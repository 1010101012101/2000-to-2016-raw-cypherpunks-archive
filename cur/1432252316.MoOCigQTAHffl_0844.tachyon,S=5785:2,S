Huh? There are IBM laptops with dedicated crypto chips? Although I don't 
claim to be any kind of an expert, I think this has to be wrong. Anyone know 
any different?

What may exist is some kind of FPGA crypo code, but even that I doubt.

(There's also the logical problem that the article writer seems to have 
missed: When one company buys another company they don't just buy that 
company's inventory and stuff, they buy the intellectual property. Who gives 
a crap if they own the chips if they also own the algorithm.)
