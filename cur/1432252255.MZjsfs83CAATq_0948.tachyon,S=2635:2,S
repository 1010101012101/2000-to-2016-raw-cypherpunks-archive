Found this on Cryptome.

I kinda prefer more passive storage devices that do exactly what they're
told to do. Anyone know of sources for technical details? 

The dvd/flash CPRM spec is available here ( hardcopy only ). Anyone got
an on-line version?

I suppose it'll be easier to get when it hits the ATA spec.
