Author James Bovard will appear on C-SPAN 's Booknotes with Brian Lamb this 
Sunday, 11/02, from 8 pm to 9 pm (I believe it may re-air from 11 pm to 
midnight).  Bovard will be discussing his new book "Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling 
Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil".  I've read the book and 
recommend it highly.

bfrom the publisher's website
"The war on terrorism is the first political growth industry of the new 
Millennium." So begins Jim Bovard's newest and, in some ways, most provocative book 
as he casts yet another jaundiced eye on Washington and the motives behind 
protecting "the homeland" and prosecuting a wildly unpopular war with Iraq. For 
James Bovard, as always, it all comes down to a trampling of personal liberty 
and an end to privacy as we know it. From airport security follies that 
protect no one to increased surveillance of individuals and skyrocketing numbers of 
detainees, the war on terrorism is taking a toll on individual liberty and no 
one tells the whole grisly story better than Bovard. 

Regards,  Freematt-
