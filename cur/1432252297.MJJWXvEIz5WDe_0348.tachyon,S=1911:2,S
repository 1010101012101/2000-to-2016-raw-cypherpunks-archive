BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A previously unknown militant group in Iraq is
threatening to kill the most-wanted terror suspect in that country: Abu
Musab al-Zarqawi.

The Arabic-language TV network Al-Arabiya said it received a taped
statement from an organization that calls itself the Rescue Group
warning al-Zarqawi and his followers to leave Iraq or face the
consequences.

One masked militant read a statement denouncing the actions by
al-Zarqawi and his followers as hurtful to Iraq, particularly the
kidnapping of foreigners.
