This reminds of the dangers of active links in email and articles.
They make it far too easy to automatically archive the whole shebang
by data hegemonists, sifters, compilers, profilers, miners, log file
addicts, and kiss-your-sweet-hole-goodbye data rapists.

Instead, avoid using active links or programs which generate active
links. Point to the sources, if you must rat, with dead alphanumerics.

Don't trust those who use active links for they do not give a shit for
the damage they are causing to readers with helpful aids that are
diabolically misleading about the tertiary uses of links.

Do not forward materials of any kind with a link to the source.
Name yourself if you can't control your phlapping idiocy, but don't
fuck others or get the ostracism you deserve for abetting those
encouraging you to be a fount of tainted, bugged, authed and
recommended info.

Say it yourself, quote the piece, or STFU. Links assassinate.

Block search engines, bots, siphons, and most especially those
who link to your material. They are purposely or ignorantly helping
bunghole wizards. Put a cork in it as well as your piehole.

Everybody here knows this due to Al Qaeda training out in California
Dreamsuckitup.
