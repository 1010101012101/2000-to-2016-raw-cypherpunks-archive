FoxNewsChannel has announced George Dubya Bush will
make a pre-emptive court strike by challenging
manual recounts. This, following warning Gore not
to challenge results in court.

These recounts are provided by state law, and are
not being done for any court.

Bush's objection is that people are subject to
corruption, unlike tabulating devices.

Dubya's new motto: "I trust in machines, not people."
