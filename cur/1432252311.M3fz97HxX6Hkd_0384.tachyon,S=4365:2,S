Which is what I said, with the novella "The Ungoverned" in between.

As for the Sunnyvale Library having it, isn't this a violation of the 
Children's Protection Act of 2000? I thought part of the FBI's 
Library Awareness Program was going around to public libraries to 
make sure those under 18 (under 21 in twelve states, under 24 in five 
states) are not being exposed to seditious and un-American influences.
