The RSA Conference will be in San Jose the week of Feb 18-22.
	http://www.rsaconference.net/indexforrsa.html
As usual, that means a lot of cypherpunks will be in town,
and we move the meeting to whichever weekend works best.
This year, that's Saturday the 16th, and it's Presidents' Day Weekend.
It's also Codecon 2002  http://codecon.org/ , a conference on
peer-to-peer, crypto, and similar applications,
designed for presentations about actual working code.
The conference will be at the DNA Lounge, 375 11th St, San Francisco.

The not-totally-firm plans are to have the cypherpunks meeting
at Codecon on Saturday afternoon (the conference is Friday-Sunday).
Bram (the conference organizer) will probably be able to comp us attendance
(the full conference is $50), but he needs to do a schedule.
Some of the crypto projects being talked about include Cryptomail
and Zooko talking about Mojo Nation derivatives.

Who's going to be in town that weekend?
Would you like to speak at the Cypherpunks meeting,
either as an organized talk or as a works-in-progress session?

		Thanks;  Bill Stewart
