STUDENT BUSTED FOR TAKING COP PICTURES

Friday, July 28, 2006 - FreeMarketNews.com

A Penn State college senior was arrested after he pointed his camera
cell
phone at police activity in his neighborhood. A Philadelphia NBC News
Channel 10 report says the family of Neftaly Cruz, 21, is claiming
the cops
had "no right to come onto their property and arrest their 21-year-
old son
simply because he was using his cell phone's camera."

<snip>

The charge against Cruz was based on a new law, allegedly prohibiting
people
from taking pictures of police officers with cell phones. Cruz is
quoted as
saying, "They threatened to charge me with conspiracy, impeding an
investigation, obstruction of a investigation..." Larry Frankel of
the local
ACLU chapter, reportedly said, "There is no law that prevents people
from
taking pictures of what anybody can see on the street," adding that,
"it's
rather scary that in this country you could actually be taken down to
police
headquarters for taking a picture on your cell phone of activities
that are
clearly visible on the street." - ST
