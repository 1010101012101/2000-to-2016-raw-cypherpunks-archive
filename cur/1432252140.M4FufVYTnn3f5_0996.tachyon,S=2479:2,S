Tim, you're assuming that statists have the wherewithal to think. This 
assumption has yet to be demonstrated.

I'm not as confident of crypto's chances of destroying the state and 
leaving the parasites out in the cold. It's just as likely that the 
government(s) will declare all crypto illegal, except that necessary 
for the protection of their own secrets. Digital money is right out, of 
course. All in the name of anti-terrorism, or the War on Some Drugs, or 
for the chiiiiildren. Powerful computers, strong crypto, and big 
databases can lead either to anarchy or to an unstoppable Big Brother. 
Too close to call, right now.
