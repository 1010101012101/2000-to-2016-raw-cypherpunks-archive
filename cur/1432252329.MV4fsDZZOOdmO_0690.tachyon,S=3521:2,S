(I thought this was too speculative, but given Tim's guess..)

I have also thought that NONSTOP refers to fault-tolerant under high-RF
conditions.   Also useful when flying (etc.) near your own antennas,
dishes, etc.

A sort of military version of the FCC standard for consumer electronics: 
doesn't emit bad (informative) radiation, accepts bad radiation without
interference.

Note that shielding that worked for tempest would also help nonstop;
and that some of the gear at a testing site (antennas) serves
both purposes.

(After reading  Harmon Seaver's piece) Since this is the NSA, maybe they
were testing that high-RF environments didn't cause info leakage -someone
else tests that the stuff simply works under field conditions.  Maybe the
thing they wanted not stopped was tempest protection.
