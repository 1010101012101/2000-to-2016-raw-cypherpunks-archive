There is absolutely nothing new about it. Cypherprankish solution would be
strong anonymity instead of complaining on the basis of popular US mythology
(constitution et al.) and Californian ideology which seems to prevail here.

If you want to make a personal (ie. body-endangering) statement then there are
many fora that can accomodate that.

If you want to discuss an applied mathematical solution that affects meatspace
behaviour (ie. cypher-weapons development) then do it anonymously.

There is really no middle ground.

Fishing for the meatspace fame subjects you to the meatspace rules - and I find
this to be the most serious limiting factor - there is no usable crypto stuff
done by mr. Melon.

Or to make it really simple: who gives the fuck if 50% of active cpunk
subscribers are sponsored by the USG ? They will just prune the stupids.

(I *know* that this is not an anon post - by anonymous I mean mixmaster chain
originating in camera-less internet cafe far from your usual waterholes.)
