... not especially crypto related, but ...

There is a serious problem with a law that broadly encroaches on freedom of
speech, patched-up with vague and complex exceptions that only a lawyer can
decipher.  Worse still, interpretation here seems to require as-yet-undetermined
case law.

A patchwork of exceptions, tailored to satisfy special interest groups, is a
very sloppy and incomplete way to deal with a fundamental problem.

I suppose my years of exposure to bad software have sensitized me to bad law,
so sorry for the rant.

More importantly RC4 could be used in some other copy protection system that we don't know about -- it's use might even be a trade secret.  There is simply no way to guarantee that a given cryptoanalytic result doesn't compromise some TPM. Even software that breaks Ceaser ciphers could be actionable. DCMA is *that* bad.
