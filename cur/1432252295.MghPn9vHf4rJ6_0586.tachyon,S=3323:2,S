I just wonder how many security professionals will be willing to work with 
them now that they are planning on making "hacking" a crime with a life 
sentence and no statute of limitations?  (Especially since they have a habit 
of finding some reason to jail them when they are not longer useful.)

"Terrorist" seems to have been redefined to mean "anyone who can 
inconvenience the Government, no matter how slight".
