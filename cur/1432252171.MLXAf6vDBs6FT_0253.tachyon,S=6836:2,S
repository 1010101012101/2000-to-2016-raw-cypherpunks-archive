I sent this to the resident Pirate Party UK economist:

Hi Harry,

> You are right. You and your probable mortgage-owning neighbours have no
foreseeable need to ever use Bitcoins. Given that there are no charge-backs
and therefore absolutely no financial protection (caveat emptor), it is
unlikely it will be adopted by the mainstream for the majority of
transactions any time soon. For obvious reasons even I *currently *trust my
debit card more than my Bitcoin wallet. Of course the same could have been
said about making secure purchases online in the 90's.

> The backing for Bitcoin is through the not insignificant capital and
electricity costs expended to "mine" Bitcoins. The secure Bitcoin
transaction system is designed around a form of decentralised digital
signing of Bitcoin transactions through this Bitcoin mining operation. The
payment for mining is currently 50BTC per block of transactions
successfully signed. This Bitcoin inflation will half in about a month to
25BTC per block, and continue to reduce in the rate of inflation until 21M
Bitcoins are mined in 2020, or so. After all Bitcoins have been mined the
financial reward for mining will be very small per transaction fees, but
potentially still significant per block.

Due to this distributed digital backing there is no way to link issued
Bitcoins to a commodity such as gold, which would require some form of
centralised repository like GoldMoney.com. Another way to think of it is
that everyone who mines Bitcoins is part of the "decentral bank of
Bitcoin". I understand that most Austrian economists don't like Bitcoin, as
Austrian definitions of money require it to originate as a commodity. In my
not so humble opinion this is a philosophical economic question, as there
are things you can conveniently buy with Bitcoins that you can not buy with
gold, cash, or credit cards. However, for now the primary driver of Bitcoin
adoption is the black market and speculation.

Many Bitcoin enthusiasts currently range in attitudes from garden variety
nerds (like myself) to crypto-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists. This
group likely includes Assange, the various members of Anonymous, and quite
possibly the guy who fixed the problem that caused NatWest customers unable
to access their bank accounts for a week. Plenty of them are Pirates too as
both Bittorrent and Bitcoin have much in common both philosophically and
technically. The majority of enthusiasts are however very naive about
economics and the realities of politics.

I guess history will decide whether it will be evolution or revolution of
the current system. I read enough contrarian commentary on the state of the
world economy to wonder when the current experiment with fiat currencies
will end, and I don't expect the end to be evolutionary. The UK was quite
graceful in its relinquishment of empire. The USA is unlikely to follow:
