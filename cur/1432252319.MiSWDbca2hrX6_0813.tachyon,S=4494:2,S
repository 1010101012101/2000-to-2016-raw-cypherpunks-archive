Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2O0O with a view to become

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large gr0up of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,O0O different known 
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeabi|ity of the walls of the b|ood vessels including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
shou|d be expected in the near future.
