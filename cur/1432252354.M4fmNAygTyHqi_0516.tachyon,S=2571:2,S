 By refusing to tell you reveal you're weird, or think you are.

94304 Abstract In spite of the widespread concerns expressed about the
importance of privacy, individuals frequently give away or sell a myriad
of personal data. How and why people decide to transition their
information from the private to the public sphere is poorly understood.
To address this puzzle, we conducted a reverse second-price auction to
identify the monetary value of private information to individuals and how
that value is set. Our results demonstrate that deviance, whether
perceived or actual, from the group.s average asymmetrically impacts the
price demanded to reveal private information. Full paper: deviance.pdf
