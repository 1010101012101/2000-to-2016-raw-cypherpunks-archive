	I guess you're right in a way, but, is there a european equivalent to the 
utah datacenter for instance? Does japan have its own (smaller but still 
substantial) version of it? China? Even russia?


	I understand that european governments expect the ISPs to spy on their 
customers ('data retention laws') which seems to suggest that 
they[governments] are not doing it themselves?


	wikipedia, lousy source, but still

	"On 2 March 2010, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled the 
law unconstitutional as a violation of the guarantee of the secrecy of 
correspondence.[18] As such, the directive is not currently implemented in 
Germany."
