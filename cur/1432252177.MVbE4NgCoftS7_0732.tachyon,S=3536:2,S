When Jews are murdering small children in reprisals against stone throwing 
by young men, and Arabs are blowing up school buses, then anti semitic 
statements against both Arabs and Jews become legitimate, indeed required.

Are you an anti semite, or are you indifferent to the murder of

Yes, Virginia, not only are there individual evil people, but there are 
entire evil nations that demand and expect that their members do evil 
things, a demand widely supported and forcefully encouraged by the people 
of that nation.
