Well sure - because not all the Black Helicopters flying over Tim's house
have belonged to Feds/UN/etc. - one of them's probably been Ken's :-)
I've also found Tim's comments on Pynchon living nearby interesting.

I'd say issues of putting aerial photography on the internet and
how that changes the status of previously "secret" information
are pretty close to our core issues - they're not directly cryptography,
but neither are the "guns, lots of guns" discussions.

I don't know if Hugh ever pulled off the "export RSA by standing in
a bar-code when the Russian 1-meter-resolution spy satellites fly over"...
