Why give them a term which, at least to some, sounds noble?

Communitarian, indeed!

I favor the more descriptive term: simp-wimps.


As for Nader and the Green Party, fuck 'em. There's nothing even

for a 100% income tax on all income above some level.

I expect most of them need to be liquidated in the purge.
