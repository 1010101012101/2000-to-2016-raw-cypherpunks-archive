yeah, for this you'd need the on board cardbus for wireless card, then
use the two PCI slots for the RAID card and quad-NIC.  as a plus, the
boards with the cardbus slot usually have a compact flash port
underneath if you want a diskless system.

the C3 was a larger fab process and had no padlock engine (neither
entropy or AES).  it's difficult to differentiate between a mainboard
using a C3 and a mainboard using the C5.  this drives me nuts! you
have to look for the keyword "Nehemiah" or verify part/model #'s.  and
then Nehemiah may refer to either the C5XL or C5P core (C5XL == single
entropy source, C5P == two entropy sources and AES)
