Ok, so two academics in '07 get 90% of the way to a fully-working
attack, but are stymied by a silly timing limitation in the
software-defined radio they had on hand. They could trivially fix it by
dropping another $1k on a second USRP for leapfrogging to the next
channel, given that they _have exposed the hopping pattern_.

And you conclude... "not compromised". Huh.

I conclude "compromised for all practical purposes": I could take their
paper and $2000 and build a fully-working attack if I had the
motivation. As could any motivated interception capability vendor. Odds
that this capability already exists: rapidly approaching unity.

Also note that recording the traffic on all 79 3Mbit/s channels is
trivially within the capabilities of any organization that designs its
own hardware. This IC has programmable hop parameters and is < $5:

Slapping 79 of those on a board with a high-gain antenna and a USB
interface left as an exercise for the reader.
