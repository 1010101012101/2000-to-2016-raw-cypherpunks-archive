To whom something is marketed makes no difference when it comes
to censorship.  It is no one's right to stop Teletubbies from
hawking Marlboros.  Freedom of speech is not compromisable.

Are you channelling Tipper Gore now? 

What happens if you don't rate your content?  Seizure of assets at
gunpoint?

BTW, Is your website marked with those voluntary internet
certificates-of-kidsafety whose acronym escapes me?

No, real life is littered with petty egomaniacs who know best, and have
guns to help you agree.

Ethical bankruptcy of parents who rely on government to censor
instead of doing a little research on their own.  Ethical bankruptcy
of bureaucrats who abuse the violence behind the law.

It's just another example of why

Pragmatism is the road to hell.
