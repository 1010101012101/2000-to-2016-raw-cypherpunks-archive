the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca||s from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Persona| Gateway from any cellu|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International

units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH
