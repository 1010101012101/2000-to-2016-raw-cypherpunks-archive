Defeat:  create a log buffer file of fixed size, logged activity changes
its contents, but not the size of the file.  E.g.:  a filesystem image
file under GNU/Linux.  Techniques could be used to maintain a constant
global MD5 checksum to defeat other detection attempts.

Manipulating file create/modify times is trivial under most OSs.

These measures can be taken for specific, high-security, messages.  Risk
profiles are not isomorphic in all circumstances.

Many of which are woefully poorly designed.  Zimmerman at ALS spoke of
one in which the key was stored in cleartext within the dongle, don't
recall the specific device.

The iPod's definitely an attractive target for portable computing, it's
also fairly robust (I bounced the demo off the hardwood floor of Apple's
Palo Alto store from about 4-5 ft.).  It appears you're just using it
for storage purposes.  Note that this still requires trusting the
environment to which the iPod is attached.

Various handhelds, particularly running an advanced OS (e.g.:
GNU/Linux), would be similarly attractive devices, readily kept on ones
person at most times, and support encrypted filesystems or files.

Peace.
