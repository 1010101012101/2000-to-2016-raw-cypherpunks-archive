"Nomen" makes a reasonable point. There is nothing objectionable about
Lance selling anonymizer.com accounts to the Feds (or with a
crypto-company selling crypto-ware to the Feds, not least since
they'll get the software or service one way or another). If you treat
'em the same way you treat any other paying company, and I suspect
that is the case with Lance, John's allegation of "sucking up" to
espionage and law enforcement agencies is uncalled for.
