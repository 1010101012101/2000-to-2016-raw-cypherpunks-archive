Oh, for sure Moxie has a threat model that makes sense to him, but I 
dispute that it makes any sense in the real world. Google's certificate 
system is TOFU, so whatever certificate Google pushes to a users' device 
is what that device trusts updates from thenceforth. And, there's no 
obvious way for an Android user to verify a certificate *even if they 
were so inclined*. For my part, as an Android user with a knowledge of 
and interest in crypto, I have *never* checked a signed APK. Ever.

So, if even the more technical end of Moxie's customer base don't check 
APK signatures, and if most people simply take what Google Play offers 
them, what's to stop Google pushing a malicious TextSecure? Nothing. 
Nothing, at all, ever. And all the machinations and air-gaps Moxie and 
co implement are meaningless, because the TOFU scheme makes Google the 
root of all trust on the Google Play market.

If it were merely about certificates, Moxie would offer up-to-date APKs 
through his own website and F-Droid repository, allowing him to have 
utter control over timely updates without an intermediate trusted agent. 
But he doesn't, and when I asked I finally got an answer: It's because 
F-Droid doesn't offer metrics, debugging, and analytics. Essentially, he 
wants Google play so he can get silent feedback on what the Apps are 
doing in the wild.

I don't object to this as long as it's opt-in for users, but I do object 
that it's being presented as something (threat model) rather than 
developer convenience. I love TextSecure, and I'm grateful to Moxie and 
co for creating it. It lets me layer security on a legacy platform that 
everyone uses in a way that's transparent and extremely user-friendly, 
while offering security granularity for those so inclined (cert checks). 
But the delivery is through an intermediary that are essentially a 
public-facing wing of the NSA, and they have total control over the 
trust/threat model for 95% of the user-base. So..I don't even.
