this has been the most interesting observation on reporting over the
last year across the channeled Snowden dataspill.

with the bulk of significant revelations identified and conveyed, the
trend now clearly toward fill rather than reach.

all of the clamor for immediate and full disclosure perhaps under
stated the scope of unique and noteworthy aspects contained within
material that is also significantly banal, un-informative filler.

in any case, i look forward to the details better defining the day to
day operations of a super power intelligence apparatus so that we may
better defend against this class as a whole, in the future.


best regards,
