Why the republicans of course. :)

--- BEGING Sarcastic Lunatic RANT and RAVE V3.2 ----

Me, I'm "afraid" of the oil companies, they're constantly raising the
price of gas, so I'm going to call them "price gouging terrorists."  I'd
happily switch to another brand, but it seems all them are raising their
prices equally.

Oh, and the milk terrorists are at it again, adding another $1 to the
price of a gallon of milk.

And those annoying terrorists that call us during dinner at at it again,
the telemarketers... well, actually, I've gotten less and less of these
calls recently, but why spoil a good rant (wink, wink) :)

Oh, yeah, and those CON-Ed guys are terrorists too, why they threated to
raise their prices, or they'll let us experience more black outs (well
they didn't, but Bush said so - so he's a terrorist too!)

Oh, yeah, and Mayor Bloomberg's a terrorist from the point of view of
smokers, and cell phone users who happen to drive.  And so is the
governor... fuck why isn't Arnold running for Governor of NYC???  Wait, he
was, The Terminator - so that means he's a SkyNet Cell Member, and
therefore, a terrorist too!

And, let's not forget the MTA who recently raised their prices by 30%
terrorized all New Yorkers, too...

And wait, wait!  The fucknuts that did the world trade center were
terrorists, and they wore underwear and socks!  So anyone who wears
underwear or socks is a terrorist!!!  Arrest'em all!

Fuck it, everyone's a terrorist.  Send'em all to GITMO....  :^)
