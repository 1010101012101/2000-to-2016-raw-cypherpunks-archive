Unless, of course, your data falls into the hands of Choicepoint,
Lexis Nexis, etc. Mostly in order to avoid a legislative crackdown
that puts them out of business, they probably put some effort into
vetting who gets to see the magic bits (unlike our Russian
streetcorner pals). But we saw how well that worked with
Choicepoint. And they are all fairly large companies; all it takes is
one well-placed database admin with bad financial troubles...
