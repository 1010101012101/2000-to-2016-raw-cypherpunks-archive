True, but there's a question of the waste of resources and man-years that
would come from such a circumstance.  And then there's the ethical[1] side
of the coin: do the (largely financial benefits) that might come from a
civil war in Iraq really justify the consequent standard-of-living for the
residents of Iraq?  People like Tim May might say that the towel-headed
barbarians deserve to be killed in a bloody civil conflict, but other
people might argue that there are stable states that do not actually
require heavy foreign civilian losses.

As to who is correct, I cannot say.  As a relatively new student of
history I am still researching the topic.

Aren't we all about to run out of oil soon anyways?

Of course.  It's much easier to smash things than it is to create; and
smashing requires much less wisdom.  On average; depending on how one goes
about `smashing' a nation-state.  I imagine that nation-building, or
nation-`shaping', would be quite hard -- and what if such efforts were to
go awry?  The consequences might be terrible.

If you've been practising pitting groups of barbarians against each other,
as is apparently the case for those involved with the military
intelligence community, then yes, I suppose it might be considered
`astonishingly easy'.  I would also be inclined to suggest that those
sorts of arrangements are quite expensive, regardless of their degree of
ease.

I suppose that Americans are getting shot and dying because they are being
paid to engage in high-risk operations.  The risk-taking probably makes
them feel more like manly-men -- until they bleed out all over the desert
sand, of course.  Is there a psychologist in the house who might shed more
light on this kind of risk-taking behavior?

Well, my opinion is such that the major lesson that [a few] people end up
learning from history is how to make conflict seem more legitimate to
increasingly better educated populations.  But there is evidently a long
way to go before the enterprise of warfare is perfected.   As to other
lessons learned from history, it is evident that we as a species have
learnt that war remains profitable under all conditions.  This is now a
matter of the most sacred orthodoxy to high-culture.  Do not worry.  I
will not presume to challenge such a strongly-held belief.

How about, "Where is Ted Kaczynski now that we really need him?"

Um, what planet are you on?

The people who, as you say, organize large scale terror tend to be
protected by virtue of large bureaucratic firewalls, legislated secrecy,
misdirection (smoke and mirrors), and even taboos.  But perhaps you are
not referring to Western terrorists, but are expecting your reader to
assume that terrorists always wear turbans, and who generally will live
and operate in the Middle-Eastern theatre.  Perhaps you have forgotten
about the people who planned and executed the operations that helped
South-American tyrants form up and train their death- and terror-squads?

Who was it, by the way, who coined the name "Death and Horror, Inc."  My
memory is a little hazy, but I don't believe it was Bin Laden.

obsolescence and random mutation.
