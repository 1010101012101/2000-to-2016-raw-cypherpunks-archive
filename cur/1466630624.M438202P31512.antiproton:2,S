Boyce,

I asked to Roger about the tor-talk moderation rules weeks ago and did not
receive any answer.  I can send the message in private to you, if you don't
believe.

**  I was already raped twice and I do have deep physical and emotional
scars.  Do you really think I loved my experiences and I deserve to be
called "ludicrous rape apologetics"?  **

I was talking about truth and lies, about judgements without proofs.  I was
a real victim in the past, I didn't tell lies.  I know in my own burned
skin what is being a victim of rape.  Please, you can offend my
intelligence, but it is really injust and pretty sick to call me "rape
apologetics".

I bet you will leave ja.group post lies in tor-talk list, Boyce.  How about
being *fair*, please?  I can create a fake account just for reading
tor-talk list, but I prefer to use my own name and be transparent, expose
myself when talking about lies.  So, the ja.group or any person can contact
me if they really want to talk about the truth.

Thanks for the answer, but you were unfair and really disgusting.

Cecilia
