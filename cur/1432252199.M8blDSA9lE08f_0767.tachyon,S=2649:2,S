Hi  ,

Take a quick look at Visa Card Rebates. They're giving away free Visa cards with free 
flight miles on any airline and 
paying MLM commissions to refer other Cardholders. They pay out on a huge 10-level plan 
($10 for the first level and $2 
on the next nine). You already know how many millions of dollars that kind of multiplication 
can generate. Nobody buys 
a thing. The money comes from the bank because of the value of cardholders. This thing 
is spreading like wildfire. 
Please check it out at http://www.VisaRebates.com/Index.cfm?ReferralID=homebizz88.
