tim Quoted...
  "How we burned in the prison camps later thinking: What would things have 
been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an 
arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive?" --Alexander 
Solzhenitzyn, Gulag Archipelago
End.
AS: excellent writer also christian,social conservative.

Bakunin was deported to Siberia. He spent many years amid the horrors of 
penal servitude, but his spirit was unvanquished. He finally succeeded in 
escaping and walking eastward over a thousand miles, under extreme 
hardship, and at last reached the sea and obtained passage to Japan. From 
there he sailed to California, thence to New York, and in 1860 appeared in 
London. He had suffered innumerable hardships and adventures, had mixed 
with all sorts and conditions of men, from the rulers of Europe to the wild 
hairy Ainus, and had everywhere found that government was tyranny.
If you'd like some quotes from an anarchist tim,Ill see what I can do. 
matts wild hairy anus.
