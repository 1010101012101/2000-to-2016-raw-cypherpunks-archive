But could they defend themselves from the inside? Quite a vulnerability. 
I'm sure any government agency out to compromise the system would be delighted
to find all the constituent elements neatly-identified and run by "respectable"
and "well-known" organizations. God, what more could they ask for. 

If the government put me in charge of subverting the remailer network, I think
the first thing I'd do is round myself up a nice batch of friendly,
respectable "professionals" with shiny impressive "professional" credentials
(tailored exactly to match what "well-known organizations" are looking for) and
infiltrate the hell out of every single organization running a node.

Once I had my team of "trusted insiders" in place, I'd gather a small team
of coders who do nothing but find new ways to subtly exploit information the
insiders are funneling out to them. If your tradecraft is good enough and your
cracks richerchi enough, there's no reason you couldn't keep this rotten setup
going forever: the whole fucking network, compromised right down to the ground.

Meanwhile, everyone on the outside is lulled into a false sense of complacency,
because, after all, these 5-10 remailers are "well-administered and
professionally maintained"-- surely we can trust these reasonably well-known
organizations who have sufficient legal firepower to defend themselves, can't
we?

If your whole system relies on 10 publicly exposed targets, it's only natural
to assume attackers will focus all their energy on picking them off one at a
time. Not exactly what I'd call a good place to be. The trusted-insider
compromise I outlined above would do the trick, though I'm sure it's only one
of a million things to worry about. 

If, on the other hand, you had a remailer system which borrowed elements from
peer-to-peer technology, there'd be no stopping it. I'm certainly not
pretending to be qualified to go into what that might entail, but if it's a
question of feeling safer for your Hydra having ten heads or a million heads,
the direction to go from here seems fairly logical and clearcut. And putting the
issue of determining who to trust back in the hands of the individual end user
rather than forcing them to make choices among 10 seems like a good idea to
me. Just a thought.
