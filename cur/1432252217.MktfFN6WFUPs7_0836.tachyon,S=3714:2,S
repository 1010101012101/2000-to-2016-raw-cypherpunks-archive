A tactic used by the anti-pedo vigilantes and narcs is to
covertly bury pedo porno amongst adult porno and then
finger the adult downloaders as pedophiles knowing the
evidence will be found without the downloaders knowing
it is there until discovered during a raid.

A federal case here in Manhattan got a conviction this way.
Or so I am told by the convict, who got a ten year sentence.

Cleanse your files, kiddie sluts.

And who saw the arousing report in Saturday's New York
Times about the practice of bestiality, yes, sex with
animals, that is now coming out of the closet. The last
taboo is getting its day. One gent goes on talk shows 
with his dog to tell what it's like.

Debate rages on whether it's rape if the animal does
not explicitly give consent. Some animal protection
advocates say that the lovemaking is okay with them, 
better to go all the way with animals rather than raise 
for killing and eating.

(No comparison of Swift's advocacy of raising Irish
children for food.)

Really, in the New York Times, descriptions of French
kissing your dog, and why not, since that is far more
sanitary than doing it with a human.

Someone suggested the article is just part of Hollywood's
promo of "Animal."
