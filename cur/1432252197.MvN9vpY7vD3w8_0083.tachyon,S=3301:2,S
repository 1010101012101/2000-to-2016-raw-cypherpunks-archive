 >>How can I receive a reward and still remain anonymous? The caller is 
advised to call back after a scheduled board meeting at
which the reward amount will be considered. Suitable arrangements will
then be made for payment of the reward. At all times the identity of
the caller is safeguarded. The normal practice is for the caller to
identify themself with their code number. Crime Stoppers can then make
a cash deposit of the reward amount into a nominated bank account or
alternatively, arrange cash payment at a nominated location.<<

"Encryption can pose potentially insurmountable challenges to law 
enforcement when used in conjunction with communication or plans for 
executing serious terrorist and criminal acts."
