FBI wants access to worm's pilfered data

A ROTTEN.COM EXCLUSIVE

The FBI is asking for access to a massive database that contains
the private communications and passwords of the victims of the
Badtrans Internet worm. Badtrans spreads through security flaws
in Microsoft mail software and transmits everything the victim
types. Since November 24, Badtrans has violated the privacy of
millions of Internet users, and now the FBI wants to take part in
the spying.

                         Victims of Badtrans are infected when they
receive an email
                         containing the worm in an attachment and either
run the program
                         by clicking on it, or use an email reader like
Microsoft Outlook
                         which may automatically run it without user
intervention. Once
                         executed, the worm replicates by sending copies
of itself to all
                         other email addresses found on the host's
machine, and installs a
                         keystroke-logger capable of stealing passwords
including those
                         used for telnet, email, ftp, and the web. Also
captured is
                         anything else the user may be typing, including
personal
                         documents or private emails.

                         Coincidentally, just four days before the
breakout of Badtrans it
                         was revealed that the FBI was developing their
own
                         keystroke-logging virus, called Magic Lantern.
Made to
                         complement the Carnivore spy system, Magic
Lantern would
                         allow them to obtain target's passwords as they
type them. This
                         is a significant improvement over Carnivore,
which can only see
                         data after it has been transmitted over the
Internet, at which
                         point the passwords may have been encrypted.

                         After Badtrans pilfers keystrokes the data is
sent back to one of
                         twenty-two email addresses (this is according
to the FBI--
                         leading anti-virus vendors have only reported
seventeen email
                         addresses). Among these are free email
addresses at Excite,
                         Yahoo, and IJustGotFired.com. IJustGotFired is
a free service of
                         MonkeyBrains, a San Francisco based independent
Internet
                         Service Provider.

                         In particular, suck_my_prick@ijustgotfired.com
began receiving
                         emails at 3:23 PM on November 24. Triggering
software
                         automatically disabled the account after it
exceeded quotas, and
                         began saving messages as they arrived. The
following day,
                         MonkeyBrains' mail server was sluggish. Upon
examination of
                         the mail server's logs, it quickly became
apparent that 100 emails
                         per minute to the "suck_my_prick" alias were
the source of the
                         problem. The mails delivered the logged
keystrokes from over
                         100,000 compromised computers in the first day
alone.

                         Last week the FBI contacted the owner of
MonkeyBrains, Rudy
                         Rucker, Jr., and requested a cloned copy of the
password
                         database and keylogged data. The database
includes only
                         information stolen from the victims of the
virus, not information
                         about the perpetrator. The FBI wants
indiscriminant access to
                         the illegally extracted passwords and
keystrokes of over two
                         million people without so much as a warrant.
Even with a
                         warrant they would have to specify exactly what
information
                         they are after, on whom, and what they expect
to find. Instead,
                         they want it all and for no justifiable reason.

                         One of the most basic tenets of an
authoritarian state is one that
                         claims rights for itself that it denies its
citizens. Surveillance is
                         perhaps one of the most glaring examples of
this in our society.
                         Accordingly, rather than hand over the entire
database to the
                         FBI, MonkeyBrains has decided to open the
database to the
                         public. Now everyone (including the FBI) will
be able query
                         which accounts have been compromised and search
for their
                         hostnames. Password and keylogged data will not
be made
                         available, for obvious legal reasons.

                         The implications of complying with the FBI's
request, absent any
                         legal authority, are staggering. This is
information that no one,
                         not even the FBI, could legally gather
themselves. The fact that
                         they seek to take advantage of this worm and
benefit from its
                         illicit spoils, demonstrates the FBI's complete
and utter contempt
                         for constitutionally mandated due process and
protection from
                         unreasonable search and seizure. It defies
reason that the FBI
                         expects the American people to trust them to
only look at certain
                         permissible nuggets of data and ignore the rest
of what they
                         collect. One need only imagine what J. Edgar
Hoover would do
                         with today's expansive surveillance system,
coupled with the
                         new powers granted by the Patriot Act, to
appreciate the
                         Orwellian nightmare that the United States is
becoming. The last
                         thing the FBI should have is a spying Internet
worm, and it looks
                         like they've found one. Welcome to the Magic
Lantern.
