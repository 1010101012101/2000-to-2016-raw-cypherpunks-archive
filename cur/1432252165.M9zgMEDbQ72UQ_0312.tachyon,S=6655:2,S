No doubt if this movement gets big enough to basically become a religion 
(like everything in the US) then this will start to happen.

But fixing the conditions at 3rd world sweatshops will have very little 
impact to the cost of those goods. What's being discussed are things like 
ensuring that toxic gasses are not being spewed into the workplace (China), 
or moving workers towards a living wage (Haiti), or workers actually getting 
paid for the agreed upon wages (New York City). Right now the issue of 3rd 
world sweatshops has very little to do with economics per se.

The unfortunate thing, however, may be that international Marxist groups 
will make addressing these issues a priority (at least in terms of their 
rhetoric). And even though the Marxists will in the long run probably make 
conditions even worse, the failure to address these issues now may empower 
Marxists throughout certain parts of the world. Hell...if I found a local 
factory was regularly grinding up children in the machinery, I'd probably go 
and take up arms with them (or pay to have weapons drop-shipped to them). Of 
course, I'm thinking Sr Donald and other knee-jerkers will equate that with 
being a Marxist. But I do believe it is encumbant upon us capital-ists to 
address these issues before the system as a whole gets tossed out, at least 
for a while.
