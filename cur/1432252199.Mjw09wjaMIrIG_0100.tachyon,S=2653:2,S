Always fun when this happens.    In my home town, Brighton in England, a 
company with the unfortunate name of "GRIP" bought about 8 or 9 old 
houses to build an office. One old woman  wouldn't sell, she wanted to 
carry on living in her own house, so until she died it was stuck in the 
middle of a steel and glass office block, propped up by big wooden beams.

As you say, when the government wants to build something, it usually 
passes a law to kick out such recalcitrant old ladies. Except that 
somehow railway companies - and before them the canals, this goes back 
to the 18th century - always managed to get the government on their side.
