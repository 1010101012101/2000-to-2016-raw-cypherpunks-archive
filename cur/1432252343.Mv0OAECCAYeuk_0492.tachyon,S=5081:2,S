I've answered this question before.

I'm not a C-A-C-L. I don't see them as the 'enemy'.

If CJ had really been running around putting bombs in courthouses (in
Canada or not) or was a credible threat to anybody (whether they are
agents are not is irrelelvant, and the distinction is really
unconstitutional) then I WANT him in jail and will happily help put him
there.

I met CJ in person, under some rather strange cirumstances. He also went
out of his way to involve me (eg the bomb description posts to the list he
had on his person when he was captured) and the Austin Cypherpunks. I will
say this, the AC were not impressed by him in general and the general
consensus was he was at least a couple bricks short.

If you want information, you sometimes have to give some.

I operate a remailer for the express purpose of discussing alternatives to
the current approaches to our society. Part of that is the willingness to
involve myself with people, even if the odds of success are very low. I
asked myself how credible I'd be if I ran around deciding I'd talk to this
group but not that group. I felt, not very.

Everything I said came from voluntary and reasonably public comments made
by the appropriate parties over several years of interaction (I joined the
original list in late '92 or early '93). Nothing I said can't be backed up
by reams of posts.

Finally, I'm more worried about my butt than yours or Timmy's.

It was a personal judgement call, one that I believe I resolved equitably.
If you don't agree, tough. It wasn't your call. (the fact that you want
respect for your actions but can't seem to give it to others is only
another indication of your real world view)

Basically, I don't see it in the same immature black/white:us/them view
that you and your cronnies hold. It ain't a football game, goober.
