Bradley Manning's sentence: 35 years for exposing us to the truth

This was never a fair trial =E2=80=93 Obama declared Manning's guilt in adv=
ance. But Manning's punishment is an affront to democracy

Link to video: Bradley Manning: 35 years in jail for an outsider who had tr=
ouble fitting in =E2=80=93&nbsp;video

As of today, Wednesday 21 August 2013, Bradley Manning has served 1,182 day=
s in prison. He should be released with a sentence of time served. Instead,=
 the judge in his court martial at Fort Meade, Maryland has handed down a=
 sentence of 35 years.

Of course, a humane, reasonable sentence of time served was never going to=
 happen. This trial has, since day one, been held in a kangaroo court. That=
 is not angry rhetoric; the reason I am forced to frame it in that way is=
 because President Obama made the following statements on record, before th=
e trial even started:

President Obama: We're a nation of laws. We don't individually make our own=
 decisions about how the laws operate =E2=80=A6 He broke the law.

Logan Price: Well, you can make the law harder to break, but what he did wa=
s tell us the truth.

President Obama: Well, what he did was he dumped =E2=80=A6

Logan Price: But Nixon tried to prosecute Daniel Ellsberg for the same thin=
g and he is a =E2=80=A6 [hero]

President Obama: No, it isn't the same thing =E2=80=A6 What Ellsberg releas=
ed wasn't classified in the same way.

When the president says that the Ellsberg's material was classified in a di=
fferent way, he seems to be unaware that there was a higher classification=
 on the documents Ellsberg leaked.

A fair trial, then, has never been part of the picture. Despite being a pro=
fessor in constitutional law, the president as commander-in-chief of the US=
 military =E2=80=93 and Manning has been tried in a court martial =E2=80=93=
 declared Manning's guilt pre-emptively. Here is what the Pentagon Papers=
 leaker Daniel Ellsberg had to say about this, in an interview with Amy Goo=
dman at DemocracyNow! in 2011:

Well, nearly everything the president has said represents a confusion about=
 the state of the law and his own responsibilities. Everyone is focused, I=
 think, on the fact that his commander-in-chief has virtually given a direc=
ted verdict to his subsequent jurors, who will all be his subordinates in=
 deciding the guilt in the trial of Bradley Manning. He's told them already=
 that their commander, on whom their whole career depends, regards him [Man=
ning] as guilty and that they can disagree with that only at their peril.=
 In career terms, it's clearly enough grounds for a dismissal of the charge=
s, just as my trial was dismissed eventually for governmental misconduct.

But what people haven't really focused on, I think, is another problematic=
 aspect of what he said. He not only was identifying Bradley Manning as the=
 source of the crime, but he was assuming, without any question, that a cri=
me has been committed.

This alone should have been cause for the judge in the case to rethink pros=
ecutors' demand for 60 years in prison. Manning himself has shown throughou=
t the trial both that he is a humanitarian and that he is willing to serve=
 time for his actions. We have to look at his acts in light of his moral co=
mpass, not any political agenda.

Manning intentions were never to hurt anyone; in fact, his motivation =E2=
=80=93 as was the case for Ellsberg =E2=80=93 was to inform the American pu=
blic about what their government was doing in their name. A defense forensi=
c psychiatrist testified to Manning's motives:

Well, Pfc Manning was under the impression that his leaked information was=
 going to really change how the world views the wars in Afghanistan and Ira=
q, and future wars, actually. This was an attempt to crowdsource an analysi=
s of the war, and it was his opinion that if =E2=80=A6 through crowdsourcin=
g, enough analysis was done on these documents, which he felt to be very im=
portant, that it would lead to a greater good =E2=80=A6 that society as a=
 whole would come to the conclusion that the war wasn't worth it =E2=80=A6=
 that really no wars are worth it.

I admit that I share the same hopes that drove Manning to share with the re=
st of the world the crimes of war he witnessed. I am deeply disappointed th=
at no one has been held accountable for the criminality exposed in the docu=
ments for which Manning is standing trial =E2=80=93 except him. It shows so=
 clearly that our justice systems are not working as intended to protect th=
e general public and to hold accountable those responsible for unspeakable=
 crimes.

I want to thank Bradley Manning for the service he has done for humanity wi=
th his courage and compassionate action to inform us, so that we have the=
 means to transform and change our societies for the better. I want to than=
k him for shining light into the shadows. It is up to each and everyone of=
 us to use the information he provided for the greater good. I want to than=
k him for making our world a little better. This is why I nominated him for=
 the Nobel Peace Prize, for there are very few individuals who have ever br=
ought about the kind of social change Manning has put in motion.

The wave of demands for greater transparency, more accountability, and demo=
cratic reform originate with Manning's lonely act in the barracks in Iraq.=
 He has given others =E2=80=93 such as Edward Snowden =E2=80=93 the courage=
 to do the right thing for the rest of us. The heavy hand dealt Bradley Man=
ning today is a massive blow against everything many of us hold sacred =E2=
=80=93 at a time when we have been shown how fragile and weak our democraci=
es are by the revelations of, first, Manning, and now, Snowden.

There is no such thing as privacy anymore; nor is there such a thing as acc=
ountability among our public servants. Our governments do not function for=
 the benefit of the 99%.=20

If Manning had received a fair sentence that was in proportion to his suppo=
sed crime =E2=80=93 which was to expose us to the truth =E2=80=93 then ther=
e would have been hope.

Instead, we are seeing the state acting like a wounded tiger, cornered and=
 lashing out in rage =E2=80=93 attacking the person who speaks the truth in=
 order to frighten the rest of us into silence. But to that, I have only on=
e answer: it won't work.
