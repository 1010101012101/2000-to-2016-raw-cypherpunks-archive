It wasn't meant to be impressive: my only point was that it's not a good 
idea for young people such as Jim and myself--"whippersnappers", if you 
prefer--to underestimate those with far more knowledge and experience in 
the relevant subjects. What could you possibly find to argue with in that.

If you or anyone else here believes that no one at Ft. Meade could possibly 
teach you anything, fine. If you question my ability to recognize a first-
rate mathematical mind when I see one, that's fine too. But if you honestly 
think there aren't information scientists out there every bit as 
technically competent and clued-in as you are, chances are you're setting 
yourself up for a rude awakening someday.  Intellectual hubris...

The fact that list members have NSA work experience hardly refutes the 
point I was making that you shouldn't dismiss someone as a donut-chomping 
incompetent on the basis of his taking government work.

It's all in the context.
