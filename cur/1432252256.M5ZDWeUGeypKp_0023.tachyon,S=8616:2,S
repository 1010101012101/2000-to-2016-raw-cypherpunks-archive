Given that a V2V system can only warn of an impending collision with
another V2V-equipped vehicle, this seems ludicrous to me. Passive systems
like radar and lidar will be cheap enough to be in nearly every new car
soon enough.

However, even if V2V ends up being mandated, whether it's abusable is very
implementation-dependent, and there are already plenty of ways to track
vehicles: license plate scanners, toll transponder readers, even just plain
old image processing on existing surveillance cameras to track vehicles
probabilistically. Oh, and then there's that cellphone you're probably
carrying with you.

Some of these are easier to avoid than others, and a V2V system could
probably be disabled easily. But we're already being tracked, and I doubt
there's much incentive for a politician to go out on a limb to make it even
easier. If we really want to avoid tracking, it's the efforts to network
and database security cameras and ALPRs that we need to go after. Those are
much harder to avoid, even if you don't own a cellphone and ride a bicycle
or walk everywhere.
