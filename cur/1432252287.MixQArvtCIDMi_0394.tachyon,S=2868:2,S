For those of you who don't watch much TV, there is a PA
by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in heavy
rotation right now.

The approximate wording:

    [various children saying]
    You searched my room...

    You invaded my privacy...

    I hated you...

    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
