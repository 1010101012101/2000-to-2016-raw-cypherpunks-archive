I agree with you, I did not put forth my argument well, and I was lazy to
snip out context from several offlist conversations. And, you are correct,
it is difficult for me to make a compelling argument, due to the fact that I
am a far cry from an expert in this area. These are challenging concepts.
However, with respect, I did take on a mega-proposition for the application
of your concepts.

An appeal for a contract. I was trying to hypothesize a value proposition
for a legitimate application of these technologies. What you proposed, via a
"credit rating market," is an open source information mercantile system. I
was looking for a better market, which attaches high value to information:
intelligence. I wonder if these applications would find the most relevance
in the intelligence sector, despite thoughts of subversive applications. If
there is not a value proposition for an information marketplace between the
government and the private sector, there could be a value proposition within
the private sector intelligence channels, moving closer to your "credit
rating market" proposition.

We do have some most recent evidence of this.

However, Steele does have an interesting prototype community. Furthermore,
he has explored private sector opportunities as the intelligence community
restructures and privatizes.

But much strategically valuable information is not online. I said "NOT
ONLINE." The intelligence needed is in regard to third-world countries and
hotspots. This insight is damn sure not on the Net. I can't find the
intricacies in regard to [fill-in-the-blank] on the Net. There are some
things you can't mine. Even where you can, it's raw information, stale, and
not analysis. Furthermore, I would think this information is often of little
strategic value.

Yes. But when they get this information... "what does it mean?" They are
drowning in information that they can't make sense of. Any such an endeavor
would target information that is NOT SIPHONABLE AND OUTSIDE OF EXISTING
INTELLIGENCE FLOWS. The endeavor would tap the private intelligence sector,
developing nonexistent intelligence channels to tap private experts, agents,
analysts, primary sources, etc. - information available, but for a price.

Well, in the unlikely event the NSA and CIA folks are still around: They
need LESS noise - more private analysis and sourcepoint intelligence. The
problem with the US intelligence community, as seen by many, is that they
are over-focused on mass mining strategies and related technologies, and
need to re-focus on securing intelligence from the private sector.
Intelligence on resources, corporations, ETC. now that the Cold War is
kaput.

That is an over-simplification, but yes. Intelligence is not headlines. To a
large extent, "what's happening" is not analyzed correctly, because the
intelligence community lacks sufficient expert analysis to cope with the
dataload. This capability is in the private sector. These information flows,
between the government sector and the private sector, are unmapped.

(I know I am just mouthing Steele's arguments, but I find them compelling.)

Tim, I didn't expect you to make it all clear to me. (i.e., "Just lotsa
questions." Indeed, I have some answers, but thank you for the book recs.) I
was merely reflecting that anonymous cash is not a cure-all, and that it
might not even necessary for a highly sensitive information marketplace. I
was questioning the value proposition that you posed in the context of a
more sophisticated model -- an admittedly fantastical one. Finally, I
questioned if it was so fantastical, given Steele (et. al.) and thoughts of
functioning OSINT communities.

I can understand how conversations are frustrating for you, especially mine,
due to the level of my naiveti.

Still, you proffered an illicit "credit rating market" as a metaphor for an
information mercantile system tapping private, analytical intelligence --
intelligence that is not online, not siphonable or subject to mining, and
which lies outside legacy intelligence channels.

Is my value proposition so different than yours? I could argue that it
targets information of like character, in a like system, between parties of
like needs.

It remains to be seen if your "crypto-anarchy" can find a sustainable value
proposition. I was trying to envision one, usually necessary for somebody to
"do something." (This is your big bitch, no?)

You are a prickly, philosophical, violence-inclined prick tease that won't
put out for me. Clearly, I stand little chance of EVER getting into your
intellectual pants. Give me some indication of how good your dick really is,
because I'm thinking it isn't worth continued loss of blood on my end to
even entertain thoughts of pursuing such a long-term, high-risk,
book-reading, flesh-eating endeavor.

However, you have looked at this too long to have not considered
intelligence applications. If you say it's a really dumb idea, there is
probably some truth to it.
