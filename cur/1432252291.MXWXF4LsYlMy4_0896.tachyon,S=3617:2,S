#    In Germany, Golfers Endure Tests Before Earning a License to 
#    Drive
#    
#    By NEAL E. BOUDETTE Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
#    
#    ST. LEON-ROT, Germany -- To play golf, you need practice, patience 
#    and perseverance.
#    
#    To play golf in Germany, you might need a quick trip to Austria, 
#    or a color photocopier.
#    
#    That's because the average duffer can't tee up in Germany without 
#    a golf license, and getting one isn't a gimme.
#    
#    You have to pass driving, chipping and putting tests, and play 
#    18 holes with no more than 108 strokes -- a stretch for a 
#    beginner. The whole process, including lessons, can cost around 
#    2,000 marks ($870). Then there is a quiz on the rules and 
#    etiquette of golf.
#    
#    "A written test?" Tiger Woods laughed before playing in the 
#    Deutsche Bank-SAP Open near Heidelberg, Germany, in late May. 
#    The world's No. 1 player has made plenty of tough shots in his 
#    career, but he said he has never had to master multiple-choice 
#    questions about water hazards. "That's why we have officials," 
#    he said.
#    
#    A Need for Ripeness
#    
#    Golf has taken off in Germany in recent years, drawing many new 
#    players who bristle at the idea of having to qualify for the 
#    license, known as a Platzreife. The term, which combines the 
#    German words for "place" and "ripe," indicates that a player 
#    is ripe enough to get a place on a German course.
