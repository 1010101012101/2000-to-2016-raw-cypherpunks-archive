Actually, I think both comments are partially on the mark, and partially  
off the mark.

We HAVE had peer-to-peer applications, of various sorts, for years.   
USENET comes to mind (I can't think of very much that any centralized  
social networks do that USENET news wasn't doing years ago.  And at one  
point, someone did a very nice implementation of USENET on top of a  
distributed hash table).  The failure of USENET has a lot more do to with 
not finding a viable solution to spam than anything else.  Currently, 
distributed CVS systems (notably GIT) are a peer-to-peer application that's 
very successful.  And then there's torrent.

Re. Wikipedia and Linux:  Both build on rather rich ecosystems of prior  
art, and development communities.  Wikis came first, in various flavors,  
wikipedia.  The world wide web virtual library predated wikipedia by  
decades.  It took a lot of experimentation, plus vision and drive before  
wikipedia coalesced.  Linux builds on the legacy of Unix and lets not  
forget all the stuff done by Stallman and the FSF (e.g, all the gnu tools 
and gnu userspace without which Linux would be useless).

The problem with Poor Richard's proposal is severalfold:

1. lack of specificity - "let's build a P2P application suite" is a pretty 
content free statement - the PeerPoint "specification" really isn't 
anything resembling much of a specification

2. lack of vision - Ted Nelson's "Dream Machine's" book and Xanadu concept 
never really led to any widely used code, but they sure inspired a lot of 
people - precisely because Nelson laid out a vision of new capabilities -- 
other people went on to implement some of those ideas

3. lack of understanding about how technology evolves - open source or not 
- it involves an ecosystem and a process of incremental development,  
punctuated by flashes of insight

4. lack of anything motivating - is there really that much dissatisfaction 
with FaceBook?  I mean, an awful lot of people use it, and there are 
alternatives for old reprobates like me who find FaceBook pretty insipid 
and useless (except for keeping track of my kid).  For real work, email 
lists have been around an awfully long time, and don't seem to be going 
away anytime soon.  The folks who REALLY worry about privacy/secrecy are 
using VPNs, encryption, darknets, etc.

"Let's build an application suite" is a mantra that leads to things like  
MS Office.  "Let's build an open source application suite" leads to  
OpenOffice and LibreOffice - which are essentially not-as-good imitations 
of MS Office.  I simply don't see anything in the PeerPoint proposal that 
goes beyond "let's do x, y, and z, but let's do it peer-to-peer."

Now if Poor Richard were to start developing stuff, that actually did  
useful and interesting things, I expect it would attract a community.  But 
just saying "I think people should do <this>," where <this> is generally 
uninspired and uninteresting, is not a recipe for anything.

</end rant>

>> Richard, there is very little such application suites on the "drawing board" because we're way ahead of you.  These conversations have been going on for over a decade.  You're excited to get started, so you start afresh, but many of us have heard it all before.  That there isn't something more by now is a difficult fact to explain.   But probably the biggest reason is that after the litigation over p2p file-sharing and such, no one (with financial resources or political clout) has taken the "leap of faith" to "get it done".   Such a comprehensive and radical project isn't that far from the process that created the protocols of the whole Internet to begin with... and you know how many years and millions that took....
