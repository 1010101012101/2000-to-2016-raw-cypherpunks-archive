No, because it does not, at least not always. For instance, in Poland t=
here=20
were several cases of Facebook censoring/removing profiles that bashed =
large=20
corporations for their actions.

Of course multinationals and governments cooperate very closely on this=
, but=20
it does not mean that for such censorship the government is solely=20
responsible.

And even if that would be the case -- even if ANY AND ALL cases of cens=
orship=20
and self-censorship in large, centralised, corporate communication and=20=

information platforms like Facebook or Google where government-ordered,=
 my=20
take on this would still be that we need to decentralise and spread the=
m out,=20
so as to make it so much harder for governments to censor.

Because instead of going to a few one-stop-shops like Google, Microsoft=
,=20
Facebook, AT&T, Crapple and getting 95% of communication censored, the=20=

government would have to reach out to thousands upon thousands of priva=
te=20
companies and persons and make them censor their infrastructure.

Some would agree. Some would not. The latter group is why it's worthwhi=
le.

So any way you look at it, large multinationals are dangerous -- either=
 on=20
their own account, or through the simple fact that they make government=
s'=20
"work" much, much easier.
