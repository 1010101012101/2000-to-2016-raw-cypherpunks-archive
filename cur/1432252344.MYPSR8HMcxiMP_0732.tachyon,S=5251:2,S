Follow the recipe below, consume, and wait.

Take:
4 lbs. ground beef (at least 80% lean)
3 16oz can dark red kidney beans
1 4.5oz can peeled & chopped green chilies (Old El Paso or similar)
2 8oz can tomato sauce
2 6ox can tomato paste
1 large green bell pepper
1 medium white onion
3 11oz bag white corn tortilla chips, round style (Jays or similar)
2/3 to 1 cup chili powder (*)
4 tbsp masa flour (commonly used to make tortillas & tamales,
  Quaker brand or similar) (*)
2-1/2 tbsp ground oregano (*)
1-1/2 tbsp paprika
1-1/2 tbsp ground red pepper (cayenne pepper) (*)
2 tbsp minced garlic
2 to 3 tsp salt, to taste (NOT tbsp!)

NOTE 1) tbsp = tablespoon, tsp = teaspoon

NOTE 2) ingredients marked (*) are also found in popular chili mixes,
         such as "Carroll Shelby's Original Texas Brand Chili Mix" or
         "2 Alarm Chili Mix". If using these mixes instead of separate
         ingredients, you will need two packages of mix to roughly
         equal the recommended amounts.

NOTE 3) both tomato sauce and tomato paste are used in this recipe.
         This is due primarily to sugar content and really does affect
         the overall flavor.

+ Start heating 5 cups of water in a large pot over medium heat.
  Stir in salt and tomato sauce. DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL!

+ Mix chopped onion & bell pepper with green chilies, while stirring
  in frying pan over low heat for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl for
  later use.

+ Break up ground beef into small chunks (think of a good size for
  picking up with a tortilla chip), and place in covered frying pan to
  brown over medium heat. When half done, drain the grease. When done
  browning, drain any remaining grease, then stir in onion/pepper
  mixture from bowl.

+ While beef is browning, stir in all spices (but NOT masa flour) to
  liquid in pot, mix thoroughly.

+ When beef is browned, stir tomato sauce into liquid in pot, then
  add beef and stir very thoroughly.

+ Cover pot and allow to simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour, stirring
  every 10 minutes.

+ Stir in masa flour, and continue to simmer another 15 minutes.
  While simmering, drain liquid from beans.

+ Stir in beans, and continue to simmer another 15 minutes.

+ Serve immediately, with lots of tortilla chips for dipping (use
  instead of a spoon). A dark beer will help wash it down. If you
  would rather have soft drinks, Squirt or Fresca are excellent
  choices and their flavor complements the spices very nicely.
