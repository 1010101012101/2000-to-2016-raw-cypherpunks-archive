I’ve heard of cases where higher penalties were applied than existed at the time (which IIRC is banned by the ECHR and possibly the CCPR, although is allowed in the USA and elsewhere), or where statutes of limitations were extended, but a blatant ex post facto law seems surprising.

its the shac7 case

there were convictions on stalking that were not illegal at the time of the incidents - thats my information from one of the defendants anyway and other laws were never utilized in such a way in order to convict activists or anyone  - one law that was over 10 years old was used that had never been utilized in any case and even the name of the law was changed before the case was brought

the problem with these kinds of cases is that they set precedent and no one knows about it AND the defendants rarely have the cash to properly fight the case so the system of law becomes flawed - broken
