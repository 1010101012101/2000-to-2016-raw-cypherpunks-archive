GSM phones do indeed broadcast their International Mobile Equipment Number
(IMEI). The IMIE is hardcoded into the firmware of each phone. Changing the
IMIE is possible, but not from the UI. Recently, the manufacturers have
announced that they will make it even more difficult to alter IMEI's in the
future.
