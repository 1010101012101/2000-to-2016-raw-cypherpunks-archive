Obviously there are costs associated with a HW RNG as someone enumerated.  Since Intel
can no doubt shut it off when not used, it is free.  And die authors
are always looking for more content to add.  (And obviously to this
list, without crypto tools the net is worse than useless, its deceptively
reliable :-)  So crypto hw will continue to be increasingly useful.)

Since the crypto cluefull would never use a single raw RNG of any kind,
and would even seek to use multiple diverse conditioning algorithms, cpu 
bandwidth allowing, a "hw" source can only help.

(Unless they were implementing something useless like DRM)

Except as someone wrote, if its the devil's hwrng, or can be clandestinely
switched into that mode as useful.
