Former NSA whistleblowers contend that the agency shut down a program
that could have "absolutely prevented" some of the worst terror
attacks in memory. According to the ZDNet story: "Weeks prior to the
September 11 terrorist attacks, a test-bed program dubbed ThinThread
was shut down in favor of a more expensive, privacy-invasive program
that too would see its eventual demise some three years later -- not
before wasting billions of Americans' tax dollars. Four
whistleblowers, including a congressional senior staffer, came out
against the intelligence community they had served, after ThinThread.
designed to modernize the agency's intelligence gathering effort, was
cancelled. Speaking at the premier of a new documentary film A Good
American in New York, which chronicles the rise and demise of the
program, the whistleblowers spoke in support of the program, led by
former NSA technical director William Binney."
