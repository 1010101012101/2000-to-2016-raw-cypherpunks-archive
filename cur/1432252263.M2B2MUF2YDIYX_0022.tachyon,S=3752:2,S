look, digslug, Justin Schwartz is an oxford-trained, yale-trained 
scholar,  now a lawyer with the seventh circuit.  he doesn't type things on 
a publicly accessible listserv where he can easily be quoted and humiliated 
for saying foolish things since the major new york papers monitor it for 
political gossip.  the man who typed that, justin schwartz, has written and 
published more than you've typed on usenet so you ought to just STFU&STFD 
because your attempts to crawl out of the gutter where you seem to happily 
luxuriate in the scum, grime and waste are embarrassing.

the examples you provide never come up with the goods--demonstrate that 
sources are untraceable, etc. your unpublished dissertation, i take it?  it 
will remain unpublished.  slop like that doesn't past the muster.  unless 
you're enrolled in Sally Struther's University, of course.
