I believe we're headed back to the crypto wars of the 1990's. Except,
this time, the cypherpunks are going to have to battle both a technical
and a political adversary along with a fearful public who's easily
convinced of whatever the government wants them to believe.

Once end point security and end to end encryption get good enough to
keep them out, they'll start pushing for new laws requiring a backdoor.
The FBI tried this already only a few years ago.

Get ready for CryptoWars II. It's right around the corner.
