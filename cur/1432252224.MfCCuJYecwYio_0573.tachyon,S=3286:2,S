I would hope that they were only RIFFLING the punchcard ballots,
and not RIFLING them :-)    Depending on whether you take the
latter word to mean shooting holes in them with a rifle
or rooting through them to steal the good stuff,
different political factions may have been involved....

No - Keypunches did a fine job of punching out the chads,
and chads could be later recycled as football-game confetti.
The reason for riffling the decks of cards was to make sure
they were all packed loosely enough that the card reader
would read each card one at a time, not misfeeding or
missing cards because there were two cards stuck together
or (worse) one and a half cards stuck together,
leading to inaccurate results and a big mess you had to clean
out of the card reader.
