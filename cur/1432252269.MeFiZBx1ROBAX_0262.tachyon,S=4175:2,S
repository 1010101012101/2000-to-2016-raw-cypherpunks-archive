'Eugene',

     Quick question for you: other than 'living' people, and 'dead' people,
what other kinds of people have ID?

     Perhaps you can steal mom's drivers license out of her purse when she
gives you your allowance?

Thanks!

Hey i got your email from a message board. But since it seems you know
enough about fake ids. I had a question and i was hoping you could answer
it
for me. I wanted to get a new identity and i was told i could do it two
ways. 1 way was to steal a living persons identity, and the other was to
steal a dead persons id. write back if you know anything to help me.
