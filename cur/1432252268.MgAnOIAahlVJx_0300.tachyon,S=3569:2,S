Entrance and exit mixes can easily be set to be Usenet or other 
Net-based public posting and reading places. Kind of hard for the U.S.G. 
or the F.S.U. to shut down a newsgroup replicated across the world in 
many places.

Also, "repeat ad nauseum" still carries costs. Even the lawyers in 
Washington can't easily shut down publishers like "The Progressive" or 
"The New York Times." It costs a lot of money to shut down a publisher.

I see no particular reason why it will suddenly become cheap ("repeat ad 
nauseum") for lawyers to shut down tens of thousands of Web sites, 
publishers, mailing lists, message pools, and Democracy Walls.

Especially, by the way, if those entry and exit sites are in other 
countries.
