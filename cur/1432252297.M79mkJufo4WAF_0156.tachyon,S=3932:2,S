This is true, but the reason is that when you post somethin to
cypherpunks, you're essentially giving an implied license to
redistribute (and archive, etc). Same with Usenet. 

When I write something for Wired.com, we don't offer that implied
license.

I've never argued for official reporter priv (though I have it,
naturally). I've even pissed off many of my fellow reporters arguing
at a Freedom Forum event a while back that the government is already
licensing reporters who apply for congressional press credentials.

It's more a question of social norms in this case. If you post rants
at timmay.com and slap a coypright notice and some ads up and
explicitly ask that they not be redistributed -- well, then you'll
soon find that people treat you pretty close to the way they treat
Wired.
