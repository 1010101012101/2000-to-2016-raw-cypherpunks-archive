I'll take this challenge, silly as it is.

By "any crypto designed by mankind" I assume you are excluding one-time 
pads, which are not breakable by any amount of computer power and any 
amount of mathematical knowledge. I assume you are referring to public 
key approaches, where _conceivably_  mathematical advances or almost 
inconceivable advances in computer power could result in PK ciphers 
being broken.

Assuming your conditions are exactly as you state, I would of course 
pick box number ONE.

We still outnumber those in government, and what they have to hide is 
mostly of little interest to me or my causes (troop movements, 
submarine positions, etc.). Also, they can easily fall back to 
courier-delivered one-time pads, which are not part of the assumption, 
as I see it. (If you are including even one-time pads being broken, 
then you are assuming magic, which is not interesting.)


Thus, having a way to securely and untraceably communicate and transact 
business is much more important than being able to read THEIR bullshit 
communications.

That was easy.

And the cool thing is that every indication is that cipher-making is 
still pulling away from cipher-breaking by leaps and bounds, so it 
looks to me that we are falling further into the right choice.
