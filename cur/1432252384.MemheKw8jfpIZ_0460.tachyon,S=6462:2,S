...and, as previously reported here, an age-old practice:

    It's an older practice than you'd think.  I just ran across the
    following while looking at some IBM history, regarding the
    "Hollerith Card":

    http://www4.wittenberg.edu/academics/mathcomp/bjsdir/history0.shtml

	Hollerith claimed he got [the punched data card] idea from
	"punch  photograph cards" used by rail road officials. Used to
	prevent the theft of railroad tickets from passengers,
	conductors would "record" the physical characteristics of the
	ticket owner (e.g. eye color,   hair color) by punching
	specially marked areas on the edge of the card. Hollerith used
	holes punched through the card, not on the edge of the card.

Maybe someone should propose a "three strikes" law for suicide terror
attacks.

Peace.
