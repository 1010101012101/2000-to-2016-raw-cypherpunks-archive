A business is not going to spend $100million on deployment of a feature that has no proven market demand when the same job can be done for $5 million with only minor changes.

I was also there in 2003, and for a long time before that, and was
also one of the voices that was saying that we needed opt-in, and
protection from zone walking, or else the thing wouldn't fly. I don't
recall that any 1 person was the reason those things didn't happen
sooner than they did; in fact I recall near-universal sentiment that
zone walking was a non-issue, and that opt-in defeated the very nature
of what DNSSEC was trying to accomplish.

Fast forward to my time at IANA in 2004 and after considerable behind
the scenes organization a coalition of TLD registries came forward and
said that they would not deploy DNSSEC without those 2 features, and
were willing to dedicate the resources to create them. So it was not 1
person who stopped DNSSEC deployment, and it wasn't 1 person who made
it happen.

Your larger point about fiefdoms and oligarchies in the IETF is,
however, tragically accurate. The blindness of the DNSSEC literati to
the real-world needs was a huge part of what caused the delay in
deployment on the authoritative side, and the malaise caused by the
decade+ of fighting to get it out the door is a big contributor to
what's preventing any real solution to the last mile problem (which is
what it takes to make DNSSEC really useful).
