      Whales of Andaluc&iacute;a </font> </h2>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color="#0066ff"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="images/Sperm_Whale-1.jpg" width="296" height="271"></font></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color="#0066ff"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The 
    Bay and Straits of Gibraltar have a large population of Whales and Dolphins, 
    which marine biologists would refer to as 'Cetacea'. Cetaceans can be divided 
    into two main orders: Mysticeti and Odontoceti. The Mysticeti are the family 
    of whales that we all think of as being the largest, as indeed they are, in 
    some cases growing to 120ft long and weighing up to 190 tons - particularly 
    impressive when you consider that a Boeing B747 airliner weighs 150 tons! 
    -. By definition this includes the Whale, Dolphin, Porpoise, Grampus and the 
    Manatee, but excludes such animals as the Seal and Walrus who have come on 
    to land to give birth.</font></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff><img src="images/Pilot_Whale-2.jpg" width="356" height="248" align="left"></font><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff><br>
    The Odontoceti are the group of cetaceans that include all the Toothed Whales, 
    Grampus, Porpoise and Dolphins. Most Dolphins, such as the Common Dolphin, 
    may be found virtually anywhere and are especially prevalent here in the Mediterranean. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>These 
    are the ones that have been known to man for thousands of years. The Straits 
    of Gibraltar are one of the great natural land bridges of the world and well-known 
    for the biannual migration of bird life. What is generally not so realised, 
    is that there is also a continual passage of 'cetaceans' also passing between 
    the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>It 
    is only in comparatively recent geological times that all this marine movement 
    has become possible. Twelve million years ago, Africa slowly bumped into Spain 
    and a low mountain ridge was formed between Tangier and Tarifa. The Mediterranean 
    became a vast lake eventually drying up, leaving vast deposits of salt behind. 
    Six million years later, Africa started to retreat from Europe and a breach 
    was created in the mountain dam previously formed. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Striped_Dolphin_1.jpg" width="351" height="283"></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>The 
    largest waterfall the world has ever known was created. For a hundred years, 
    the Atlantic thundered over a 3000 ft drop, yet again filling the Mediterranean 
    basin, thus allowing the reintroduction of marine life into this area. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>Because 
    the Straits are only 13 miles wide at their narrowest point, the concentration 
    of cetaceans is very high, especially so towards the middle. It is about 3 
    miles offshore that you find the larger examples, such as the Sperm Whale. 
    For some reason most sightings show that they are heading in a westerly direction. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>The 
    prevailing surface current is easterly and these animals may be just stemming 
    the current flow and not in fact travelling out of the Straits at that particular 
    time. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><FONT size=4 FACE="Comic Sans MS,Arial" color=#0066ff>From 
    prominent headlands, with patience and binoculars, it is possible to see the 
    smaller cetaceans closer inshore. In the Bay of Gibraltar, Common and Striped 
    dolphins are always present and several companies run 'dolphin spotting' boat 
    trips throughout the year. </font></p>
