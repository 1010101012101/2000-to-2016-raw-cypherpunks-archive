   You fucking dimwit -- public property was all there ever was. Private
property is purely a construct of Euro culture, at least in this hemisphere. Who
owned the whole fucking continent when the eurotrash expatriates hit the east
coast? You really think you *own* a piece of Mother Earth? Guess again when that
volcano erupts underneath it.

  Some people, like this dumbfuck, don't deserve to be sucking air. "using force
to regulate behavior" is wrong? Like if some shithead tries to rob me I can't 
"regulate" their behavior? Or my village can't hire a professional
"regulator" to deal with robbers? Or for that matter, to "regulate" people who
smoke in public?
