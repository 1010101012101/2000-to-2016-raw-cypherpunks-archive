In NYC it's common to see 9/11 conspiracy theorists, and I am always amazed.

Basically, if a conspiracy is out in the open, who gives a sh*t? Whether 9/11
was planned by Bushites or not, the result is a huge series of crimes and
political vandalism such that 9/11 is a footnote in comparison.

My thinking is that conspiracy theorists would rather believe that 'this was
all planned' rather than the incompentent and complete cluster f*ck it
actually is. They'd rather believe someone's in control and 'screwing us over'
rather than the reality of chaos.

I'm interested in knowing more about the China issue...having lived there in
the 80s and speaking the language (yes, Stoopid Cypherpunk Tyler Durden speaks
Chinese), I'm sometimes able to read Chinese agitprop (though I'll grant that
it's fairly easy once you get the hang of it).
