The Good : religion is placed on equal footing with everyone else - it's
time tpo end preferential treatment.

The Bad   : a government thinking for even a moment that dress codes are
under its jurisdiction.

The Ugly  : those who should be wearing masks to protect their fellow
citizens sensibilities will not be able to.
