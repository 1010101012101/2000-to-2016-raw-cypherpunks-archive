These guys make coins. Er. "rounds". Whatever.

Except for whenever they make warehouse receipts for gold in a vault in Idaho.

They're bearer instruments (remember *that* word? :-)), so, once the coins
are minted and sold (at an egregious markup over specie, but, hey, caveat
emptor, better than fiat money, in theory...), they don't need records. In
theory. Oh. Right. For the tax man.

Tax man...

Oh. I get it. The *tax* man...

Never mind.

Cheers,
RAH
