About this Conference:

As government becomes more dependent on e-business, databases, information storehouses, mission critical information storage and information sharing, new risks are posed. These risks may come from student hackers, foreign governments or foreign military, terrorist organizations or even internal users.

This conference will highlight the risks, opportunities and innovative management and technical approaches to the detection and response to unauthorized intrusions into agency data. The conference will focus on business and military applications and agency plans and programs for securing these applications.

A highlight of this conference will be a section on AGENCY REQUIREMENTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES and strategies of coping with unauthorized attempts to compromise agency and DoD systems and data.
