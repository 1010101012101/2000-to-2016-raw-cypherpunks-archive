	Nonsense. There is no significant difference between the two, other 
than maybe Al Qaeda being a little more honest. They admit they want to 
destroy this (America) country and our way of life, while the eco-facists 
*do* want to destroy this country and our way of life, but don't come 
right out and say it.

	If they (the eco-fascists) had their way, they would wind up being the 
cause of a lot more than a measly 3k dead.
