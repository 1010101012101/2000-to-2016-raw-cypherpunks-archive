	I knew there was a reason I printed out NAMBLA's website 
throughout the years.  Maybe I should contact this child's parents as 
well as their attorney.  Maybe you should do the same.  Maybe you really 
are a member of NAMBLA.  It certainly sounds like it.  I wonder if you 
would tell the parents to their face how important you think it is to 
preserve the information put out by the people who helped cause their 
son to be murdered, rather than doing something to help prevent it from 
happening again.
