My impression is that whatever his original position, in the course 
of defending it, he made claims that were ever more unreasonable, 
ever more flagrantly wrong, and defended those ever more obviously 
erroneous claims by asserting the vast superiority of lawyers, and 
our vital need for lawyers, in an ever more condescending fashion.

If judges behave as lawlessly as BU would up claiming they did, we 
have no need for lawyers at all.

If judges are going to behave as lawlessly as Sandy now says he 
was predicting they will, we will have no need for lawyers at all.

As for what Aimee is saying -- that was not very clear, and the 
more she says, the less clear it is.
