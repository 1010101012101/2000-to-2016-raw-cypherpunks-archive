Unfortunately, the primary algorithm seems to work like this:
- Somebody puts a name on some list because it seems like a
         good idea at the time, and there's no due process required.
- Everybody copies lists from everybody else,
         with minimal attempt to track where the information comes from.
- Database corruption propagates rapidly, so anybody who's on
         any list because of political corruption like Neo-Cointelpro
         stays there because of database corruption.
