Gmail's new e-mail sorting system divides mail into three categories by
default - "primary", "social", and "promotions". The user can train the
filter by dragging and dropping and by creating new categories.

A quick look at avaaz.org's SPF record shows that they are using
Sendgrid, I doubt they will be having difficulties with deliverability.
