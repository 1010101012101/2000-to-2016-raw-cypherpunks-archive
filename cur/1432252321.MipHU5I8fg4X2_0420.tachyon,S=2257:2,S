At a press conference held on the 26th of September 2003, TSA chief James
Loy needed someone to extol the virtues of the CAPPS II internal border
control system.  His choice: 'passenger advocate' David S. Stempler , head
of the Air Travelers Association.  Stempler obliged, saying that CAPPS II
testing was a fine idea and that "(w)hatever's going to be done will have to
be done in secret".

If Stempler sounds like a boot-licking toady, it's because he probably is:
his association appears to be little more than a front for the Cendant
Corporation, whose Galileo subsidiary stands to gain a new profit center if
CAPPS II is implemented.
