Nice quote!

Some of us have been saying this for a while.  E.g.,

" #2.4 Avoid Public Key Cryptography like the Plague

Public key cryptography is the kiss of death to simplicity. The
problem is that it is not simple, not amenable to KISS, and full of
traps that will swallow a battleship. Although the very basic idea is
understandable and elegant, none of the instantiations of public key
cryptography can create simple interfaces that are free of minefields.

It is more likely that the implementors made a mistake.  This can be
seen also in that all the symmetric algorithms are amenable to
black-box and deterministic testing, whereas the asymmetric ones are
not so amenable.

Oh, and forget the key sizes.  This is not about the key sizes.
