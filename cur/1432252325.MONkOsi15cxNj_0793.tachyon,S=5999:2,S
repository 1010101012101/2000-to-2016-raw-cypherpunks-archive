>Public Interest Groups and Academics Call on Bush Administration to Fill
>Privacy Position
>
>In a letter sent today, a diverse group of advocacy organizations and
>academics called on the Director of the Office and Management and budget to
>hire a new Chief Privacy Counselor.
>
>The signers expressed concern that privacy would lose the momentum that it
>had gained at the end of last year.  "We are concerned that without these
>central staff resources dedicated solely to privacy, we will return to a
>time when privacy was an afterthought in government and commercial data
>processing; education of the different agencies took years rather than
>months; and OMB staff knew little about the larger privacy issues effecting
>the country," the letter read.
>
>The signers want the new counselor to oversee the implementation of existing
>privacy law as it applies to the federal government and advise the President
>on privacy policy in the public and private sectors.
>
>"Despite all that we have heard about the importance of privacy recently in
>both the public and private sectors from Congress and in the polls," said
>Center for Democracy and Technology Senior Policy Analyst Ari Schwartz, "we
>are still waiting for the Administration to appoint leadership on the
>issue."
>
>The organizational signers included The Center for Democracy and Technology,
>Consumer Action, the Free Congress Foundation, OMB Watch, Private Citizen,
>and Privacy Foundation along with seven important academic experts Mary J.
>Culnan, Bentley College; Rod Dixon, Rutgers University Law School; Jerry
>Kang, UCLA School of Law; Deirdre K. Mulligan, Boalt Law School, University
>of California, Berkeley ; Joel R. Reidenberg, Fordham University School of
>Law; Paul Schwartz, Brooklyn Law School; and David E. Sorkin, The John
