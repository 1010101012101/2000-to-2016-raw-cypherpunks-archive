employs federal<br>agents who run most of the operation. I suggest =
demanding from your<br>newsgroup provider that they stop the peering of =
binary groups to<br>FBI's Giganews. Please understand how risky this is =
for me to explain<br>as Agent Kibbey subtly threatened my family on =
behalf of Data Foundry<br>the second time I met both agents at the =
Austin FBI office. The<br>traitors saw me as a threat and said I did not =
cooperate. Even with<br>this threat, please warn Giganews customers and =
other Usenet users,<br>and use the evidence I've linked. If the google =
drive link dies, email<br>me for a new one. Agents Kibbey and Riley did =
not let me photograph<br>them, but I did include a scan of their =
business cards. Riley didn't<br>have an FBI badge or card, but he had an =
fbi.gov email address, ip,<br>and Austin Police Department =
badge.<br><br>I've linked pictures of my Giganews badge and the shirts =
with their<br>red armor logo I was forced to wear when working there. =
I've also<br>linked to the Giganews/Data Foundry employee list with =
in-office mug<br>shots, phone numbers and emails they gave me. I did not =
agree to<br>return this on their employee paperwork, so it is not =
illegal to<br>share. They thought I did, though. I doubt the names and =
phone numbers<br>they used internally are all real, as many are likely =
aliases and<br>fed-routed voip proxies. Most of the emails changed to =
goldenfrog.com<br>before I left from the ones listed in the 2011 =
employee pdf. Some of<br>the mugshots are photoshopped by them, as the =
pictures did not match<br>the physical appearance of some, likely to =
hide in case of someone<br>like me exposing these traitors.<br><br>Feel =
free to upload this to any newsgroup that Giganews carries -<br>Their =
customers need to know.<br><br>-Nick =
