Someone on this board mentioned that a fake AP site might be almost as good as real AP.

I suggest that someone create a fake AP board, on the tonga server or wherever, for Mike Hawash. Basically, it would be a website that lists the name of anyone involved in incarcerating this man without due process. It will also sport logos of the various "payment" options, including Paypal, Digicash, egold, or whatever else. It will also have the current $-value associated with each name.

Future additions to the name list will be tactical, however. D u b y a, for instance, would not be on there, nor would Fabio, Britney, or any other "funny" slam-dunks.

Hopefully, the board will look like its real, and as if there's already a price (and date) established for those involved in holding Hawash.
