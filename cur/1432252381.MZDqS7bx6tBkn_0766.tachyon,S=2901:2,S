I'd be steamed if I had a laptop stolen. Recovering stolen property
sounds good but the little zTrace widget is probably in the flash or on
the hdd - reflash bios, reinstall os. Might want to use a pcmcia nic to
get a new mac address, I have seen an enet chip that uses a small eeprom
for the mac and can be reprogrammed in circuit, use Linux to avoid the
cpuid sneaking out. Now how does it phone home? Best bet is watch it
closely or lock it up when you can't.
