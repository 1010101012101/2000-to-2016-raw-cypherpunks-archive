Actually I think it's usually taken to mean that. As for the amygdala, it's
not exactly pure science to say that increased activity in that region
causes any damage or is associated with whatever negative impact these
people think sex/violence incurs. Since this particular nucleus has a lot to
do with fight or flight reactions and primitive emotions, I'd be ready to
bet on similar reactions being found in anybody having fun/suffering
stress/whatever.

Actually bloodflow has been found more accurate a predictor of neural
activity in some studies than the use of radioactive markers - for some
reason, the metabolic activity of human cells does not always get reflected
in their oxygen/glucose consumption in any straight forward way.

My point exactly.

I think the fastest MRI equipment can go upto tens (or even
hundreds? anybody?) of images per second. Tracking bloodflow at such a high
temporal resolution actually gives a lot more information about the local
activity of the brain than those relatively static PET shots. (Remember, PET
requires considerable repetition, consentration and conditioning before
sharp images of brain activity are acquired.)

Not likely. Few people with MRI access are stupid enough to do this. Of
course, we might find that the researchers have a concurring viewpoint on
the subject matter...

More than likely. Is this something new in the censorship debate?

General population? Phew...

'Cause that would mean children aren't innocent?
