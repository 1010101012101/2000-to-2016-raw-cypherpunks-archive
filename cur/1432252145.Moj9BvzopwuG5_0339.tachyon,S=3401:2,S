But Bob, I thought you usually did "Edit once, send three or four times" :-)
This one only went to cypherpunks and dcsb (plus Declan), 
without also hitting two or three other lists, unlike most of your
announcements.  (I don't mind - Eudora's pretty good at sorting stuff,
and it's easy to skip the excess copies since they've got the same 
date and Subject, though I do occasionally get bouncegrams for replying
when some of the lists allow non-subscriber content and some don't.)
				Thanks!
