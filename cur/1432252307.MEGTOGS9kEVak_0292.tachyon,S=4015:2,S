Thinking through this a little bit more, such a system wouldn't work
well given today's technology. It would allow an attacker to know 
with a high degree of certainty the truename (cardname) of someone 
and link that with an encrypted message. By unwrapping it down the
chain with subpoenas and court orders, it would be possible to 
get at least the last To: line if not the final text.

Such a situation could be avoided by remailers that use temporary
(changing by the minute, say) keys so that a court order wouldn't 
be able to succeed in the same way as above. But then that has
the problem of getting the keys to the users of the remailer --
not a terribly difficult thing; given a small # of remailers, all
could be queried in a second or two. A website that collated
the temporary keys (signed by a permanent one) would be a nice service.

Naturally you'd have to trust that at least one remailer was honest --
but you already do that, right?
