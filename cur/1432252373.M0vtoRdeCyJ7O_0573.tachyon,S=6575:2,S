Well, when you give up those rights by still disclosing your
source IP and trusting your 'destination organization' [aka provider]
with address info regarding you and who you're mailing... it's not much
of a solution. Put in as many classes as you want... besides the body
of the message which you control, you can't fix centralized Email.

Here's another class of provider and browser based non solutions...
https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2014-July/004894.html

There's a thread of this subject ongoing that acknowledges Email
can't really be fixed against the issues of the day... and discusses
other possible messaging designs towards a next gen solution...

https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2013-December/002638.html
https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2014-July/004900.html

The goal is likely one or both of these over an anonymous P2P network...
o  direct delivery to your recipients online node.
o  stored delivery to same (push or pull, only exposes destination).

More interesting than wasting time on futility of old Email.
