Speaking of orthogonal, what happened to *PLONK* as a code
outburst for chagrin a being tromped by somebody smarter-assed,
well, more adept at haughty bon mot triumphalisme.

*PLONK*s were once frequently used here to hawk loogies. The 
archives show over 30,000 sneezes from about 2 million snorts.
29,000 were by Mr. Tim May, 500 by Monsieur Perry Metzger, 499 
by Detweiler, a universally beloved pseudonym, though less popular 
in the American (forever a) colony than Euro-septic Luther Bissett.

You say you missed about 1.9999 million of the wheezes. Well, then
you are a super*PLONK*er who unsubbed after bazooka-ing your
bugger, mooning your crack as the outdoor whacked it. Or pretended 
to unsub and hunkered down to see if anybody cared (Old French: 
"gave a shit"), or resubbed under a pseudo snot-me.

Truthsayers claim over 98% of cpunk subscribers are one humanoid
keyhammering about having to code for the 2% fuck-offs topside spitting
sub-juvenile filos0fikal cant to consumers agog at the wonders of
laborsaving digitalizers commanding them to spend thousands on
upgraded error spreaders.

This outrage must stop. Mark Klein nasaled.
