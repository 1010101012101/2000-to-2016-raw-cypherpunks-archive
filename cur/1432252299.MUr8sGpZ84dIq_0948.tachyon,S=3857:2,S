Seeing Green. The latest person to take the well-traveled path from Capitol 
Hill to greater riches on K Street is Dan Turton, floor assistant for 
outgoing House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D- Mo.).

Turton has singed up with Timmons & Co., which has also snapped up Alan 
Hoffman, chief of staff to Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.).

At a grave time for the airline industry, meanwhile, American Airlines has 
tapped Daniel Elwell to serve as managing director of international and 
governmental affairs. Taking a more unconventional path to the lobbying 
industry, Elwell is a veteran company pilot. That led to the inevitable 
quip in a company press release that he is "equally at ease navigating a 
bill through Congress as he is a 767 across the country."

Fleishman-Hillard, meanwhile, has signed up the former drug czar, retired 
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, to launch a new homeland security practice at the 
public relations behemoth. Three members of the firm's international 
advisory board - former Defense Secretary William Cohen, ex-Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former Health and Human Services Secretary Louis 
Sullivan - will provide "strategic counsel"to the new practice.

And Thomas Wheeler, president and CEO of the Cellular Telecommunications & 
Internet Association, has been elected president of the board of directors 
of the Foundation for the National Archives.
