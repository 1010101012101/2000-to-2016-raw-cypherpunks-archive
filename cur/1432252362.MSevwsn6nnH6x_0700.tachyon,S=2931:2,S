Financial conservation does not apply to money.  If paper currency  
collapses, and is replaced by gold, those who invest in bitcoin will come 
out with nothing.  If paper currency collapses, and is replaced by  
bitcoin, they will come out with immense fortunes.

The market is at present rating the prospect of the world going to a  
bitcoin standard rather than a gold standard at two chances in a million, 
which seems reasonably conservative.
