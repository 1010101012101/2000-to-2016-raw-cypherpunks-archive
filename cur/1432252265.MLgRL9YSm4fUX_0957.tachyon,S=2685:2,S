Rush steps into a bucket of:

>This is not true. I know Jim in person. 

Rush, get ready for a subpoena. Better, to plead, I don't
know anybody or anything that will not incriminate me.

Jim didn't say that, just one time, and from that came
the CDR mark of entrapment and forthwith acting on
behalf of the evildoers. Jim cannot eliminate the CDR
brand because it's the hidden hand doing it.

The Jim you met, Rush, ain't there anymore. Nor others
once known.
