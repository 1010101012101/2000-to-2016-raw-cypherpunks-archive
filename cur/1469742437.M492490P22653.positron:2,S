Depraved Clinton War Criminal Says Trump Will Destroy US Foreign Policy

Madeleine Albright openly condoned the slaughter of 500,000 Iraqi
children

(Alt:

)

CNN rolled out the old war horse Madeleine Albright on Tuesday to push
the Putin conspiracy angle on the DNC leak.

Albright told the convention Donald Trump had “already done damage” to
American foreign policy “just by running for president.” She said
defeating Trump would represent a defeat for Putin and the Russians.

  “Putin is eager to see Trump win, and that should worry every
  American,” she said. “Take it from someone who fled the Iron
  Curtain—I know what happens when you give the Russians a green
  light.”

Secretary of Hate

The damage inflicted by Albright when she was “Secretary of Hate,” as
Bob Djurdjevic ( http://www.srpska-mreza.com/library/facts/Mad.html )
characterized her time at the State Department, is almost incalculable.

In 1998, as Bill Clinton unleashed cruise missiles on Iraq, murdering
dozens of civilians in response to Saddam Hussein thumbing his nose at
the United Nations, Albright declared: “If we have to use force, it is
because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall.
We see farther into the future.”

In 2013, she admitted the bombing of Yugoslavia by her boss was illegal,
but decided it was fair. Clinton teamed up with NATO in 1999 and
conducted 38,400 sorties, including 10,484 strike sorties, in a terror
bombing campaign that lasted 78 days and destroyed infrastructure,
commercial buildings, schools, health institutions, media houses and
cultural monuments.

In addition to convincing Clinton to bomb Yugoslavia with depleted
uranium and cluster munitions to force Slobodan Milošević to sign the
Rambouillet peace accord, she pushed to send US troops to Bosnia,
according to the recollection of then Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin Powell.

Hillary Clinton celebrated the illegal attack. In October 2000, The New
York Times (
http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/03/hillarys_war.html )
reported Clinton “cited American involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo as
examples of foreign engagements she favored on moral and strategic
grounds.” Clinton urged her husband to bomb Yugoslavia without
congressional approval and said what “do we have NATO for if not to
defend our way of life?”

NATO also defended the way of life of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
terrorist gang of ethnic Albanian separatists. The KLA effort for an
independent Kosovo supported by Albright and the United States
encouraged similar terrorist groups in the Balkans, the Middle East, and
Russia. The Kosovo precedent was responsible for inspiring Chechen
terrorists in Russia and the murder of scores of Russian citizens.


Career Achievement: 500,000 Dead Children

Albright’s crowning achievement, however, was the murder of half a
million Iraqi children under a brutal and medieval sanctions regime
imposed on the country by the United States and the United Nations.

  “We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean,
  that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the
  price worth it?” asked Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes asked Albright in
  1996.
  
  “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the
  price is worth it,” Albright responded.

On Tuesday, the war criminal Albright warmed up the crowd for Bill
Clinton, described at the time of the Yugoslavia bombing raid by Edward
Herman as the world’s “leading active war criminal.”

The crowd was clueless about the magnitude of the crimes committed—and
those to be committed if Hillary Clinton wins. The corporate media once
again failed to note the complicity of Albright and Clinton in mass
murder and crimes against humanity, preferring instead to dwell on the
alleged DNC hacking by Vladimir Putin, an accusation without definitive
evidence that is now passed off as a fait accompli.
