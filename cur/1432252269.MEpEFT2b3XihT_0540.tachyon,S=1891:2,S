A court refused to hear the case of a man accused of owning unlicensed
pharmaceuticals when a pig entered a locked loo.  The loo was part
of a gas station; the attendant called the pigs.  A prostitute was
in there too, with him, and the area rife with folks of that profession,
FWIW,
which is nothing.  But the court held reduced expectation of privacy in
a public loo.

One imagines much fun with anonymous calls when state employees
are in such places, but this does not temper our disgust, or desire for
karma
with extreme prejudice.
