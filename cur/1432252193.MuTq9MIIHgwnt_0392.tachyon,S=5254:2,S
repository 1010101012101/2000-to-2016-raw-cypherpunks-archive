Right, but Jimbo lives in Texas where the word is spelled "defense" not
"defence" as it is in England.  Just teasing the (ignorant) monkey.

It is educational (and it amuses me) to draw him out into parading his
ignorance and intransigence for all to see.  Of course, he won't admit he is
wrong directly, but when his stupid notions are repeatedly challenged, he is
forced to dig himself in deeper and deeper.  This makes it crystal clear to
all observers that his arguments have no merit.  If he is unchallenged, a
few folks might actually think he has something worthwhile to say.  So think
of it as a public service.

Now the real question is, does Jimbo realize he's making an ass out of
himself, or does he actually think he's scoring points?  If the first
alternative is true, it brands him as a detestable moral and intellectual
coward.  If the second is true, he's far stupider than I would have thought.
Of course the two options are not mutually exclusive...

The really sad thing about Jimbo is that he stands absolutely alone.  Each
time I, or someone else, gives him a real good ass kicking, taunt him, tease
and humiliate him, NO ONE ever jumps to his defense (or defence, for that
matter).

I've been told not to feed the trolls, once or twice someone has agreed with
a factual part of one of his statements and folks like you have said--in
effect--why bother, but no one has ever said anything like, "play nice" or
"cut the guy some slack, he's human too" or anything remotely SYMPATHETIC to
Jim Choate as a human being.  You have to be a pretty wretched human being
to evoke that little sympathy

However, as I think you realize, that would all change overnight if Jimbo
were to show some humility or moral/intellectual honesty.  If that were to
happen, I would be the first to cut him some slack.  As it is, though, I
have zero respect or sympathy for him and I will continue to cut him off at
the knees without remorse.
