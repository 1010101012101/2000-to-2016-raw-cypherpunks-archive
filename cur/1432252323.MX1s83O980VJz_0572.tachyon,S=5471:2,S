      Actually, I have.

         Really? So some senile asshole orders it. I give him ten
copies. So
then what? Oh, there's more? How many? All? How many is "all"? Okay,
here's
ten more. Prove that's not "all".

       Hmm --- no, you decided it was settled to your satisfaction.

          Cases dealing with corporations who naturally keep lots of
records,
files, etc. This was about a journalist, one entity, who probably keeps
about
the same number of grocery store receipts as the rest of us, like zero.

      Hmm, sorry. IANAL. But I have spent one heck of a lot of time in
Gov.
docs reading statute and case law. Not that it matters -- this is really
more
about justice and common sense. Common sense dictates that I'd produce
-- if
ordered to hand over the "original and all copies" of my own work -- the

"original" and maybe 2 copies, then bogey to another jurisdiction and
anonymously spam the whole world with whatever they were trying to
suppress.

       I think I've got an extremely good grip on the issue -- it's you
who
are doing your utmost to muddy the waters and take everyone's mind off
the real
issue. Who gives a fast flying fuck what this asshole judge, or any
other
scumbag court has to say when they are trying to suppress the truth?

        All I've seen from you is a whole lot of BS plainly intended to
obscure the real issue. Cite whatever you want --- it's totally
irrelevant. People
need to learn about their options.  Cite us the case of the villagers in
Latin
America who hacked a judge to death with machetes -- that's much more
relevant.

Asked, but not answered. The only possible answer is that it's a crooked
judge
who wants to suppress the truth.
