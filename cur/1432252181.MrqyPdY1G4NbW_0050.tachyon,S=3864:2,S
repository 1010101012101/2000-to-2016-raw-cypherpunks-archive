Ahhhh... So FileVault actually is just a marketing term for the encrypted
disk images! Thanks for the explanation! I just hope my login password can
be longer than 8 characters then.

Do you know whether the source code to hdiutil and hdid respectively its
10.3 kernel equivalent is available? I can't seem to find it in the

I believe in peer-reviewed source code for crypto apps/features.
