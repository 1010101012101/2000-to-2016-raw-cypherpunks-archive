Among others, /. is reporting that Win2k and WinNT source code may
have leaked.  

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/12/2114228

Does anyone here have any good evidence as concerns the truth or
falsity of this claim?

Lots has been said about OSS developers not wanting to look at this
for fear that they will be "tainted."  While it is true that simply
the act of looking at the code is unauthorized and illegal, I wonder
if there is any truth to the claim that a developer who looked at
Windows source would endanger future projects (assuming, of course,
that simple copying---which is clearly illegal---doesn't happen).
Comments?
