Hydrogen peroxide is not an organic peroxide. Concentrated hydrogen
peroxide is unstable, and can violently decompose, especially if catalysts
(finely distributed metals, pyrolysite) are present, but it does not
detonate. The usual use for it is for hypergolic rocket fuel (with
unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine).

Organic peroxides is something else entirely. You can make organic
peroxides using hydrogen peroxide, though it is not advisable for laymen.
In fact, due to their instability, it is better not to work with them at
all. Considerable potential for severe or even terminal injury there.
