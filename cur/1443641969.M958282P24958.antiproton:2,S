Not sure if I'm missing something here but CF's CEO confirmed what I had
tested on Twitter.
The Web Service owners have to give CF their private keys.
So they are complicit in giving away your "secure" communications to CF
(and whoever they are buddies with, whether it be Advertisers or NSA et al).
But they do not tell the end users that they are using a service such as
CF which if they did would at least give the end users a chance to make
their own mind up.

This is an issue that needs to be looked at but using WAF's is not a
solution to DDoS, it's a malware solution so in fact they only need to
ensure your traffic passes through CF without decrypting it to gain DDoS
protection - that is a routing issue.

There is a big problem with the centralisation with the internet in this
way but it is also very difficult and costly to for a website to handle
large volumes of traffic in an independent DC.
But responding to DDoS by using services such as CF is playing into the
hands of the likes of the NSA who may well be behind a number of the
attacks in order to promote the CF "solution".

Snowden is a moderate extremist, he doesn't want transparent government
and private individuals, he just wants a discussion on where to draw the
line with surveillance, his leaks are purely to further this aim.
Assange and the people who have worked with him on leaks are more the
kind of people we need.
