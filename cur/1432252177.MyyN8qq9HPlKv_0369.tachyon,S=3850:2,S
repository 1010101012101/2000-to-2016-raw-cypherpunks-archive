Anyone caught inside a house or office should be dealt with in the most 
expeditiious manner possible.

Anyone picked up on crittercam surveillance cameras, and identified by 
any means, should be dealt with later. The offices and judges who order 
such sneak and peek invasions shluld be dealt with as well.

All of those who passed this law have, in my political opinion, earned 
the death penalty,
