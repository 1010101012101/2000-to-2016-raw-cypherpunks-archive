[Using the *financial* angle, having to show state-photo-ID is
overturned to vote
is overturned.   Interesting if this could be used for other cases where

Court Blocks Ga. Photo ID Requirement

ASSOCIATED PRESS

ATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court Thursday refused to let the state
enforce a new law requiring voters to show photo identification at the
polls.

Earlier this month, a federal judge barred the state from using the law
during local elections next month, saying it amounted to an
unconstitutional poll tax that could prevent poor people, blacks and the
elderly from the voting. The state asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to lift the stay, but the court declined.

Under the law, voters could show a driver's license, or else obtain a
state-issued photo ID at a cost of up to $35.
