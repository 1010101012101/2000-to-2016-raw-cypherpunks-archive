People don't seem to understand what free speech is all about.  You might
be interested in knowing Jodi that Hitlers Germany had one of the most
progressive free speech policies in the world.  You could say whatever you
wanted to say, provided it was authorized by the state.

I don't support free speech because it's the fashionable thing to
do.  Free speech is the basic right of all.  The content of that right is
irrelevant.

Now - you spending alot of time on the sex angle here.  I don't think you
understand what freedom of speech means.  If I were to tell you that I had
personal knowledge of the rape by canadian politicians and senior
bureacrats of young boys from fort lauderdale during the 60, 70, 80's -
and that these rapes and further investigation of those who abuse these
children is being intentionally suppressed by senior police officers and
law officers in Canada - how would you react to this?

Now here's the kicker.  I have all of that knowledge and I am prevented by
court order from exposing any of these people.  You can thank Judge
William Browne of the Ontario Court for that.

It's people like you who are willing to deny others rights who end up
taking away my rights to expose these political child molesters.

Would you like to follow up with the investigating officer in fort
lauderdale and verify this?  You talk a big talk Jodi - now do you have
the passion to walk the walk and help these former kids.  Just let me know
and I will phone someone who will forward you a URL.  We don't want to
break our court order you understand ;-)

Joe Baptista
