Declan - Microsoft's DNS is back up; the article in
The Register  http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16340.html
says their problems were due to DNS issues, not security
or denial of service attacks.

Previous story about it being down
	http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16321.html

There's much discussion on Slashdot,
	http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/01/24/1455247&mode=thread
but not much of it's useful :-)

With Microsoft trying last year to push the term
"Digital Nervous System" to usurp the acronym DNS,
in spite of it being the third or fourth most important
aspect of the Internet (and one of the most controversial),
having a Digital Nervous Breakdown seems like poetic justice.


				Thanks!
