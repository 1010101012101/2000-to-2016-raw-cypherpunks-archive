The important fact that you seem to be unaware of
is that the body that radiates faster also
absorbs more (reflects less).  A black plate will
radiate faster than a white one,  but the white plate
is reflecting almost all the light that hits.
Cavity radiation and blackbody radiation are used synonymously.
