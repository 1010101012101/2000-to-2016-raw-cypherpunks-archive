Right to enter is restricted to the landlord or reprsentatives under
particular circumstances.  Emergency personnel (firemen) can also enter.
Peace officers can enter in "hot pursuit" situations.

In the case of peace officer questioning, you can just ask them to leave.
No need to hide.

The main reason not to invite peace officers in is because of the risk
they might see something which would give rise to probable cause for a
search.

The reason for not talking to them is that most people don't know
what the legal implications of their words are.  That's what lawyers are
for.

You don't have to talk to them outside your house either or after arrest
or any time.
