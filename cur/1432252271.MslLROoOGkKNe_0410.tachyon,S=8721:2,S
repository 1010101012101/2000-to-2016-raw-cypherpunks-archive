For the week of Monday, February 12, 2000

"He's the only one here to play defense." 
--Allen Iverson on Dikembe Mutombo at the All-Star Game. 

STARTING LINE
A third crack as been found in the rail system that will 
support movable parts of Miller Park's retractable roof, but 
stadium officials describe the problem as minor.  The 
Milwaukee Brewers are scheduled to begin play there this 
spring...

... Anymore cracks on Miller's roof and you'll get a genuine 
draft...bada boom! - Mel Jones!

---------------------------------------------------------
WAY FUNNY --

Young couples, caught having sex, at work, by security cameras!
As seen on 20/20, Entertainment Tonight, Sally Jessy and more:

HOLLYWOOD SPORTS
OUR FIRST TELEVISION SHOW!
That's right - SportsHollywood is proud to announce that 
this summer - Ed Marinaro will lead an elite unit of Las 
Vegas Detectives as the world's biggest ass-kicker in the 
new USA Network television series ROPE SQUAD.  But don't 
worry...Ed's not leaving us, because the folks from 
SportsHollywood will actually be producing the TV show with 
Ed!  Just think - exclusive behind-the-scenes scoop, 
breaking news from the set and, of course, Ed's regular (and 
much-requested) SportsHollywood column about - what else? - 
sports...and Hollywood.

And how cool is this?  When SportsHollywood needed the 
inside track on finding out how the real Vegas cops 
operate...one of our long-time SportsHollywood subscribers 
stepped up to the plate to get Ed the opportunity to spend a 
few days with the real-life Vegas crime busters themselves.  
You gotta love that SportsHollywood family.  You rock, DH!

So sign up for the newsletter and get all the gory details 
of Ed's adventures with the Vegas cops this week.  Let's 
just say that there's a little tale about a drug bust, some 
go-go boots and a piercing....

SPORTSHOLLYWOOD EXCLUSIVE: Kathryn Hancock is possibly the 
most beautiful woman ever interviewed by SportsHollywood, 
and definitely the first who could have knocked us on our 
behinds in a game of backyard football. Kathryn, who will be 
debuting in the soap opera PASSIONS in March, grew up in 
South Carolina as the only girl on her street who'd play 
football with the boys. With Kathryn to tackle you can 
understand why football is so popular in that area. See her at:

BASKETBALL
Calling the financial situation unfair to owner Michael 
Heisley, NBA commissioner David Stern gave the Vaqncouver 
Grizzlies permission to explore a move to another city. St. 
Louis, New Orleans and Nashville, Tenn., have been mentioned 
as possible destinations for the team...

... Those cities all want professional basketball teams... 
but they might take the Grizzlies, instead...

BASEBALL
Robert Person of the Philadelphia Phillies was hogtied by 
police, who said the enraged pitcher tried to kick out the 
windows of a police car after his arrest in city's nightclub 
district...

... He shouldn't have tried the high kick - he should have 
tried escaping out of the stretch...

TENNIS
Sunday's episode of "The Simpsons" featured tennis stars 
Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams and Serena 
Williams... 

... My favorite character on the show was the bald one with 
the yellow complexion - not Homer, I mean Agassi...

ANNA KOURNIKOVA'S BACK!

XFL
The XFL wasn't as big a turn-on in Week 2, as the football 
league drew only half as many viewers as it did for the 
debut broadcast on NBC...

... Pretty soon it'll be the ex-XFL...

The XFL's Memphis Maniax aren't changing their name despite 
criticism that it is a slap at the mentally ill.  The 
president of the National Mental Health Association says, 
"The name Maniax is demeaning to Americans who are affected 
by mental illness each year."  The Maniax are one of eight 
teams in the XFL, the new football league owed by the World 
Wrestling Federation and NBC...

... They really should change the name to avoid offending 
the majority of their viewers...

THIS WEEK IN SPORTS HISTORY
In 1999, the San Diego Padres announced that country music 
star Garth Brooks would attend spring training as a 
non-roster player...

... Talk about a screwed up organization - they had Garth 
Brooks playing outfield while Roseanne sang the National 
Anthem...

In 2000, Tom Landry, the stoic, expressionless Dallas 
Cowboys coach who wore a business suit and fedora and led 
America's Team to five Super Bowls, died...

... How could they tell...?

PENALTY BOX
In Florida, O.J. Simpson surrendered to authorities to face 
charges that he during a road-rage argument in December. 
Simpson is charged with burglary of a car and misdemeanor 
battery of motorist Jeffrey Pattinson...

... You'd think OJ would have learned by now not to cut in 
front of anybody...

For the entire Offensive Line:
http://www.sportshollywood.com/shnews.html

Akili Smith, the Cincinnati Bengals' second-year 
quarterback, was arrested in San Diego Sunday for 
investigation of drunken driving.  Smith was pulled over for 
driving the wrong way down a one-way street.  He told 
officers he was looking for friends...

... You know, where everybody knows your name...
YOU'RE OUT:
"I'll be back." 
-Heavyweight boxer Peter McNeeley, five days after being 
pummeled in his fight with Mike Tyson.

EDITORS NOTE: I've met our new SportsHollywood babe, and let 
me say this. OOOFTA! She gave me a really nice bottle of 
cologne and every time I spray it on (every morning) I 
fantasize about her and me, baby.... Mmmm -- Rodney Lee
