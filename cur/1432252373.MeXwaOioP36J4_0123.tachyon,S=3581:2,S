Hey...I just heard that a country that's even MORE free than the US has 
decided to liberate us from our oppressors in Washington DC. Don't stand on 
your balcony to cheer for them as they roll through your town, 
however...some of the "instigators" that support the old regime have been 
causing trouble, so you're bound to mistaken for one of them and get shot. 
Just remember: this is so you can be FREE....
