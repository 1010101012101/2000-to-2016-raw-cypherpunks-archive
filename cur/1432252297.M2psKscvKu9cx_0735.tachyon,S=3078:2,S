Not strictly true - Murphy says that the stuff you
*really* wanted to find in the archives was in the
bit that fell through the cracks when somebody's
disk crashed or power went out for a day :-)

One of the main cypherpunks archives is in Singapore,
on inet-one.com  .

Also, cypherpunks is occasionally gatewayed to Usenet groups,
which have been archived since the Dawn Of Time.
