Yup, Muir's quote hit that too.

It's interesting that pathogens are learning how to bypass their
normal vectors and going straight for the target (HIV and SARS come to
mind).  Plague rode on fleas that rode on rats, and it covered the planet.
SARS rides the host on airplanes and covers the planet a hell of a lot
faster.  Ebola is fortunatly self limiting, but seems to be wiping out all
primates in its zone of influence.  Let's hope that thing doesn't learn a
better vector!

Patience, persistence, truth,
