Not necessarily. 

The difference here is that Bad_Guy is visiting the
country for the first time. Now, there are fewer
questions to ask.

 The idea is Mr.Bad_Guy gives minimal information

Its just that the Bad_Guy should be trained to give
out least information. That way there is no need to
remember hundreds of answers.
