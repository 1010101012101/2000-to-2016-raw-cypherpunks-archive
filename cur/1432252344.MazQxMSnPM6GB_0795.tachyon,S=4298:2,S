Radiative transfer goes as the fourth power of the temperature 
difference between two bodies. The hot object will radiate energy to the 
cooler object roughly as (delta T)^4. When the temperatures are equal, 
radiative transfer is equal in both directions.

Think of "radiance" as being a bit analogous to thermal conductivity. 
Heat transfer still depends on a driving force (temperature difference).

All heat transfer functions have something like this form:

Heat Transfer is proportional to a (power per unit area) x (area) x 
(temperature)^(some exponent)

This is of course the same form Ohm's law takes:

current = voltage/resistance

current = voltage x "conductance"

Here, current plays the role of heat transfer. Voltage is the potential 
difference, or delta T. Conductance plays the role of emissivity, 
radiance, etc.

This is just the very basic flux equation, seen in physics, geology, 
even economics.

The "perpetual motion machine" envisaged would no more work for two 
metals of differing emissivities than such a machine woudl work by 
placing two metals of different conductances together.

Yes, you've got it right.
