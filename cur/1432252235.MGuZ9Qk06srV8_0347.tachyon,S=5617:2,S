If you're going to jump straight in to the real world of real money, yes.

But you can take baby steps, running a service with limited clients and
limited amounts, or with play money. Wasn't that part of the appeal of
MtGox, that it had been running as an exchange for years, before getting
into the BitCoin world? I think the assumption was that they seemed to know
what they were doing, so it was safe enough to use them for trading BTC and
"real" money.

(Note that I never had anything to do with MtGox, or indeed with BitCoin.
This was not so much a matter of crypto paranoia as a matter of mortgage,
three kids, and a wife who won't stop spending.)
