Dear Surveillance Camera Players: My name is Fred B., I am the
President of a Local Union of the American Flint Glass Workers
Union We are in the formidable stages of  a grievance process which is
likely to end at an arbitration hearing, concerning our company installing
Surveillance Equipment.

Is there anything you could do or recommend for us that would
be a show of not only Disgust but also Defiance?

Yours' In Solidarity
Fred
