Agreed. (I will not say "So? We've been saying this for years. See my 
"Four Horseman" point of 1992-3 or so.")

Those who want crypto outlawed have been trumpeting crypto uses by 
terrorists, pedophiles, money launderers, and other thought criminals 
for the past decade.  Nothing very new or interesting in the latest 
round, save that the New Team is now attempting to lay the groundwork 
for New Laws.

Come on, Aimee, do some background reading. The "average American" 
is, and has long been, of two minds:

-- "what have you got to hide?"

and

-- "none of your damned business!"

Both views are present in most Americans. An observation I made here 
nearly a decade ago.

I welcome your participation here, provided you don't rant about the 
list being "estrogen-deficient," but, really, these basic points are 
well-trod ground.

Ah, good to see you recognize the situation.
