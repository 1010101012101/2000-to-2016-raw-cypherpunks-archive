I disagree. An ethical concept can be proven through rhetoric (though it is
a challenge sometimes). Morals, on the other hand, are different. According
to your particular side of the debate about the nature of morals, they
either cannot be proven at all, or they are proven by widespread
internalization and adoption lifespan. But that tends to be a philosopher
vs. theologian argument, and that very fact is why I tend to Choate the
whole thing and say "bullshit" either way.
