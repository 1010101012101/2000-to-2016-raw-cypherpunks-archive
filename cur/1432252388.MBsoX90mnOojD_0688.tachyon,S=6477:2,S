Dave:

	Hiawatha Bray asks "to foil plots like this, what would IPers do?"

	I have an article to be published shortly that tries to address
that.  It's called "Privacy and Information Sharing in the War Against
Terrorism."  Available for free download in essentially-final form at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=899626.

	The article provides a checklist to apply to proposed information
sharing/surveillance programs, and then discusses each item on the
checklist.

	Here is the checklist, FWIW:

Due Diligence Checklist for a Proposed Information Sharing Program

1.  Will the proposed sharing tip off adversaries?
2.  Ends/means rationality.  Does the proposal improve security?
Cost-effectively?
3.  Is the proposal "security theater"?  How much does it provide the
appearance of security?
4.  Are there novel aspects to the proposed surveillance and
sharing?  What
risks, if any, accompany these novel aspects?
5.  Are there relevant lessons from historical instances of abuse?  What
checks and balances would mitigate risks of such abuse?
6.  Do fairness and anti-discrimination concerns reduce the
desirability of
the proposed program?
7.  Are there ways that the proposed measure could make the security
problems worse?
8.  What are the ramifications internationally and with other
stakeholders?
9.  Are there additional, privacy-based harms from the proposed measure?
10.  Will bad publicity undermine the program?

	Thanks,

	Peter

Now that the maniacs have our full attention, I'll ask once more the
question I've asked before:

What should a government do?  How far should it go, to surveil,
arrest and
interrogate the sort of people who'd plan something like this?  It's all
very well to complain of governmental threats to our liberty; indeed,
such
complaints are a vital part of that liberty, so keep 'em coming.  But at
some point, somebody's got to decide what we will do against these
disgusting, murderous fanatics.

And so the question:  To foil plots like these, what would IPers do?

Hi, Dave

regarding the planned attack.

The plan was to bomb the planes via liquid explosives which is the
reason
to forbid taking liquid with you into the plane. Mother's milk has to
be tested by the mother to be taken within the plane
The security fears that any mobile etc. could countain a detonator or
used as one.
