Aloha from Baltimore,

   The protests have been peaceful of late, and actually fairly peaceful 
overall.  The police, however, have not been.  Despite claiming to be 
basically terrified of black people congregating in large groups, 
Baltimore cops killed another unarmed man two days ago.  Earlier this 
week, I got trapped in DC overnight due to the curfew, and last night my 
boyfriend got trapped at my place despite living a block away.  I've got 
video of a hundred or so soldiers marching through the streets near the 
train station as the curfew takes effect (out of hundreds that did so).

   Last night, my kid sister had to come home at 10:10 and it was the 
first time that I've been worried about her safety since she's lived 
with me.  Because she's a minor, the curfew means that she's not even 
legally allowed outside for any reason without me present [0].  Not to 
go to a friend's house, or to grab a cup of coffee, or to volunteer.  
Because I'm her guardian, I of course have given her permission to do 
all of those things because Fuck That Noise [1].  But we're also about 
to make our exit because living under helicopter noise with cops driving 
around in vehicles that have gun turrets on them is not great for the 
psyche, and no kid should have to live in that environment.
