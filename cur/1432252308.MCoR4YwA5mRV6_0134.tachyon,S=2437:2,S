They don't if you're the home owner and it's your home. The law requires
the owner of rental property to have them installed, there is no law that
says the tenents must use them. For example the law does not clarify who
and when the batteries must be changed.

Most of this stuff is regulated by insurance contract and not law (at
least the non-contractual type).
