A hierarchical organization is like a tree.  Hierarchical restructuring 
(as in plan C) results in a different, and hopefully hardier tree. 

Always though, trees can be cut with axes and saws.  

In a fully distributed state, the number of elements that have to 
fail in order to make the system not work is the same as the number 
of elements in the system.  Fully distributed systems (as in plan D)
have the structure of water.  

Water can also be cut with axes and saws, but what's the point?
nothing outside the volume momentarily occupied by the axhead 
or sawblade is thereby changed. 

It is interesting that trees need water, but water does not need 
trees.
