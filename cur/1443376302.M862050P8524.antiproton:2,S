I noticed that (at least!) one media report portrayed this as making VW's l=
ess "green". =C2=A0But from another report, I saw that they had 10% greater=
 gas mileage if they were allowed to cheat. =C2=A0(In other words, less CO2=
 emissions per mile.) =C2=A0Now, the above quote refers to "huge amounts" o=
f NOx. =C2=A0(nitrogen oxides, probably NO and NO2). =C2=A0The question is,=
 for those people who complain about CO2 being a greenhouse gas, what is th=
e relative undesireability of extra CO2 versus extra NOx. =C2=A0Relative ha=
rm, and all that. =C2=A0Which is a concept that people who call themselves =
"environmentalists" seem to have a great deal of difficulty with.
This also raises an idea: =C2=A0I've never heard of this, but what would be=
 wrong with allowing differences in emissions based on location? =C2=A0Putt=
ing a GPS in a car is trivial today. =C2=A0Producing less NOx inside a city=
