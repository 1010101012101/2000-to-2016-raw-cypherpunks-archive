Later this month, the General Services Administration will announce the 
first government agencies to be cross-certified with the federal public-key 
infrastructure bridge, making it easier for agency users to exchange data 
securely.
The federal PKI bridge is designed as a way to link agencies' certificate 
authorities (CAs), which are the central component of a PKI. A CA is the 
server used to generate and manage digital certificates to identify users 
and secure their transactions.
By cross-certifying CAs certificate policies through the bridge, which acts 
as a trusted third party, an agency that needs to accept a certificate from 
another federal agency, and ultimately other non-federal entities, to 
conduct an electronic transaction will know that the certificate can be 
trusted.
On Sept. 18, GSA plans to hold a cross-signing ceremony that will show 
certificates from the Defense Department, the Agriculture Department's 
National Finance Center, NASA and the Treasury Department can interoperate, 
said David Temoshok, acting director for identity policy at GSA's office of 
governmentwide policy.
Those agencies' PKI domains "will be able to cross-certify through the 
bridge" and will be recognized by each other, Temoshok said while attending 
the Interagency Resources Management Conference in Hershey, Pa., this week. 
He added that in 2003, GSA hopes to add Illinois and Canada to that list.
