Amen.

The "worth" of anything is what the market pays for it. Period.

I expect that "reputation" is something very close to "goodwill", which is
a polite accounting fiction to deal with the fact that the calculated
"worth", of an asset as carried on the books of a purchased entity, is less
than what the market paid for it.

Cheers,
RAH
