READY, WILLING AND WORTHY
by Scott Wintrip 

Some time ago I heard a wonderful song by Richard Mekdeci called "Ready,
Willing and Worthy." So struck was I by the title, that I found I could
focus on nothing else for the remainder of the event. I am always on the
lookout for the simple and effective things in work and life. And
"Ready, Willing and Worthy" immediately captured my attention as a
simple and effective tool for exploring and making changes in your
business.

Why Managers Condone Incompetence 

by Terry Petra

There is one thing worse than hiring the wrong person. That is to hang
on to the employee long after the evidence indicates you should let them
go. This is a problem that challenges managers at all levels of the
organizational ladder.

Without getting into a discussion regarding hiring practices, let?s
begin this monograph by simply stating that most managers, at one time
or another, find themselves in a situation where they have an employee
who should be terminated and yet, the manager takes no action. It may be
a problem of unacceptable performance, poor attendance, negative
attitude or lack of congruence between the manager?s primary operating
style and the functional preferences of the employee.

Terry provides insight into this common problem ( click here

How to Identify Quality Search Assignments
By Mike Ramer, CPC
Recruiters from all sectors of the employment industry will relate to
these points

Being able to determine the quality of a search assignment before you
"work it" is more critical today than any time in the past decade. 

What if you were to take on a search assignment that wasn't a quality
one? You could spend weeks, even months, before finding out that: 
1) the position was put on hold, 2) an internal candidate filled the
job, 
3) the company found the choice candidate through another source, 
4) you're really looking for a "needle in a haystack," 
5) the company isn't financially stable and can't pay your fee and/or 
6) another reason spent your valuable time, which could have been used
to work better assignments. 


Mike provides a simple recipe to avoid wastingyour time
