Subject: [liberationtech] Single board mini computers as circumvention tools
X-Mailer: MessagingEngine.com Webmail Interface

Does anyone know of any research being done on the use of low-cost
single board mini computers to run the likes of online circumvention
tools like VPN, Tor, Gibberbot etc

Whilst these boards have been around for sometime, since the
introduction of Rasberry Pi, interest has grown and now there are many
boards are being created like:

ARM Mini PCs

_best_and_the_rest/
http://liliputing.com/2012/06/74-mk802-android-4-0-mini-pc-first-impressions-
video.html

Android OS and other Linux OS appears to run easily on these boards and
allows for use of software from the likes of:
https://guardianproject.info/apps/ and http://www.whispersys.com/ (sadly
now defunct)

Some of these boards are also so cheap as to be disposable single use,
or at least simple reuse after OS/Data erase.

I am looking at how easy it would be to develop and use a Linux OS  that
only runs from the board's ram (LiveCD/USB/SDcard), such as TAILs
<http://tails.boum.org>
