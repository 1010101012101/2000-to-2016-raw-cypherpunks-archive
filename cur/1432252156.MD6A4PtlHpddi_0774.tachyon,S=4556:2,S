DEAR FRIEND,

 I AM MRS. SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
 SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 OF CONGO (DRC). I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS
 LETTER,
 THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT
 CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.

 I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
 KENNETH AND BASHER OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
 CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY
 FAMILY
 AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED TO SETTLED IN
 MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
 DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
 CHANGED MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
 DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO
 OTHER

 FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE
 NEW

 HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT KABILA HAS MADE
 ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
 TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
 HENCE

 MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
 STUDY THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
 LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
 TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE
 HUSBAND'S
 CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE
 FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
 IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED
 AND

 CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF EIGHTEEN
 MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18000,000,00.) WITH
 A

 SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE
 SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE
 CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR
 INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE
 MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO
 THAT
 I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON(KENNEH) WHO HAS THE
 OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
 WANT

 YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL
 NOT
 WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY
 PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND
 TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE
 INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH
 LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
 CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN CONCLUSION,
 IF
 YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE
 PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS
 ARE

 CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.

 FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
 INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
 NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

 BEST REGARDS,

 MRS M. SESE SEKO
