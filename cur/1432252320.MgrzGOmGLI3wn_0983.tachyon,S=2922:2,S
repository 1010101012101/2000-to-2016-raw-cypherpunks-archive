This list is no stranger to Tim May's sarcasm and anti-semitic rants.

>You just used a German word. I'm reporting you to the Zionist League.


>"Remember, children of Israel, "Eretz Israel" is not the same thing 
>as "lebensraum," and the suppression of the ragheads in Eretz Israel 
>is merely pest eradication, not the "Final Solution." War is peace, 
>freedom is slavery, and Zionists are libertarians."
