Fingerprint, photo system at border runs smoothly
 BY JEFFREY GAUTREAUX, STAFF WRITER
 Dec 7, 2004



 SAN LUIS, Ariz. - While it was initially feared that new digital
fingerprint and photograph technology might slow visa issuance at United
States ports of entry, the first day at San Luis showed exactly the
opposite.

 Acting port director William Brooks, of U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, said the new screening technology went live at 6 a.m. Monday
and ran smoothly throughout the morning.

 "One of the best things about it is that it's transparent," Brooks said.

 "It's been a savings of three minutes per person. It's actually sped it up
when there was fear it would be slow."

 The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology, or US-VISIT,
began Nov. 15 with pilot programs in Douglas; Laredo, Texas; and Port
Huron, Mich.

 According to the Department of Homeland Security Web site, US-VISIT
tightens border security by recording the entry and exit of people who are
not U.S. citizens, making sure that visas are used only by the people to
whom they were issued, and checking visitors against government watch lists.

 San Luis, Lukeville and Nogales in Arizona, and Calexico and Andrade in
California began using US-VISIT for the first time on Monday.

 Brooks said the new system was scheduled to be in operation in the 50
busiest ports by the end of this month. He said the San Luis port was in
the "upper portion" of that top 50.

 Most Mexican visitors to the United States who use a border-crossing card
to enter the border zone will not be screened by the system. Brooks said
Customs will process an average of 50 applications per day, and each will
take about five to eight minutes.

 While the technology has improved, the requirements and fees to get a visa
remain the same. The fee is $6, and visitors must establish sovereignty and
residency in their home country, Brooks said.

 Visas issued from different ports of entry entitle the bearer to different
opportunities within the U.S. Temporary visas issued from the San Luis port
allow visitors to travel within 25 miles of the border and stay no longer
than 72 hours. Visas for longer stays with more travel freedom are also
available.

 According to DHS, US-VISIT applies to all visitors (with limited
exemptions) holding nonimmigrant visas, regardless of country of origin.
Visas are required for most students, business travelers - depending on
their length of stay - and millions of other visitors, regardless of where
they live.

 For now, US-VISIT is focused only on those entering the country. However,
Brooks said similar technology is being developed for people who are
exiting the country. This equipment is scheduled for testing in 2005 and
2006.

 Brooks said Customs employees had no trouble getting used to the new "user
friendly" system. Four sets of digital cameras and fingerprint scanners are
placed right on the counter, so pictures and scans can be taken right
there, rather than having applicants have to go through a single line.

 Visas can be swiped through a card reader, so all of the information about
its holder comes up on the computer instantly. Brooks said this is why the
system can work more quickly than the old process, which relied heavily on
writing by hand.

 Brooks declined to identify what kinds of databases are searched when
people have their fingerprints scanned.

 "It checks various databases that are available to us for derogatory
information," he said.

 The digital cameras, fingerprint scanners and printers are all brand-new.
Brooks said the computer workstations had recently been upgraded, and there
are plans to redesign the counter area.

 After 21 years with Customs, Brooks said the US-VISIT technology was
another improvement on a long list of amazing changes.

 "The technology has grown by leaps and bounds," he said. "And now it goes
even faster."
