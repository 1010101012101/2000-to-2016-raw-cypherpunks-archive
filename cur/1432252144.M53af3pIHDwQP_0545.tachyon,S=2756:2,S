Oh yeah...that's nice and simple. 'Obvious', I guess.
it has the nice feature too of being relatively subversion-proof, insofar as 
someone (or even many people) penetrating the group can not really influence 
the outcome. Meanwhile, there's no real external routine to trust (ie, you 
can check what everyone else promised and what their secret value was and 
what the modulo-math should be). So it's all verifiable without a 'higher 
authority'.
Nice.

Do such applications actually exist?
