Yes, there should be a lot of noise in the image, some
way or the other. If you reduce the amount of info you
want to send per image, the lesser the chances that it
be detected. Once you detect and recover the entire
information, decrypting it by some cryptalysis
technique is another nearly impossible task. The whole
thing appears to do with politics. Anyway,a lot of
research grants would be spend for stegano detection,
which is particlarly good for the community.

Sarad.
