Please speak for yourself. As a student and friend of liberty, I am a
libertarian ESPECIALLY in times of stress, when the befogged and weak
are tempted to surrender their freedom.

The two are not separable - the latter is in fact a corollary of the
former - so the order in which they are stated is irrelevant. Human
life, as opposed to the organic existence of cattle in a feedlot,
implies liberty.
