This is not TV, Sandy. Or a public school, or politically correct
town meeting.

I, for one, enjoy JYA postings. It takes some intelligence  to twist
the tongue in the right way and also to understand the implied. It is
fun, since thought process is revealed and much more info conveyed.

It is called "language", and although 200-word pigeon english
seems to be the standard these days, it doesnt mean that there are no
sentient beings around that do not feel obliged to run the speech center
in "lite" mode.

Dont look around. Spontaneous group leering will not help you.

Perhaps this is too complicated for you.

Let me simplify:

Even if "everyone" programs in visual basic, there is still beauty,
style and efficiency to be done in C or assembly. And there are things
which cannot be done in VB.

You seem to exhibit standard american "culture" conditioning that denigrates
everything which is not immediately understandable by complete idiots.

Like genital action, for example. I understand that that is your expertise.
