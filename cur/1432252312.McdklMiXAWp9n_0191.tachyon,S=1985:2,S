The cypherpunks and coderpunks lists just received spam from
"Betty Hill" saying you've just been sent $200.  

	Simply click 
	<a
href=http://paypalregistration.cjb.net/>http://www.PayPal.com/links/uni</a> 
	and complete the one-page registration form to claim your money. 

CJB.net is a free URL redirection service - it would have pointed off
to somewhere (presumably a moving target) to snarf up some Paypal
account information and any other data it could.
The anonymizer couldn't display it, either because it's closed down
or just one of those things that the Anonymizer can't grok,
but it is an interesting scam.
				Thanks!
