Funny thing about the 14th, the representatives of the Southern States (who 
had previously been sworn in and seated for the session) didn't get to vote 
on it.  They were ejected and the doors barred (the Senate even barred a 
New Jersey rep. who held the deciding vote and was strongly opposed to the 
measure).  They then reported that the majority (of those in the room) 
approved the measure, which was sent on to the states for ratification.  A 
similar travesty played out in the counting of ratifying states and 
reporting out the results.  When challenged in the Supreme Court the robed 
ones punted, saying it was a "political matter for Congress to 
decide".  Thus spake Tyranny.

Most all current federal authority rests on the 14th and the unwarranted 
expansion of the Commerce Clause (Wilkert v. Filburn) after FDR and 
Congress threatened to pack the bench with additional justices in order to 
pass unconstitutional New Deal legislation.
