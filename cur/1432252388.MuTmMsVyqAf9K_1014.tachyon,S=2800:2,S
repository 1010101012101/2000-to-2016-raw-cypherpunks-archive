Subject: [Politech] Bush administration appeals loss in NSA/ATT case to 9th
	Circuit [priv]
User-Agent: Thunderbird 1.5.0.5 (Macintosh/20060719)

On Monday the Bush administration appealed its loss in the AT&T/NSA
wiretapping case to the 9th Circuit. U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker
had ruled on July 20 that EFF's case alleging illegal cooperation with
the NSA could proceed.

I've placed some of the briefs filed today online here:

http://www.politechbot.com/docs/eff.nsa.073106.pdf
http://www.politechbot.com/docs/att.brief.073106.pdf

And a writeup:

Also on a personal note, CNET News.com and the California First
Amendment Coalition won permission from Walker today to file an amicus
brief. For background on that point:
