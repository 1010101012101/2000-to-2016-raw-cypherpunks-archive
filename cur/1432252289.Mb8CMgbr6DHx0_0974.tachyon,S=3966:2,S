That's true, but I do not think it means what you think it means. 

To start with, james, who is not nearly as famous for his crimes as the 
nazis are for theirs,  can be assumed not to have committed nearly as 
many atrocities as the nazis.  Murders on one side -- six million 
(est.)  Murders on the other side -- unknown, but I'm pretty sure we'd 
have heard about someone who committed more than a few hundred.  The 
logic as presented flawlessly distinguishes the evil ones in this case. 

The fact that each side can say the same things about the others is 
beside the point.  I can say that pigs fly, and I can say that birds 
fly.  On a pure logical level, these two statements are identical. 
Hence the only possible conclusion is that they're both wrong?  Uh, 
no.  The only possible conclusion is that it's necessary to observe 
pigs and birds and *see* which statement, if any, is true.
