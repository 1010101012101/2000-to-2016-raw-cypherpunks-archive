The thread originated from a concern of someone planning to put up a
remailer over legal responsibility and related costs. If in fact reducing
this cost is a prerequisite to a growing infrastructure of remailers, I
would say the remailers should definitely be doing just that. It's not
so very different from running a middleman.
