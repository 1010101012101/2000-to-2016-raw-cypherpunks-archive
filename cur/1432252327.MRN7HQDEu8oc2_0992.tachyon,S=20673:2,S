"AS SEEN ON NATIONAL T.V."

Thank you for your time and Interest.


This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.

Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major nightly
news
program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the
program
described below, to see if it really can make people money.

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their
findings proved once and for all that there are, absolutely no laws
prohibiting the participation in the program. This has helped to
show
people that this is a simple, harmless and fun way to make some extra
money
at home.

The results of this show has been truly remarkable. So many people
are
participating that those involved are doing, much better than ever
before.
Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very
exciting
to be a part of this lately. You will understand once you experience
it.

"HERE IT IS BELOW"

_________________________________________________________________________

*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***

The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a
look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment and the
income
return is TREMENDOUS!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $46,000 in less than 6 months!
Please
read the enclosed program...THEN READ IT AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY. It does not
require
you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of
all, 
you never have to leave the house except to get the mail. If you
believe
that someday you'll get that big break that you've been waiting
for, THIS
IS IT! Simply follow the instructions, and your dreams will come
true.


This multi-level e-mail order marketing program works
perfectly...100%
EVERY TIME. E-mail is the sales tool of the future. Take advantage of
this 
non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!! The longer you wait,
the
more people will be doing business using e-mail. Get your piece of
this
action!!!


MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is
being
taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and
the
Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods
and
services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to
late
1990's.


This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000
millionaires
in the WORLD, 20% ( 700,000) made their fortune in the last several
years
in MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people become
millionaires
everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.


You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald
Trump (A
MULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would
do if
he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without
hesitating,
Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to
work.
The audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and
dead-panned his response "That's why I'm sitting up here and you
are all
sitting out there!"


With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions
from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by
people you
introduce to the business.


Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time
or
money once and getting paid again and again and again. In network
marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others.


This program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different
countries across the world.


The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing
invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who
never
had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of
the
poor. As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET
POORER."
The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to
"move up"
or "get rich", inflation will see to that.

You have just received INF0RMATION that can give you financial
freedom for
the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT."
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever
imagined.


Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It
works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of
this
exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you
send
this to may send out 100,000 or more...and your name will be on
everyone of
them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers
you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials
and
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

"THINK ABOUT IT"

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did,
take a
little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and
figure
out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst
possible
response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a
lot of
money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have
will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS!


HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$

INSTRUCTIONS:

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that
you could use up to $46,000 or more in the next 6 months. Before you
say
"BULL... ", please read this program carefully. This is not a chain
letter,
but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is
what you
do: 

As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by
recruiting new
 partners and selling our products. Because of the global nature of
the
internet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business
partners
from all over the world, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar
sent. YOUR
ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved
in
personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or
office. 
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere.

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below
(you can't sell them if you don't order them).

a. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT
YOU
ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in
case
of a problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to
the
report.

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY
MAIL
PROBLEMS!

b. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports.
You will need all five reports so that you can save them on your
computer
and resell them.

c. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to
send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to
each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than
is
instructed below in steps "a" through "g" or you will lose out on
the
majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you'll
also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method
has
been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

a. Look below for the listing of available reports.

b. After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement
and
REM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made
it
through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $46,000! Also,
change the
name of the company, the address, and the REM0VE e-mail address on
the  top
of this document to your own.

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.

f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

g. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and
save
it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of
this
letter.

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you
can
afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet connection and
e-mail
is FREE!

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports
you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing INF0RMATION
which
includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free
classified ads and much, much more.


There are two primary methods of building your downline:

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and
we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs
each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.3% response. Using a
good
list the response could be much better. Also, many people will send
out
hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing
with
this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.3% response,
that
is only 6 orders for REPORT #1. Those 6 people respond by sending out
2,000
programs each for a total of 12,000. Out of those 0.3%, 36 people
respond
and order REPORT #2. Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs each for a
total of
72,000. The 0.3% response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3. Those
216
send out 2,000 programs each for a 432,000 total. The 0.3% response
to that
is 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. Those 1,296 send out 2,000 programs
each for
a 2,592,000 total. The 0.3% response to that is 7,776 orders for
REPORT #5.


That's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this
example is
$30 + $180 + $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!!

REMEMBER DEAR READER, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO
THINK
FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT
100,000
PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000.

Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your
cost
to participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already
have
an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!

REPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing,
tell you
where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail
lists
and show you how to send out 1,000,000 e-mails for free.

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

1. Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there
are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start
small
just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 6
people to
participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the
internet
will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in
YOUR
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline members. Follow this example to
achieve
the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 6 members with $5 ($5 x
6)........................$30
2nd level--6 members from those 6 ($5 x 36)....................$180
3rd level--6 members from those 36 ($5 x 216)............ $1,080
4th level--6 members from those 216 ($5 x 1,296)....... $6,480
5th level-6 members from those 1,296 ($5 x 7,776)... $38,880
..................................................$46,650
_________________________________________________________________________


Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only
recruit
6 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20
people
to participate! Many people will get 100's of participants!
THINK ABOUT IT!

For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
report they
ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!
This
will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and
address on
it, will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive
the
report!

and follow the directions accurately.

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have
them when the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report.

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.


* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks
later
you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't,
continue
advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN
RELAX,
because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue
to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in
front of
a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching
which
report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more
income,
send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole
process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from
