Think about it.

You have lost me, I have no idea why you think what you are  
talking about might be relevant to my assertion.

The TPM has its own secret key, it makes the corresponding public 
key widely available to everyone, and its own internal good known
time.  So  when your customer's payment goes through, you then
send him a  copy of your stuff encrypted to his TPM, a copy which
only his TPM  can make use of.  Your code, which the TPM decrypts
and executes,  looks at the known good time, and if the user is
out of time, refuses to play.
