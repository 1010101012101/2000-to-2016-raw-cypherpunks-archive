"Anonymizer.com Launches 'Operation Safe Investigation' to
Help Law Enforcement and Journalism Professionals Maintain
Anonymity and Safety Online"
PRNewswire (09/06/01)
NLECTC Law Enforcement & Corrections Technology News Summary
Thursday, September 13, 2001
...
Anonymizer.com just debuted its "Operation Safe
Investigation" program to protect the identities of law
enforcement agents and journalists conducting investigations
via the Internet. Under the program, the company will
allocate as many as 25 user licenses for its Anonymous
Surfing service. Accounts remain active for a period of
three months, but participants will receive an option to
continue using the licenses at a reduced cost in the future.
Law enforcement officials require anonymity to conduct
investigations about the activities of Web surfers suspected
of criminal activities and for accessing certain Web sites
that show different Web pages based on a user's identity. In
addition to allowing investigators to effectively conceal
their identities, the service provides protection from
various security and privacy threats found on the Web.
