You overestimate the subtlety and sophistication of the feds. 
Whether Aimee is a fed or not, her quite genuine ignorance made 
her incapable of knowing what views sounded cypherpunkish, and 
what views sounded violently anti cypherpunkish.  If she is a 
fed, she probably also goes around buying crack and pretending to 
be a thirteen year old interested in sex talk.  And if the feds 
were to assign a fed to our list, that is the kind of fed they 
would assign.  That is all they have. 

When the feds were infiltrating the militias, their agents stuck
out like dogs balls.
