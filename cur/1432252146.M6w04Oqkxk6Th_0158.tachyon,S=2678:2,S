"The proposal comes from Alex Stamos of research firm iSec Partners, and 
would appoint Artemis Internet as the gatekeeper of .secure. Artemis would 
require registered domains to encrypt all web and email traffic (except for 
HTTP redirects funneling connections towards the appropriate TLS-encrypted 
site), use DNSSEC, and deploy DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) for spam 
prevention. In addition, Artemis would employ a rigorous screening process to 
verify registrants' identities (including reviewing articles of incorporation 
and human interviews), and routinely conduct security scans of registered 
sites. The venture has $9.6 million (US) in funding provided by Artemis'
parent company NCC Group, a UK-based IT security firm."
