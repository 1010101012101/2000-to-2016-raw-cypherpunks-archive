Not being subscribed to cypherpunks (has S/R improved?) I will have

:-) Certainly not. AFAIK, RAH has always used "geodesic" in conjuction
with "settlement", which clearly says to me that he's talking about the
quickest/easiest way to do money transfer. You may, or may not, achieve
that with distributed systems, but so what?

And, to hit relativity, for completeness, geodesic in that sense is
about figuring out curvature. That is, knowing all geodesics tells you
the shape of space-time. And, natch, light follows geodesics, which is
the glue that holds it all together (and brings in your non-instaneous
transfer, too, but again, that is neither a consequence of, nor a
requirement for, geodesics).

I'm taking the fifth on that one.

Like, yeah, daddy-o.

Cheers,
