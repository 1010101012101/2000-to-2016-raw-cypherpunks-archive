It's ironic that a neo-Calvinist Nietzschean would give a damn what people
think of him one way or the other. Must be an alpha baboon thing.

And for the record, my reference to the MMPI was nothing more than a passing
comment until you replied and got me interested me in elaborating on it. Though
I'll admit I never should have bothered responding to the thread in the first
place, anyone who thinks it ought to die a natural death should for god's sake
quit prolonging it.


>I didn't take issue with your posts about guns, did I?

No, but only because it suited you. The alpha giveth a banana and the alpha
taketh away...

I have been. Though somehow I never felt the need to generate and churn
unnecessary posts to "prove" it. I also don't do "me too" posts; or delight in
shooting fish in a barrel by pointing out incorrigible idiots' idiocy, etc. It's
not as if my tiny handful of posts each week is anything a filter file couldn't
cure.

One wonders why you aren't drawing a bead on the high-volume, high-profile
nuisances instead. Er, I mean, so to speak, that is.


>Your stories about living as a homeless person but now being paid to
>surf the Net (you say)

Quite a convenient troll you have there. Not bad. If there's one thing that can
get to a person who came from shitty circumstances and bettered themseves
through intelligence, cunning and sheer strength of will alone, it's has to be
something along those lines.

(Did you catch that? Any unimaginative dimwit flunky out there looking to score
ass-kiss beta brownie points by baiting me really should be taking notes.)

But I would like to take this opportunity to say that if it makes any of you
feel better to think I'm paid to surf the net or work as a Special Agent to spy
on you or whatever else you happen to cook up in one of your more colorful
delusional/alcohol-soaked moments, be my guest. You're on the wrong track and
it's win-win all the way: your wasting time is its own reward.

But if I'm really as uninteresting as all that, why anyone would bother is less
than self-evident.


>may be fodder for Oprah's Online Chat Room ("You
>go, girl!"), but this is not that forum.

If you didn't know I'm a woman you wouldn't have taken them that way.
