Look into what's inside OS X, which is what I run. A lot of FreeBSD, 
some Mach, etc. However, I don't kid myself that keystroke loggers for 
Macs, which I have bought myself for my own use (some years ago) won't 
be carried by spooks doing sneak and peak entries.

One approach is to use a removable hard disk, or a PC Card (PCMCIA) to 
handle the PGP keys and buffers. The new flash-based USB dongles, a la 
"PEN," look intriguing. Carry it around your neck and only insert it 
long enough to get the needed passphrases and private keys off it.

A technical question for anyone: If I store passphrases (and keys, for 
extra security) on a flash-based USB drive dongle, and then use 
cut-and-paste to access them and paste them into PGP, is it possible for 
a keystroke logger to see them? In the Mac at least, pasting from a file 
or from the clipboard does not of course go through the keyboard. So a 
straightforward intercept of the keyboard driver at the BIOS level 
should not see the pasted material. I realize that "keystroke logger" 
can mean more than just logging the keyboard, however.

Some of you might have already looked into this and may have some data 
points.

It seems to me that the older type of keystroke logger (history file in 
Unix, Ghostwriter, etc.) can be defeated thusly.

Selecting letters with a mouse on the screen also bypasses the keyboard.

The question is, are "keystroke loggers" actually doing more than 
keystroke logging. Are they, for example, monitoring all screen I/O 
(seems unlikely, for bandwidth reasons).

That's cool. Just don't support laws affecting my decisions.
