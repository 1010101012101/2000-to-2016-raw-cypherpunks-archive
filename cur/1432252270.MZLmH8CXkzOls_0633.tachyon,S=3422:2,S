It looks like the extra 3 hours did the job in the Democrat-heavy 
precincts. The dead man, Mel Carnahan, has narrowly edged-out John 
Ashcroft.

By the way, none of the news services I can find are reporting the 
"overturning" of this extension some have reported here...anyone have 
solid dope on this heavily-doped race?

I know the Democrat criminal Richard Daley rigged it so that dead 
people would vote for the criminal JFK (terminated with extreme 
prejudice a few years later), but now we have the spectacle of 
Democrat criminals keeping the voting booths longer in Democrat zones 
so that a dead man could _win_.
