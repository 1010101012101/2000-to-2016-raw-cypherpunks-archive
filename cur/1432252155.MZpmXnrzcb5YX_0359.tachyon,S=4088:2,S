NEW YORK — The New York Civil Liberties Union sued the city this week, 
saying police were unjustly making arrests to enforce an unconstitutional 
state law meant to stop people from mailing annoying or alarming materials.

MADISON, Wis. — A federal judge ruled on Aug. 20 that a prison inmate can 
sue the state Department of Corrections because guards wouldn't let him 
wear a Wiccan necklace.
Michael Grindemann, an inmate at the Kettle Moraine Correctional 
Institution in Plymouth, said in a complaint that the Corrections 
Department violated his First Amendment rights by denying him a pentacle — 
a five-pointed star also known as a pentagram.
