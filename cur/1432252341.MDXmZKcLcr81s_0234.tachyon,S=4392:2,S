Nonsense. What "political science" do you think was stopping Ford or 
Honda or Volvo or GM from introducing a hydrogen fuel cell car by 1980?

Do you think it was the lack of hydrogen storage technology? Not a Poly 
Sci problem.

Do you think it was the lack of methane fuel at filling stations? Not a 
Poly Sci problem.

Do you think it was the very high cost of fuel cell vehicles even today 
(in prototype form) compared to  conventional fuel vehicles? Not a Poly 
Sci problem.

And so on, for H2 storage tanks, reformers, etc.

You are generally free to develop your idea of a fuel cell vehicle and 
to then try to sell it to customers, modulo some minor issues of safety 
tests, etc.

Don't let weird ideological ideas get in the way of being able to 
evaluate technologies objectively. "Careful with that axe to grind, 
Eugene."
