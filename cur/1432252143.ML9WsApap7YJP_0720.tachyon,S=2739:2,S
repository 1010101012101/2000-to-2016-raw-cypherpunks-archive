It's a fairly simple process really.

1) read about many types
2) choose one
3) get the materials
4) make it
5) turn the material in to your watch commander
6) blame everyone that you found to be of assistance during your project
of providing material assistance to terrorists

#6 is all too likely to be true because some terrorists wear uniforms
and some hold public office.
