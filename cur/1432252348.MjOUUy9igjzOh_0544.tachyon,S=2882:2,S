e'd like to remind those of you planning to attend this year's event that
CodeCon is fast approaching.

CodeCon is the premier event in 2005 for application developer community.
It is a workshop for developers of real-world applications with working
code and active development projects.

Past presentations at CodeCon have included the file distribution software
BitTorrent; the Peek-A-Booty anti-censorship application; the email
encryption system PGP Universal; and Audacity, a powerful audio editing
tool.

Some of this year's highlights include Off-The-Record Messaging, a
privacy-enhancing encryption protocol for instant-message systems;
SciTools, a web-based toolkit for genetic design and analysis; and
Incoherence, a novel stereo sound visualization tool.

CodeCon registration is discounted this year:  $80 for cash at the door
registrations. Registration will be available every day of the conference,
though ticket are limited, and attendees are encouraged to register on the
first day to secure admission.

CodeCon will be held February 11-13, noon-6pm, at Club NV (525 Howard
Street) in San Francisco.
