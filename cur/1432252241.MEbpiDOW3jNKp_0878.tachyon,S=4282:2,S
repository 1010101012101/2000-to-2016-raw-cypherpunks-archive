Johns Hopkins University censored this exact blog post by Prof. Green,
because of a complaint from its local defense contractor affiliated
with NSA, the Applied Physics Laboratory
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Physics_Laboratory).

The university gets slight credit for backtracking one day after the
censorship story hit Twitter and the press.  So the blog post is now
back (and is still worth reading).

Here's the story:

  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/10/nsa-matthew-green-takedown-blog-post-johns-hopkins
  http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130909/11193024453/johns-hopkins-tells-security-researcher-to-remove-blog-post-about-nsa-encryption-attacks-university-server.shtml
  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/crypto-prof-asked-to-remove-nsa-related-blog-post/
  http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/a-note-on-nsa-future-and-fixing-mistakes.html

Now, why is it that so many folks with links to NSA think like
totalitarians?  It's wonderful seeing them crawl out of the woodwork
and try to give orders to the public about what it is allowed to
think, what it is allowed to read, and what it is allowed to write.
It's only wonderful because the huge public counter-reaction protects
us -- the totalitarians reveal their true colors, but they don't
actually get to tell us what to do.  Thank you, fellow denizens of the
world, for creating your own freedom, by making a lot of noise when
some NSA-affiliated idiot tries to take it away.

	John

PS: How much NSA tax money does JHU's Applied Physics Lab get?  I don't
know, but here's a guy on LinkedIn who worked at NSA in the past,
works at the Lab today, and brags that he's managing a $120M contract
from NSA:
