Huh?  Voters don't control the security of the voting system any more
than we control the security of the credit rating/id theft system.
And similarly, your choice to not play doesn't protect you.  Tim's
idea of using the voting system's security to accelerate the
de-legitimization of the system is a fine one, although it has the
risk that the statists will get awfully violent as we try to ignore
them out of existance.  I don't see how an absentee ballot is going to
make anything any better.
