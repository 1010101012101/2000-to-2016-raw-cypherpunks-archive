Theory: In-Q-Tel funds - pushing the envelope means having opportunity to
fund more stuff that breaks the new, harder stuff. Some opponents use the
harder stuff already, it's just harder to fund if it's not widespread.

The article reaches a bit in drawing conclusions, and offers little
support. The picture painted is of a coherent judicial system - the
opposite is true, each state even municipality treats the novel application
of surveillance technology differently, holds different standards for
'public / private' and when, where and how you can expect privacy. Notable
are the ways different courts treat cases of indecent exposure, when that
exposure occurs on 'private property' (such as in an open window).

The point illustrated, though, is valid - some clarity around what
constitutes a 'search' beyond 'privacy mores in vogue' needs to be provided
and codified, otherwise the US risks allowing widespread complacency to
further continue the erosion of privacy.
