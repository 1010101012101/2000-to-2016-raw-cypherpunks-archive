A nit on a nit: This is ~300% tax, not ~400%. Consider: 10 pounds worth
(to the refiner/dealer) of petrol yeilds s the British government about 30 
pounds of taxes. ie, 300% of the cost of the item.

It's still mind-boggling that a nominally free people will put up with this
kind
of organized theft.
