Mr. Brito may be right that such a restricted national ID card might be 
legal but so what?  The skill these terrorists used in creating their 
identities shows that they would not likely have been caught even under his 
suggested system. Another case of reducing liberty with only the appearance 
of improvement in safety.  A bad bargain even if it worked.

Also, the breadth of the application of the Interstate Commerce Clause 
since its growth spurt in the '30s is staggering and very troublesome. I 
can't find much historical justification for it in the writings of the 
framers (can anyone on the list?). Its reached the point where almost any 
economic (and many non-economic) activities come under the ICC.  Its become 
the source of most of Congresss' power and they know it.  Only recently has 
the SC begun to issuing a more narrow interpretation (bully for them), but 
its still too broad and I find any expansion under it to be resisted 
wherever possible.

The creation of yet another, even more intrusive, federal data base which 
(if recent events serve as an example) can be abused by those in authority 
is to be avoided at all cost.

If the U.S. Consulates and INS had not fumbled the ball on admitting and 
tracking those legally admitted it might have raised the bar considerably 
on domestic terrorism from these sources.  But now a heard of zombies are 
roaming free among us and we may never know the true extent to which we 
were exposed by those inept guardians of our safety.
