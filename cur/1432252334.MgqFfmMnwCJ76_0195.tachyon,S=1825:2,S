That 'publicity' may be easier to come by than you think.  I migrated to my 
present domain from a much older one just 4 months ago.  Now, a quick check 
of my spam folder shows that fully 5% of the received spam is directed to the 
new domain address.  Considering that the old domain had a 7-year history, 
I'd say the harvest bots are working harder than one might otherwise think.
