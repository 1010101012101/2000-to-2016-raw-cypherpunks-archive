Hi, we are looking for an ISP that will host our websites that are promoted via spam mail.

We will pay very good money for the trouble of dealing with the spam complaints and keeping us online as long as possible.

If you can provide that kind of service or know someone, please email me at host_seeker@hotmail.com

Thanks.
