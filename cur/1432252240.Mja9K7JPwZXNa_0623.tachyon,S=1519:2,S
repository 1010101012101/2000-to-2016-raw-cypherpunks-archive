Great film, source of one of my favourite movie quotes:

  Have you ever noticed that in the Bible whenever God needed to punish
  someone, when God needed a killing, he sent an angel?  Can you imagine what
  a creature like that must be like?  Your entire existence spent praising
  God, but always with one wing dipped in blood.  Would you ever really want
  to *meet* an angel?"

(so much deeper than "I'll be back").

Peter.
