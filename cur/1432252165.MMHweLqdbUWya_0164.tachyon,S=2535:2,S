Is that sort of like documented immigrants (not undocumented _citizens_
like Mexicans who live within earshot of the border, speak no english,
pay no taxes, and think they're part of Aztlan - perhaps there's an
analog to this class of _citizens_ in China; I'm no expert on politics
in East Asia) who are being jailed and kicked out of the United States,
also for just about no good reason at all?
