But the opposite will also get you in trouble -
if you allow certain plants to grow on your property,
numerous federal agencies will _also_ be very, very angry :-)
And if you try to argue that *you're* not growing the plants,
the plants are doing the growing themselves,
they'll bust you for aiding and abetting plants...
