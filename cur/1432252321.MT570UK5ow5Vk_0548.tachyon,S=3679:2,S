Seems that'd be about as hard as breaking your stash into possibly thousands of
random sub $casual amount pots and shuffling/washing them about would be.
Though both are possible does anyone bother? The problem for large balances
is even more... spottable reconvergence of the amount on the other side. You'd
need to close out at the thousands stage post wash instead of reconverging.
It might help if there were a few large essentially free random washing
machines operating in the anonymous space to encourage all transactions
to be scrambled and swapped. Localbitcoin equivalents might be the only real
in/out points available for such things and even that's not always perfect.
