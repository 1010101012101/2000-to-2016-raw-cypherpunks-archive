You're a townie then?  If it's like NZ, pretty much every farm in the country
has (or had) one or more rifles, typically a .303 because they were cheap and
a .22 for dealing with rabbit infestations (they're mostly useless against
possums, another major plague).  Also, the fact that you don't see them
doesn't say anything about whether they're there or not.  At the time of the
gun grab, a friend of mine who lived in Queensland and was doing some work on
his house found it more or less impossible to buy PVC fittings of particular
sizes and types, the explanation being that the stocks had been drained by
people using them to sequester their firearms.  So they may have managed to
destroy large numbers of firearms, but they also drove large numbers off the
books and underground (literally, in many cases).

Peter.
