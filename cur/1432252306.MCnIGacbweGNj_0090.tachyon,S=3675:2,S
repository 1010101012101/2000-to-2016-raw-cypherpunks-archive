BEC ON A CHIP.  First it was neutral atoms guided along a wire
(Update 416).  Then it was a beam of atoms steered over the surface
of a microchip (Update 486).  Now the latest feat of atom optics,
performed by a group at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, is the
creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of rubidium atoms in a
microscopic magnetic trap built into a lithographically patterned
chip.  Not only was this the fastest-formed BEC (it took only 700 ms
to form, faster even than the all-optical BEC method reporter earlier
this year see Update 545) but the condensate can be maneuvered
around the microchip a few microns above the surface (see Update
516); in fact the condensate was moved a distance of 1.6 mm.  This
capability opens up the possibility of numerous atomtronic
applications in interferometry, quantum computing, navigation,
lithography, holography, and entanglement experiments.  (Hansel et
al., Nature, 4 October 2001.)
