passed Feb. 14, as it weighs the privacy implications of the new
technology.

FAA acting chief Michael Huertabs letter to members of the Congressional
Unmanned Systems Caucus marked the first time the agency has said it would
consider privacy issues related to commercial and other non-military
drones, though those concerns have been broadly raised elsewhere.

*Push for more drones in U.S. raises questions
*

The federal government is rushing to open America's skies to tens of
thousands of drones b pushed to do so by a law championed by manufacturers
of the unmanned aircraft.

Yet questions remain about their potential to invade privacy and about
their reliability, as two incidents on the U.S.-Mexico border demonstrate.

The drone makers have sought congressional help to speed their entry into a
domestic market valued in billions of dollars.

The 60-member House of Representatives' bdrone caucusb b including the
co-chairman, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo b has helped push that agenda.
Over the past four years, caucus members have drawn nearly $8 million in
drone-related campaign contributions, an investigation by Hearst Newspapers
and the Center for Responsive Politics shows.
