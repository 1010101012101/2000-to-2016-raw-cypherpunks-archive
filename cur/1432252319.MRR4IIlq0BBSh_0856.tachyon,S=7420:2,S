Indeed, the Pirates are seriously punching above their weight in terms 
of influence in EU. So much so that the other "mainstream" parties have 
started adopting pirate policies to greater/lesser extents; this 
actually lead to a drop in pirate votes, but on balance it's a good sign.

Now, Julia Reda is in charge of the draft proposals for copyright reform 
in the EU. They put a pirate in charge of that. And, she's done broad 
consultations through net and otherwise, she's publicised every visit 
from lobbyists, and she's released an evidence-heavy report with 
recommendations for serious reform; not the hardcore pirate outcome, but 
something no other kind of EU politician would have come out with.

Amelia and Julia are rockstars. I've been waiting and poking for a 
Pirate Party in Ireland to form so I can try and send more quality MEPs 
over to Brussels but we always lag behind on my island. :)
