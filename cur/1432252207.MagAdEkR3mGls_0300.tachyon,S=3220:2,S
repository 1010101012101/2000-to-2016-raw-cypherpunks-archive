	You guys miss the point... you don't have to deal with stretched
examples of wires as storage devices ...  I doubt there is a single
router or switch which does not clock incoming packets into various
intermediate storage registers, stuff them temporarily into RAM and/or
FIFOs, and otherwise store traffic.   Nobody builds flow through
asynchronous systems of that complexity, if for no other reason than
that outgoing traffic has to be queued for delivery.

	In fact virtually every networking technology and virtually
every digital telephone technology stores the stream of samples,
packets, vocoder frames and so forth internally for various lengths of
time, often up to many seconds under the right circumstances.

	And essentially every design for a digital interface on the
planet clocks bits one by one into holding flip flops, so viewed at the
nanosecond clock tick by clock tick level the data is sitting there in
storage even for devices that don't store whole packets, frames or
messages.  Shut off the clock and the data will sit there forever
(plus or minus dynamic refresh issues).

	Thus unless the law changes, you are quite right - wiretapping
virtually anything in digital format - at least by copying it from a
storage device such as a latch inside the communications equipment that
properly carries the traffic - is perfectly legal without exception
under this absurd ruling.
