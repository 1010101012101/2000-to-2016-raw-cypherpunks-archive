Yes, you did.
Or are you now saying that what you said and what you meant are not one
and the same?

Too many things have gone away under the banner of "saving the children"
and there are many more things on the chopping block, either with that,
or with some similar FUD as the overarching mantra keeping them there.

Do you deny that you presented criminal use of technology as a vehicle
leading to and excuse for the dismantling of that technology?  I'm saying
that the technology should be maintained even though the potential for
abuse exists, instead of being all touchy-feely about it dismantling it
because the potential for abuse exists.  I don't want a nerfy world with
big brother or big sister making everything warm, friendly and safe.

And what is that smiley on the end all about?

Which says nothing about ducks not passing for pilgrims.
