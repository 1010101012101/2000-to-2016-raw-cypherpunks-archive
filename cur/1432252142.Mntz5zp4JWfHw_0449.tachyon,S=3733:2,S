This is a stupid question but as I'm not a biologist, I'll ask it anyway and risk
looking foolish...

Would it help to microwave your mail if you don't know where it came from and you're sure it doesn't contain an objects?  i.e. it's
not a CD you've ordered from Amazon. :)

Do anthrax spores get cooked enough by microwaves to be killed, or are they too dry in spore form to be nuked?

Of course, if we start mass nuking our mail, the terrorists might mail us something that would explode when nuked... still, for now
it's a question to ask.
