Hasn't the cellphone evolved into a personal body chip more
identified with a user than email. Built-in tracking, recording,
surveilling, archiving, linking ubiquitously to a person's manifold
associates and activities, portable, unwired, often in multiple
versions, well beyond what computers do to 1984 an inmate.

These gadgets are expected to be reduced to the size of a
gnat, or much smaller, and will come attached to skin and 
clothing in order to command and access whatever a person
needs to interface with other persons, food, housing, transport,
6 feet under.

A nascent urge becomes a signal sent and the first ack is 
to Central Base to finish the thought for you and scratches 
your dandruff, assays its components and reminds you to
buy ABC shampoo within one hour at these imaginary 
locations or it will be glopped at next bathe.

Lay on the floor, don't move, not necessary, day dream and
all will come true. You will live about ten minutes or less 
then replaced automatically with a hot new ver. which will
be your self as dreamed by Central.

An idle dream question is who will you, everybody, resemble? 
An electronic datapoint, quadrillion vibrating self-pleasurably
forever. In short, a sun for a while then its opposite composed
of all the EM ever once emanated.

This is Your Rapture.
