In adopting the black outfit the Black Bloc has made themselves easier
to single out.

What about doing something a little more sophisticated like, say,
everyone wears jeans and sneakers and rolls a die to choose :

Baseball cap, bandana, t-shirt color.

Limit the garb to a small set of colors. red white blue green yellow
black

If it becomes clear that automated techniques are being used to study
regions of an image, up the list of colors.

Wear a secondary shirt color under the first.

Use a 7-Eleven cellphone in a baggie to keep saliva off.

Use sounds to coordinate movements. Sounds are tough to pinpoint in a
crowd and it's tough to prove who whistled or whose airhorn was dropped
on the street. 

Want to intimidate? An entire crowd chanting some 3-word slogan in
unison is probably as scary as the black outfit.

Let's see observers identify the presence or location of the group,
assign membership to a particular person or track a subgroup through a
crowd. Who's going to get three colors correct during a pursuit when
those colors can be lost or changed on the fly?

A single color is not so anonymous.
