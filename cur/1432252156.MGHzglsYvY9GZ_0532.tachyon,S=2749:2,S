Wouldn't you know it, just after I send a test message to check to see if I'm 
still getting mail from the list. I find something worthwhile to post.

And then too, of course, the "dramatic demonstration" from
http://www.satsecurity.com/news103103.htm

SAN DIEGO - October 31, 2003 -- Satellite Security Systems (S3), a global
provider of asset security and logistics control, in cooperation with the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and InterState Oil Company, dramatically
demonstrated the first wireless remote shutdown of a fully loaded moving
petrochemical tanker truck.

>From S3's headquarters in San Diego - 530 miles from the demonstration
site - satellite communications were used to disable the truck in seconds,
proving S3's GlobalGuardT and FleetGuardT a viable solution to the challenge
of controlling rogue hazardous waste vehicles that could pose a threat to
homeland security.

The event, conducted on CHP Academy grounds in Sacramento and administered
by the CHP, addresses ongoing concerns about the affordability of effective
security technology, stealthiness of such a security device, and how GPS
monitoring can be incorporated safely into law enforcement protocol.
