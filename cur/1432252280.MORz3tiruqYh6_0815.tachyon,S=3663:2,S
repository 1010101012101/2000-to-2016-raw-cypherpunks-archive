Well, this is not exactly on topic to any ongoing thread, but its
something I'd like to get a few opinions on.  It seems that while
science is moving ahead at a such a rate that I'm constantly amazed to
see science fiction becoming science fact, at the same time we're seeing
more political(?)-fiction(nightmares?) becoming fact as well in the form
of government censorship and persecution.  As I'm not exactly excited
about the prospect of being shot or winding up in jail indefinitely for
'political crimes', it seems the best options are to simply leave the
country altogether or forget about the personal freedoms granted by the 
constitution.

So my question is: where to go?  I certainly don't want to leave behind
all the neat toys in the US like widespread broadband internet access,
massive bookstores, high paying tech jobs, etc.  Is there any country
that has the same technological benefits as the US without the
government steadily encroaching into every sector of life?  How does one
'drop out' of the US and keep all the good things one has become
accustomed to?

"The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government
to gain ground."	- Thomas Jefferson
