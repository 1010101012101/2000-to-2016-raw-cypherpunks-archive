Why would you fear it? It would be a badge of honor.

But no fear, they won't -- it would be giving away capabilities.
Many have claimed LEOs were reading the list in the past, but
I presume by a direct subscription.

I don't think human eyes see much of this traffic, but no doubt
all of it goes into storage. As all low-volume traffic (I don't

How would you trace back large scale purchases of hard drives
and computer clusters to a TLA? They have to use contractors
for that.
