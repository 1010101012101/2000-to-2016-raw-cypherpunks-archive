Thats going to be strictly up the node owners.  The node I anticipate here 
will likely carry all messages, but thats stricly a choice for the node 
operator.

abuse.

Thats a really good idea, but implementation across multiple nodes may 
prove difficult. I'll give it some thought.

Seriously, if you want to support it, get a box and be a provider. I'll 
happily support mailman and its native archives, but it'll be a cold day 
in hell before I interface NNTP again, or worry about maildirs for every 
user: forget it.  If you are hereby *seriously* offering to provide these, 
then put up a box on a permanent connection, and you can be the designated 
module writer for it :-)
