I did some Google searches, on "preservation logs online" and found 
nothing. I tried some variations. I expect the nature of legal data 
bases is that Google will probably not turn up obscure legal rulings 
which failed to get media or activist attention. Maybe Findlaw will 
turn up something.

I would be very interesting in seeing the full context of the U.S. 
official's basis for his comment that "preservation has been the law 
for nearly five years."

 From the time period, I am expecting CALEA is being implicated here.

It would be an interesting First Amendment case if there were some 
putative requirement that all communications be logged (absent some 
specific court order to do so).

The cynical point of view is that this is just one of the tens of 
thousands of regulations which our overbusy imperial capital 
generates every year. More things to turn us all into felons.

I briefly had some hope when I saw a yellow Ryder truck heading 
north, towards Washington. Hot damn, I thought, we're gonna see 
another mcveighing! Alas, it was only some chads and dimples.
