Without quibbling with your sentiment, this isn't unique to the DMCA.

Holocaust revisionism is a crime in Germany, I understand. If I ran
my naziswereswell.com website from the U.S. as a U.S. citizen and made the
mistake of traveling to Germany, I could easily be arrested. Let's not
even talk about what would happen if Rushdie wanted to visit Iran.

Similarly, U.S. law prohibits money laundering. If a known Russian money 
launderer visited the U.S., he'd likely be arrested. This is unremarkable.

That's not even talking about kidnappings by U.S. agents.

As for the DMCA, it says: "No person shall manufacture, import, offer
to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology,
product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that (does the
good stuff)." Nowhere does it limit its scope to Americans.

As I wrote in an article in April, all this means is that cutting-edge
security conferences will be held overseas, or maybe in Canada.
