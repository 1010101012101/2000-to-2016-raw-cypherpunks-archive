A quote from http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,20985,00.html:

" Criminal organizations appear to be using the proceeds of
    IP-infringing products to facilitate a variety of enterprises,
    including guns, drugs, pornography and even terrorism. Invariably,
    when there is intellectual property crime, there is tax evasion and
    money laundering."

Note that last sentence.
