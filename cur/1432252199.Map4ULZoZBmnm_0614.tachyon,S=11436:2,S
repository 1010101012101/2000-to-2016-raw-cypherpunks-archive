Greetings Good Sir:

I have a business propisition for you. I am the president of Nigeria and I 
am trying to obtain $458m in accounts in Switzerland that were previously 
owned by the late General Sani Abacha. However, in order to release these 
funds I will need a local representative. In exchange for your services I am 
prepared to pay you 2.5% of the amount reclaimed.

Please contact me at your soonest convenience. I am sure we can make an 
equitable arrangement that will benefit us both.

God Bless you and your family.

>He added that "the decision strengthens the Swiss position regarding the

>for the benefit of the people of the country in question. The point must
