The French have declared war on OVH, though, so it won't be
there for long.

Of course the torrents are up, so the cat is quite firmly

wikileaks. seems that they (wikileaks) got the message, following
tweets included their IP address and the new .ch domain.

The current IP address for the cablegate stuff is 213.251.145.96 which
is RIPE block assigned to wikileaks, the RIPE WHOIS entry shows
213.251.128.0/18 with AS16276 as originwhois AS16276 (OVH in Paris
France), mtr from here (SATX) seems to go through Dallas and enter
Global Crossing network or hosting services, currently <2% packet
loss.

Server seems to be configured to return IP address based URLs.
