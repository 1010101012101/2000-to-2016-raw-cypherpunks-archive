You left out the FFRDCs...


What Is an FFRDC?
http://www.mitre.org/about/ffrdc.shtml

A Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is a unique
organization that assists the United States government with scientific research
and analysis, systems development, and systems acquisition. FFRDCs bring
together the expertise and outlook of government, industry, and academia to
solve complex technical problems that cannot be solved by any one group alone. 

Working in the public interest, FFRDCs operate as strategic partners with their
sponsoring government agencies. In order to ensure the highest levels of
objectivity and technical excellence, FFRDCs are organized as independent, not
- -for-profit entities , with limitations and restrictions on their activities.
This special standing permits a degree of access and a long-term perspective
not shared by commercial contractors. 

Since FFRDCs are prohibited from manufacturing products or competing with
industry, commercial companies can divulge sensitive information with the
confidence that it will not be misused. This enables FFRDCs to provide guidance
across the full spectrum of capabilities development, from planning and concept
design to technology insertion and integration, in a way that gives their
government clients maximum flexibility for meeting future requirements. 

First established during World War II, FFRDCs currently number more than 40
different organizations, and work in the fields of defense, energy, aviation,
space, health and human services, and tax administration. All FFRDCs are
sponsored by government agencies, but they are privately administered by
universities and other not-for-profit organizations.
