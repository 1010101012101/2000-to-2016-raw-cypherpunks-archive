America is the world's leading terrorist state.

"My name is Tim, and men with guns take a lot of money from me each 
year. I am a terrorist."

As horrible as 9/11 was for the 3000 or so victims and their families, 
it was not much more than hundreds of thousands of victims of American 
terrorism have suffered around the world.

I'm glad I wasn't a victim...but, then, I figured out many years ago 
that living in a Schelling point for reprisals against American 
terrorism was not a smart thing to do. And I discovered that helping 
Delta and Jet Blue go bankrupt through not flying was smarter than 
being a sitting duck victim of Spec Ops vs. Al Qaida turf wars.

Give the Jew invaders of Palestine a 10-minute lesson in swimming, hand 
them a pair of water wings, and tell them to swim for their lives.

With luck, only one in 100 will make it to the point where Do-Gooder 
rescuer ships make them welfare burdens on America.

"We should not march into Baghdad. To occupy Iraq would
instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab
world against us and make a broken tyrant into a latter-
day Arab hero. Assigning young soldiers to a fruitless
hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning
them to fight in what would be an unwinable urban guerilla
war, it could only plunge that part of the world into ever
greater instability."
--George H. W. Bush, "A World Transformed", 1998
