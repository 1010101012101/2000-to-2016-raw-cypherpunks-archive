I think text is the wrong approach. Put up some pictures,
and a question - 'Click on the white bunny' 'Click on the
chipmunk' 'Click on the Russian icon'. 'Click on the clowns nose'
'Click on the clown's right hand'

Taking text, which is explicitly designed to be readable, and
trying to find a degree of distortion which is human (but not machine)
readable is probably a bad approach. Try something a 6 year old
can do, but which is still a PhD thesis problem for computers.
