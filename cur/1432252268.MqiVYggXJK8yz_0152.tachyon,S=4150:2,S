Needless to say, many of us believe it is no business whatsoever of 
the government to "keep one party from locking out others from access 
to the standard."

If I am developing my Superaptical Frammalobber, it is no business of 
the government to enter my premises and/or demand that I reveal its 
secrets so that others may jump in.

In fact, the government supports bother "trade secrets" _and_ patents.

And, more generally, many of us do not even support "obvious" 
applications of the Sherman Antitrust Law.

Haloid, later Xerox, was not required to help others match its 
undeniable standard.

Likewise, and more recently, Intel is not compelled to share its 
design tricks, or its bus specifications, with other chip companies.

I realized this post will not reach Cyberia-L or fight-censorship. I 
wish this promiscuous cross-posting would cease.
