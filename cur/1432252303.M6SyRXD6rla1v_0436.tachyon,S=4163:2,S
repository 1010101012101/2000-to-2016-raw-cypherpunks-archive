The sad truth is that if you're a gun owner and like to have variety in 
what you collect, no "western democracy" is going to be a better fit than 
the U.S. Even some smaller countries that should know better (or not) are 
lining up behind the anti-gun nations, as we can see this week at the U.N. 
summit.

Some may be better than others. Bermuda (not truly in the Carribbean) is 
more British and less strained in terms of race relations. Aruba is also 
better than others. But even with the problems in modern America, we still 
have a stronger commitment to what remains of civil liberty. Which may not 
be saying much.
