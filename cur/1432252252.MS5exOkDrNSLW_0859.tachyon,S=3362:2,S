Sperling is the office boss, not the case prosecutor,
who is AUSA Gallant. A report claims that a person with
the last name Gallant is the sysadmin at Brian's
competitor - who operated the Okie Rag's Web site
Good Cyber-Citizen Brian reported to be holey and
got cyber-criminalized forthwith. 

Whether the dipsec Gallant who got exposed by Brian 
had set a cyber-trap in order for Sperling/Gallant's office 
to grab some cyber-crime funding is just too fucking 
fantastic to believe, what with the cyber-soldier training 
camp being set up right in the neighborhood and
bigtime newspaper notices splashing the chamber of
commerce Ft. Sill-grade cyber-crime-fighting pork 
story.

Okies like greased-pig justice.com prisons, too, especially 
that OKC federal transfer station we read about here so 
avidly when those rumors are not being shunted aside
by Aimee's hot-eyed scheme to blow up something as 
if she's determined to prove AP is not a joke on Jeff.

Come to think of it Aimee's reminds of Jeff, and the timing
is pretty good for another raid.

Hark, wipe your disks.
