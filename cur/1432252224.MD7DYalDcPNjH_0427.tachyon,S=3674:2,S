Hello from NY, 

I want to share a profitable ad campaign with you.  We both have much to gain.  I sell this 
program on my web sites and have a terrific response.  I use it on my own pc.
It is called Evidence Eliminator and is one of the most profitable software programs sold 
today. 

Example ads at the bottom of these pages: 

http://www.gis.net/~catb/nympersonals.html 
http://mywebpage.netscape.com/jca507/retrotv.html 

As an affiliate, you make ONE HALF of the sale price on leads generated from your sites.  In 
the second tier (as I will be) five percent
of YOUR sale.  We are talking about a product which sells for over $100. and I have kept a 
rate of about 5 sales out of 100 hits. 
Phenomenal..... for a moderately expensive product.  You have some control over the 
pricing at your site which may vary depending
upon your clientelle. 

This is no cost to you, merely join and place a banner or link on your site.  Try it on your own 
pc today!

Enroll link:
