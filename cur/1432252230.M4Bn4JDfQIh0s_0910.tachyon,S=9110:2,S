Beware Those Insidious Vcards
           by Michelle Delio

           10:00 a.m. Feb. 23, 2001 PST


           Those little virtual business cards that some people attach
to their
           e-mails might be dangerous.

           Microsoft announced Friday that a flaw in its Outlook e-mail
program
           allows crackers to crash or remotely control computers and
entire
           networks, via virtual business cards (Vcards) that harbor
malicious
           code.

    Vcards containing malformed data can cause any
                           action of the attacker's choice to run on the

                           recipient's machine or a network when a
hapless
                           recipient opens them. They can add, change or

                           delete data, communicate with websites,
reformat a
                           hard drive, and more.

                           The flaw is located in the segment of the
Outlook
                           program that processes Vcards. Microsoft says

                           damage would be limited only by the security
                           permissions a user has set on his or her
machine.

                           "Since most people, especially those who
aren't
                           backed by a decent security department,
typically
                           leave their machines wide open to any
security
                           breaches, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be
had
                           here," said Andrew Antipass, a security
consultant
                           for TechServe.

                           Ollie Whitehouse, managing security architect
at
                           @Stake is credited for discovering the flaw,
which
                           Whitehouse reported to Microsoft in November
                           2000.

                           "Microsoft's reaction, as always in these
matters,
                           was professional. We worked with them to help

                           them replicate the vulnerability. They in
turn
                           developed a patch which they sent to us for
testing;
                           additionally they coordinated with us the
release of
                           their advisory and our own," Whitehouse said.

                           Typically, when a flaw is discovered that is
not
                           widely known and therefore doesn't seem to be
an
                           immediate threat, the software company and
the
                           discoverer of the flaw will avoid making
official
                           announcements until a patch has been
developed.

                           Once the announcement has been made, it is
crucial
                           for users to apply the patch, as attackers
would then
                           be aware of the flaw and will seek to exploit
it.

                           Microsoft has released a patch and advises
anyone
                           who uses Outlook to download and install the
patch
                           immediately.

                           Whitehouse said that this particular
programming
                           flaw is not uncommon in Microsoft's products.

                           Atstake has discovered a number of similar
                           vulnerabilities in Microsoft products from
Powerpoint
                           to Media Player.

                           Outlook 97 and 2000 and Outlook Express 5.01
and
                           5.5 contain the "Unchecked Buffer" flaw. An
attacker
                           can exploit the flaw by creating a Vcard, and
then
                           altering it with a hexadecimal editor to
include a
                           long string of data.

                           Normally, when a program's buffer is overrun
with
                           random data, the application would simply
lock up
                           or crash. But due to that flaw in Outlook's
buffer,
                           flooding it with data by way of a Vcard can
                           magically transform the e-mail program into a

                           compliant slave of the cracker, allowing him
or her
                           to make Outlook act as a sort of remote
control over
                           the affected machine.

                           If a vicious Vcard were opened on a machine
whose
                           user was connected to an unsecured network,
or if
                           the affected machine were configured to allow
it
                           control over a network, the attacker could
control
                           anything that is connected to that network.

                           Essentially, the attacker would be a ghost in
the
                           machine, with all the rights and privileges
that
                           machine's user has.

                           The card does have to be opened to be
effective,
                           said Microsoft, and there is no way that it
can be
                           coded to open automatically.

                           "So the attacker would need to entice the
recipient
                           into opening the mail, then opening the
Vcard,"
                           Microsoft said in its security bulletin.

                           Unfortunately, given the wide and fast spread
of
                           recent viruses like Anna and the Love Bug, it
doesn't
                           take much enticing to get computer users to
open
                           and click on attachments.

                           And "for reasons that are beyond my mortal
abilities
                           to figure out," many people don't consider
Vcards to
                           be an attachment, said Antipass.

                           Microsoft plans to issue a full security
bulletin on the
                           Vcard problem late Friday.
