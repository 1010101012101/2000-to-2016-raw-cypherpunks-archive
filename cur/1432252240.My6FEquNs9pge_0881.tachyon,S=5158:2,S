In 1998 Gore proposed a national justice information
system which was implemented by AG Reno. The
purpose of the program is to make criminal justice and
other information easily available to many the parties
involved; courts, prosecutors, law enforcement officers,
local officials and so on. We ran across a presentation
by a DoJ official in which he outlines progress of the
program and how to address the conflict posed by
information collection technology for privacy concerns 
of citizens and organizations:

   http://cryptome.org/doj-ji-pi.ppt   (129KB)

He advocates that despite the "tension between justice
needs and privacy concerns," tools for information 
collection and sharing be provided the national justice 
system as soon as possible, while a campaign is initiated 
to address privacy concerns primarily by PR among
US, Canadian, UN and other cooperating agencies. 

He observes that local parties are not always sensitive 
to privacy concerns and that they may need education -- 
but that is not to hold up getting them the tools they need 
to collect information on citizens.

He also notes that current laws do not adequately cover
today's and tomorrow's technology for collecting and
sharing information. 

What technology besides Carnivore is outside the law?

Here's a June 2000 information distribution technology 
status report by The Global Justice Information Network:
