That doesn't make it right, Doc.  At least one copy of the archives 
containing the logs has been seeded for over a year (that we are aware of.) 
 If you saw the access logs, wouldn't you privately contact John to ask if 
they should be in there?

That's what Mike did.  Because there is a larger question of whether they 
could have been used to forge a slide, it became a more complex matter.  
When John ignored him and then attacked him and accused him of faking the 
data, he came here.  At that point, what else could he really do?

John says the log files have now been removed from the archive.  If Mike 
had remained quiet, as you seem to be suggesting, they'd still be in there.

I don't want to reignite the shitstorm, which is one reason why I've been 
quiet - and I'm very sad to see Cathal leave the list over it (I hope Eugen 
doesn't smack him for directing the noise his way ;) but this whole thing 
has been just too strange.
