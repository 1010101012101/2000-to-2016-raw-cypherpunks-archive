To be honest, I was thinking about lots dots - no easily inferred shapes,
but pretty obvious for a human. If the state-of-the-art software using
neural nets and what not is capable of reading even *letters* made up of
many dots (circles) in different colors, shapes, and textures (and with many
"false" dots in colors that blend in the background for the human eye), then
the programmers are much more advanced than anything I read about.

I don't know how well people would manage to do that. One requirement was to
be easy for a human to answer the puzzle.
