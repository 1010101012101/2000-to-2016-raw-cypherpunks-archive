This appears more of the long-running bedazzlement of the public
which war gaming and futuristic toy-like killiing and harming gadgets
was invented to do. If Wired had no criticism of this it should be ashamed.
As should Brookings a once ethical organization.

Wired might give up its threat level strutting and turn to more civilizing
coverage, with less war porn. Sure readers will have to weaned from
the narcotic of play with yourself war and that will be tough with the
rise of masturbatory digital gaming so essential to train gullible
warriors to do what no sane person would do if they visited VA
hospitals grotesqueries instead of TV-watching bury-the-evidence
glorification cemetaries.

Drone pilots are as evil as SEALs and special ops in their willing
participation in political PR stunts of murdering innocents under
orders from distancing executive branch officers. War gamers
and gadget inventors and their media-amoralists are shamelessly
exploiting the WMD heritage of amoral technology and propaganda
aided by NGOs as diabolcial as GOs camouflaged by national
security inviolable sacred cow protected by secrecy.

US titanic export of arms pays for these diverting games and these
obsequious media dressed in hipster cammies, Perhaps unwrite
this very list of friendly fire.
