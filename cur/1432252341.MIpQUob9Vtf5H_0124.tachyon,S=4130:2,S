Great start! If anyone is interested, maybe this weekend I could put 
together a list of the top policy analysis schools with their technology & 
policy faculty and backgrounds: I'm sure there are plenty of researchers 
with a lower profile than those on your list who might be a great match for 
potential students out there. All you really need is to find a few key 
people to mentor you whom you can really learn from and relate to, to make 
it worthwhile.

Sure, anyone you think might be interesting to work with and learn from.

You can find all sorts of thing to do at universities, think tanks, NGOs, 
lobbying groups, etc. doing applied work, abstract work, or a combination 
of both. I'm sure where you end up depends a lot on your focus area and 
skill set.

Since it's multidisciplinary from the start, if you take the analysis road, 
you have a much better chance of "building in" some flexibility and doing 
as much "pure research" as you want to in the long run. Take law, you're 
just stuck with doing law. But of course I'm 100% biased, so any any 
encouragement in this direction should be judged accordingly! :)

Good luck...
