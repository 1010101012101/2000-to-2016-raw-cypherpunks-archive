American distaste for the French was not very strong till recently; but 
goes back a long way. The "Cheese-eating surrender monkeys" line
goes back to 1995, as I showed - even then it was uncontroversial.

As long as I can remember, there has been a love-hate relationship.
This is based on the notion, held by many French and some
Americans, that France has a superior, more sophisticated culture
than the US. Some Americans just accept this, others see vast
pretentiousness. 

Examples:
"An American in Paris" (1951) - uncritical acceptance.
"Funny Face" (1957) - Young Audrey Hepburn accepts until
		Flostre's real intentions towards her become all too
obvious.
Mark Twain had a LOT to say about the French - check
http://www.twainquotes.com/French.html

For an interesting essay on the evolution of European attitudes 
towards the US, try:

                       Two centuries of alienating Europe.
