(CC'ing cypherpunks@cpunks.org for trolling reasons).

Your argument raises the question about the soundness
of the so called ``theory of many eyes''.

libressl/openssl ship elliptic curves of low quality,
and they can be detected by man documented command.

The low quality of the curves can be checked by going
to wikipedia's page about ECC dlog records.

AFAICT they probably implemented backdoored RFC (don't 
know if they knew it is backdoored).

This raises the question about more obscure features
buried in, say, obscure macros, misleading comments, etc.

No math knowledge required, but the low quality curves are weaker
that the backdoored DSA via generic dlog attack, unless
DSA allows much faster dlog in the small subgroup by 
exploiting the sub-exponential attack of dlog modulo $p$
(or some other attack).
