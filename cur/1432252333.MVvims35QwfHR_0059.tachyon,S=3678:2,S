Personally I'd prefer a non-colonial foreign policy that doesn't generate
such antipathy.  

The message of the WTC is this: regular ole' non-mil sheeple *are* held
responsible for
the actions of their government.  *Even* in the US.  What a concept.
I suppose the sheeple in Dresden (etc.) know what that's like.  

When the US populations' endocrines settle down, maybe they'll clue in to
cause and effect.  Doubt it.  Getting involved in others' family feuds is just
too much fun.

What was it General Washington said about foreign entanglements?  I'd tattoo
it onto every congressvermin's forehead.
