CCTV fails to cut crime rate

http://www.edinburghnews.com/news.cfm?id=EN01146615

INCREASES in fighting and abusive behaviour in an East Lothian town have
cast doubt on the effectiveness of closed circuit television.

Traders in Haddington said the CCTV system had done little to reduce i
ncidents of drug dealing and abuse in the area.

Police were called out last weekend after a report of a youth in a white car
"driving like crazy" in the town centre.

However, when police attended the scene, the trouble had stopped and no-one
was willing to come forward.

In a second incident, police were called to a fight outside the Gardener's
Arms public house, but when they arrived the people involved had dispersed.

The criticism comes as a review of CCTV systems in East Lothian is under
way.

Traders are disappointment the CCTV has not done more to prevent crime. One
said it had produced "little result".
