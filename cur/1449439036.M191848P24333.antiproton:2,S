did you see the unredacted version?

i actually used this recently in a FOIA, in fact:

"Per your request for fix of this request,

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56 ยง505(a), 115 Stat. 272,

Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268, the FBI can issue National Security

SSL/TLS private keys used in Internet communications. See

the Mark Klein exhibits were the first time i saw sensitive private
cable tap activities exposed to the public.  it was the first time i
had hope for judicial action against nation state spying activities on
domestic soil.
 ( i still have hope, but it is much more tempered, now :)

Theo an opinionated egotistical asshat, yet still no justification for
a Dixie-Chicks'in on his contracts...



> Maybe no one cares...

you're missing other significant behavior modifications,

like the "voluntary" servitude of forever-secretive classified contracts,

or compelled cooperation when they catch you ridin' dirty,

or an employer dependent on military-industrial-complex, now the
cyber-spy-n-sploit racket,

or ....
