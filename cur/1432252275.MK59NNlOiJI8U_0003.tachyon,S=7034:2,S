<p>We understand that Internet Investors prefer not to join programs that require a long
waiting period before they receive a return, therefore we have designed a program that
gives you a much faster return than many other High Yield Investment Programs. Therefore,
we needed a program that had a fast turn around time, offered unexceptional rate of
return, and would not die off, due to not getting enough new subscribers. In response to
this need, we created <strong>ODD COUPLE, </strong>a game where you can make 150% return
instantly, as well as 10% return on referral winnings. Basing this game around solid
mathematical principles, we have a game that is sure to last, and does not rely on new
recruits or ponzi schemes to be profitable. </p>

<p><big><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>ODD COUPLE</strong></big></font></big></p>

<p>Okay folks, grab your dollars and let's have some fun. Now we CAN capitalize on those
fast rolling e-gold &quot;batch numbers&quot; .. the might as well be good for something,
right ? </p>

<p>The game is real simple, it's called <strong>ODD COUPLE</strong>, and how it works is
like this:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Look at your batch number from your spend to us. If the batch
number's last digit is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ODD
-------------------&nbsp; Your A Winner!!! and you receive 150% return<br>
EVEN or COUPLE (i.e. 77,22,55,etc)------------------- Sorry Try Again</strong></p>

address and referrer # in the memo box. <br>
<br>
