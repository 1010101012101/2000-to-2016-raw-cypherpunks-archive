OK, yes - being able to verify first and foremost that the PCB you have
matches some reference is an important first step for guaranteed hardware
security.

Perhaps building an accessible verifier might be the logical first step.

How effective is this X-Ray method for detecting hardware modifications
[what is the resolution?] How do you process two different X-Ray images,
remove the noise (normalize) to compare two different documents?
