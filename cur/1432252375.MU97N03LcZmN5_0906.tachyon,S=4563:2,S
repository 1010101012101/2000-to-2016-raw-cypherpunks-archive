I can concur with this, though it wouldn't surprise me if lying on
police reports has increased since then.

He may not have a choice. There are three choices for intracity travel
in the US: air, automobile (I'm lumping intracity buses in with personal
cars here for a reason that will be obvious later), and train. 

First, let's look at automobile travel, which includes buses. There is
one major intracity bus company left and that's Greyhound. They tend to
be cheap, and thus attract people who can't afford to fly. The only
advantage over driving your own car, is you don't have to worry about
doing the driving yourself ("Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us"
if you remember the old commercials). Generally, automobile travel is
nearly unworkable if you're going farther than, say, a 10-hour drive or
about 500 miles.

As for Amtrak (the last passenger rail line left), well, that may be
just as bad in most cases. I have heard that the government subsidies of
Amtrak are being dropped to lower and lower levels, and as such they are
not making enough money to operate at acceptable standards to most of
us. Read misc.transport.rail sometime and you will see what I mean.
Also, you don't get there that much faster than with automobile travel,
and I think it may actually cost more.

I wouldn't speak so ill of the ACLU. Groups like the ACLU are just about
the last thing standing between what's left of our democracy and an
outright dictatorship.

White people aren't even necessarily the "majority" anymore.

This is downright insensitive. (Mr. Monahan, if you actually get to read
this, Terranson does *not* represent the views of all of us in the
least.) I really have a good mind to archive this and send it back to
you when your wife gets pregnant and something similar happens to you.

And again, he likely didn't continue to fly because he wanted to. See #2
above.
