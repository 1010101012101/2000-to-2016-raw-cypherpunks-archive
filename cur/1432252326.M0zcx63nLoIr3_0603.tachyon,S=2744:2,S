This discussion about talking to the FBI has me ROTFLMAO. I feel like
I'm watching a John Wayne movie with its simplified moral categories of
good and evil. Why not say that cooperation is dependent upon the
situation? Exercise your judgement.

Witness to a hit and run : 
  "I wrote the make, model and license number down - here's a copy"

Witness to a victimless crime :
  "What? Dunno, wasn't paying attention."

Witness to a pie in the face delivery for a politician : 
  "It was great! The pieman? Dunno, I was too busy laughing!"

Questioned as part of some future anti-crypto fishing expedition :
  "Piss off"

Our governments and its agents are not 100% an enemy - they're just very
prone to bad behavior and require close watching and a vocal
constituency.

Mike
