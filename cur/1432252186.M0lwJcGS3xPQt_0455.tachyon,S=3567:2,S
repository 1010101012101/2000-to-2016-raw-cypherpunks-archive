Aye. Quite a number of people seem to have this strange intuition that
"research and education" are somehow different from "commercial" use,
making them "fairer". It's naturally true that the preconditions of the
fair use exception are more often fulfilled in the context of research,
but that's about it. Were that not the case, people who make textbooks
would not be very well off.

I'd guess it's basically the same thing that makes people advocate public
schooling -- not too long ago I too thought education was a "basic need"
which needed to be socialized.
