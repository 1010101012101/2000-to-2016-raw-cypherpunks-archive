actually, i have long held this view on an intuitive / elegance level
of understanding.  the continual expansion of our understanding of
quantum phenomena has only reinforced and clarified this model of
consciousness for me.

rather than sounding crazy, i am pleasantly surprised that others
grasp this concept of consciousness and are willing to embrace it!

this would be a fun tangent to discourse about, however, i'll save the
brain as quantum antenna linked to body via nerve cell transducers for
another day...  ;)
