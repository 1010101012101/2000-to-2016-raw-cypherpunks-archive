Oh hi..
Interesting criticism.

It's incumbent on me to prove that it scales but if there are obvious theoretical
scaling inadequacies then maybe you would care to bring them up?

I'd love for it to be more deterministic but I don't see how to make the design do that.

Yeap, DoS is a serious issue with this design.
It's also a serious issue (although less serious) with the Internet as it is today.
My plan is to introduce a market based flood management system integrated with congestion control logic.
What's your plan?
Just hoping that that botnets never reach terrabit capacity isn't an answer.

bEncoding sucks. But it sucks less than the alternatives which I saw at the time.
What's necessary is simplicity and ability to add keys to a message without breaking old nodes.

It's probably not the best design but it's an asthetic issue, cjdns weeds the control packets
out of the stream en route, it doesn't "bind to port 0".

Good to hear that cjdns isn't missing a feature.

/me snickers at the fact that it was said on an IPv6 mailing list.

If you mean what I think you mean, that's already done ("cjdns weeds the packets out of
the stream").

Bullshit.

Throwing out the book is always valid, at best you invent the next big thing, at worst
you have a great learning experience. In the middle, the good ideas are integrated into
existing technologies and the bad ideas serve as a case study.

If I was in charge of a major AS, I wouldn't implement *anything* which was developed
with an R&D budget of 0. There are some potentially interesting components but as a whole,
cjdns is not intended to work on large networks.

In places like where I live, it's not cost effective for cable and phone companies to
provide fast internet.

I believe that people are willing to spend money on a pole and a few directional radio
links if they can install the equipment and it will just work. I also think they'll be willing
to share the data downstream if they can get a discount on their bill for the data they shared.

What I need is a way to separate infrastructure, billing, and IP4 gateway provision.
I want to put up a pole, make a directional radio link to my neighbor, sign up with a billing
provider that takes major credit cards, and be online. I don't want to worry about my neighbor
spying on my traffic and if someone links to my pole, I want a discount for carrying their bits.


IMO the most important role of cjdns is not in offering an answer but in introducing a question.


Thanks,
Caleb
