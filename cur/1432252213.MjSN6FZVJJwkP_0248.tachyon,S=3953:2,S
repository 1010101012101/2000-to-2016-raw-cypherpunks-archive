You think?

Wiping out the airfields, knocking out the lines of supply, all of this 
is essential to getting several million Afghanis to flee onto the 
mountain trails, where the snows will soon get them. This is essential 
to rooting out terrorism by reducing the terrorist breeding grounds by 
several million.

But, cheer up! 15,000 more orange food packlets are being scattered from 
15,000 feet. And, I hear, at least 400 emergency tents are being dropped 
along the Khyber Pass.

Operation Final Solution should be successful by, say, January 20th.

We won't be able to do Bomb Damage Assessment until the spring thaw, 
however.
