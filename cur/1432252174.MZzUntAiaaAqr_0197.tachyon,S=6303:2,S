The difference between an encryption key and the key to a locked drawer is
that the drawer may be smashed opn while the encrypted file might not be
smashable at all.

Again, one wonders if a truly deniable form of TOR-based encryption might be
possible. If I enter key number one, message one is retrieved untraceably from
the cloud. If I enter key number 2, message 2 is retrieved instead. The tough
part is that there needs to be a mixed middleware service layer inside the
cloud that can take the requests in an untraceable manner and go to the right
place to retrieve.

Or is there any easier way, given ISP records of customer activity?
