I'm confused.  Is Mr. Donald saying McVeigh did not surveil his target
sufficiently to know that there was a day care center in the damage
pattern?  Or is he saying it only takes one "non-innocent" in a damage
zone to justify an attack? (in which case, how is he privy to Bin
Laden's attack plan, such that he can rule out any "non-innocent"
targets)

Or is the problem perhaps that any reasonable definition of "terrorist"
must describe both McVeigh and Bin Laden?  Ends do not justify means.  A
reasonable man would argue that attacking an occupied building with
highly destructive weapons is an act intended to incite terror, without
needing to even consider the motive.
