Interesting for me is probably around 65%.  You can judge for
yourself:  http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.cryptography.randombit

I like it, but to be honest, it does get spouts of super-high volume
(like the last week while I was traveling).  I consume it via RSS from
gmane which keeps my inbox cleaner.
