    Exactly! But even for the court to order "the original and all copies" is a bit
absurd -- how could they possibly determine how many is "all"? And what the heck is
the "original" in this day and age? Most of the stuff I (and surely the vast
majority of writers and journalists these days) create is just bits and bytes. You
want the printed "original" -- gee, I've never printed one, but I will if you want
me to -- how many "originals" do you want, and how many "copies"?
     Frankly, even I couldn't be *really, really* sure I had given them "all
copies" -- I've got zipped files floating around all over the place, on backup
tapes, stored on various machines, servers around the net, floppies in boxes I'll
find years later, etc.

        Or even disseminate it in encrypted form that the jury can't read, so what?
The info is still protected from seizure, as it's beyond anyone's reach to retrieve
"all copies". In some cases it might be provident to openly publish the info, in
others not. I would think that in the case in question, someone in the jailed
journalist's immediate circle would have already made copies and secreted them
away, out of reach of the court. Maybe someone should tip them off to freenet/mojo.

         Careful -- I got called a village idiot for suggesting essentially the
same thing.

           Well, aren't they?   See "Badge + Skinhead = Psycho" on my
