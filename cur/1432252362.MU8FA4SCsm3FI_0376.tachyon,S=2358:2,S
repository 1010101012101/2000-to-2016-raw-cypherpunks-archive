One leettllleee problem: we are not really at war.  Or, to put this another
way, we are only "at war" when it is convenient for us to be.  Our Gitmo
guests aren't POWs because there was no declared war.  Anyone we grabbed on
the fields in Irq were just "illegal combatants", while our own troops
(Jessica Lynch) were "POWs".

The whole thing is through and through bullshit.
