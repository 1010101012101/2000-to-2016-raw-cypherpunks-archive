Dear Joe,

Thank you for your interest in Dialpad.com. We want to extend our 
sincerest apology for sending you our newsletter without permission. 
When you signed up for our service, you indicated that you wish not 
to receive promotional email from Dialpad or any of its partners. 
We sent our new company newsletter to all of our users thinking it 
was more of an informative piece on our services rather than a 
promotional advertisement from a third party. We now understand this 
was not in the best interest of all of our users.

Again, we apologize for this inconvenience and will make sure you no 
longer receive any emails from Dialpad. We encourage you to visit our 
site and sample the many new products we have recently launched. We 
hope you continue to use Dialpad to make long distance calls from 
anywhere in the world to the United States.

Regards,


Linda Crockett
Manager, Customer Care
