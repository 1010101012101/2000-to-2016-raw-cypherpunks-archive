This is IMHO naive.  Have you ever been in a brawl?  Unlike most silver 
screen fights my experience is that the first person to get in a good one 
usually decks the opponent and its over.  If the first one to throw the 
punch can sneak up on the opponent or create over confidence in the other 
party by getting them to think that no violent reply will be forthcoming if 
attacked (in New York we called that "sucker punching") then the odds of 
success are that much more increased.  "The Art of War" is still a good 
source of combat advice.
