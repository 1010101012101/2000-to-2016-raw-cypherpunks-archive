Well, there's the guy who blew up the Wisconsin Army Research Center
math building in the 70s (at night, and they hadn't known there was
one person still in the building) who used ANFO.

I think Bernadine Doern was part of the Columbia bomb-makers,
though she may have been some other bunch of leftists.

For more recent events, even though there isn't much of a Left left,
you could either believe the FBI saying Judi Bari blew up
herself and her friend with a pipe bomb a few years back,
or believe everybody else who think the cops did it. 
(The friend was killed; Judy was injured, and she recently 
died of cancer.)


				Thanks!
