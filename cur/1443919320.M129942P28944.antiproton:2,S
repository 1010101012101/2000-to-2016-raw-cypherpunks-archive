Sounds like a prime beef you have with any constitution is its (lack
of) honesty. Perhaps we can work on that :)

I think you'd only see temporary 'improvement' and for a shorter time
than with constitutional statism.

Barring a general population wide increase in awareness/consciousness
of course - but the same can be said for any system.  I can keep my
mental door open to the possibility that political anarchism might
provide a longer duration of stability, or a greater likelihood for
"population awareness increase" but frankly I doubt that.

Of course we can argue that replacing one undemocratic mafia, e.g. the
British overlords that you guys kicked out, with another is
essentially "handling the problem of criminal cooperation inside a
government by getting rid of that government" as you say.

What are the metrics of national sanity?
- wealth levels?
- human intention towards family self sufficiency?
- stable military?
- deaths due to mafia faction fighting?
- actual freedoms which can be readily lived by individuals v.s.
proclaimed freedoms which have impenetrable and unspoken boundaries?
(speech, movement, association, growing food/plants, breeding, making
and doing anything which harms no one, choice v.s. imposition of any
medical procedure or substance, ...)

Why would political anarchy not descend into mafia coalitions, control
and actual anarchy, more quickly than constitutional statism?
Over here in Australia we have had pretty good run re 'political
stability', despite more and more total ratbags who now dominate -
yes, in military we've been lapdogs to USAgov in Vietnam, Iraq etc,
but internally we had say 80 years of prosperity and 'stability' - I
can imagine it having degraded more quickly if we had political
anarchism as our "foundation" rather than a "binding" constitution for
the mafia to target and having to spend effort to undermine.

Just like HTTPS - not actually providing its claims, just raising the
bar - does constitutional democracy also raise the bar?

:)

Here we go - with constitutional statism, we need more truth in its
opening pages. How's this:

- we the people are, on the whole, sheep, willingly shorn for any 2
bit lie promise
- we are often greedy, self centered and small minded to an extreme
- we are by nature tribal, we live in fear, and we will sell our mates
for a dozen silver coins and our souls for a bowl of rice and the
promise of 'protection' from 'bad things'
- we are so pathetic, we will even continue to alternately vote in two
known political mafia gangs who persist in promising us everything
(housing, food, clothing, medical and 'protection') for nothing (just
a vote for them) whilst they continue to financially rape the country
through illegal and debt 'instruments'

- and so because we are so pathetic, we acknowledge that if we even
pretended to be able to live our own lives free of representatives and
a protectorate, we would very soon run screaming in fear to the
nearest gun-totin militaristic saviour

- in our well trodden and known to be doomed to total corruption
within at most a few decades, but ultimately placebo, if
self-deluding, concept of democracy, we seek to placate our own
madness and desire for an unachievable order in the world by declaring
another democratic religion for we, the sheeple, very soon to be shorn
of any and all of our achievements in this world by our new democratic
mafia overloards

How's that for an opener?

Certainly, we live in interesting times.

And then wrote so in clear and enjoyable to read true stories. Good stuff.
