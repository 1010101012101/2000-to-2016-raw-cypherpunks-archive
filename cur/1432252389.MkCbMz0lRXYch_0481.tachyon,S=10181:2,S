On Tue, 28 Aug 2001, Duncan Frissell Wrote In A Panic
@ Panix:

> Anyone with half a brain could put on a stronger
defense than the two previous victims.   

  Funny you should mention that, Duncan...
  The second day of my incarceration, after the
initial hearing at which I was effectively denied my
Constitutional Right to self-representation by having
an attorney appointed to <hee-hee> 'help' <haw-haw> me
and then had my request to proceed forthwith denied by
the Alleged Judge in order to give the unwanted
'helper' time to "prepare" for what he had already
declared to be an unstoppable formality, I was thrown
into The Hole [TM] at the Corrections Corporation of
America Federal Prison Facility in Florence, Arizona.
  I was put in a cold air-conditioned cell with no
mattress, no bedding, and was provided with no
clothing other than a thin pair of boxer shorts.  I
was denied reading materials and exercise and medical
treatment and spent the next month and a half in what
amounted to a sensory-deprivation environment with no
way to keep track of either Time or Reality.
  In spite of this, upon having contact with my
sister, Alia, I distinctly remember telling her that,
despite the conditions in which I was being held, and
being denied access to any sort of legal resources,
that I was confident that I could present an effective
defense to the charges against me, as long as
I..."manage[d] to preserve half of my brain."
  Foolish me, I believed at the time that I would be
able to manage to do so, given the fact that I had
succeeded in doing so through a lifetime of dealing
with disabilities and hard roads in a myriad of
situations in which I did not always exercise the best
judgment or get the best of life's breaks.  However, I
was unaware that the GovernMint would be subjecting me
to Imprisonment Without Bail or even a Bail Hearing
for almost a full Year on my way to what would later
be declared to be a 'Speedy Trial' in some Mysterious
Process which was kept Hidden from *me*, even though
it was my Motion To The Court that was being
(Secretly) Ruled On, and that, during this time, I
would continue to be denied even the most basic of
Rights&OR&Privileges that are commonly provided to
Felons already Convicted of even the most Heinous of
Crimes (e.g. - At Various Times -- Food, Water,
Exercise, Medical and Medicinal Needs, Access To Legal
Resources and Contact with My Family or even the
Attorneys who were being appointed, against my wishes,
to provide a Rubber-Stamp Representation that allowed
the GooberMint Offal $chill$ to proceed smoothly with
their prosecution without the bother of some Pesky
Defendant presenting them with a Defense that would
actually Question the GovernMent's
Allegations&OR&Accusations.

> CJ & JB didn't really even try.  For example,
neither got real lawyers.

  If the 10% of the Memory I have left Serves me
correctly, I believe that every effort Jim Bell made
to dump his 'unreal' lawyer[s] was denied by the
Court.
  As well, I recall posts to the CPUNX List after JB's
first arrest in which various individuals (including
lawyers?) reported that their missives to Bell's
attorney, offering assistance/expertise on Jim's
behalf, were ignored by the attorney, and were no
doubt never brought to his client's attention.

  As for myself, despite filing a variety of Pro Se
Motions to allow me my Constitutional Right to
Self-Representation, I had *forced* upon me an
'unreal' lawyer who was not only one of the worst
legal representatives I have ever dealt with, but who
also thwarted every effort I made to exert even the
least influence or control over the direction or
quality of my legal defense (as well as denying me
access to, or even knowledge of, legal materials and
advice that were being sent to me by family, friends
and 'real' attorneys).
  Nonetheless, despite the Court's efforts to deny me
access to a 'real' attorney, I did, in fact, have one
working *for* me.
  
  The Irony, OfCourseOfCourse [TM] is that my Secret
'Real' Attorney was not even a Member of the Bar, at
that time.  His name was Greg Broiles.
  Greg directly provided me with an assortment of
legal cites and cases which not only included
*everything* quoted by the GovernMint Prosecutor,
London, and the Defense Persecuter, Grantham, during
the course of the <nod-nod> AllegedInary Trial
<wink-wink>, but also included cases involving a wide
variety of defenses which could have - and *should*
have - been used.
  I ended up having another 'real' attorney, in
retrospect...myself...
  After two days of perusing the material Greg sent
me, I ended up rejecting a defense, which later proved
to be the exact defense that Grantham (without
informing me) was mounting.  According to my reading
of the very same law quoted by both  the Prosecutor
and my DeFarce Attorney, the Ninth Circuit Court
believes that for a Citizen to be Guilty of the Crimes
with which I was Charged, the Prosecution needs only
to prove that A Casual Friend Of A Distant Relative Of
The AllegedInary Victim thinks that MayBe the
AllegedInary Victim
PerhapsMightCouldHaveOrCouldRemotelyEnvision Feeling
The Slightest Bit Uneasy over the Situation after Law
EnFarceMint Offal $chill$ made every effort to
ScareTheLivingBeJesusOutOf the AllegedInary Victim...
  In short, in light of the case, as presented, I
agreed at the time, and still agree, with the beliefs
of the Prosecutor, and the ruling of the Judge -
according to Ninth Circuit Law.

> We either have the money or the emotional resources
to corral a defense.

  You appear to be assuming, of course (and not
unreasonably in a Perry Mason / Ben Matlock TV-Reality
Society) that 'money' and a recognizably 'real'
defense would result in a different outcome.  However,
this would only be true in a situation where the Court
actually FaithFullyFollowed both the Spirit Of The
Law, and the Established Rulings of Previous Case Law.
  If, in fact, you review the Motions I presented to
the Court, I believe you will find that the Court, in
my case, Blatantly Ignored Clear, Established
Precedents of basic Constitutional Law, and indeed had
to jump through what *should* have been mBareAssing
FaultyLogicalLoops (had THEY [TM] any SenseOfShame) in
order to provide me with a 'Trial' in which I was
Denied: 1. My Constitutional Right To
Self-Representation  2. My Constitutional Right To A
Bail Hearing  3. My Constitutional Right To A Speedy
Trial  3. My Constitutional Right To View
(&OR&Contest) The Evidence Against Me  4.
EtcEtcEtAlAdInfinituuuuuummmmmm...
  As A Matter Of Fact [TM], if you take a look at the
Appeal presented to the Ninth Circuit Court by 'real'
attorney (he even uses 'Esq.' after his name on his
business card, eh?), Todd MayBrown, I believe you will
find that he quoted the Same Legal Cases,
Precedents&OR&Arguments, in the Appeal Brief, that I
presented in my Original Motions to the Court.  The
reason he did so, is that I was right, in the first
place...and still am...

  Although I feel that MayBrown would have, given the
'money' (and thus the 'time') that your referenced
'we' have, proceeded with a variety of other issues on
appeal which *should* have been raised, nonetheless
success would *still* be dependent upon the Appeals
Court itself actually following the law instead of
Jumping Through New Improved FaultyLogicalHoops in
order to JusticeFie Judge Bryan's Original
FaultyLogicHoops in order to come to such an
UnJusticeFiable Ruling that THEY [TM] had to rule it
UnFit2BQuoted in any other Ninth Circuit Case.
  Todd MayBrown, Esq., did, in fact, to his
EverLasting Credit, have the Decency &OR&
Balls/Audacity, in his Appeal to the Supreme Court, to
 refer to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling
as 'DisInGenuOus', which, as EveryBody &OR& His
Proverbial Brother (nobody@replay.com?) Knows...can be
Accurately TransLated as: "Lying Scum-Sucking
PiecesOfShit who are Blatantly Ignoring the Law in
order to Support an Abhorrent Legal Constitutional
Abuses serving no other purpose than to
ThrowASeriousFuckInto..."
