Explosive ablation sounds like giant pulses, and chemicals lasers (the
only ones known to provide lasing output in the ballpark) don't do these
very well. So either you have to fire synchonously from many platforms, or
have a veritable Death Star out there in LEO. Several of them, in fact, to
maintain an umbrella at all times.

During boost phase. Once past that, you need a kinetic kill or a nuke to
damage a nuke (largely, by neutron flux, not the momentum due to explosive
ablation).

One would want to hide the real McCoys in metallized inflatable balloons
anyway, to hide them in the decoy cloud.

Gold or copper will do well for infrared, but aluminizing the hull will
still do for a wide spectral window, and I haven't heard about FELs
delivering the output necessary.

Do you think one could kill a hardened warhead in transit?

It would be interesting to see whether any of the proposed solar power
satellites (which need realtime beamforming via a phased array to track
the rectenna target on ground) could double as vehicle killers, if
deployed massively.
