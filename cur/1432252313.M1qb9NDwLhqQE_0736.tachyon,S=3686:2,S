It doesn't rely on processing cycles for maintaining the log of
transactions. It needs some processing for the distributed mint,
but adaptively so (difficulty goes down if mining rate goes down)
and processing cycles are fundamentally egalitarian.

You were late to the party, and by that time you probably needed 
GPU clients (which will be soon useless, since ASIC miner rigs
are ante portas) participation in a mining pool.

This is a currency based on scarcity, just like gold or cowry shells.
If you intended to become rich by mining, you should have been a year
or two sooner to the party.

The value of bitcoin is ability to do P2P transactions in real time without
requiring a third party, using a naturally deflationary monetary system
which however is highly frangible.

That by itself is of obvious enough utility.
