It is your attitude.  You keep telling us privacy is illegal. 
Most highly profitable uses of privacy are illegal somewhere, but 
they are never illegal everywhere.  If you had your way we would 
all be obeying all US law, including those seldom or never 
enforced, or only enforced against black people and political 
subversives, all french laws, all Iranian laws, etc.

Concerning your example of the IRA -- I recollect that for a long
time the US government allowed IRA fundraising, and use of the US
banking system for transfers to the IRA.
