I don't think I claimed that.  I said that the cost curve wasn't strictly
linear.  Before they release prisoners, the crowding must first become
unbearable.  So that means prisons are all running along the ragged edge of
overcrowding.  This makes parole a MUCH better deal for the prisoner, which
was my point.

Well if so, it certainly doesn't allow for your solution.  We have seen
countries and jurisdictions relax their drug laws, for example.  Remember,
the US repealed an anti-drug constitutional amendment.  If they can go
through all the sturm und drang required to repeal an amendment, I don't see
why mere statutes can't be undone.

Well, American prisoners are in American prisons.  This discussion has been
about the situation in the US vis-`-vis, parole.

So let me get this straight.  You thing getting Americans (the majority of
whom favor the death penalty) to buy "kinder, gentler" prisons is going to
be easier than getting them to repeal bad laws?  Yeah, that's going to
happen.

You are correct, it can.  Scary, huh?  But my point is still true people WHO
ARE ALREADY IN PRISON would prefer to be under restrictive parole than in
some hell-hole prison.  You said "not true," but do you really believe
prison is preferable, even your "kindler, gentler" European prisons?

Nope, dead serious when compared to the alternative.  Did I need to make
that explicit?

So folks, I'm going off to celebrate my dwindling freedoms this Independence
Day by going to a movie with a pretty girl.  Please feel free to argue among
yourselves in my absence.  :-D
