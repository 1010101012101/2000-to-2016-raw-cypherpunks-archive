I never figured out why does one need a map of grocery stores. You see a store
with the OPEN sign and get your chocolate.

802.11b works the same way, there are zillon drivers that give you a list of
OPEN access points IN YOUR RANGE* and you simply pick one (some drivers will
also test the connectivity to the backbone so you don't waste time with
firewalled ones.)

And the purpose of chalk marks is ?



* 18" grid dish does wonders ... all the city is in the range.
