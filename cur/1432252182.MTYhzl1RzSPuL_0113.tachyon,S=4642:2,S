   House Endorses Snoop Bill
   By Declan McCullagh (declan@wired.com)
   2:00 a.m. Oct. 13, 2001 PDT
   
   WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly Friday
   afternoon to hand unprecedented surveillance powers to police.
   
   Just hours after the Senate approved its version of the anti-terrorism
   bill, House legislators followed suit by voting 339-79 to ease limits
   on wiretapping and Internet monitoring.
   
   The big difference: The House attached an expiration date to the "USA
   Act" (PDF). The wiretap sections expire in December 2004 -- unless the
   president decides it is in the "national interest" to extend them
   until December 2006.
   
   During the five-hour debate, legislators complained that House leaders
   had forced a vote before anyone had a chance to review the 175-page
   bill. Early in the morning, top House Republicans met privately and
   abruptly agreed to use the Senate's anti-terrorism bill instead of a
   more moderate one that their colleagues had expected.
   
   Democrats were the most strident critics of that decision. Barney
   Frank (D-Massachusetts) said: "What we have today is an outrageous
   procedure: A bill, drafted by a handful of people in secret, comes to
   us without a committee review and immune to amendment."
   
   Frank was talking about a rule handed down from GOP leaders on Friday
   morning that banned any changes to the USA Act before the vote.
