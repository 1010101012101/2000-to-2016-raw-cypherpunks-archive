AT FIRST FAUSTINE WASN'T SURE ABOUT THIS HUGE DILDO BUT SHE ONLY NEEDED A
LITTLE BIT OF CONVINCING. WE LUBED IT UP WITH HER WET PUSSY AND SHE
WAS BEGGING FOR IT IN HER TIGHT LITTLE ASSHOLE... WE COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW 
DEEP SHE TOOK IT!
BUT SHE LOVED EVERY INCH AND THEN WANTED MORE!
DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE GIRLS LIKE  FAUSTINE?


I have friends who listen to the cia like police scanners,this is a little 
old butt I believe she's still a member of good standing
.We learned to be patient observers like the owl. We learned cleverness 
from the crow, and courage from the jay, who will attack an owl ten times 
its size to drive it off its territory. But above all of them ranked the 
chickadee because of its indomitable spirit.
