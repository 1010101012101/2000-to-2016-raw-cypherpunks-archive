And had they previously dispersed these so as to ensure that they 
could not deprive themselves of every last copy, no matter how 
hard they cooperated with the judge, they would be in good shape.

Sure, judges can issue any order they like.  But if, before that 
inconvenient order is issued, you have rendered it moot, the judge 
is stuffed.

And existing precedent is that if you rendered it moot, not by 
actions taken in anticipation of that specific lawsuit, but by routine 
and regularly scheduled actions, they are stuffed AND they cannot 
punish you for stuffing them -- or if they can punish you, no one 
has been punished yet.
