"I think it would be far easier if WAN protocols were plain GBit Ethernet."

WAN won't be 1GbE, but it will probably be 10GbE with SONET framing, or else 
OC-192c POS (ie, PPP-encapsulated HDLC-framed MPLS). In either case, I 
suspect it will be far cheaper in the long run to monitor a big fat pipe 
than to try to break out a zillion lil' tiny DS1s.
