OPEC announced 11/1/01 they would be cutting oil production
because prices were just too low.  OPEC AGAIN announced
on 12/28/01 to cut production another 6% starting 1/1/02!

"The Department of Energy says that the national average price
of a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline has soared 25 percent
this year, and is currently $1.37, up from $1.22 on March 11.
