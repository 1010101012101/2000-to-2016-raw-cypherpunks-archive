Security Firm Signs Ex-CIA Director, Ex-Microsoft President to Board 
Advanced Biometrics says it will look to Robert Gates and Michael Hallman to help develop an infrared identification system. 
By Laura Rohde 

Advanced Biometrics Inc., or ABI, has added a couple of heavyweights to its board of directors: former CIA Director Robert Gates and former Microsoft President and COO Michael Hallman have joined the biometric technology company, it announced Thursday.

Both Gates and Hallman are joining the board, in part, to help guide the development of the ABI's biometric technology LiveGrip, which will be used to identify individuals for security purposes, the company said in two separate statements. LiveGrip identifies a person using infrared light to measure the substructure of a person's hand, the privately held, Washington state-based company said.

Gates, who had a 27-year career with the CIA and served as its director under George Bush, is being looked to for his expertise in security and intelligence issues, while Hallman, Microsoft's president from April 1990 to March 1992, would seek investment opportunities for LiveGrip, ABI said.
