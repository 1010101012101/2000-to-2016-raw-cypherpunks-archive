	Well, memory may be playing tricks on me, but from what I remember
from my fire fighting training in the Marine Corps, 15 pounds was the weight
of the agent. 

	A 50 pound bottle would really defeat the purpose of a portable 
fire extinguisher. There are many people who would have trouble holding the
bottle in one had and pointing the nozzle with the other. 

	Even a 35 pound (25 pounds agent, 10 pounds bottle) bottle is hard
to manage at times. 

	Depending on the construction of the container you could add another 
5 to 10 pounds for the bottle etc.
