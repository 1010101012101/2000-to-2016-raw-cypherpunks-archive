	The shape of the glyphs is not copyrightable, but the application 
of a specific name to that set of glyphs is.

	You can copy *exactly* the shape of a font, and just call it 
something else. Helvetica->Arial/Geneva/Swiss (actually *slightly* 
different, but that was more an artifact of the original technology for 
them, Arial is TT, Geneva was a bitmapped font from Way Back on the Mac 
etc.)  Times->New York on the mac (as Helvetica is to Geneva, so Times 
is to New York, IIRC).

	Oh, but don't do it by just renaming the postscript, that's 
copyright infringement on the *code*, as is (probably) using some sort 
of Postscript->TT conversion that renames as it goes.

	That would be utterly pointless (no pun intended). The value of 
Postscript is that it *isn't* a set of pixels.
