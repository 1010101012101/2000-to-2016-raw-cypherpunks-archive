Isn't this the same premise behind over-the-horizon "passive radar" 
(yeah, Im pretty sure that's not the formal name for it - its just as 
close as I can remember)?
  
It sure sounds like it, and if so, it's hardly new - just applied to a 
different target class.

And more importantly, the likely oberservers won't be paying for the 
networks which will provide all of the wonderful passive imaging: the 
targets will set up their own imaging nets.
