Actually they can if there is a contract that requires it and you as a IP
owner sign it. For example, what I had originaly intended to do with the
SSZ node was to 'authenticate' each submission. That means the software
sends it to the list owner for verification. At that point a contract
between myself and each subscriber would have specifically, and
individualy, converted each submission to SSZ to public domain. It would
have used digital signatures for post authentication of the contract if
there were a disagreement at a later time.

Currently you are correct, there are no stipulations of transfer of IP
related to participating in the CDR. I now believe that is the best
policy.
