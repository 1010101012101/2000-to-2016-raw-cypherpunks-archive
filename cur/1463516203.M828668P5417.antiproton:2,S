	Oh, I do see the value of what your master omidyar does. I know
	qute well how propaganda works.

	The 'cracks' in the system are useful to keep the fake

	wikipedia.

	Ok. So I'm a 'fanatic nutjob'. I'd rather be that instead of an
	omidyar lapdog.

	lol rayzer - you are a cheap marxist - you can't get more
