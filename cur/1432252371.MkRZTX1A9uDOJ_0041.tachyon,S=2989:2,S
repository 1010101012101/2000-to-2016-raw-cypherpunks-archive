Subject: NY Times editors decline to comment on publication delay

As we've all read by now, the NY Times delayed publishing its article
on domestic eavesdropping for a year.  The Public Editor of the Times
-- nominally responsible to the readers -- tried to investigate the
reasons for the delay, and in particular wehther or not the article
should have been published before the election.  He reports in today's
paper (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/opinion/01publiceditor.html)
that the executive and editor and the publisher of the Times have
decline to provide any explanation whatsoever for the delay: "there is
really no way to have a full discussion of the back story without
talking
about when and how we knew what we knew, and we can't do that."
