This isn't exactly true. The way he presented it in his talk at Real
World Crypto today, there is some public contract associated with the
system that governs how eavesdropping can occur. One valid contract is
"no eavesdropping."

The idea is that a policy enforcement mechanism is built in, the
policy is well known to the participants, and the system is designed
to resist any eavesdropping that is not consistent with that policy.

It appears that one must assume at least one non-colluding mix server
in order for this guarantee to hold. The proposed mechanism for
ensuring non-collusion is hosting servers in different administrative
domains.
