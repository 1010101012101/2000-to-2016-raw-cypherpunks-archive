I don't worry about car bombs nor hijacked airplanes. I have better chance 
of being killed in a standardized ISO-compliant CE-marked car crash than 
getting into mere visual contact with a bomb blast.

On the other side, the streams of bureaucrap the Hellhole also known as 
Brussels spews every day are filling my heart with genuine fear.

Forget about turbans. Real terrorists wear neckties.
