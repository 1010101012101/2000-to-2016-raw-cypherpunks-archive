But actually the problem, here, is less one of pinpointing the location than
of trying to ensure that the location is far enough away. I think some
careful thinking in terms of the current BGP aggregation scheme should help
at least a little.

How about trying to automate this process? Using the remailer IPs and
possibly some others as well known geographical 'beacons' and utilizing
routing aggregation to get parts of the address space that are sure to be
close to the remailer and hence 'dangerous'. I think geographical
information at the level of nations is at least somewhat reflected in the
allocation of IP addresses - it wouldn't seem sensible to allocate IP
addresses for two different countries from a single pool.

And pass those that are known to be in the same.

If this sort of egress filtering (or any variant of the original scheme
proposed) seems useful, why not develop some protocol/uniform data format to
acknowledge the limitations of a given remailer. Type 2 remailers even have
the necessary public key infrastructure in place to sign such extra data.

The anon case was perhaps a bit different - provided that a remailer is well
maintained, cpunk remailer maintainers can display that no data is retained
on where different messages originated or were posted to. I do not think
even CoS could have shut anon.penet.fi down.
