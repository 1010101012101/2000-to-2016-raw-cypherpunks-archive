I haven't heard this before. It's a good idea.

I've tried to contact limewire about working with them on some
distributed resources coding concepts.  I found them unreceptive.
They suck.

I've started on the very beginnings of a GNU Distributed Computing
client to attack the RSA RC5 and factoring challenges.

If you come up with a good concept and write some C code, I'll help
you refine it and include it in the distributed computing client.
I would also be willing to help you work it into the gnut Gnutella
client and the KDE based Gnutella client if you can provide a
reasonable argument for that as a better platform than the
distributed computing client.
