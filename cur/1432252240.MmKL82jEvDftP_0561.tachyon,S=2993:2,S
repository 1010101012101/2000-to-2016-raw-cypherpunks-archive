I don't think this problem is easier to solve (or at least I sure don't 
know how to solve it). It seems to me that you could tell a user every time 
they go to a new site that it's a new site, and hope that users would 
recognize that e-g0ld.com shouldn't be "new", since they've been there 
before. However, people go to a large enough number of sites that they'd be 
seeing the "new" alert all the time, which leads me to believe that it 
wouldn't be taken seriously.

Fundamentally, making sure that people's perception of the identity of a 
web site matches the true identity of the web site has a technical 
component that is, at most, a small fraction of the problem and solution. 
Most of it is the social question of what it means for the identity to 
match and the UI problem of determining the user's intent (hard one, that), 
and/or allowing the user to easily and reliably match their intent against 
the "reality" of the true "identity".

Any problem that has as a component the fact that the glyphs for 
"lower-case L" and "one" look pretty similar isn't going to be easy to 
solve technologically.
