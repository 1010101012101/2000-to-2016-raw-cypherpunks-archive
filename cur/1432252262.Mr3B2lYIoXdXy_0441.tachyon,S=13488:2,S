OK, I'll bite. Or rather...

Well, your initial postulate was stated in such a way as to be fairly 
unrefutable, the key word being "float". Only companies, etc...provide that 
by requiring that the transacted funds flow through their coffers for a 
moment, where they extract their discount revenue. At this stage of the 
game, nobody when their head screwed on tight would argue that 
Internet-based businesses don't represent an increase in Risk (whether that 
increase will eventually make float-based business models impossible is an 
entirely different matter).

Interestingly, the Visa organization recently launched a Purchasing Card 
platform which merely facilitates EFTs (a step towards your oft-mentioned 
"Geodesic Society"?)...there's a fixed and small discount revenue touch 
that's independent of the size of the transaction (and they can afford to do 
this because there's no float, ergo no risk). In this case, Visa is 
providing "value added" information systems for the transactions, but in a 
sense they're allowing their member banks to more or less completely step 
out of the transaction if they wish.

Now of course, Paragraph 2 is only related to Paragraph 1 by the fact that I 
wrote both of them in one post. To my knowledge, Visa's new PCard platform 
has nothing to do with Internet-based risk PER SE, but in the long run I'll 
doubt we'll lable this a coincidence.
