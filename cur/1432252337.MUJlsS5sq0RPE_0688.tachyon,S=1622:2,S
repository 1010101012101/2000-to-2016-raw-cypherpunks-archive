White House seeks to expand DNA database

WASHINGTON  DNA profiles from juvenile offenders and from adults
who have been arrested but not convicted would be added to the FBI's
national
DNA database under a Bush administration proposal.

Under current law, only DNA from adults convicted of crimes can be
placed in
the national database, which is used to compare those samples with
biological
evidence from the scenes of unsolved crimes. As of January, there were
about
1.3 million DNA samples in the database, U.S. officials say.
