Balancing Linux and Microsoft
By STEVE LOHR

For nearly two years, Bruce Perens was a senior strategist for open-source 
software at Hewlett-Packard  an evangelist and rabble-rouser on behalf of 
a computing counterculture that is increasingly moving into the mainstream. 
Part of the job description, he was told, was to "challenge H.P. management."

His last day as a Hewlett-Packard employee was 10 days ago. The parting was 
amicable, Mr. Perens said, but he was fired  "officially a termination," 
he noted. "It came after a long, long warning," Mr. Perens explained. "The 
thing that I did that was most hazardous for H.P. is the Microsoft-baiting 
I tend to do."
