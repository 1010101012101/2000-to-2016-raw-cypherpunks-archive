Maybe. But so far, market forces have prompted few conferences to try
to push journalists around and try to make this argument. I covered
PFF's Aspen conference this week. If I had to pay $800, I probably
wouldn't have gone.

Tim, you're not thinking like a Washingtonian. The point of having CFP
held in other cities (and, in the case of Toronto, another country
last year) is so Washingtonians get a nice junket.
