Automatically trying to make software incur faults with large amounts of
randomized (potentially invalid) input.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing

If you get an observable fault you can repeat the process under a
debugger and try to understand why it occurred and whether it is an
exploitable bug.  Here's a pretty detailed overview:

https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Amini_and_Portnoy/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-amini_and_portnoy-WP.pdf

When it was first invented, fuzzing basically just consisted of feeding
random bytes to software, but now it can include sophisticated
understanding of the kinds of data that a program expects to see, with
some model of the internal state of the program.  I believe there are
also fuzzers that examine code coverage, so they can give feedback to the
tester about whether there are parts of the program that the fuzzer isn't
exercising.
