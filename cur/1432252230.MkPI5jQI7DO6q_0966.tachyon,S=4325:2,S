I understand your point. It's specious. The distinction you try to draw is
based on a flawed morality. You believe that there is some effective
difference between attacking a soldier of a country, and the mother of
that soldier. That somehow attacking only certain aspects of a society are
allowed. Then when 'your' side commits equal acts they are somehow
justified because 'your' side is the 'right' side. That somehow the people
who vote to put a certain contingent in charge are then somehow insulated
from the consequences of the acts of those representatives.

So much for "Of the people, By the people, For the people".

The fact is that there are no 'innocents'. There never were.

The British certainly didn't see it that way. They saw some group of
miscreants raising hell in THEIR country. People it's worth noting a
significant fraction of which were not generaly born in this country.
