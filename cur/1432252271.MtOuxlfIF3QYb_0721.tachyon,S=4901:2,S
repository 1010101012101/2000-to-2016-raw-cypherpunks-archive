Get a grip. I also didn't mention algebra, history, and dozens of 
other topics a person here should be familiar with.

I was distinguishing the works on free markets (Haye, Von Mises, 
Popper, Friedman, etc.) from the more general stuff on micro- and 
macro-economics, price theory, etc.

By doing background reading.

You're right. I withdraw my "Well-Read Cypherpunk" reading list.

Instead of listing half a dozen very important books, take Faustine's advice:

-- read the tens of thousands of books out there!

-- read the encyclopedias of the world

-- broaden your horizons!

And don't ask what these references to Vinge or Benson or Friedman 
are all about: the truly well-read Cypherpunk will have spent the 
hundreds of thousands of reading time to have read all of these, and 
more.

Of course, in a world of scarce resources, time being one of them, 
some of you may choose to start with Vinge, Card, Rand, Hayek, and 
the other main authors, and then get to the "broadened horizons" 
authors when a spare decade appears on your calendar.
