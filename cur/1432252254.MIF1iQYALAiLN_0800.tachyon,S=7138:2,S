Now that is something I would help crowd fund, the paying of the dude=92s =
contempt of court fines. Who cares about kickstarting some groups game, =
or help bring a cellphone activated door lock to market. I would rather =
kick some cash to the guy who did as much as he could to keep his =
clients data =93safe=94, even when threatened by three letter agencies. =
Thats some balls in my book.

Thank you,
Scott Blaydes
