I don't think this is likely to be true. In my experience,
people who learn enough to design their own thing also learn
enough to be able to do SSL properly.

That's not true as far as I know. V1 and V2 were designed
by the same guy (Kipp Hickman). V1 is actually very similar
to V2, except that the integrity stuff is all screwed up.
As far as I can tell, the fact of the matter is that Kipp 
didn't understand the security issues until Abadi and
to some extent Schiffman sold them some clues.

As far as I know, that's not the case. The original Netscape
team was very small and there really weren't any significant
choices to be made.

That's not my experience. WEP and PPTP come to mind.

I would say the highest level primitives you can get away with.

SSL is quite fine for chat, actually. It's one of the 
major things that people use for IM. The issue with
speech and media isn't connection-orientation but
rather datagram versus stream data.

The history of people who go this course suggests otherwise.
They generally get lousy solutions.
