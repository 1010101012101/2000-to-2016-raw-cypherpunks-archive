Then what the hell are you doing here, chitchatting on the list many
critics have characterized as Tim's private cesspool?

Yes, Tim.  Come on.  Faustine will be doing Important Rigorous and
Objective Policy Analysis.  Her work will have Real Impact.  Members of
Congress and the Administration will invite her to come give them
briefings (at least those with sufficient clearance).  Large corporations
will be wetting themselves in their anxiety to have her join their Board
of Directors.

She just doesn't want to "show her hand" yet.  You know, all those
paparazzi can be so annoying. And it's hard to get important Policy
Analysis done when you're being pestered by all those lightweights
in Congress.

Besides: Gosh!  Just think: we'll be able to say that we knew her when.
