Anonymity is generally considered a a requirement for the political
process in the United States to protect the right to express political
speech without regard to being harrassed by those in power.  There
have been several federal court decisions in the last few years that
have struck down laws limiting anonymity for political speech.  One
that comes to mind was a requirement in Chicago, I think that required
the authors name on political phamplets.
Would a law requiring such technical measures for controlling access
to copyrighted information as proposed by representatives of Disney,
et. al. in the U.S. Congress recently that incidentally by design
prevented anonymity be found to be unconstitutionally limiting freedom
of political speech on the internet by its chilling effect?
