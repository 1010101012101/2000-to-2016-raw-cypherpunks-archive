Dear Sir,
        Mabuhay!
        Greetings from Philippines!
        I'm one avid readers in your website.
Finally,I'm curious upon knowing about the PUK CODE of
the SIM CARD.
        Do you have a knowledge how to UNLOCK THE PUK
CODE of the SIM CARD if your SIM CARD asks enter PUK
CODE??? And if you really don't know the PUK CODE
because you forgot it or you lost it.
        Sir,is there an a HARDWARE or a SOFTWARE to
help to UNLOCK the PUK CODE of the SIM CARD???
        In a way, thanks for your kind consideration.
I'm hoping you can do a favor regarding my request.
        GOD SPEED AND MORE POWER TO YOU!!!


                                 
                                  Sincerely Yours,
   
                                  Paul Lacron
