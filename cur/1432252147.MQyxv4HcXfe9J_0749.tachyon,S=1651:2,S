False.

It is the best possible situation cpunk-wise I can imagine.

It effectively deals away with bs artists (those who *argue* against this or
that) and empowers mathematics. If one is so fucking stupid, lazy or both not
to encrypt, anonymize and practice other safe-sex approaches then let's hope
that whatever broad wiretapping results in will also have slight (but
measurable) pressure in factoring those out from the gene pool.
