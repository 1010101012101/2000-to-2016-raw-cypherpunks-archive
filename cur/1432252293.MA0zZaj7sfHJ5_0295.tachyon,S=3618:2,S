Hash: SHA1

Just noticed on /. that distributed.net wound up 4 years of intense CPU
cycles, by getting the key to RSA's RC5-64 challenge.

Distributed.net release:
http://www.distributed.net/pressroom/news-20020926.html

"On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned
the winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key
0x63DE7DC154F4D03 produces the plaintext output:

~    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread

Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on
the keymaster, this successful submission was not automatically
detected. It sat undiscovered until 12-Aug-2002. The key was immediately
submitted to RSA Labs and was verified as the winning key."

Because I know that these two rooms, in which we are huddled together,
are stronger than all this might."                      - Tawfiq Tirawi
