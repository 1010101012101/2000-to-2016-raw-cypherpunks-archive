Perspective:

"How ironic, that this is all happening under the shadow of the Statue of
Liberty. Some of us may not have been born to see Pearl Harbor in 1941, but
I can assure you that none of us will ever forget the attack of the WTC in
New York City, September 11, 2001, a date that may become of more historical
significance than we can currently imagine.

------

Perhaps borders and transportation will widely field biometric and
biochemical surveillance countermeasures. The surreptitious collection of
suspected terrorist biometrics for border security, along with surreptitious
polygraphing might have provided additional security, especially in
coordination with intelligence agents in the field. (If part of an organized
terrorist attack, our intelligence agencies *should have* their mugs.) That
could have been an aerosol cloud full of blister, blood, choking agents....

Still, while we are all flying the flag, I just hope we don't forget what it
stands for in the policy aftermath.

To say we had forewarning is an understatement, and name-calling,
retaliation, and yadda-yadda does nothing to address our intelligence and
security failures.

GAO reports critical of airport security:
http://www.federaltimes.com/issues/crackdown.html
http://www.janes.com/transport/news/jar/jar000616_1_n.shtml
(It seems like there was something very recent, but I can't find it. I can't
pull up GAO.gov.)

I hope this will be seen as a mandate to engage in the aggressive
acquisition of foreign intelligence sources, and a coordinated
counterintelligence strategy. Human Intelligence might make a much-needed
comeback. All we needed here was one placed HUMAN asset. One guy.
