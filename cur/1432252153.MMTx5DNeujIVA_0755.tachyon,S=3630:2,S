	Utter crap.

	The attack was simple minded and executed badly.

	A 25 minuted delay to the time on target for the first plane to hit 
the WTC would have doubled the loss of life (after 9 AM as opposed to 
before).

	A couple of bored psychotic high school students with a smidgen of 
algebra could have planned this and carried it out in a month or two. This 
was neither sophisticated, nor complicated.

	All it was was effective.
