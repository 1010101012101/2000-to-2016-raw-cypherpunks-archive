The method used by PGP phone against a man in the middle attack is 
impossible for text programs, though fairly easy for voice and video.

A chat program needs a server, or interacting network of servers to 
advertise presence.  This server could also act as a public key server, 
invisibly to user, guaranteeing stability of identity -- that this presence 
was the same entity as had been logged on under the same name in previous 
sessions.
