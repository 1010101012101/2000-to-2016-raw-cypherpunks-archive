Hi, I've been admiring your and Tim's contributions, and I was wondering if
either of you were planning to subscribe to the (new) news list.

http://lists.cryptnet.net/mailman/listinfo/cpunx-news

Be sure and check the archive before posting.  It is still small.

Otherwise, if anyone could recommend additional good sources for
cypherpunk-related news, I'd be very grateful, because I don't feel
right about cross-posting news items to cypherpunks list.  I'm already
subscribed to the Cryptome rdf channel, Politech, and GNU-Darwin of
course.  I don't think I'm interesting enough for Interesting
People ;-}.  Please feel free to write back to me on- or off-list
for whatever reason you like.

Regards,
proclus
