I imagine that the Narus systems likely running in Egypt will have in
impact in a number of years. Just the same as the snort IDS at the edge
of Syria. These are databases that over time become more and more
valuable. When smart people learn about them, smart people will do much
much scarier things than the original creators of these systems.


I think it's really important to keep perspective about perspective.

We're still around fifteen days away from a full year of revolution in
Egypt. I'm sure we haven't seen everything yet and I'm certain that what
we have seen, we probably don't understand very well. If the Egyptians
were using Narus or Cisco interception, would we know? I've been told
that the Cisco interception is used for arrests, so what do we make of that?

Sure, I think we agree on the first point. Additionally, I'd add that
different authorities use their capabilities in myriad of ways.

We do not know the full reality, only the capabilities. By being
cautious, we're trying to mitigate many of the possibilities even in the
worst of actualities.

The irony is that for internet chatting and web browsing, I think we've
got an ironclad solution; where as for phones, we're basically all
doomed - from billing to content.

All the best,
Jacob
