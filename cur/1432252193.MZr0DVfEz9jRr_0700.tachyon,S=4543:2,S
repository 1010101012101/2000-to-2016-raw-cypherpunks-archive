I think if you load Vuze with the mlDHT plugin you'll often see
150m users online.

If a DHT can scale to say 10B nodes while performing lookup on an
unknown key in say a minute or less [1], that sounds like a great start.
Are there such designs in effect? The concern is that we don't appear to
have any decentralized p2p messaging network today that is anywhere near
that large. When you ask the current big ones (BT, Tor, I2P, cjdns, etc) they
don't seem to have a scale solution, be they filesharing, transport,
messaging, etc.

[1] Perhaps reasonable latency for delivery of mail across an anonymous
transport (aka: circuit setup time, uncached) may be a few minutes or so.
