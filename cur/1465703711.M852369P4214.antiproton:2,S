Anarchism is hard for some people to differentiate from nihilism.

Try reading Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker, Ludwig von Mises and,
most especially, Murray Rothbard. Maybe a bit of David Friedman, too.

Once you've made your way through their works, you can call yourself
educated in anarchism.

Ignore Emma Goldman, the various Russian anarchist, the
anarcho-syndicalists, etc. - they aren't serious.
