I cant see any rational player voluntarily opting to honor a grossly abused
ideas monopoly concept that only a force monopoly form of government could
even pretend to enforce.  You know how many companies in China had a history
of laughing in the face of western "IP" and just cloning whatever they
wanted.  Yep thats what it looks like, and its a good thing for human
progress.  I hope when they overtake the US in economic and geo-political
strength in the next few decades they say "screw that" and treat it as a
strongly defensible ethical stance, and not pay lip service to the WIPO
bully tactics.

I mean the best you could say is put a donate link in the doco if you want
to pore through the list of starving former patent trolls, small investors,
and IP luddites who are climbing over each other to claim to be first to
have thought of the 1,000,000 stupid and overlapping "xor cursor" grade
things that went into making the given product.  Or just skip.  Let the
market choose, thats a nice euphamism for it shriveling and dieing.
