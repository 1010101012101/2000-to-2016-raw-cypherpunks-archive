4. How is the key stored on the user's device? Is it backed up by Android's Sync to Google's servers, or backed up by iCloud to Apple's servers? 

5. Even if there is no backdoor right now, an automatic update can easily sneak in a "key escrow".

WhatsApp's "end to end encryption" is voodoo. You cannot expect security from closed source code, certainly not automatically updating closed source code.
