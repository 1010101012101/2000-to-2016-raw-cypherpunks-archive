Sorry, that last one from me was out of line.  I'm just tired of being
accused of sending my messages as attachments by people with broken MUAs,
and then their claiming that their MUA must handle MIME fine because they
can click on the pretty little icon and have attachments magically open for
them.  Having done tech support in the past, I've just heard this sort of
excuse one too many times.
