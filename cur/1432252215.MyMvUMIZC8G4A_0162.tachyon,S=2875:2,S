Well besides the misinterprettaion of the ruling, which I will ignore, what 
makes you think MixMaster isn't already dead?

MixMaster is only being used by a small percentage of individuals. Those 
individuals like to claim that everyone should send everything anonymously, 
when in truth communication cannot happen with anonymity, and trust cannot 
be built anonymously. This leaves MixMaster as only being useful for a small 
percentage of normal people, and those using it to prevent being identified 
as they communicate with other known individuals.

The result of this is rather the opposite of what MixMaster is supposed to 
create. A small group to investigate for any actions which are illegal, or 
deemed worth investigating. In fact it is arguable that for a new face in 
action it is probably easier to get away with the actions in question to 
send the information in the clear to their compatriots than it is to use 
MixMaster, simply because being a part of the group using MixMaster 
immediately flags them, as potential problems.

In short, except for those few people who have some use for MixMaster, 
MixMaster was stillborn. I'm not arguing whether such a situation should be 
the correct way things happened, but that is the way things happened.
