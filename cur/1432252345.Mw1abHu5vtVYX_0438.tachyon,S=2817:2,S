My dick, unerect, is about 12 cm long and has 3.5 cm radius.

This makes for 37 cm3, or about 60 grams (2 oz) of C4.

60 grams can pierce the aircraft hull no problemo.

So, the question is, how do you tell between plastic C4 dick and genuine
meat without close tactile observation at the security checkpoint ?

Beware of arabs/israelis humping aircraft walls.
