Are there any image processing brains out there who can duplicate the results on downf.jpg?

Without the filter kernel and other specific techniques known it's impossible to replicate and verify what this guy says, and after the Bert thingie he does to his credibility, well, you know, Trust but Verify.  Messing around with the original using my graphics software's built-in filters I don't get anything that looks anything like the results on bringmenews.com.  To me it looks doctored.
