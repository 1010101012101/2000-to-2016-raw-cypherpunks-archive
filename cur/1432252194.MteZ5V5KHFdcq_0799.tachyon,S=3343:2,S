Again, I have never had to face this decision of what I would actually 
do. Would I refuse to answer the door, would I blow them away with my 
12-gauge, would I tell them that they were trespassing and that they 
have 20 seconds to be off of my property, or would I roll over on others 
as Choate did?

I don't know what I would do. I like to think I would simply not answer 
the door at all once I saw that two agents were standing on my doorstep.

I have nothing to say to the FBI or anyone else in law enforcement, on 
any matter related to topics on this list. If I am not under arrest, 
shove off. If I _am_ under arrest, then "anything you say can and will 
be used against you in a court of law."

There is no reason for anyone on this list to _ever_ talk to the Feds.
