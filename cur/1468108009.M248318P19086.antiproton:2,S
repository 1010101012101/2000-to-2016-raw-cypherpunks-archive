Cypherpunks could only have survived and thrived and made a difference by=
 being predominantly based in the US.  On the other hand,
it was helped along and strengthened by international participation, whic=
h probably tipped the balance in a number of cases.  The
balance of powers, freedom vs. Federal / police control, public vs. priva=
te, etc. all tend to come down on the side of the state and
against the individual or group if a country doesn't have airtight consti=
tutional protections.  For instance, while France is
generally a nicely free country, it had been illegal to use encryption in=
 a lot of cases in France until fairly recently:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography_law#France

Encryption and privacy is like tax law: You should understand what your r=
ights are, where the lines are, and you're within your
rights to go right up to the line.  And, when something isn't right, you =
should be able to explain why precisely and work to fix
it.  We keep knocking down laws that, if they survived, would become temp=
lates for other countries.  A few things that slipped
through have proved that.

Which isn't to say that the US is perfect.  In many ways, the US is alway=
s imperfect, always in a squabble or fight about rights and
limits, land grabs or monopoly and healthy commerce; that's part of the d=
esign of the system and what enables it to generally work
and improve long term.  Things tend to go in the right direction eventual=
ly, catching up with or adopting best practices from
elsewhere.  It is a model of stable instability, noise that causes eventu=
al escape from disoptimal minima / maxima.  A lot of other
systems are similar, but seeing some of them go bad, I wonder how many ar=
e missing the complete model of balance of powers needed
for more permanent stability and resiliency.  The quality of people invol=
ved can keep any system working somewhat for a while, or
conversely they can break a fairly good system.  The interesting measure,=
 and the real measure of comparison, is whether a system is
elastic and resilient enough to handle extreme torque, failing in little =
ways gracefully while never failing overall, and still keep
going.

One apparent exception, by many people's standards, is guns where histori=
cal decisions have a long throw.  As yet another resiliency
strategy, a kind of defense in depth at the state level, it may or may no=
t still have some of the same effect.  We'll just have to
solve the problem of effective prevention of mental illness (and very bad=
 meme sets) while suffering some attrition on that front.=20
Solving those is hard, but extremely important and valuable.  Determined =
people don't need guns to kill other people, so I'm
skeptical that gun control helps much.  We're entering the age of buildin=
g anything on demand starting only with information and/or
imagination, so the impulse of controlling the existence of things is goi=
ng to rapidly become less effective.  Seems like we're
almost ready to seriously work on maintaining the quality of mental healt=
h and emotional health and culture.

This book, perused last night, seems to be on the right track, exploring =
that direction:
