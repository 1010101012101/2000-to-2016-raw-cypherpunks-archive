Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account@node.
All the MTA's die off in time.

[Please direct list replies to the list, not me. I should have broke
the subject earlier.]
