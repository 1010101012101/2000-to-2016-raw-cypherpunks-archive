No. AIUI the CC company is not obligated by the state to offer joe any credit
at all in response to his application. They may reject him based on his
nonpayment twenty years later. They simply may not attempt to collect the 
old debt. Also, in practice, the people who aggregate such information
from other creditors will have a hard time reporting on the old default.
But you are not obligated to extend any credit that you do not wish to
extend.
