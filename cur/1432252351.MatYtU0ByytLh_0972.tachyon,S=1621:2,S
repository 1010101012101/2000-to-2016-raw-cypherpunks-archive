I've also posted this to sci.crypt to see if anyone there had any comments,
both Tom St.Denis (a regular contributor and author of libtomcrypt) and David
Wagner (needs no introduction :-) comment that the chance of a random 512-bit
prime having this form is about 1/2^250, so it's not worth checking for.  See
the sci.crypt thread for more info.

Peter.
