[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  I've been getting the Muslim Student 
Association News mailing list (MSANEWS) for many years (it was 
created in 1991).  One of their editors used to subscribe to my 
mailing list and he lived nearby.  They went dead for about four 
hours this afternoon from about 2pm onward-  The message below 
details their view that their servers are being tampered with.  I 
tried to send a posting this afternoon titled "Anonymous Tip Web Link 
Now Available Worldwide to Report Information to U.S. Authorities" 
which came back with an error message.  They appear to be up and 
running again. MSANEWS Home Page:   <http://msanews.mynet.net/>, 
Comments to the Editors: <msanews-ed@msanews.mynet.net>, Submissions 
for MSANEWS:  <msanews@msanews.mynet.net>, Problems with 
subscription:   <msaosu@postbox.acs.ohio-state.edu> ]
