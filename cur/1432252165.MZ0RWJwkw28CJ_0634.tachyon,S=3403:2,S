Either they were blending in (ie, counter counterintel) or
they were taking small karma hits and expected to be very in the

Admittedly there's some geopolitical/war- and personal- issues involved
in
hijackers' motivations, and maybe their generals were more obsessively

It is much harder to convince someone to kill themselves for you
without something supernatural (irrefutable, possibly tapping into
certain circuits) ---the japs had their emperor, etc.
