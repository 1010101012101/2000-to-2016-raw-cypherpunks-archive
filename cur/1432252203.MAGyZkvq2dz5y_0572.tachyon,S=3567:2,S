Agreed.

I would be really, really impressed if Koontz had said all this *before*
the event. Afterwards? I hope he never publishes his theories on the
words of Bob Dylan.

Some hundreds of interpretations I guess. The world is full of art
historians and critics and cultural studies folk who can generate them
for as long as you like. We have a whole department of Art Historians
here at this very university. I bet they could find terrorist messages
in just about any painting you cared to mention, if you bought them
enough drinks.
