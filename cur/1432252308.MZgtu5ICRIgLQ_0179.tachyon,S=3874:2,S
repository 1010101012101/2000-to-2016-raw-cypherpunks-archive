Why would it not? It was the regime controlling Afghanistan. Sure, it 
was not the regime that signed the Geneva Accords of Whichever Type, but 
neither is the Bush Jr. Administration the same as the Clinton, Bush 
Sr., Reagan, Carter, Ford, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, or 
Truman Administrations.

Nor is the Putin Administration the same as whatever band of brigands 
ran Russia 50 years ago. And so on.

The Taliban Regime was as much in the line of succession as any of 
hundreds of other regimes.

That the U.S. is choosing to ignore the Geneva Accords of Whichever Type 
is, hopefully, one more nail in their coffin.
