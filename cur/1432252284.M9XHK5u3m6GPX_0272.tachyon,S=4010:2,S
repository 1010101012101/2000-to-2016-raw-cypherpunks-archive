It does apply.

Making the picture is speech because it represents an expression.

No, this is sharing, that takes copies, that takes 'press'.

I'm not, simply paraphrasing your C-A-C-L commentary from past discussion.
And the best you can do is 'fat boy'? I'm surprised you made it to 50th

> What you have stated seems to be more your position.

is wrong and not protected speech or press. That the material involves a
non-consenting participant and that their self-defence trumps any
individual 'speech' rights you might claim.
