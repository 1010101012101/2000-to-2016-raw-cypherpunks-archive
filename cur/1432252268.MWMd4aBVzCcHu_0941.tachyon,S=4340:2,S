You're just trolling, right?

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Sending a reporter to jail for not revealing her source sure sounds like
its infringing on freedom of the press to me.  The issue isn't HER.  The
issue is that if I'm someone that wants to blow the whistle on
something, I'm going to be less likely to do it if the reporter I tell
might reveal me as her source.  And of course, reporters might be less
likely to cover such stories if they may end up choosing between
protecting the source and jail.

"On July of 2005, Miller was jailed for contempt of court by refusing to
testify before a federal grand jury investigating a leak naming Valerie
Plame as a covert CIA agent. Miller did not write about Plame, but is
reportedly in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation.
According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official
? later revealed to be "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Cheney's Chief of
Staff ? on July 8, 2003, two days after former ambassador Joseph Wilson
published an Op-Ed in the Times criticizing the Bush administration for
"twisting" intelligence to justify war in Iraq. (Plame's CIA identity
was revealed by political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003.)"

That woman went to jail for not revealing the source, on a story SHE
NEVER EVEN WROTE.  Thats dedication.
