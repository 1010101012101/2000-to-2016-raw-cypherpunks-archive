Recently I have been working on creating a distribution of Tor which
includes a pre-configured browser -- the Tor Browser Bundle. It is
intended for being run off an USB flash drive, but will probably also
be helpful to users who want an easy-to-setup packaging of Tor.

More information and download links can be found here:

 http://torbrowser.torproject.org/

The bundle contains Firefox, Tor, Vidalia, Polipo and Torbutton. No
installation is needed (just unpack the contents). All the components
are automatically started by one double-click.

The bundle is new, and contains development versions of Tor, Vidalia
and Torbutton, so should be considered a testing release. I do hope it
will be useful, and I'd appreciate comments, suggestions, and bug
reports.

Thanks,
Steven.
