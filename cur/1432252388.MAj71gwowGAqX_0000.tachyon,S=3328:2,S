Huh? There's little to search with when it comes to images, unless
you pull from the surrounding content, which Google does.

There are several orders of magnitude difference between storing web
page-size content and the kind of filename-size content that would
appear in image titles and descriptions.

In other words, an index of just JPG image titles would be far
smaller than an index of the same number of web pages (though the
binary files themselves, which won't be indexed, would likely consume
more space).
