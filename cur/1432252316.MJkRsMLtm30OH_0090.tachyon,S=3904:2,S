YEAH!!! THAT'S THE SPIRIT!!!!!

But I have to admit I was rather hoping you'd come back anonymously to mix it up
and give everyone a little hell in the grand manner. Oh well.

You know, people around here just aren't the same without a sufficient number
of convenient targets to flatter their egotistical delusions about being
followed around by crack teams of Special Agents who find them so fascinating
they can't resist posting replies in their pet forums. (Admitting you have a
research interest in people who think they're subjects of surveillance just
wasn't important enough, I guess.)

You haven't missed much though. Did you know that a lard-assed welfare parasite
arsonist lunatic put a four-dollar bounty on your head a month or so ago? I was
quite offended mine wasn't any higher--but hey, coming from a nematode
leech who's never going to act on any of his bullshit bluster anyway, I guess
that's as good as it gets. He's not worth replying to--but it is fun in a train
- -wreck sort of way to sit back and watch him dig himself in deeper:

"I have always been among those who believe that the greatest freedom of speech
was the greatest safety, because if a man is a fool, the best thing to do is to
encourage him to advertise the fact by speaking."
- --Woodrow Wilson

So welcome back to the conversation, actually. ;)
