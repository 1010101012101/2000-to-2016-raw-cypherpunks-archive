   Yes, of course, we will always be in a national emergency. Very convenient,
eh? Using that logic, we didn't even need the unpatriot act enacted, they can
simply evade any and all laws/bill of rights on the basis that we are in a 
"national emergency" just on the scumbag prez's say so.
   Isn't this essentially what every dictator does?
