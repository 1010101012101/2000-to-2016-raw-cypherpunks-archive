Agreed.  As an interesting aside, there is actual case law in New York
that would be on point here (although I can't for the life of me find the
damn citation.  Sandy?).  The NY Court of Appeals ruled that it is not
possible to "disturb the peace of a police officer".  The incident was in
fact someone calling a cop a "pig", and their subsequent arrest for
"disturbing the peace".

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
