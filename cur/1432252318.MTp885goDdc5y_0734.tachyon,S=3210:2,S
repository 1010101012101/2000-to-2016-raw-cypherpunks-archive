Only if you know your coworker or neighbor is a spy.

I've refused to answer questions about neighbors when they were being 
checked out by the FBI. I told the agents, this was in the mid-80s, that 
I had no interest in speculating to them about a person I knew only in 
passing.

I expect a lot of background checks get idle speculation from bluehairs 
and busybodies.
