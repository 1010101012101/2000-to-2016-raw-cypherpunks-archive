I was just going over my legal work and ended up reading Judge Bryan's =
statements at my sentencing.
Playing to the Public/Press, he made some PretentiousBullShit statement =
about those who are ready to Criticize TheSYSTEM taking the time to =
observe TheSYSTEM at work in cases such as mine...as if anybody =
had...except for the GovernMint Advertised HighLites such as my =
sentencing.

FUCK JUDGE ROBERT BRYAN!!!

If anybody *had* cared to observe Ameri%an Ju$tU$ at work during my =
case, they would have observed me being denied food, water, medical =
treatment, clothing, bedding, sanitation, etc., and being subjected to =
various physical and mental abuses and tortures, all while being held =
UnConstitutionally without benefit of a Bail Hearing under the =
Constitutionally Abusive Authority of Judge Robert Bryan.

I challenge anyone involved in the Secret Service's Staged Trial of me =
to read the Constitution and point out to me a single of my =
Constitutional Rights that were not denied to me.  Just a single =
one...it can't be done...
