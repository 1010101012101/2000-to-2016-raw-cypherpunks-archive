I've written a small howto on holding a keysigning party
based on the use of GnuPG w/linux.

http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/gpg-party.html

It's version 1.00, so feedback (comments, suggestions,
corrections) sent to me individually would be
appreciated.  The goal of the document was to help 
linux users gain familiarity with GnuPG, and encourage
them to hold keysigning parties. Some LUGs have started
holding keysigning parties at their meetings.  If you
are a linux user and in a LUG, I encourage you to
encourage your LUG to do the same.

"We all call mama earth our home.
  Respect her, protect her.
   Don't bite the hand - hand that feeds.
    She bleeds by our greed.
     Yet still, she reseeds to meet our needs. 
      Do you hear her voice as she pleads?"
