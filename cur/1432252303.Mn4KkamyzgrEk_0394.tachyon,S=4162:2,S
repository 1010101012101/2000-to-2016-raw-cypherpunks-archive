Except the financial world DID crash, and they just had the government(s)
print new money to do the rollback for them.

That's the difference with MtGox, there's no single authority (or distributed
consensus mechanism) that is capable of rolling anything back.... except for
the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

So maybe technically you could argue the **accounting** database system never
crashed, but we were feeding in garbage mortages and processing meaningless
transactions at a rate the world had never seen before or since.

And then it took at least 3-5 years to rollback and unwind all the corrupted
input data.
