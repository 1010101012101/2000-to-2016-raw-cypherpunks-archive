Other filtering proxies don't mess with the Agent line, or let
you send whatever you want there ("Hi!  I'm running X10 on MVS!").  

I don't think that a high percentage of people use filtering proxies.
You could make a rough guess by analyzing your log files to see which
users are reading the content pages and not requesting the ads...
but that's only possible if you're serving the ads yourself.
You'd have to account for people who end the session early, therefore
don't request the ads.

If many sites implement anti-filtering methods, the ad filter writers
will figure out a way to get around it.  I'd do it.  It'd be
pretty easy- simply request the ads but don't send them to the browser.
I suppose that you could then add 1x1 stealth gifs to the ads to see
if the ads are getting to the browser, but then I'd just code the filter
to parse the HTML stream and request those .gifs.... you can't win.

Besides, if the market for web ads is a free market, the number of
people who filter out ads is already factored into the price
that you're getting.  It's probably about $1.25 a month. :-)
