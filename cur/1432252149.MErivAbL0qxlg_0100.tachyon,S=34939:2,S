Whatever Happened To Keep It Simple?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it seems the KISS 
formula has been tossed out the window. 

I visit various sites that are supposed to be selling a 
product or service and get various messages such as: 

> We'd like to let you know you don't have the latest 
version of IE or Netscape and we'd like to ask you to 
upgrade your browser at this time. 

> We're sorry but this site can only be viewed with Internet 
Explorer. 

> If you want to view our site you'll have to download the 
flash media software. 

> Sorry you need to download these plug ins before viewing 
our site. 

Well I have to admit I'm out of there when it comes to any 
of these sites. 

If I'm looking for a product or service and you want my 
money, don't ask me to jump through hoops to hand it to 
you. 

I'm not visiting your site so I can spend the rest of the 
night adding plug ins, upgrading browsers and being told 
I'm not welcome unless I do a "dog and pony" show for you. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but web surfers have a limited attention 
span when it comes to making a buying decision and I really 
don't think they're coming to be impressed by your site. 
They're stopping by to see if you have what they want, need 
or desire. 

I'm sure many of these sites are making nice sales, but how 
many more are they losing? 

There are sites with a sales letter and maybe one or two 
graphics making sales around the clock. You stop by, see 
what they have to offer, and either you buy or you don't. 

They're saying, "Hey come as you are, you're always welcome." 

I know that there are a lot of goodies out there to impress 
visitors with, but I'd rather feel comfortable and welcome. 

If you expect me to spend my money make it easy. I'm not 
looking to spend the rest of the night making upgrades and 
changing browsers etc. so I can hand you my money. 

I may be old fashioned, but if you want my money, make me 
feel comfortable. I don't need to be told I have to change 
to hand you my money. 

I'm actually glad there are so many sites I can't view, it 
saves me money.

Don't Just Get Sales; Get Affiliates in the 2nd Tier!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Most affiliates get sales from the respective affiliate  
programs they belong to by selling directly to visitors. 

But what about the 2nd Tier? 

Many affiliates programs allow you to sign up affiliates 
under you so you can earn commissions from the sales 
that YOUR affiliates are making. This is commonly referred 
to as the 2nd tier. 

However it is often ignored. 

Many of the most successful affiliates have built a huge 2nd 
tier in their programs where they have hundreds of other 
people all earning commissions for them. 

This means they earn a lot of their commissions from the 
indirect sales. It also means they do not have to concentrate 
so much on the direct sales. This frees up more of their time 
to work on promoting some of their other affiliate programs. 

Think about the power of the 2nd tier. 

You do one piece of work - getting an affiliate signed up 
under you in one of your affiliate programs. 

Then each of those affiliates sell the particular product 
or service separately themselves. Any sales that they 
make, you make a commission. 

The commission you make for the 2nd tier is much less 
than the direct commission. But if you have hundreds 
of affiliates under you, these many small amounts dwarf 
the 1 larger amount. 

If they sell this week - You get paid. If they sell next week - 
You get paid again. And if they sell next month - You STILL get  
paid. 

You get paid each time they get paid. 

Some affiliate programs allow you to earn commissions 
from your affiliates for many years. So by doing a little 
work today you can be earning commissions for years 
to come. 

So do not just sell direct to your visitors. Entice your 
visitors to become affiliates as well. 

Show them the benefits of joining an affiliate program. Tell  
them how much money they could make. Motivate them to sign up  
as an affiliate under you. 

In the long run this strategy will prove to be very 
successful for you. 

Don't forget the 2nd tier. It may be more valuable than 
you think.

<br>they belong to by selling directly to visitors.
<p>But what about the 2nd Tier?
<p>Many affiliates programs allow you to sign up affiliates
<br>under you so you can earn commissions from the sales
<br>that YOUR affiliates are making. This is commonly referred
<br>to as the 2nd tier.
<p>However it is often ignored.
<p>Many of the most successful affiliates have built a huge 2nd
<br>tier in their programs where they have hundreds of other
<br>people all earning commissions for them.
<p>This means they earn a lot of their commissions from the
<br>indirect sales. It also means they do not have to concentrate
<br>so much on the direct sales. This frees up more of their time
<br>to work on promoting some of their other affiliate programs.
<p>Think about the power of the 2nd tier.
<p>You do one piece of work - getting an affiliate signed up
<br>under you in one of your affiliate programs.
<p>Then each of those affiliates sell the particular product
<br>or service separately themselves. Any sales that they
<br>make, you make a commission.
<p>The commission you make for the 2nd tier is much less
<br>than the direct commission. But if you have hundreds
<br>of affiliates under you, these many small amounts dwarf
<br>the 1 larger amount.
<p>If they sell this week - You get paid. If they sell next week -
<br>You get paid again. And if they sell next month - You
<br>STILL get paid.
<p>You get paid each time they get paid.
<p>Some affiliate programs allow you to earn commissions
<br>from your affiliates for many years. So by doing a little
<br>work today you can be earning commissions for years
<br>to come.
<p>So do not just sell direct to your visitors. Entice your
<br>visitors to become affiliates as well.
<p>Show them the benefits of joining an affiliate program.
<br>Tell them how much money they could make. Motivate
<br>them to sign up as an affiliate under you.
<p>In the long run this strategy will prove to be very
<br>successful for you.
<p>Don't forget the 2nd tier. It may be more valuable than
<br>you think.
