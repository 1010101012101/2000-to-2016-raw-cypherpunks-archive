Seymore Mail Order

Gene sez I hear things. I heard that up until two months ago Seymore Butts 
was ready to make a deal to sell his mail order. He had a tentative 
interested party. There was a handshake and a promise from Seymore to call. 
He never called.

I think seymore might have retired. He hasen't updated his site or answered 
his message board in weeks. Even throughout his lawsuits and personal 
problems he answered his board, updated his site, and released new material 
every month. He hasn't done any of the above. I think maybe he claimed 
bankruptcy and decided to leave the business. Did anyone hear any rumers?

I haven't heard anything, but if he was really going to hang it up, I think 
he would have done so already. My guess, pure speculation, is that he's 
taking a good long break/vacation now that he's not in a court case and is 
free to leave California.

I don't think so speelie. I think he would have posted something on his 
message board that he used to update daily. Even through the crises with 
the court cases and the break ups with alisha and Shane, he still had time 
for his fans. Thanks for the reply.

Tampa Tushy Fest

 From the St. Petersburg Times, March 9, 2002: When Adam Glasser joined a 
bevy of California porn stars for a long weekend in Tampa in 1998, he did 
what has made him a brand name in adult films. He raised his camera and 
pushed "RECORD."

Famous in the industry under the name Seymore Butts, Glasser's niche is 
"gonzo" porn, which involves filming - and performing in - unscripted 
sexual encounters. This one took place between two women in a Dale Mabry 
motel room, in a town renowned - some would say infamous - for welcoming 
the sex industry.

The encounter's result was featured in Tampa Tushy-Fest, Part I, a film 
that Glasser says ranks among the most industry-lauded of the 100 he has made.

It might also send the 37-year-old filmmaker to jail, along with his 
mother, Lila, the bookkeeper for his San Fernando Valley office.

Next week, in a Los Angeles courtroom, the Glassers face trial on obscenity 
charges - the first such case to go to a jury there since 1993. Such 
defendants usually enter a plea and accept a fine, but Glasser decided to 
fight it.

The city claims that specific acts Glasser filmed in the Tampa motel room 
were so extreme, so far beyond other porn films, that the movie flouts the 
community standards of Los Angeles. The case will be closely watched as it 
could help define obscenity standards for the multibillion-dollar West 
Coast porn industry.

The case also will reinforce Tampa's longstanding reputation as a 
stronghold of the sex industry. Voyeur Web cams, a swingers group, sex 
shops, nude clubs: all have seized headlines in recent memory, largely 
through the city's efforts to shut them down. Bob Buckhorn, the council 
member who pushed a 1999 city ordinance banning lap dancing, has described 
Tampa as "the holy land for the porn industry."

"Inevitably, what you hear from visitors and new residents is, 'Why are 
there strip clubs on every corner?' " Buckhorn said. "We are world famous 
for this stuff."

And getting more attention all the time. A recent episode of the PBS 
documentary series Frontline dealt at length with the Tampa Tushy- Fest 
case. Tampa Tushy-Fest, Part II has been released.

What accounts for Tampa's allure to the sex industry? Those who work in it 
point to heavy tourist traffic, designated zones for strip clubs and 
loopholes that make it possible to open adult businesses near churches and 
schools.

And every September, the area plays host to an adult film awards gala 
hosted by Nightmoves, an Oldsmar-based adult magazine given out free in 
local sex shops.

"It isn't quite the holy land, but it's a very adult friendly atmosphere," 
Nightmoves publisher Paul Allen said. "We've got beautiful girls, beautiful 
weather. We've got the best attorneys we'll ever need. And guys like (nude 
club kingpin) Joe Redner have laid the groundwork."

Tampa's reputation as an adult-business haven has even permeated the world 
of sports. In the wake of the arrests of two National Hockey League players 
in a lap dancing raid, the NFL provided written warnings to all 31 teams 
about Tampa's sex entertainment just before Super Bowl XXXV in 2001.

Many of the nation's sportswriters could have written the warning 
themselves. During a national conference call of football writers in 1999, 
a moment of silence was observed to mourn a fire that had recently damaged 
a nude club on Courtney Campbell Parkway, the Tanga Lounge.

No one has sailed the winds of opportunity in Tampa better than Joe Redner. 
In the 1970s, Redner invested $1,600 in a dilapidated beer joint on 
Hillsborough Avenue, built a stage and opened a nude club called Night 
Gallery. Despite years of police raids, and what he estimates are 150 trips 
to jail, Redner owns three clubs, including the famous Mons Venus, and 
places his net worth at more than $10- million.

If his clubs are known for pushing boundaries, Redner says it's partly the 
government's doing. For years, the threat of a yanked liquor license forced 
clubs to limit their raunchiness. Dancers stayed on stage away from 
customers. When the government banned the sale of liquor at nude clubs in 
the late 1970s, the lap dance was born.

Luke Lirot, a First Amendment lawyer who represents Redner, said cities 
like Houston have far more strip clubs per capita than Tampa.

Tampa's reputation as a place overrun by sex businesses is a misconception 
fostered by the city's well-publicized efforts to police them, Lirot said. 
When the city tried to shut down Voyeur Dorm - a Web site that peeks on a 
household of young women - the case reached a federal appeals court and 
brought nationwide attention. "Now, when people think of Web cam stuff, 
they think of Tampa," Lirot said.

Lirot estimates thousands of adult-industry workers are in the Tampa Bay 
area, several hundred involved in making porn videos. For the annual 
Nightmoves awards, 30 or 40 porn stars fly in from around the country for a 
weekend of parties, radio gigs and appearances at adult clubs. It 
culminates in a black-tie gala.

Glasser recorded portions of Tampa Tushy-Fest at the 1998 gala. But the 
segment that brought the obscenity charge took place at the motel on Dale 
Mabry.

"I was really only taking advantage of the fact that there were other 
people from the industry from California who happened to be in town at the 
same time," said Glasser, who ate at a Dale Mabry Bennigan's every night of 
his Tampa trip because he lacked a car.

He and his mother could face 720 days in county jail if convicted on 
misdemeanor obscenity charges. The effect could be great on the porn 
industry, for the case could draw a new line that porn filmmakers would 
cross at their own peril.

The porn industry keeps getting more lucrative. The New York Times reported 
that Americans "pay more money for pornography in a year than they do on 
movie tickets, more than they do on all the performing arts combined . . . 
The porn business is estimated to total between $10-billion and $14-billion 
annually in the United States when you toss in porn networks and 
pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, Internet Web sites, in-room 
hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys and magazines."

George Cardona, chief of the criminal division in the Los Angeles City 
Attorney's office, said his office occasionally prosecutes cases like 
Glasser's in part to determine community standards of obscenity.

Glasser is defiant. The actors in his films were consenting adults, he 
says, and he defends some of his work as how-to films that are educational, 
providing "an oasis in the desert of the adult marketplace."

Glasser describes Tampa as a market burgeoning with potential porn- star 
talent. Some strippers who have suffered because of the city's lap dancing 
ban, he said, have turned to adult movies.

"The girls are probably more willing and interested now than ever," Glasser 
said.
