The academics think that TCPA technology is already solved.  I haven't
read the whole paper, but y'all might find it interesting.

You know, as long as we're discussing this pile of issues of
how do you bind keypairs to software entities, and what that means,
etc., the ESORICS paper I mentioned (a revised version of an older
tech report) has a lot of relevance.   "How, before TCPA,
I solved the problem of meaningfully binding keys to software entities
in a tricky hardware environment."

This work may have more relevance to open
platforms than England et al admit...
