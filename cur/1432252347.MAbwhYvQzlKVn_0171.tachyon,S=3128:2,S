dude, but you've apparently got, or had, bot!

Let's see what it looks like today:

Well, you've got 993 and 995 open, so 110 and 143 should probably go away.
Then, you've got VNC open to the worold: ARE YOU NUTS?

Your DNS is not recursing, and that's OK, although I question your need to
run one.  Basically, you look OK, except that the world still believes you
Got Bot.  You may wanna give SORBS a heads-up that you fixed it.  Sorry
about the public posting, but it's the only way to get it to you.
