I don't recall just now where I saw this, so I can not be sure of
its accuracy, but I am under the impression that existing policy
reciprocally allows Brits and Yanks to spy on each other's
peasantry, as long as they share back the intelligence gained.
Maybe a bit less so with the rest of the EU, but with US/UK a
certain historical and technological unity of 'security interests'
shapes public policy on issues related to all aspects of espionage..

Oh, wait, that was easy:  I was more or less right.
