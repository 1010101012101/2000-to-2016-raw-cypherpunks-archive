Terrorist:  One who uses terror as a means of coercion.

The word was originally coined to describe the committee of
public safety created by the french revolution, and was
subsequently used to decribe similar regimes, most of them
revolutionary, for example Lenin's.  However it is equally
applicable to non government groups who use similar measures. 
The difference between guerrilas and non government terrorists
is that terrorists target random innocents - for example
blowing up schoolchildren for accepting candy from US soldiers,
as recently happened in Iraq.  Similarly the deliberately
capricious executions by most communist regimes, intended to
produce a sense of fear and helplessness in their subjects.

McViegh did not target innocents.  Bin Laden did target
innocents.
