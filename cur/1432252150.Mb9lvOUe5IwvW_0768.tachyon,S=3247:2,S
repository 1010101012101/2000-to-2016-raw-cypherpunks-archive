Hi James,

This is an intriguing idea, but I don't understand how cancelling out
cycles of IOUs (which sounds very much like PledgeRoute, is that right?)
can be combined with Chaumian mixing of IOUs.

Let's say for the sake of argument that we've solved the problem of
finding a trustworthy party to perform the mixing.

Before mixing, Alice has an IOU from Bob. Alice has interacted with Bob
before and established a credit limit for him, so she knows how much an
IOU from him is worth. Alice puts her IOU into the mix and gets out
someone else's IOU. Now she has an IOU from someone she's never
interacted with. How does Alice know the IOU is worth anything?

Cheers,
Michael
