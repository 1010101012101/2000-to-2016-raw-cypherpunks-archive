Well, those are particularly interesting questions though I haven't given a
lot of thought to yet.

One of the things to notice is that these are fairly shallow waters in
general. And while I don't believe a scuba diver went down with a hedge
clippers, my assumption had been that someone had figured out some relatively
low-tech way to do it, and is probably trying much more often than
succeeding.

That said, these cables are not easy to break, not even by large boat anchors:
The cost of fixing a less engineered design would rapidly make it worthwhile
to ensure they can withstand a LOT, and they can. So I think it's worthwhile
considering who has the ability to do this sans clever tactics.

I was actually surprised to hear that two cables in close proximity were
broken and considered that not a coincidence. After three the pattern was
becoming clear.
