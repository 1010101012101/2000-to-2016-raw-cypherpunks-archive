Release of intelligence files on activists go public Sept 3rd
With over 3200 individuals and 200 organizations in the Denver P.D.'s 
misnamed, "intelligence database", it's a sure bet that if you think you're 
on the list then....
Procedures for picking up your spy files during a 60 day window have been 
released. After that the files will be destroyed and new files will be 
started under new guidelines. The new three-judge panel recommendations 
came from dubious sources such as the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU).
If you are an individual and/or group representative you need to fill out 
this Request for Intelligence File form. If you are trying to obtain a 
group file you need to fill out and have notarized an additional Affidavit 
of Representation form. Have these forms ready to go when the Spy Files 
Action takes place on Tuesday September 3rd at 5:30 pm.
