E-Bombs generate electromagnatic pulse which destroys any and all =
electric current running in any particular area it is detonated in. =
E-Bombs are a national threat and are being sold on the black market for =
$400 to terrorists. For the place that is being hit, it wipes out all =
electricity and is said to destroy all of the technological advances =
within the past 200 years. Basically they generate a large magnetic =
pulse (with a large coil of wire) which has a lot of current running =
through it. Then the chemical inside explodes touching the coil of wire =
causing it to be a moving short circut. When it hits, all current =
running through any metal or electricity-using object is destroyed. =
Terrorists in the middle east along with Iraq have been said to be =
researching this bomb for several years and have become a large threat =
to the United States. I hope that answers your question
