Alternatively, I think a copy of the non-spent coins will do the trick 
also.

So in your scenario, the predicate valuable(x) = valid_crypto_stamp(x) 
& not element(x, spent_coins).

In my scenario, valuable(x) = element(x, unspent_coins).

Why store the large set of spent coins when you can store the much 
smaller set of unspent coins?

There's no security issue I don't think.  In my scheme the bad guys can 
torture you and get access to the hash file, yes, but what's the point? 
  They still have to mount a multi-million dollar collision attack.  
It's much easier just to seize the gold in the vaults than fiddle 
around with some pathetic bits on a server.  Or if the digital coins 
are backed by something like e-bullion they can just torture you for 
the e-bullion password.

I don't understand your point here.  Why are my transaction costs 
greater than yours?  They might even be less.  The disk usage might be 
less, too.
