USA v. E-gold court documents:

http://cryptome.org/e-gold/usa-v-e-gold.htm

Describes e-gold's holdings stashed around the world, what was
seized by the USG (everything), the unceasing bludgeoning of the 
defendants by freezing their finances, refusing their attempts 
to cooperate, double-crossing, sweet-talking, lying and ratcheting 
up accusations, and inducing lawyers to abandon their bankrupted
clients. Dr. Jackson has to evict his parents to sell a house for
legal fees. Him and his parents now destitute. Feds didn't give
a shit, wanting to set an example for those who think the Internet
finance is borderless.

What the plea agreement says beyond the Fed's press release could
tell more about e-gold serving as a hostage and informant, well, 
except for the secret parts concerning the running of honeypots
and placing rats inside the schemers offshore lairs.
