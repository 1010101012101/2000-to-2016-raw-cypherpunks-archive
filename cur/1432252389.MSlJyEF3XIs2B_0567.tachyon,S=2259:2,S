What has happened so far is that "corporate lawyers" have lost,
and linux has won - that is to say, corporations using linux
have successfully defended their right to do so.  Compare with
what happens to tax evaders.

The state is your enemy.  The corporation is your friend.  It
was corporations that defended linux in court, and created
substantial parts of linux - for example a lot of linux was
written by IBM employees on IBM salary - presumably as an anti
microsoft measure.   Corporations deal with competition by
creating stuff, governments deal with competition by shooting
it.

The corporation is free and voluntary association.  The
alternative is state imposed association.
