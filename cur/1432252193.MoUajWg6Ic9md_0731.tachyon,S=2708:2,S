For those interested, here is someone's official response about the
Technical Report and its implications for the Tor network:

http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/anonymous/2007/02/26/the-rumors-of-our-demise/

Does anyone know who authored that?  It seems a bit strange to have an
anonymous official statement, but maybe this is appropriate for Tor ;-)

Here is an FAQ by one of the Tech Report's authors:
