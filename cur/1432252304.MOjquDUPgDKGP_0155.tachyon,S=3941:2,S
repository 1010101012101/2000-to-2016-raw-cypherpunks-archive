I beleive it was Eric Hughes who at a Cypherpunks meeting about four
years ago, said "the solution isn't key escrow, it's document escrow".
Which makes sense- a business doesn't (or shouldn't) allow employees
to keep a single copy of an important document on their hard drive.
It should be replicated in other known places in case of disaster (drive
failure, stolen computer, employee hit by bus, etc).  Just because
documents are encrypted doesn't mean that this practice is abandoned.

One can envision a system where there's a corporate "document czar" who
is regularly given docs from various employees and who then encrypts them
in his own key.  When and where the docs get decrypted is determined by
corporate policies.  No key escrow required.

I don't know of any existing system like this, but formal corporate
document control isn't my field.
