"September 10th, 2015: China’s Shanghai Gold Exchange announces that
physical gold bullion will be allowed to be used as collateral on
future’s contracts, beginning September 29th, 2015. “This development
is an important one for the gold market and is bullish for gold. It
shows, once again, that gold is slowly but surely becoming a cash
equivalent and as money again. Gold’s re-monetisation in the
international financial and monetary system continues.”

I may have posted the following a while back, not sure: Russia Reserve
Bank buys the majority (all?) of internal/Russia mined gold, most/all
of internal consumer gold is imported; the internal production is
roughly 20 tonnes a month, and I think Russia's reserves are around
1300 tonnes at this point. This is just the publicly official amount,
real amounts may be different.

China is stockpiling gold similarly rapidly.

It certainly goes hand in hand with their evident intention to jump
ship off the petro dollar, with BRICS, AIIB, SCO, EEU etc. And with
the US govt now 6 months bankrupt, without a further extension of
emergency funding measures and without an increase in the debt ceiling
we will see the full reset to some new "US reserve note/fiat" on or
shortly after October 30 (when the USGov next assesses their emergency
funding/ debt ceiling situation). Frankly, now that there is so much
selling of USGov securities:

"China dumping Treasurys? Here's what you must know"

And a very recent commentary:
http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/14/what-china-selling-us-treasurys-really-means-commentary.html
which interestingly concludes interestingly "In other words, the world
is not choking on U.S. debt, instead, there is a relative shortage of
it."

We'll see in time. I have no doubt they (USG/Federal Reserve Bank) can
QE (print money) their way for another round or three, the only
question is what is in their (maximal) interest - reset now, or QE
again.

"Diversification" in the face of a soon to collapse world reserve
currency, USD, makes sense though.
