That's because you're on the toad.com node.  I'm going to send this 
note there because otherwise you probably won't see it; but you need 
to sign up for one of the other nodes and get off toad if you want to 
see much of anything that isn't spam.  Outside of toad, the ratio is 
closer to fifty-fifty.

go to http://anon.efga.org/Remailers/ for recent updates.  Pick the 
ones you think are best from the information there.  I recommend a 
mixmaster remailer rather than a first-generation 'cypherpunk' 
remailer, but other than that you're on your own.  For different 
uses and different operations, different remailers will be more 
reliable. 

I also recommend never using only one remailer.
