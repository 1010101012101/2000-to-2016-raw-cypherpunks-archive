According to the LA Times at 
<http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/updates2/lat_cameras010201.htm>,
police used real-time face recognition systems to scan the faces
of about 100,000 people who attended the Super Bowl in person. The
cameras were hidden. 19 people with "criminal histories" were 
identified, but no arrests were made.

The article quotes usual suspects like Bruce Schneier, Cliff Stoll,
and Erwin Chemerinksy saying that the system is troubling, as well
as an Oakland Raiders official who views it positively.

Per the article, "[o]ther applications are expected to include ATM
machines and public events such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City."
