As before, take these issues to the realworld political front.

If you're a coder, you can write all the code you want.
If you're a user, you can use whatever code you want.
If you're EFF/ACLU, you can publish all the press releases
and fight all the cases under already written laws you want.

Yet politicians generally ignore the above groups because they don't
have much if any direct political action component that affects them.

What's needed is a permanent political fixture and operation similar
to the American NRA. These guys have a real, ongoing, political
agenda and impact. Candidates are actually afraid of and responsive
to the NRA's political clout... before they get elected, and before
laws get enacted... not after. The NRA email, fax, letter and call
trees, and their members who visit their legislators and stage in
public view... are very effective. Look at the banner scroller in
the upper right half of their homepage... they have a broad and
deep approach to issue outreach/embedding, even a lifestyle. Labor
unions and others are common examples of such organization. They
all do it by leveraging large monoculture bases to politics.

The NRA is 3.5M - 5.0M members strong. They turn $250M/yr from that
base (manufacturers too). They have little difference of opinion
in their ranks. They are good at crafting and pitching political
rhetoric, framing the conversation, and rendering complex issues
into simple forms that resonate with their entire base.

The EFF/ACLU representing the internet are tiny in comparison. Yet
the internet has a household penetration rate of 70%, more than
firearms rate of 35%... so a big untapped culture there. Finding 5
million (or 2% of population) internet users should be simple task.

Unfortunately, right now there are many tens of flag groups [1]
mostly doing their own thing on the net. That's not good enough,
and is confusingly diverse to both users and politicians. They need
to join together to craft and coordinate the users under a single
general banner they've been subconsciously waiting to fall in line
behind, and then start firing out actionable political things for
them to do.

Internet users could demonstrate solidarity on issues with a typical
Million User March [1]. They need to start raking in money for their
war chest and to fund ongoing operations, etc. Just like the NRA...
doing everything needed to become, and be, a strong integrated
ongoing political force to be reckoned with.

speech, freedom, copyright/filesharing, no data collecting, mining,
