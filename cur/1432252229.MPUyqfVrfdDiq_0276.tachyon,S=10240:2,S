AP IMPACT: Framed for child porn b by a PC virus

* By JORDAN ROBERTSON, AP Technology Writer - Sun Nov 8, 2009 12:17PM EST

Of all the sinister things that Internet viruses do, this might be the worst:
They can make you an unsuspecting collector of child pornography.

Heinous pictures and videos can be deposited on computers by viruses b the
malicious programs better known for swiping your credit card numbers. In this
twist, it's your reputation that's stolen.

Pedophiles can exploit virus-infected PCs to remotely store and view their
stash without fear they'll get caught. Pranksters or someone trying to frame
you can tap viruses to make it appear that you surf illegal Web sites.

Whatever the motivation, you get child porn on your computer b and might not
realize it until police knock at your door.

An Associated Press investigation found cases in which innocent people have
been branded as pedophiles after their co-workers or loved ones stumbled upon
child porn placed on a PC through a virus. It can cost victims hundreds of
thousands of dollars to prove their innocence.

Their situations are complicated by the fact that actual pedophiles often
blame viruses b a defense rightfully viewed with skepticism by law
enforcement.

"It's an example of the old `dog ate my homework' excuse," says Phil Malone,
director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet &
Society. "The problem is, sometimes the dog does eat your homework."

The AP's investigation included interviewing people who had been found with
child porn on their computers. The AP reviewed court records and spoke to
prosecutors, police and computer examiners.

One case involved Michael Fiola, a former investigator with the Massachusetts
agency that oversees workers' compensation.

In 2007, Fiola's bosses became suspicious after the Internet bill for his
state-issued laptop showed that he used 4 1/2 times more data than his
colleagues. A technician found child porn in the PC folder that stores images
viewed online.

Fiola was fired and charged with possession of child pornography, which
carries up to five years in prison. He endured death threats, his car tires
were slashed and he was shunned by friends.

Fiola and his wife fought the case, spending $250,000 on legal fees. They
liquidated their savings, took a second mortgage and sold their car.

An inspection for his defense revealed the laptop was severely infected. It
was programmed to visit as many as 40 child porn sites per minute b an
inhuman feat. While Fiola and his wife were out to dinner one night, someone
logged on to the computer and porn flowed in for an hour and a half.

Prosecutors performed another test and confirmed the defense findings. The
charge was dropped b 11 months after it was filed.

The Fiolas say they have health problems from the stress of the case. They
say they've talked to dozens of lawyers but can't get one to sue the state,
because of a cap on the amount they can recover.

"It ruined my life, my wife's life and my family's life," he says.

The Massachusetts attorney general's office, which charged Fiola, declined
interview requests.

At any moment, about 20 million of the estimated 1 billion Internet-connected
PCs worldwide are infected with viruses that could give hackers full control,
according to security software maker F-Secure Corp. Computers often get
infected when people open e-mail attachments from unknown sources or visit a
malicious Web page.

Pedophiles can tap viruses in several ways. The simplest is to force someone
else's computer to surf child porn sites, collecting images along the way. Or
a computer can be made into a warehouse for pictures and videos that can be
viewed remotely when the PC is online.

"They're kind of like locusts that descend on a cornfield: They eat up
everything in sight and they move on to the next cornfield," says Eric
Goldman, academic director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara
University. Goldman has represented Web companies that discovered child
pornographers were abusing their legitimate services.

But pedophiles need not be involved: Child porn can land on a computer in a
sick prank or an attempt to frame the PC's owner.

In the first publicly known cases of individuals being victimized, two men in
the United Kingdom were cleared in 2003 after viruses were shown to have been
responsible for the child porn on their PCs.

In one case, an infected e-mail or pop-up ad poisoned a defense contractor's
PC and downloaded the offensive pictures.

In the other, a virus changed the home page on a man's Web browser to display
child porn, a discovery made by his 7-year-old daughter. The man spent more
than a week in jail and three months in a halfway house, and lost custody of
his daughter.

Chris Watts, a computer examiner in Britain, says he helped clear a hotel
manager whose co-workers found child porn on the PC they shared with him.

Watts found that while surfing the Internet for ways to play computer games
without paying for them, the manager had visited a site for pirated software.
It redirected visitors to child porn sites if they were inactive for a
certain period.

In all these cases, the central evidence wasn't in dispute: Pornography was
on a computer. But proving how it got there was difficult.

Tami Loehrs, who inspected Fiola's computer, recalls a case in Arizona in
which a computer was so "extensively infected" that it would be "virtually
impossible" to prove what an indictment alleged: that a 16-year-old who used
the PC had uploaded child pornography to a Yahoo group.

Prosecutors dropped the charge and let the boy plead guilty to a separate
crime that kept him out of jail, though they say they did it only because of
his age and lack of a criminal record.

Many prosecutors say blaming a computer virus for child porn is a new version
of an old ploy.

"We call it the SODDI defense: Some Other Dude Did It," says James Anderson,
a federal prosecutor in Wyoming.

However, forensic examiners say it would be hard for a pedophile to get away
with his crime by using a bogus virus defense.

"I personally would feel more comfortable investing my retirement in the
lottery before trying to defend myself with that," says forensics specialist
Jeff Fischbach.

Even careful child porn collectors tend to leave incriminating e-mails, DVDs
or other clues. Virus defenses are no match for such evidence, says Damon
King, trial attorney for the U.S. Justice Department's Child Exploitation and
Obscenity Section.

But while the virus defense does not appear to be letting real pedophiles out
of trouble, there have been cases in which forensic examiners insist that
legitimate claims did not get completely aired.

Loehrs points to Ned Solon of Casper, Wyo., who is serving six years for
child porn found in a folder used by a file-sharing program on his computer.

Solon admits he used the program to download video games and adult porn b but
not child porn. So what could explain that material?

Loehrs testified that Solon's antivirus software wasn't working properly and
appeared to have shut off for long stretches, a sign of an infection. She
found no evidence the five child porn videos on Solon's computer had been
viewed or downloaded fully. The porn was in a folder the file-sharing program
labeled as "incomplete" because the downloads were canceled or generated an
error.

This defense was curtailed, however, when Loehrs ended her investigation in a
dispute with the judge over her fees. Computer exams can cost tens of
thousands of dollars. Defendants can ask the courts to pay, but sometimes
judges balk at the price. Although Loehrs stopped working for Solon, she
argues he is innocent.

"I don't think it was him, I really don't," Loehrs says. "There was too much
evidence that it wasn't him."

The prosecution's forensics expert, Randy Huff, maintains that Solon's
antivirus software was working properly. And he says he ran other antivirus
programs on the computer and didn't find an infection b although security
experts say antivirus scans frequently miss things.

"He actually had a very clean computer compared to some of the other cases I
do," Huff says.

The jury took two hours to convict Solon.

"Everybody feels they're innocent in prison. Nobody believes me because
that's what everybody says," says Solon, whose case is being appealed. "All I
know is I did not do it. I never put the stuff on there. I never saw the
stuff on there. I can only hope that someday the truth will come out."

But can it? It can be impossible to tell with certainty how a file got onto a
PC.

"Computers are not to be trusted," says Jeremiah Grossman, founder of
WhiteHat Security Inc. He describes it as "painfully simple" to get a
computer to download something the owner doesn't want b whether it's a
program that displays ads or one that stores illegal pictures.

It's possible, Grossman says, that more illicit material is waiting to be
discovered.

"Just because it's there doesn't mean the person intended for it to be there
b whatever it is, child porn included."
