The "making false statements to officers" bit is only about Official 
Investigations.

It doesn't cover lying to your next door neighbor the cop, lying about 
what speed one was traveling at, or lying on a news broadcast he may be 
watching. (Even if he's an Official Investigator!)


Also, convicting someone of "making false statements" is fairly 
difficult, and such prosecutions and convictions are rare.
