Worse, why limit a cypherpunks list to only those who
use encryption? Several of the cpunks' bastard offsprings set
up their own gated communities, unable to put up with those
who ridiculed their advocacy of really really opinionated
discussion of the glories of crypto.

What has been learned since early days of cypherpunks
is that all encryption is faulty and survives on willing suspension
of disbelief. Not the math, oh never, which is as infallible as the
Pope and Muhammad, it's the disbelievers in other people's
faith-based communities and who are dedicated to finding faults
over there to divert attention from those in here.

Still, even back then, encrypted messages were posted by
enthusiasts. Nobody answered, many said get the fuck out.
