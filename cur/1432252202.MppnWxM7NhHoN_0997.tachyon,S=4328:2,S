I don't believe that particular 'boundary condition' was included in the
original question/point. In fact, injecting spurious boundary conditions
after the problem is presented (ie "Oh, I meant to include...) is itself
considered bad form, logically speaking.

As to the point, if nations can't participate in terrorism then exactly
what is it that Afghanistan is being theatened with for harboring the
raghead? Exactly why did their leaders go into hiding again? Exactly why is 
Pakistan running around like a sub-woofie? Exactly why did the US use
F-111's to drop bombs on a particular 'rogue state' for engaging in
'terrorism' (ie Libya)? What exactly do you thing Amin was doing, besides
killing croc's that is...

You've got your beenie wound too tight junior.
