For those not familiar with the murder of US Attorney
Thomas Wales in October 2001, there's a long account in
The New Yorker, August 2007:

FBI standing offer of $1million reward for nabbing the killer:

Greg Broiles offers an informative archive of the trial and
conviction of CJ:

This is not to suggest that CJ had anything to do with the
Wales shooting. However, there may be a connection
to this forum's yelling about government officials "needing
killing." More documentation on this in Greg's CJ archive.

In contrast to this grim shit, read the uplifting spin of
Cypherpunks on Wikipedia:
