The US government benefits greatly from dissidents in North Korea, 
China, Russia, Japan, and Germany being able to effectively use Tor
to exfiltrate business intelligence and leak it to the people that
run this country, the campaign contributors.

The ability to use Tor to anonymously gather information about what
multinational companies are planning to do is very valuable to said
multinational companies. What's amusing about this is it's good for
the CEOs, security officers, security agencies, and sentient high
frequency trading AI's, but not very good for most investors.

The US government is not a single entity, it is full of people who
have biases, turf battles, and mixed loyalties. So there are parts
that fund tor, for ideological reasons, and parts that hate it, and
they are playing very long-term battles with each other, in addition
to the perceived 'battle' between the noble cypherpunks and the
despotic good for nothing government
