Just received word from Jim that there are some law enforcement types going
through a search of his house, apparently with 'authorization'. He was
downstairs when his mother let them in, so says he didn't know what their
explanation was for their appearance, what they were looking for, or what
his mother had to say to them or vice-versa.

If possible he will post info and details to cpunks later.
