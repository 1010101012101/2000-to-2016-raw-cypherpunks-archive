The Ames Strain of Anthrax wasn't "developed" in Ames, It was "discovered".
It was naturally occurring strain that was resistant to the anti-biotics
that were used to treat Anthrax at the time.

It is very commonly used in the study and research of bacteria, and up to a
few years ago  could be easily ordered from lab supply houses (as long as it
looked like an "offical" research organization, the company sent it).

It took a  white-supremicist scientist ordering it and then driving around
with it in the trunk of his car to convince the government more restrictions
to be put in place.
