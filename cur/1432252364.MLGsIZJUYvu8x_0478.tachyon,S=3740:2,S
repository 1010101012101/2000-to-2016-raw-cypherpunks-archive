We failed to save a copy of Steven Levy's Palladium article in Newsweek 
and online at MSNBC, now withdrawn by MSNBC. We can find no copy 
online. Whoever save a copy: we would like to receive it for publication to 
assure its continued availability.

A Microsoft programmer, John DeTreville, named in the alleged 
"Palladium" patent published on Cryptome, has written us 
(copy below) to deny the ms-drm-os patent is Palladium -- which 
he claims is based on another patent or several of them. We would 
appreciate leads on which patent or patents he is referring to.

Thanks.

Are you a good contact person for the information on the Microsoft 
DRM patent (6,330,670) on cryptome.org?

The pages linked from http://cryptome.org/ms-drm-os.htm say that 
the authors of this patent (England, DeTreville, and Lampson) were 
identified by Newsweek as Palladium programmers.

I can reliably state that I (DeTreville) am not a Palladium programmer, 
and neither is Butler Lampson.

I believe that the Newsweek article was referring to a different patent. 
I'm sure that the Palladium participants jointly hold a significant number 
of important patents in the field of computer security.

Cheers,

John
