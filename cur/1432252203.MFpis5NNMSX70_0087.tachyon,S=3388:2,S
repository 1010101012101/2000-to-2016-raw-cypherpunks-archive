Unfortunately they've become either just another Crypto clone (FC in the last
year or two) or a collection of XML/J2EE/buzzword-du-jour be-ins (all the
rest).  The world still needs a good, technical e-commerce security conference
which isn't one of the above.

I'd love to see it resurrected.  While I can't really organise it because of
where I am, I'd be happy to referee papes or whatever.  Having served on PCs
for several other security conferences, I've seen enough papers of the
appropriate kind submitted elsewhere to indicate that there'd be enough for an
e-commerce security conference (in other words there's no shortage of material
there).  The Usenix one, during its short lifetime, attracted some really good
papers.
