The SPLC satisfies the description of "hate group" at least as much, and
probably more so, than any of the groups that it catalogs and denigrates.
Which suggests that ICANN should be contacted, with a demand that they
de-list SPLC for the appropriate reasons.  Naturally, they'll come back with
all sorts of 1st-amendment reasons they shouldn't, all of which should have
been applied to the vote-swap issue.
