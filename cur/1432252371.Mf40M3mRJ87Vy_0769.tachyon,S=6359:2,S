Dear Friend, 



The following is Part I of a two part program sent to me. 
This new program will cost you NOTHING to join!! 

We will be using the same multi-level principles as the $5 program, 
but you will 
not have to send $5 to anyone. 

In fact, we'll be using as a vehicle a company already in 
existence which pays you $2 to sign up! 

You have the potential to make a $16,000 easily and legally, using 
the 
compensation plan of an already existing internet company. 

The program has been divided into two parts so as to minimize the 
risk of damage 
due to spam (did I mention don't spam?? :)). Email me immediately 
that you're 
interested and I will send you Part II which contains the real meat of 
the 
program. 

My friend from my upline warns it will be to your best advantage 
if you join immediately because this new company will take off fast! 

I am REALLY excited about this one!! 

I hope to hear from you soon! 
Dixie 

The program introduction and instructions start below the line: 
_____________________________________________________
___________________________ 

BEGINNING NOTE: 
Save a copy of this email 
because you will use it later on 
when you join the program. 

*********************************************************** 
***THIS IS PART I OF OUR 2-PART PROGRAM*** 
*********************************************************** 

Introducing... 

"THE MOTHER OF ALL FREE AFFILIATE $$$ MAKING IDEAS!" 

"Chain Letter" type programs have a BAD REPUTATION! 
They break down for several reasons, 
but the primary one is the fear of being "ripped off" 
when you are asked to send money to total strangers. 
Also, a secondary fear...you might just be doing something illegal or 
unethical. 
And lastly, just one spamming entrant to a list will cause ALL 
accounts on the 
list to be cancelled by their respective service providers.  
Consequently, the 
program runs of all participants on the list are aborted...stopped dead 
on their 
tracks! 

Thus you will hear the most common snide remark against chain-
letter programs: 
"I tried it...but it NEVER worked!" 

Our answer to the first 2 concerns is in the cost of the program... 

************************************ 
Make it ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! 
************************************ 

*~ NO Sign-up Fees! 
*~ NO Postage and Handling Fees! 
*~ NO Backorders of Delivery Delays! 
*~ NO Meetings! 
*~ NO "Now you have to Upgrade to make your $$$!" 
*~ NO One loses one cent! 

Because it is FREE, it is legal, moral and ethical. 

As for the last concern, the present program now contains... 

***************************************** 
BUILT-IN  SECURITY MEASURES 
***************************************** 

BONUS!!!  Participation in the program 
will generate for you 3 safe lists corresponding 
to 3 different levels in the program. 

MORE BONUS!!!  Get 4 FREE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS 
that you can use for this program. 

OK!  Send me Part II 
so that I will know how to... 

**************************************** 
GET $16,000 in just a few weeks!!! 
**************************************** 

TO JOIN THE PROGRAM, JUST REPLY TO THIS EMAIL

You have NOTHING to lose, 
and a LOT of money to gain. 

IMPORTANT: 
This is a private downline club. 
As a condition for participation, 
each participant must agree to the conditions 
set forth in the Pledge of Honor below. 

PLEDGE OF HONOR
