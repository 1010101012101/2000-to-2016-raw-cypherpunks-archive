120-130 years ago, there was a privately owned toll road between Los Gatos
and Santa Cruz.  Now there is a publicly owned road, with no toll, and I
haven't heard much call to go back to the old days.  Why are the vast
majority of people happy with the current situation?  Some ideas:

* Paying for roads through gas taxes has much lower transaction costs (in
both time and money) than paying tolls.  The modern electronic toll systems
are a relatively new development, and while they compromise privacy, that
privacy will soon be lost to the cameras.

* People like the direct influence on road decisions that the political
process allows.  In the case of the Los Gatos -- Santa Cruz road, the
people in Santa Cruz county who don't want their county to be a bedroom
community for Silicon Valley have kept the road a twisty 4 lane freeway.

Any more ideas?

Cheers - Bill
