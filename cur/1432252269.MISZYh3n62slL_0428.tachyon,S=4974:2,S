What Petraeus & Broadwell *Should* Have Done

Remember, when trying to hide things from the FBI, no method is perfect,
especially when they're already on your trail. The following tools are
not 100% foolproof, but if employed early would have made for a much more
convoluted game of cat and mouse, and might even have concealed the amorous
activity long enough for the general and his fatal attraction to have
escaped unscathed.

* 1. PGP Encryption <http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-pgp.htm>:* PGP stands
for "pretty good privacy," and that's exactly what it is. The service
encrypts data, like emails, which would have been another hurdle for the
FBI to jump through. If this method would have been used, it would have
forced Uncle Sam to deploy Trojan-style spyware onto Broadwellbs computer
to uncover the emails. With Google snitching the General out, PGP might not
have worked. For regular folks though, this tool is a good start.

*2. Hide Your IP:* Tools like Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>, an open
source method to conceal real IP addresses and Web browsing, would have
masked their IP address identification. Another is
Hamachi<http://hamachi.en.softonic.com/>,
an app that creates free, encrypted Virtual Private
Networks<http://lifehacker.com/5763170/how-to-secure-and-encrypt-your-web-browsing-on-public-networks-with-hamachi-and-privoxy>
(VPNs)
between computers. Just use the VPN every time you log in, and don't log in
from your home IP, and you should be safer. Well, unless you're
LulzSec<http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-mull-fraudster-database-in-wake-of-lulzec-fiasco-111006/>
that
is.

*3. Disposable Email:* This message will self destruct after reading.
Really. If the General really was 007, or even 007-ish, he would have used
this method. Disposable email functions much like it sounds, with messages
that are deleted after reading. Disposable email services include
Spamex<http://www.spamex.com/>
 and Mailinator <http://www.mailinator.com/>, which were originally
designed to keep out spam, not the Feds.

*4. Don't Send Messages Online Period!* Keep it offline! If this was 1972,
short of the U.S. Postal Service intercepting their mail, this would have
been the ideal method, and some inquisitive papparazzi snapping a photo
would have been all they would have had to worry about. While the two
*did* spend
a good deal of time together in-person (Broadwell apparently traveled
overseas to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit Petraeus), they might have been
safer to keep the relationship in person only. The only truly private way
to use email? Don't!
