I keep having the same conversation over and over again with various reporters 
from various news agencies. I've put up a [blog post]
(https://blog.torproject.org/blog/rumors-tors-compromise-are-greatly-
exaggerated) as our answer.  The content of the blog post is also included 
below.

# Rumors of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated

Recently, there are two stories claiming the Tor network is
compromised. It seems it is easier to get press than to publish research,
work with us on the details, and further, to propose solutions. Our
comments are based upon the same stories you are reading. We have
no insider information.

The first story has been around 'Freedom Hosting' and their
hosting of child abuse materials as exposed by [Anonymous Operation
Darknet](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/anonymous-takes-down-
darknet-child-porn-site-on-tor-network.ars).
We're reading the press articles, pastebin urls, and talking
to the same people as you. It appears 'Anonymous'
cracked the Apache/PHP/MySQL setup at Freedom Hosting
and published some, or all, of their users in the
database. These sites happened to be hosted on a [Tor hidden
servce](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en). Further,
'Anonymous' used an old denial of service
attack on 'Freedom Hosting' known as the
[slowloris](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Slowloris)
attack. It's a simple resource starvation attack that can be conducted
over low bandwidth, low resource requirement connections to individual
hosts. This isn't an attack on Tor, but rather an attack on some software
behind a Tor hidden service. This attack was discussed in a thread on the
[tor-talk](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-
October/021822.html)
mailing list starting October 19th.

The second story is around Eric Filiol's claims of compromising
the Tor network leading up to his Hackers to Hackers talk in
Brazil in a few days. This was initially announced by some French
press websites; however, it has spread further, such as this [Hackers
Brazil in a few days. This claim was initially announced by some French
websites; however, it has spread further, such as this [Hacker
News](http://thehackernews.com/2011/10/tor-anonymizing-network-compromised-
by.html)
story.

Again, the
[tor-talk](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-
October/021722.html)
mailing list had the first discussions of these attacks back on October
13th.  To be clear, neither Eric nor his researchers have disclosed
anything about this attack to us. They have not talked to us, nor shared
any data with us &mdash; despite some mail exchanges where we reminded him 
about
the phrase "responsible disclosure". Here's the attack as we understand
it, from reading the various press reports:

They enumerated 6000 IP addresses that they think
are Tor relays. There aren't that many Tor relays in the world &mdash;
[2500](https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html) is a more accurate
number. We're not sure what caused them to overcount so much. Perhaps
they watched the Tor network over a matter of weeks and collected a
bunch of addresses that aren't relays anymore? The set of relays is
public information, so there's no reason to collect a list and no reason
to end up with a wrong list.

One-third of the machines on those IP addresses are vulnerable to
operating system or other system level attacks, meaning he can break
in. That's quite a few! We wonder if that's true with the real Tor
network, or just their simulated one? Even ignoring the question of
what these 3500 extra IP addresses are, it's important to remember that
one-third by number is not at all the same as one-third by capacity:
Tor clients load-balance over relays based on the relay capacity, so
any useful statement should be about how much of the *capacity* of the
Tor network is vulnerable. It would indeed be shocking if one-third of
the Tor network by capacity is vulnerable to external attacks.

(There's also an aside about enumerating bridges. They say they found
181 bridges, and then there's a quote saying they "now have a complete
picture of the topography of Tor", which is a particularly unfortunate
time for that quote since there are currently around 600 bridges running.)

We expect the talk will include discussion about some cool Windows trick
that can modify the crypto keys in a running Tor relay that you have
local system access to; but it's simpler and smarter just to say that
when the attacker has local system access to a Tor relay, the attacker
controls the relay.

Once they've broken into some relays, they do congestion attacks like
[packet spinning](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#torspinISC08) to congest
the relays they couldn't compromise, to drive users toward the relays
they own. It's unclear how many resources are needed to keep the rest
of the relays continuously occupied long enough to keep the user from
using them. There are probably some better heuristics that clients
can use to distinguish between a loaded relay and an unavailable relay;
we look forward to learning how well their attack here actually worked.

>From there, the attack gets vague. The only hint we have is this nonsense
sentence from the article:

  The remaining flow can then be decrypted via a fully method of attack
  called "to clear unknown" based on statistical analysis.

Do they have a new attack on AES, or on OpenSSL's implementation of it,
or on our use of OpenSSL? Or are they instead doing some sort of timing
attack, where if you own the client's first hop and also the destination
you can use statistics to confirm that the two flows are on the same
circuit? There's a history of [confused
researchers](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough) proclaiming
some sort of novel active attack when passive correlation attacks are much
simpler and just as effective.

So the summary of the attack might be "take control of the nodes you can,
then congest the other ones so your targets avoid them and use the nodes
you control. Then do some unspecified magic crypto attack to defeat the
layers of encryption for later hops in the circuit." But really, these are
just guesses based on the same news articles you're reading. We look
forwarding to finding out if there's actually an attack we can fix,
or if they are just playing all the journalists to get attention.

More generally, there are two broader lessons to remember here. First,
research into anonymity-breaking attacks is how the field moves forward,
and using Tor for your target is [common](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/)
because a) it's resistant to all the simpler attacks and b) we make it
[really easy](https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/research.html.en)
to do your research on. And second, remember that most other anonymity
systems out there fall to these attacks so quickly and thoroughly that
no researchers even talk about it anymore. For some recent examples, see
the single-hop proxy discussions in [How Much Anonymity does Network
Latency Leak?](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#tissec-latency-leak)
and [Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing Based Anonymization
Networks](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes11-panchenko).

I thank Roger, Nick, and Runa for helping with this post.
