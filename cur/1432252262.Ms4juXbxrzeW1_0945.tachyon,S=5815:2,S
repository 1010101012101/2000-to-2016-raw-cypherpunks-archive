I hadn't though about it this way until now, but having the ability to
achieve full anonymity on the internet enables things like this, and
assassination markets might not be the first or most viscous thing enabled
by anonymity.

I can imagine that if assassination markets were to take off, you'd see
some large bounties (in excess of $100k) on every major politician in the
world. Pretty much any figure of high popularity would probably have some
sort of assassination bounty on their head, because the more popular you
are, the more haters you have.

What other sorts of unacceptable things could you do given fully anonymous
money coupled with a fully anonymous internet identity? I can think of:

website takedowns
funding murder, rape, arson, etc.
bombing certain buildings
funding smear campaigns (say, tear the clothes off a popular celebrity or
something)
bounties for drugs, child porn, etc.
kidnappings
doxing

You could basically attempt to crowd fund any illegal activity.
