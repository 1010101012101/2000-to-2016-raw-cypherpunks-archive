I think that solving unlicensed drones will be simpler to solve than 3d
printers making banned products, and products which need licenses.

It is illegal to make a gun totally out of plastic parts, which can go thru
airport and other metal detectors without being detected.  That ban worked,
until 3d printers.  3D printers now make all sorts of guns.  I saw some
tested on TV news, including multi magazine capacity assault weapons.  They
only get off a few shots, then break, but that technology will soon be
perfected.

With drones, simply have a law saying that any drone outdoors, or on private
property, must have some standard means of identifying their registration,
when asked, and if fail to do so, their owners have no recourse if they get
shot down.  Either they have printed labeling visible from the ground, with
the name of their operating organization, or they respond on the kind of
frequency used by air traffic control, with the kind of transponder a
commercial piloted aircraft uses.
