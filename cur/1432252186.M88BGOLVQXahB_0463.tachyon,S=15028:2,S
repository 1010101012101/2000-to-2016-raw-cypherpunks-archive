Thanks for the whitepaper, I'll have a look when I've the time.

IIRC the DH signing keys are bound the the account ID. Appelbaum 
recommended in his 31c3 talk 'Reconstructing Narratives' that users 
rotate their OTR keys often and verify the hash using off-band channel.
I'm not sure it's a convenient thing users have to re-add their contacts 
every time the DH signing key needs to be refreshed. It's sort of good 
thing users are immediately using the public signing key (Tox ID) but 
the issue is, while the Tox ID doesn't have to be secret, it must be 
authentic: so users unaware of this can be subjected to MITM attack.

This only changes the type of attack: a keylogger has to be used along 
the private key exfiltration tool.

I would argue the current OTR/PGP/ZRTP implementation has limited 
lifespan regardless of execution, given the fact intelligence community 
is expanding end-point exploitation to mass surveillance levels: 
methodology is changing, not the scale:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FScSpFZjFf0&t=37m35s

There's a lot of misconception on 0-days being expensive 
'one-time-hacks' that must be used only when necessary. How many 
anti-virus programs detect and report these? What percentage of users 
are running some sort of IDS? How many users assume sudden system crash 
is due to malfunctioning exploit/payload? A 0-day is more like a master 
key for given OS with average lifespan of 300 days ( 
http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~tdumitra/public_documents/bilge12_zero_day.pdf )

I agree it should be separate. I tried to keep that section short and 
the intention
was to provide contrast and show each of these can be addressed 
simultaneously.
