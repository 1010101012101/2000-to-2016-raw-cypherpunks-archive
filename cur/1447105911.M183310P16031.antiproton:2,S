Whata hell of news, that email is not and never ever been secure
communication method. Same as Moxie defined SMS as hell of unsecure
because of metadata.
We know that already no? Same way we know that Web Of Trust is huge leak
of trust and security.
But count with GPG/PGP on long run. It could be important now who are
you talking with but it could be possible that on long run will be
important what are you telling.
Fact is that statistical analysis is bitch and it is pretty hard to hide
all kind of metadata traces you are producing.
Minimalize damage use at least encryption on level of email content.
OTR over facebook chat or Google chat protocol or whatever will leak
same amount of metadata because you share willingly when you are online
sometimes contact or who are you talking with.
This sword have two edges - we want to communicate and mostly socialise
but we do not want to leak who do we make love during lunch break with,
right?
Paranoia is nice and expected thing here but lets think reasonably -
usability versus security.

Of course could be really nice idea to strip all metadata from our
communication on some practical level but lest admit that email will
never be worth that work and it was never ever designed like that.
