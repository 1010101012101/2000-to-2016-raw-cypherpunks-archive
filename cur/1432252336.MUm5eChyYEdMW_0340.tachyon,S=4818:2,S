So? What authority gets to decide what "decent" profits are?
Businesses _should_ always seek to maximize their profits
in the long term.

Many businesses fall into the "short term trap", which maximizes
profits for a few years, which then fall off in the long term, leading
to lower overall profits.  Leaving "money on the table", as it were.

It is my _opinion_ that insurance companies, by inserting themselves into
the legal system, and seeking to make themselves a necessity,
are well down that road.

What is preventing them from simply paying for their treatment?
