Not a misnomer, a redundancy.  All nation-states are criminal.  Honig
had it straight:

> Crime is any *nonconsensual* interaction.

Non-consensual interaction is what nation-states /do/.  They supplant
peaceful personal choice with political dictate, regardless of any
consent by the person.  Epluribus unum, and all that.

Has your neighbor consented to delegate her authority to your nation-
state?  Was she even asked?

I didn't think so.
