I'm currently living somewhere one can't safely drink the tap water.  So I
agree, massive ongoing public investment in water infrastructure sure is a

worldwide are literally dying of thirst.

Y'all gotta gets outta New Jack City once in a while.  That part of America

caused by the toxic industrial food system.
