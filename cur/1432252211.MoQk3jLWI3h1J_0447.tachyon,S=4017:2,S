Hi all.

Long time listener, 2nd time poster.

My wife received this, and some of you on this list
seem to be very talented at chasing down hoaxes. I am
not so. 

For some reason, the formatting looks out of place in
parts. Anyway, this is how she received it, but I have
omitted all of the people it has been sent to. Other
than that, it's verbatim. I haven't called the number
yet as I just got it, and I assume it's the lady's
work number.

Dan
