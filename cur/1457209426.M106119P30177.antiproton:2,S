See this is a problem. All this trust in single entities,
singular and closed systems you keep needing to place.
Why in the fuck do you keep doing this?

You compute hardware should be completely open.
You compute software should be completely open.
You should fuse your own keys into your own hardware
for software builds you reproducibly build sign and install
yourself from distributed opensource software.

Open designs, open fabs, open products, open source.
You are NOT going to solve these problems without it.

And quit crying profit... the work of your plumber is all in the
open and profitable.

Or quality... all quality is currently shit, but at least
you stand a chance of seeing the flies on it if it's open.

Like all those call and other data... just for the asking,
thus retroactive immunity for them, thus rolled up for absorption
and enacted by an unaccountable government.

These two are one and the same.

Yes it's theirs, which they can fuck you with at any time...
because you trusted them, oops.

These are in tenacious conflict.

> As a minimum the existence of compelled software lays waste to the EULA.

Shrinkwrap hardware / software EULAs offer you nothing concrete,
trustworthy, or compensatable. All to them, none to you.

Negotiated contracts are different but just as tricky.
