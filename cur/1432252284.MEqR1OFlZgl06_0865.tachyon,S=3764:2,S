Wrong, not all RNG's have the same statistical output. There is -nothing-
in the requirement for a RNG that requires it (radiation sources are not
equiprobable for example, they're much more 'zero' than 'one'). There may
be boundary conditions on crypto applications that require equiprobable
distributions with respect to characters or strings (that 'k' thing
again, see Knuth). But that doesn't apply to -all- RNG's or their
applications by a long shot.

Also, 'random noise' is redundent. 'Noise' is by -definition- random,
otherwise it wouldn't be noise, it would have a correlation factor, once
you found it you could remove the noise (assuming of course its
computationaly tractible).
