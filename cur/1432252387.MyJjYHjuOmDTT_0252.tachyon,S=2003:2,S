Well, that's an interesting phenomenon. In industrialized nations where the 
price of software is fairly low compared to the wages, people seem somewhat 
willing to pay. At least, we don't see ticket sales for big movies going 
down at all. So it could be that people will eventually voluntarily release 
control, as long as the consequences (ie, prices) aren't too high. On the 
other hand, the whole P2P phenomenon is not happening simply because people 
don't want to pay. Stupid industry execs will probably continue churning out 
the same stupid shit they always did and P2Pers will find some way around 
their "protection" if needs be.
