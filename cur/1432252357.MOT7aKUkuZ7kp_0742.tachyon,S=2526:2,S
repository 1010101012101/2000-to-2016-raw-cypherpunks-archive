   [1]segphault writes "The [2]Chinese government has shut down nearly
   600 pornographic web sites, and arrested over 200 people for
   distributing "obscene" content. The Chinese government has also
   started performing covert surveillance of mobile phone text messages
   in order to crack down on banking fraud and prostitution organized and
   perpetrated with text messages. Ars Technica has the story: 'With more
   than 100 million Internet users, China has the second largest
   population of web content consumers after the United States. Although
   the Chinese government promotes web use for business, education, and
   government activity, the communist regime has committed its resources
   to crushing web sites that challenge government authority, or
   distribute content that the government considers to be detrimental to
   society'"
