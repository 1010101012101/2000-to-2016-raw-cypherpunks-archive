To those tracking Jim's signature for future prosecution
I'd like to state that he's a nut and has no control over
what he thinks, writes, posts, declares, corrects, impunes,
mocks, refuses, acts on, reacts stupidly to, misses by a
mile, mischaracterizes scientifically, rats on, and slaughters
with unintended belly laughter. He suffers dementia from 
a windfall due to Tivoli's buyout by mad cow diseased 
IBM. Until that day when Jim got a bunch of money he
didn't deserve, and it was a glorious moment we all
dream of, he was rational and could be approached
with safety. Not any more.

If there's any desire on the part of authorities to setup
a Jim Bell next-in-line, Jim Choate ain't it. He'd never
pass the psychological evaluation -- which come to
think of it, is a pretty damn smart state to be in these
days, so I'm heading up Jim's asshole for protection
from the avenging angels who own his heart and
mind. Remember the chip the feds planted in Jim,
right next to the one put there by IBM -- actually
identical devices for assuring obedience even
while protesting against the powers that power the
chips lucre.
