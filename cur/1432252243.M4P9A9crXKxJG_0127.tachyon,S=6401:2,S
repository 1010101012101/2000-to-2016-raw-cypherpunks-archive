i used to agree with this, and then i realized this is bad advice if
incremental improvements are resulting in less security over time.

said another way, if you are currently falling behind quickly, by not
moving, then moving ahead at a walk just means you fail less soon than
others.

everyone ends up in fail, however.

i think this is only true if the magnitude of broken and incompetent
crushes you into inaction.

if instead it spurs you to build, for years, on something of a solid
base, then criticism must be deferred until that base is put to the
test.

of course, my time spent writing rebuttal subtracted from the time
best applied proving or denying in practice, arm chair theory inviting
as it is...
