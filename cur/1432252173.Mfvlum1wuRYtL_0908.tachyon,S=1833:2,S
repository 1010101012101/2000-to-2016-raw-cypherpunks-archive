A very long article on the FBI and the 6 fellows in upstate NY who
travelled the world to hang out with religious nutballs.  One of the
most interesting things about the case is that the FBI did not catch
these folks; they were turned in by someone having second thoughts.
That fellow, who then turned informer, is in jail anyway.  Bad
informer management, but no one asked me.
