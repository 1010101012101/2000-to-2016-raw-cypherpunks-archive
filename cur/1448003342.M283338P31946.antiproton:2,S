Hi TOR Mailing List People,

            I am apparently  the number one person in the United
States on the _*NSA-CIA-FBI Watch List*_. For multiple reasons! I am
the Coordinator of the United Front Against Racism and
Capitalism-Imperialism who was arrested by the so-called "Major Case
Squad" in August 1986 because our group exposed the scientific
documentation on a big series of _/*huge*/_ wall posters that AIDS is
Biological Warfare by the US Government Against Blacks, Gays and those
with certain blood dyscrasias. The arrest was on the front pages of
all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to send this
email to Anonymous and TOR does not permit attachments so just
disregard that when you see an attachment mentioned.

            Recently I was _*Extraordinarily Renditioned*_ (KIDNAPPED
AND HELD AGAINST MY WILL FOR 18 HOURS AND TORTURED after simply
walking along a road in New Jersey!) See the third attachment. The NSA
has TOTAL control of my computer and has real time keystroke by
keystroke monitoring and harassment while I am on the computer. My
anti-virus and anti-Malware are totally useless as explained by
Snowden because the computer is controlled through the _*BIOS Chip*_
as explained in the attachment on Snowden revelations. Scroll down the
document until you get to _*ANT*_ (Access Network Technology). I would
like for _*Anonymous*_ to publish on its website for EVERYONE, not
just me,  how to remove and neutralize NSA viruses placed on the BIOS
CHIP! Also please send the information in an email to me. I am sure
you could manage this. If THEY can do it and YOU are the world's
greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize any
garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me
in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip
because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important
enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I
can go screw! Will I receive the same response from Anonymous? It is a
rule of capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate
its own opposition by one means or another any and ALL means.
Anonymous is a supposed opposition group. So who is _/*really*/_
running anonymous and please do not say "everyone" or "no one" because
that is the same BS answer given by the anti-Communist Anarchist
group,  so-called "Occupy Wall Street." _*I need immediate help*_. And
so undoubtedly do others! I am partially computer savvy. But I am not
yet a programmer. Also, I am a Medical Doctor and a Theoretical
Astrophysicist and a Professional Revolutionary and have recently
finished writing an extremely important document completed after
almost 2 years of actual work: The _*Materialist Analysis of
Theoretical Astrophysics*_, which is a Classic of scientific,
political literature. As it states early on:

            "Though it is of a different genre from "On the Origin of
Species" by Charles Darwin and             "Zur Dynamik Bewegter
Korper" by Albert Einstein and the Einstein Field Equations
         which form the basis for the General Theory of Relativity it
sits on the same shelf
            because it defends all three and takes it further and
provides the answer to the ultimate                 question: What is
the truthful explanation of the Universe?"

            I could have added "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte," by Karl Marx, which is a classic object lesson in applied
historical materialism. In any case we have to get rid of capitalism
or capitalism is going to get rid of us. _*A non-response from
Anonymous is a death sentence for the credibility of Anonymous.*_ You
can give me the information on how to get rid of a virus on the BIOS
chip or you can contact someone who DOES know how to do it. I will
remove it every day if I have to.

            Also I need help in publishing in some fashion the second
attached document. I do not want to hear "We are not your army?"
During the era when political postering was permitted in the United
States I spent over $50,000 of my own money on politics and the huge
posters which used to cover the walls of many US cities. Our AIDS
poster stopped all political postering in the United States by the
capitalist dictatorship of millionaires and billionaires. We are
living in End-Stage Capitalism. It is known as Rule by Decree, a form
of Bonapartism as in Napoleon Bonaparte. It is expressed a a military,
bureaucratic police state which is hardening by the day. "Democracy"
under capitalism is merely a codeword and a euphemism--both, they are
different--for capitalist dictatorship and enslavement here or
anywhere else in the world. We have to get rid of capitalism or
capitalism is going to get rid of us. Remember that capitalism is a
WORLD SYSTEM and so is Communism. Socialism, the first stage of
Communism has never ever actually been practiced anywhere and cannot
be practiced anywhere until capitalism is overthrown worldwide
starting at its center, the USA. We live in a a world of nation
states. All nation states are dictatorships of one class over another
class, either the capitalists over the Workers or vice versa. Because
of the 1988 Surrender by Gorbachev to the threat of a Nuclear War
there are a lot fewer Worker's States. We were almost there! In the
1930s we had a Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class Movement.
But they were deliberately misled to take a bribe known as the New
Deal. You don't think they came up with the New Deal out of the
goodness of their heart now do you? FDR was given credit then and more
recently on Cahnnel Thirteen Public Television for "Saving Capitalism
with the New Deal!" If that Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class
had not been deliberately misled to take that New Deal bribe there
would have been no Adolph Hitler, No WWII, No Korea, No Vietnam War
and ZERO of today's present problems. Look at the present world
situation! Ninety-Five Percent of New Yorkers and the overwhelming
majority of Americans and people worldwide agree we need a new system
based on human need not private profit.
