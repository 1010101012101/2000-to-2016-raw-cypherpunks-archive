thanks for sharing your insight, coderman.

i have an additional comment on a single point...

perhaps i misunderstand it, though must 'resonance'
be audibly acoustic, and would a SCIF actually defend
against "vibrations" at all frequencies.

what is referenced is the pairing of vibration in resonance,
fundamental to quantum physics if not mistaken, whereby
two identical entities can vibrate in unison, at a distance,
to include at opposite ends of the universe, seemingly

so if this were involved, not necessarily sending human
audible soundwaves, though that sympathetic vibration
(as one string vibrating influences another, say) or other
(wireless power of Tesla, though i do not know enough
to make the case) could potentially function beyond a
SCIF barrier or wall. for instance, if having a tuning fork
on the inside and a tone naturally generated else also
electromagnetically sustained on outside of the SCIF,
such that a vibration or specifically paired resonating
condition would under normal circumstances exist,
vibrations causing other vibrations -- though while
inaudible or outside normal hearing ranges, is it by
default true that a SCIF kills off that paired vibration,
else would not quantum effects cease to exist in the
materials (atoms, molecules, particles) inside of the
SCIF and have the power to detach them structurally
from space-time even. i tend to think the tuning fork
would vibrate inside the SCIF moreso than not, if it
is explored beyond ordinary channels. just a guess.

perhaps though because i do not actually have any
actual knowledge of these things, nor the science
in its depth or breadth, that this is readily taken
care of and accounted for in a security context.

either way it would not be surprising to me, that
such conceptual gaps may exist in auditing or
they may be undocumented yet accounted for.
