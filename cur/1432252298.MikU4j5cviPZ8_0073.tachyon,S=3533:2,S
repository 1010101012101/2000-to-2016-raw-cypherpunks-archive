Does anyone know the law regarding duplication of out of print
books/other works?

E.g. Stephen King withdrew his book 'Rage' (support your neighborhood
second-hand bookstore) about a schoolkid who holds his class hostage 
at gunpoint, shortly after the Littleton shootings.  King _does not_ 
want this book to be available to the public until the mess blows over.

If I distributed this book in electronic format for free, I would not
be costing him a single penny.  Would I still be violating the DCMA
and which other laws would I violate?  

Also, what if I claimed that books like King's were in some way
responsible for the current spate of shootings?  Would I be able to
reproduce the book (so my quotes can be judged in the context of a whole 
work) in order to campaign against it?  Or can he legally suppress his 
own works?

Publius.
