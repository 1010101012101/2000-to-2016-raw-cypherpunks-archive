It's not all too hard to make from hexamine (although quite inefficient,
the bulk manufacture isn't done that way) for someone with access to a 
bit of chemical equipment.  I couldn't believe the fuss they're making 
over this, it's just another HE, although more brisant than most.  The 
story is about as interesting as "Stick of dynamite discovered in 
Baghdad parking lot", the media is making it sound like someone's 
absconded with a live nuke.  I guess they couldn't spend the necessary
30 seconds or so it'd take to look it up somewhere and see what was
involved.
