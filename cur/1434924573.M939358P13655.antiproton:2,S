*Cough* AFAIK if 'OK google' works anything like on Android (and it should)
it locally processes for the trigger phrase, then provides both audio and
visual queues its recording your voice. They aren't constantly recording
everything you say and uploading it.

It's not exactly the 1984 two-way A/V system its made out to be. Inspect
the source for yourself rather than relying on fantastical reporting.

Google's products and services are not free, I don't find it surprising
that they datamine voice, they've been offering 'free' PBX systems for
years in exchange for all voice traffic that transits through it - directly
using this to train voice recognition along with YouTube videos and so on.

Anything on your machine can be tapping you. Your attackers don't need to
bake it into the browser - doing so would be idiotic. Your attackers can
piggy on updates, TAO in, use an exploit or simply bug you. It's way easier
to pop a 10$ bug in the room rather than risking burning some 0day worth
infinitely more on you.

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yesterday, news broke that Google has been stealth downloading=
 audio<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; listeners onto every computer that runs Chrome, and transmits =
audio data<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; back to Google. Effectively, this means that Google had taken =
itself the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to listen to every conversation in every room that runs =
Chrome<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere, without any kind of consent from the people eavesdr=
opped on.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; official statements, Google shrugged off the practice with wha=
t amounts<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9Cwe can do that=E2=80=9D.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It looked like just another bug report. &quot;When I start Chr=
omium, it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; downloads something.&quot; Followed by strange status informat=
ion that notably<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; included the lines &quot;Microphone: Yes&quot; and &quot;Audio=
 Capture Allowed: Yes&quot;.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; chrome-voicesearch<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Without consent, Google=E2=80=99s code had downloaded a black =
box of code that =E2=80=93<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; according to itself =E2=80=93 had turned on the microphone and=
 was actively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; listening to your room.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; A brief explanation of the Open-source / Free-software philoso=
phy is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; needed here. When you=E2=80=99re installing a version of GNU/L=
inux like Debian or<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ubuntu onto a fresh computer, thousands of really smart people=
 have<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; analyzed every line of human-readable source code before that =
operating<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; system was built into computer-executable binary code, to make=
 it common<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and open knowledge what the machine actually does instead of t=
rusting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; corporate statements on what it=E2=80=99s supposed to be doing=
. Therefore, you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don=E2=80=99t install black boxes onto a Debian or Ubuntu syst=
em; you use<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; software<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; repositories that have gone through this source-code audit-the=
n-build<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; process. Maintainers of operating systems like Debian and Ubun=
tu use many<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; so-called =E2=80=9Cupstreams=E2=80=9D of source code to build =
the final product.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chromium, the open-source version of Google Chrome, had abused=
 its<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; position as trusted upstream to insert lines of source code th=
at bypassed<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; this audit-then-build process, and which downloaded and instal=
led a black<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; box of unverifiable executable code directly onto computers, e=
ssentially<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rendering them compromised. We don=E2=80=99t know and can=E2=
=80=99t know what this black<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; box does. But we see reports that the microphone has been acti=
vated, and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that Chromium considers audio capture permitted.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This was supposedly to enable the =E2=80=9COk, Google=E2=80=9D=
 behavior =E2=80=93 that when you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; say certain words, a search function is activated. Certainly a=
 useful<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; feature. Certainly something that enables eavesdropping of eve=
ry<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; conversation in the entire room, too.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, your own computer isn=E2=80=99t the one to analyze =
the actual search<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; command. Google=E2=80=99s servers do. Which means that your co=
mputer had been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; stealth configured to send what was being said in your room to=
 somebody<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; else, to a private company in another country, without your co=
nsent or<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge, an audio transmission triggered by=E2=80=A6 an unkn=
own and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; unverifiable<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; set of conditions.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Google had two responses to this. The first was to introduce a=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; practically-undocumented switch to opt out of this behavior, w=
hich is not<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a fix: the default install will still wiretap your room withou=
t your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; consent, unless you opt out, and more importantly, know that y=
ou need to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; opt out, which is nowhere a reasonable requirement. But the se=
cond was<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; more of an official statement following technical discussions =
on Hacker<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; News and other places. That official statement amounted to thr=
ee parts<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (paraphrased, of course):<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Yes, we=E2=80=99re downloading and installing a wiretapping=
 black-box to your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; computer. But we=E2=80=99re not actually activating it. We did=
 take advantage of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; our position as trusted upstream to stealth-insert code into o=
pen-source<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; software that installed this black box onto millions of comput=
ers, but we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would never abuse the same trust in the same way to insert cod=
e that<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; activates the eavesdropping-blackbox we already downloaded and=
 installed<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; onto your computer without your consent or knowledge. You can =
look at the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; code as it looks right now to see that the code doesn=E2=80=99=
t do this right<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; now.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Yes, Chromium is bypassing the entire source code auditing =
process by<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; downloading a pre-built black box onto people=E2=80=99s comput=
ers. But that=E2=80=99s not<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; something we care about, really. We=E2=80=99re concerned with =
building Google<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chrome, the product from Google. As part of that, we provide t=
he source<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; code for others to package if they like. Anybody who uses our =
code for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; their own purpose takes responsibility for it. When this happe=
ns in a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Debian installation, it is not Google Chrome=E2=80=99s behavio=
r, this is Debian<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chromium=E2=80=99s behavior. It=E2=80=99s Debian=E2=80=99s res=
ponsibility entirely.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) Yes, we deliberately hid this listening module from the use=
rs, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that=E2=80=99s because we consider this behavior to be part of=
 the basic Google<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chrome experience. We don=E2=80=99t want to show all modules t=
hat we install<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ourselves.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you think this is an excusable and responsible statement, r=
aise your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand now.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, it should be noted that this was Chromium, the open-sourc=
e version<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chrome. If somebody downloads the Google product Google Chrome=
, as in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; prepackaged binary, you don=E2=80=99t even get a theoretical c=
hoice. You=E2=80=99re<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; already downloading a black box from a vendor. In Google Chrom=
e, this is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; all included from the start.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This episode highlights the need for hard, not soft, switches =
to all<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; devices =E2=80=93 webcams, microphones =E2=80=93 that can be u=
sed for surveillance. A<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; software on/off switch for a webcam is no longer enough, a har=
d shield in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the lens is required. A software on/off switch for a =
microphone<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no longer enough, a physical switch that breaks its electri=
cal<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; connection is required. That=E2=80=99s how you defend against =
this in depth.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, people were quick to downplay the alarm. =E2=80=9CI=
t only listens when<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you say =E2=80=98Ok, Google=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D (Ok, so how doe=
s it know to start listening just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; before I=E2=80=99m about to say =E2=80=98Ok, Google?=E2=80=99)=
 =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s no big deal.=E2=80=9D (A company<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; stealth installs an audio listener that listens to every room =
in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; world<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; it can, and transmits audio data to the mothership when it enc=
ounters an<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; unknown, possibly individually tailored, list of keywords =E2=
=80=93 and it=E2=80=99s no<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; big deal!?) =E2=80=9CYou can opt out. It=E2=80=99s in the Term=
s of Service.=E2=80=9D (No. Just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; no.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is not something that is the slightest amount of permissi=
ble just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; because it=E2=80=99s hidden in legalese.) =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99=
s opt-in. It won=E2=80=99t really listen<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; unless you check that box.=E2=80=9D (Perhaps. We don=E2=80=99t=
 know, Google just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; downloaded a black box onto my computer. And it may not be the=
 same black<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; box as was downloaded onto yours. )<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Early last decade, privacy activists practically yelled and sc=
reamed that<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the NSA=E2=80=99s taps of various points of the Internet and t=
elecom networks had<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the technical potential for enormous abuse against privacy. Ev=
erybody<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; else<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; dismissed those points as basically tinfoilhattery =E2=80=93 u=
ntil the Snowden<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; files came out, and it was revealed that precisely everybody i=
nvolved had<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; abused their technical capability for invasion of privacy as f=
ar as was<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it would be wise to not repeat that exact mistake. Nob=
ody, and I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; really mean nobody, is to be trusted with a technical capabili=
ty to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; listen<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to every room in the world, with listening profiles customizab=
le at the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; identified-individual level, on the mere basis of =E2=80=9Ctru=
st us=E2=80=9D.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Privacy remains your own responsibility.<br>
