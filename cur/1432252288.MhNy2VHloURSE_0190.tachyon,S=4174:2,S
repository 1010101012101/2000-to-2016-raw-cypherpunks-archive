Subject: Peer to Peer Services

Dear all:

It is time to get coordinated and aggressive with the new round of peer to
peer 
services. The amount of music being downloaded is, as you know, reaching 
unprecedented levels. Since college started last week Morpheus traffic was
up 
to 19 million downloads per day. AND THAT'S JUST MORPHEUS. With the
imminent 
launch of legitimate subscription services we have to get our customers
back. 

I know you want your new businesses to be successful. So do I. Given the 
overwhelming volume of these alternative services, RIAA can't handle all
of the 
enforcement alone. If they are not controlled more effectively and
consumers 
redirected to legitimate offerings, there won't be new businesses. That's 
obvious. 

You are all competitors, but you have common interests in
enforcement. Help me 
help you. I'd like to have a meeting at the RIAA in October as soon as 
possible. If you agree to participate, I will have my assistant try and
work 
with schedules to get a date that works. 

I want to keep the meeting small to start (we can expand participation to
other 
companies later). 

We need to discuss: 

1. Spoofing and/or interdiction methods for existing peer to peers -
(perhaps 
by adding promotional messages about the launch of various new systems) 

2. A PR campaign

3. We will share the latest legal strategies and RIAA's thinking on
options 

Please plan on attending. I am cautious about sending alternates because
we 
need people who have the ability to make decisions and commit to spending. 

Best regards, 

Hilary
