Fairmont State offering computer security major 

by Jennifer Biller 

STAFF WRITER 

FAIRMONT -- For anyone who suffered through the recent Blaster Worm computer virus, it's obvious that computer security is a necessity. 

Fairmont State College is addressing this niche by offering a new major in computer security. The program is in response to increased computer virus attacks and security attacks on systems nationwide. 

Students can earn a bachelor of science in computer security by completing courses such as network security, cryptography (enciphering and deciphering messages in secret code), computer vulnerability assessment and legal and ethical issues. 

"Computer science is becoming more and more important, not just because of viruses but because of having to protect large computer networks from threats," said Alicia Kime, FSC associate professor of computer science. 

"Most schools are offering courses in this now," she said. "We're offering a major." 

The program is a joint effort of the college, the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation and DSD Laboratories/Backbone Security.com. 

Donald Tobin, associate professor of computer science, is teaching the security courses. 

Tobin earned a bachelor of science degree from the University of Texas, a master of science degree from Boston University, and is completing a doctorate in computer science from the University of Idaho. 

"It's a program we hope to grow each year," Tobin said. "It's unique, and I came here to help create the program." 

Students will learn the intricacies of protecting commercial, state and federal information systems. 

More and more, even personal computers are in danger of viruses and security breaches, Tobin said. 

"People don't understand the risk they take just by being on the Internet," he said. "It's a large problem, and it's not going to get any better." 

Students will get the chance to complete internships out in the field before graduation, Tobin said. 

For more information on earning a degree in computer security, contact the college at (800) 641-5678.
