Cypherpunks do something?

Maybe start with the basics: a WWW site.
Doesn't Choate have a couple registered names for our use?

Describe how to use encryption on each platform.
The various options for sending/receiving encrypted email.

Set up (I volunteer to figure out the software scripting
if people are interested in using it) a clone of lne.

Boy, has lne eliminated 99% of the crap that the other nodes get.
Anyway, a clone that accepts only encrypted submissions, and
sends encrypted output.

Purely for slinging more encrypted traffic around, obviously.
Just on principle. The encrypted list software might be useful
to other people.

Okay, to get back to the subject: an explanation on how
to release these tools anonymously. Document why it is
necessary. It's not the reverse engineering that needs
to be moved to foreign outposts. Perhaps describe some
methodologies for selling it anonymously.

That takes voters, right? We don't lob money, right?

Maybe one of those "reach out to three others..." sequences,
with an URL to tie everyone together to alerts to write
letters. We'd provide a letter template for each alert that
they could edit on our site, create a PDF or WWW page output
for them to print and actually send in. Many places don't
seem to react to email.

What was that Kurt Vonnegut book/movie (Jerry Lewis): Slapstick.

Maybe we should start a movement of people
who all change/set legally their middle
name to 'Privacy'.

Damn straight.
