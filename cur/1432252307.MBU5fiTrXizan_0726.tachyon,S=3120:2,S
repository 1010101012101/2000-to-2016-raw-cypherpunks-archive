I didn't catch that one, but as the token phone company guy here,
the fact that they started off Desert Scam by blowing up the
phone company building with a cruise missile did piss me off...


What our management _does_ need to clue into is the recent
Michigan law banning VPNs/NAT/routers/etc. - the similar laws
proposed in a number of other states only applied in cases of fraud
or theft of service, but the Michigan one was badly worded.
