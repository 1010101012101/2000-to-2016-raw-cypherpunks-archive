Yo, Ding Dong, no need to send it to me twice.


#    I think I have a very good idea who you are.

I should hope so, since I'm not anonymous.
Ask Declan or Gilmore if you get stuck.

#    hear the crack of the rifle shot...

No! I insist you terrorize me by shooting my legs first!

<POW> Oh, I'm hit! Tim May has finally come to kill me!
<POW> Oh, my other leg! I'll be dead soon! Terror!!!
