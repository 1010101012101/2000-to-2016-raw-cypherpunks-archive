Ah I see. So your editor confused the cpunks printouts you use for TP for
the actual mailing list...a natural mistake for a journalist, they can
never get the quote right :)

And no, I don't think Declan meant anything by 'movement' other than a
shared interest and motivation to participate (and they were saying on the
news just last nite the government wanted their citizens to participate).
