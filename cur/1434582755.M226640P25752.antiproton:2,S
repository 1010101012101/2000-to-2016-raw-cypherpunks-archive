	I don't smoke lettuce. My example was meant to teach you the
	basics of morality - something you seem unable to grasp. 

	So, pay attention : human/natural rights exist PRIOR TO ANY
	FUCKING GOVERNMENT.

	Enve a retarded 'american' should know this if he bothered to

	independence'

	That's what the shitbags do, however. So what you think
	about some nonsensical 'charter' has less than zero relevance.

	There's what? There's a neocon in this mailing list?

	Well, at least you figured out that I'm an anarchist, although
	funnily enough you don't seem to know what anarchy is. 

	 
>government directed usually by direct democracy.

	Nope, that's not anarchy.

	It's a basic truth, sonny. It may mean nothing to government
	worshiping psychos/neocons, but...it is still true.

	No, your wrong analogy only shows that you don't know what
	you're talking about or are plainly dishonest. Or both.

	Yes they do, to varying degrees. They are all funded with
	stolen money for starters.
