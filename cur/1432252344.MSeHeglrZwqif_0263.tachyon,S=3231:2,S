One of the interesting things about Vannevar Bush's Memeweb 
is that 1. you can legitimately refer any yahoo to 'look it up'
in the memeweb and its not terribly rude and 
2. said yahoo really can look it up, better than anyone
alive to this moment.

*This* is what discourages the incredible traffic you'd get if you
multiplied the AOL-september effect by the ignorance factor.

Claude save us all.
