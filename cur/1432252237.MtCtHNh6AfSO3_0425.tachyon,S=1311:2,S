There's an interesting look at the situation in Iraq from the point of view of
a third-party contractor, in an article in the Sunday Star Times,
http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/sundaystartimes/0,2106,2908644a6442,00.html.
Most quotable quote:

  The thing that pisses us off is the Yanks had no idea what to do after
  they'd taken out the Iraqi army. They rocked on in, took them out and then
  thought: OOh shit, what do we do now?

Peter.
