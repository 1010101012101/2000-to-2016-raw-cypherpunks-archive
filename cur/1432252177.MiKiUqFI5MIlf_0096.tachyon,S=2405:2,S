> What does it look like when the NSA tell you to turn over records?

here's my guess:

- big name(s) in fancy transport make a show of arrival to convey
presence of authority
- discussions are held in confidence and off the record.  top sekrit, etc.
- verbal assurances given but no paper trail.  ask with a carrot ($$$)
and a stick (national security risk, etc)

as far as conveying the image of authority, maybe just a nice suit, an
ear piece, and a chevy blazer with white tags is sufficient...  ;)

(i'd love to know more detail on how these conversations were implemented)
