SCOPE

Multi-hop wireless Ad Hoc and sensor networks are self-organizing  
systems
formed by co-operating nodes within communication range of each other  
that
form temporary networks. Ad hoc wireless networks allow anywhere,  
anytime
network connectivity with complete lack of control, ownership, and
regulatory influence. The last few years have witnessed a wealth of
research
ideas on ad hoc and sensor networks that are moving rapidly into
commercialization and standardization. Such networks can be randomly and
rapidly deployed and reconfigured and easily tailored to specific
applications including entertainment, civilian, military, etc.  
Moreover, an
ad hoc architecture is highly robust to node failure and can provide a
high-level of fault tolerance due to nodal redundancy and its  
distributed
nature. Furthermore, energy efficiency can be achieved through multi-hop
routing communication. Bandwidth reuse can also benefit from dividing  
the
single long range hop to multiple short hops with each hop having a  
shorter
range. Several challenges face are standing in the way to achieving
ubiquitous deployment of ad hoc and sensor networks. These include  
variable
topology, device heterogeneity, limited power supply and the lack of
effective energy-efficient design, lack of QoS and application support,
etc.

This symposium aims at providing a forum for sharing ideas among
researchers
and practitioners working on state-of-the-art solutions to the  
challenges
above. We are seeking papers that describe original and unpublished
contributions addressing various aspects of ad hoc and sensor networks.
