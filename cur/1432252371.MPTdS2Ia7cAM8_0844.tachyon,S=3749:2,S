That's nice and trustable.  Neither George Bush nor Al Gore
has the time to watch 100,000,000 ballots counted,
though one could argue that we'd be better off if they couldn't
take office until they'd sat down together and done it,
or until one of them had conceded that the other was more patient :-)

Even counting all the ballots in a large city has to be parallelized.
Of course, political parties are often good at that,
at least parties big enough to be successfully elected.

The difficult problems are making sure that the ballot box wasn't stuffed,
and that the people who voted all existed and were unique,
and that their votes weren't obtained through bribery (though deception is
fine :-)
Here in the US, it's traditional that ballot boxes (where they're used)
are sealed at the polling place and ostensibly only opened with witnesses,
but fraud is nonetheless possible and perhaps still practiced on a small
scale.

				Thanks!
