Yes, quite a refreshing trend.

That British woman who says "You ARE the weakest link. Good-bye!" is 
not an authority figure by any sense of being a state functionary. 
People compete in the show, as in all of the other shows you are 
presumably catching snippets of, on a voluntary basis.

(Note: I have never seen an episode of "Survivor," "Boot Camp," or 
"Weakest Link." I did watch the first episode of "Big Brother" last 
summer, figuring it might be germane to my interests in privacy and 
surveillance, but it was too boring to watch for a second hour.)

Calling these shows comparable to what the Nazis did is ludicrous.

Teaching people this fact might do wonders for getting ten million 
leeches off the welfare rolls and state subsidy scams, so I applaud 
it.

The dull are just that, dull. Not pseudoscience, but fact.

You ARE the weakest link. Good-bye!
