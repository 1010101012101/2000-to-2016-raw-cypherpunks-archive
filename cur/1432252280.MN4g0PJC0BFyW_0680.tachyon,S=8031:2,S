Yes, I read the motherfucking article. He says that he was apathetic,
and trusted institutions (and even that asshole W). Maybe he needs to do
more mea culpas for that, or cut off his left pinkie. But unless you
cite some public statement where he actively supported the invasion,
rather than just deferred to arguably better-informed opinions, it's no
big deal in the current context. In my opinion.

I'd say rather that he let Uncle Dick finger fuck him, but just a little ;)
