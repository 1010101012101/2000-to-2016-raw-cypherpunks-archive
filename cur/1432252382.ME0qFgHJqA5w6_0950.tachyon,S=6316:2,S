Interestingly enough, the United States government conducted a controlled 
experiment called the Nth Country Experiment to see how much effort was 
actually required to develop a viable fission weapon design starting from 
nothing. In this experiment, which ended on 10 April 1967, three newly 
graduated physics students were given the task of developing a detailed 
weapon design using only public domain information. The project reached a 
successful conclusion, that is, they did develop a viable design (detailed 
in the classified report UCRL-50248) after expending only three man-years 
of effort over two and a half calendar years. In the years since, much more 
information has entered the public domain so that the level of effort 
required has obviously dropped further.

This experiment established an upper limit on the required level of effort 
that is so low that the hope that lack of information may provide even a 
small degree of protection from proliferation is clearly a futile one.
