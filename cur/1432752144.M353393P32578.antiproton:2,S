As of a couple of years ago, there was at least one Commodore being used as 
a repeater here in the great PNW.  Can't vouch for present day as I have 
slacked off on my ham radio activities.

My original Trash-80 had 4mb.  That was the one where you could put the 
portable AM radio next to it and use it as a speaker!  Mmm, radiation ...

I had that Trash-80 and a Timex Sinclair in my cabinet 'o crap for ages, 
thenI somehow lost track of them during a move.  How sad.
