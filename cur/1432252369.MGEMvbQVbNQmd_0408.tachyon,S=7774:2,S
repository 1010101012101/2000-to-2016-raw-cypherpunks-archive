CodeCon 2.0
February 2003, San Francisco CA, USA

Call For Papers

CodeCon is the premier showcase of active hacker projects. It is an
excellent opportunity for developers to demonstrate their work, and for
coding hackers to find out about what's going on in their community.

All presentations must be accompanied by functional applications,
ideally open source. Presenters must be one of the active developers of
the code in question. We emphasize that demonstrations be of *working*
code, and reproducible by other people. Throughout the event, we will have
several kiosks and local servers available for demonstration purposes.

CodeCon strongly encourages presenters from non-commercial and academic
backgrounds to attend for the purposes of collaboration and the sharing of
knowledge by providing free registration to workshop presenters and
discounted registration to full-time students.


We hereby solicit papers and demonstrations.

   * Papers and proposals due: December 1, 2002
   * Authors notified: December 15, 2002
   * Demonstration materials due: January 15, 2003


The focus of CodeCon is on working applications which:

   * enhance individual power and liberty
   * can be discussed freely, either by virtue of being open source or
     having a published protocol, and preferably free of intellectual
     property restrictions
   * are generally useful, either directly to a large number of users, or
     as an example of technology applicable to a larger audience
   * demonstrate novelty in technical approaches, security assumptions, and
     end-user functionality


Possible topics include, but are by no means restricted to:

   * development tools - languages, debuggers, version control
   * file sharing systems - swarming distribution, distributed search
   * community-based web sites - forums, weblogs, personals
   * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls


Presentations will be a 45 minutes long, with 15 minutes allocated for
Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.

Submission details:

Submissions are being accepted immediately. Acceptance dates are
September 1, November 1, and December 1. On each acceptance date,
submissions will be either accepted, rejected, or deferred to the
next acceptance date.

The conference language is English.

All submissions should be accompanied by source code or an application.
When possible, we would prefer that the application be available for
interactive use during the workshop, either on a presenter-provided
demonstration machine or one of the conference kiosks.

Ideally, demonstrations should be usable by attendees with 802.11b
connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on Windows,
UNIX-like, or MacOS platforms. Cross-platform applications are most
desirable.

Our venue may be 21+. If you are submitting and are under 21, please
advise the program committee; we may consider alternate venues for one or
more days of the event. If you have a specific day on which you would
prefer to present, please advise us.

To submit, send mail to submissions@codecon.info including the following
information:

   * Project name
   * url of project home page
   * tagline - one sentence or less summing up what the project does
   * names of presenter(s) and urls of their home pages, if they have any
   * one-paragraph bios of presenters (optional)
   * project history, no more than a few sentences
   * what will be done in the project demo
   * major achievement(s) so far
   * claim(s) to fame, if any
   * future plans

Sponsorship:

If your organization is interested in sponsoring CodeCon, we would love to
hear from you. In particular, we are looking for sponsors for social meals
and parties on any of the three days of the conference, as well as
sponsors of the conference as a whole, prizes or awards for quality
presentations, scholarships for qualified applicants, and assistance with
transportation or accommodation for presenters with limited resources. If
you might be interested in sponsoring any of these aspects, please contact
the conference organizers at codecon-admin@codecon.info.

Press policy:

CodeCon strives to be a conference for developers, with strong audience
participation. As such, we need to limit the number of complimentary
passes non-developer attendees. Press passes are limited to one pass per
publication, and must be approved prior to the registration deadline (to
be announced later). If you are a member of the press, and interested in
covering CodeCon, please contact us early by sending email to
press@codecon.info. Members of the press who do not receive press-passes
are welcome to participate as regular conference attendees.

Questions:

If you have questions about CodeCon, or would like to contact the
organizers, please mail codecon-admin@codecon.info. Please note this
address is only for questions and administrative requests, and not for
workshop presentation submissions.

Please note: do not email the old addresses at "codecon.org". Use
"codecon.info", or else they will not reach us.
