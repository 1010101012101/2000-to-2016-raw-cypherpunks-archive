Not at all illegal over here in UK.  Banks & some other offices have
signs up requesting visitors to remove masks & especially motorbike
helmets.   

Lots of cyclists wear little filter masks or bandanas round their mouths
- I suspect it is a style statement more than anything else. In London &
some northern cities it isn't at all rare to see Muslim women going
completely veiled (though the vast majority don't - it seems to be
cultural - some Arabs & East Africans go completely covered, a lot of
south Asians & also European Muslims wear headscarves, but don't
actually hide their faces. Turks almost never seem to wear veils but
then Turks seem to dress more or less the same as Western Europeans
these days, at least the ones from Istanbul & Cyprus do, who of course
are the vast majority of Turks we see in London (perhaps 5% of the
population of the area I live in), maybe things are differnt in
Anatolia) 

I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a law that says the police
can tell you to take a mask off.
