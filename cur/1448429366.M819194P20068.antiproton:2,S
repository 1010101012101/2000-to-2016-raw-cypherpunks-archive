This is not a new concept, and not an exclusively Islamic concept. And
it has been tried with incredible success historically. No wonder
Russia is despised by the "elite" of "the West".

Russia Debates Unorthodox Orthodox Financial Alternative
http://journal-neo.org/2015/11/22/russia-debates-unorthodox-orthodox-financial-alternative/

It's not a short article, but here's a key quote to get you salivating:

"Under Czar Alexander III and his Finance Minister Nikolai Bunge,
Russia established the Peasant Land Bank in the beginning of the
1880’s to give interest-free loans to the liberated peasantry that had
been freed from serfdom in 1861 by his father, Alexander II and given
land. The Land Bank invested in the modernization of Russian
agriculture with farmers only paying a small handling charge for
credits. The result was such a spectacular rise in Russian wheat, and
other cereals that Russia became the world “bread basket” up to
outbreak of World War I, exceeding the combined production of the USA,
Argentina and Canada by some 25%.
