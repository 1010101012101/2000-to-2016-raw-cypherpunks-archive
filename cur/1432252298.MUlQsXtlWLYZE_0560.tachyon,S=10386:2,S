Snakeoil will be good at sucking money out of suckers with more dollars
than sense. Bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency, really does have
potential as a way to grease the gears of international finance or
micropayments, but not really as a complete currency replacement in my
opinion.

The problem here is that there is no legitimate or reasonable way to buy
into the market without going through these snakeoil-like dealers.
