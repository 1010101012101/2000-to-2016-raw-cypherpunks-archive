Re Doe et al v ExxonMobil et al (1.21MB PDF)
US State Dept letter that attempts to squelch a lawsuit against ExxonMobil 
for alleged human rights abuses, including murder, torture, kidnapping and 
rape, committed by the military unit guarding the company's natural-gas 
operations in Indonesia - 'the adjudication of these claims could prejudice 
the Government of Indonesia and Indonesian businesses against US firms 
bidding on contracts in extractive and other industries'
( US State Dept via ILRF )
See also this ILRF campaign page for links to the complaint itself and 
related documents, this Reuters coverage, and the Stop ExxonMobil website
