Daily, monthly, yearly, quadrienally... what's the difference?
It's all amortization and signature games under insufficient backing.

US Congress and their pork doesn't give a fuck, their lives and that of their
families are cushily secured past any revolution or massive refactoring...
unless they're assassinated in the process ;-) And the President just
lives to spend all that is given and ask for more, soundbites excepting.

Though hearing what, if any, the supreme judiciary has to say
about all this, even in a historical context, would be interesting.
Especially since most extant countries on the planet started out
on the "incorruptible" gold standard.
