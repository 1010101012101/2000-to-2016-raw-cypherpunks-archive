I realize that you were just trying to help me by posting my earlier
emails
but I think it may have caused more harm than good; at least for the
short
term.

So if you will be so kind as to post this email for me then maybe I can
make
a little lemonaide from the previous lemons.

The way I see it is if the "powers that be" at my job have already read
my
email postings from earlier then they'll probably go back to your site
to
see if you've posted any more emails.

Please respect my wishes, here. I just want to avoid any harm against my

family and me.

And please dont show my email address again, too. If I'm lucky and they

still dont know who I am then that would be a good thing.
