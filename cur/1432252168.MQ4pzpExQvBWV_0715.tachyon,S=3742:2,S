In most cases, national laws are altered to bring them 'in line' with 
treaties. (All treaties.) This has been an issue in the US, where the SC 
has ruled that a treaty cannot violate the constitution...or, rather, that 
it doesn't matter WHAT Congress agreed to, the Constitution will trump any 
laws passed to institute it.

That this might somehow change is a favorite paranoia of a loony right. 
(And, were it likely to occur, it would be a justifiable paranoia...it 
would allow the legislature to do an end-run around the Bill of Rights. For 
example, the US as it stands CANNOT ban 'hate speech' from US-hosted 
servers, even if Europe pressured them into signing a treaty to do so.)
