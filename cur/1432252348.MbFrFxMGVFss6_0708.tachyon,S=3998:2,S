Finally - real british style news reporting and real journalism to balance
the constant jibberish one see's on CNN and for that matter most of the
north american news channels.

Al Jazeera plans version in English 
By Charles Clover in Doha
(Filed: 12/11/2001) 

THE only television station broadcasting live from Taliban-held areas of
Afghanistan plans to introduce an English version early next year. 

Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, has around 15 million viewers a day in the
Arab world, including satellite subscribers in the West. But, as it
broadcasts in Arabic, it does not have the global audiences that
broadcasting in English could bring it. 

Clips from Al Jazeera's footage of the bombing of Kabul and the video
messages sent by Osama bin Laden to its office in Kabul have been used by
networks around the world, including the BBC, ITN, CNN and Sky News. 

But the station has been accused by Colin Powell, the US secretary of
state, and Tony Blair of screening broadcasts which could contain coded
messages and Taliban propaganda without a critical commentary. 

Ibrahim Hilal, the 32-year-old Egyptian editor-in-chief of the station,
said he was under intense pressure from managers to launch English
language broadcasts by January. He thought March was more realistic. 

He denies allegations of bias: "We give time to anybody in this crisis. If
the Archbishop of Canterbury has something to say he will be on my screen. 
We had him the other day."
