   Speaking of secure keyboards, what would one look for inside the keyboard
to determine if it were compromised? Or would the best approach be to buy a 
new keyboard, open it, and photograph the interior with a good camera under
good light at close range, perhaps subtly marking various items first and 
recording the marks. And perhaps also using some sort of sealant on the edges
when closing it back up that would show any tampering?
