There's an entertaining aside that happened in Hawaii during WWII
during a conflict between civilian and military law. The US Marshals,
on behalf of the civil courts, tried to serve a military commander
with a subpoena. The officer ordered troops to block the marshal from
walking onto the porch, while he escaped through a side exit to a
waiting car.
