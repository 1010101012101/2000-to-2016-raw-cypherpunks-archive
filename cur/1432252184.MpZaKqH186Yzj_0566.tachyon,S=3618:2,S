Save that the Feds have no interest in proceeding against any list posters 
with cash and brains (or perhaps self-control).

They have only arrested two very tangential participants with neither cash 
nor self control.

They won't proceed against others because they would lose to a full defense 
and they know it.

Maybe there are some other JB's or CJ's on the list.  Any 
candidates?  Those might be endangered but no one else.
