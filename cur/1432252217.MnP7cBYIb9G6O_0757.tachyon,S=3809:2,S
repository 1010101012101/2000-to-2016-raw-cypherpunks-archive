"Whatever recharges the battery" in a car is the alternator.
You'd wire it up to a battery feed instead - the lighting system
is distributed widely enough around the car that that's probably convenient
if you want to put it somewhere harder to see.

Doesn't matter - they're not trying to locate Bell within 100 feet
to target him with nuclear weapons, just keep general track of where
he's going and be able to demonstrate where his car was at least to the
across-the-state-line level of accuracy.
