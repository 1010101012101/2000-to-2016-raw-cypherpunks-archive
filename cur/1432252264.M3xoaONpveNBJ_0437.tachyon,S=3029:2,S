Or avoid flying, which is what has driven United, American, US Air, 
Sabena, Swissair, and several other airlines into bankruptcy or close 
to it. Latest casualties include Cathay Pacific, which, courtesy of 
police state measure and SARS, is close to shutting down.

I haven't flown since the summer of 2000. I didn't like the cramped 
cattle cars of the past decade (I was once pulled off a UAL flight for 
honestly answering an "anonymous" opinion poll--Fuck Them--UAL earned 
extinction decades ago). My last several flights have been horrible.

Southwest Airlines was fairly reasonable, despite asking me questions 
in San Diego which I could not truthfully answer without lying, so to 
speak, and I hope it also goes bankrupt, as is likely within a few 
years.

American, UAL, Air France...they have earned liquidation. With extreme 
prejudice.
