The reason they would not let her pilot the plane on the flight for 
which she got the ticker tape parade is that she could not safely pilot 
the plane for which she got the ticker tape parade.  That they would not 
let her fly it, despite extreme pressure to do so, suggests that if the 
had let her fly it, she would have gotten killed all the faster.

If unsafe to let her fly one plane, unsafe to let her fly another very 
similar plane.

They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they 
had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, 
under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara 
Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they 
could find.

PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.

Similarly, successful businesses stuff all their female executives into 
HR, keeping them away from decisions that could screw up the business.

In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms 
and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non 
flying.  All the naval pilots that actually fly will be given girly 
uniforms.  Emasculation will be required in order to provide a more 
female friendly environment for the non flying pilots.
