I am not that comfortable with this idea:

1.  The meeting location is not generally known.

2.  I prefer the "open-air" arrangement (public place with good
view of the environment).

3.  I also prefer the "open-seating" arrangement (precise
location determined on the fly).

After all, cypherpunks are supposed to be paranoid...
