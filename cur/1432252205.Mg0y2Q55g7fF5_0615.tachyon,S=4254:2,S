Hello David,

http://www.rayservers.com/blog/physics-drives-finance-finance-drives-politics

"Today, we do not have money or stock markets. We have debt tokens, slave
identification cards, money markets instead of stock markets, and fascists in
charge. In a related note, we do not have news, we have propaganda. This is
because we do not have a market for news, we have a market for advertising. News
merely turns into filler in-between the paid advertising spots. Naturally
parasites arise to replace news with propaganda."

So, hell no, religious idealism won't cut it. You need a market.

Best,
Ray
