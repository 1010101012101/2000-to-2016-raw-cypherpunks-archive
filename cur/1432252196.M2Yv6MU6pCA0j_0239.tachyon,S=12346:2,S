Not at all.  The distinction is in the same vein as the distinction
between talking about something and actually doing it.

You can't draw this parallel, though.  You see, he is only proposing
the _lack_ of certain forces compelling you to do something.  This is
not advocating "anarchy, injustice, and immorality," but simply
rejecting regulations on how one should associate with the rest of
society.

Further, setting a precedent whereby it is acceptable to legislate
"proper behavior" is obviously flawed, because you can't provide a
valid distinction between nice fuzzy laws compelling you to behave in
a certain way and the laws of an Orwellian nightmare as you'd
certainly like to.  On the other hand, making a distinction between
laws that compel behavior of one sort and laws that simply prevent
certain behaviors is perfectly acceptable, and necessary.  The
argument is really, I think, about laws which limit positive actions
(shooting someone) versus laws which limit negative actions (not
associating with someone).  The latter are, for Gil, for me, and for
most people on this list, unacceptable.

Please admit that you just used a squirrel definition so we can kill
the worms in this can quickly.  Restrictions on the negative liberty
in question (that is, _not_ to associate with someone) are obviously
more intrusive than laws that limit positive liberties (e.g. the
liberty to kill your neighbor).

> justify separately.

This statement tells me that there is no common ground between you and
Gil, or between you and me.  Gil and I start from the assumption that
you have liberties that the government cannot take away, while you
seem to be coming from the perspective that the government gives its
people certain liberties, but that liberty comes from nowhere else but
government.  Perhaps it's not even worth it to argue any more.

I put forth this explanation: shared resources are those resources to
which it is impossible to restrict access.  A lighthouse built on the
coast and the radio spectrum are both examples of shared resources.
Food is not.  I can keep you from eating my food without too much
trouble--I can lock it in a safe or I can eat it.  I can discriminate
as to whom I will provide services, et cetera.

No, not at all.  A shopkeeper who owns a private shop has the right to
sell only to certain people and not to others, and the distinction the
shop owner makes between those he will sell to and those he will not
is his alone to make.

But why not?  Why is this different from forcing a shop owner to sell
to people he would not otherwise serve?  It seems that if I cannot
limit your right to speak, even if I can't escape the sound of your
voice, you can't limit my right not to sell food to you even if it
means you will starve.

Neither Gil nor anyone else is your caretaker; thus, you are imposing
upon him by asking him to transport you out of there.  This is again a
distinction between positive and negative action.  You say his
_in_action is an undue burden on you.  I say that your request for his
action is an undue burden on him.

You have a right to life.  You do not have the right not to die.
There is a difference.  Neither I nor anyone else have to sustain your
life; all that is required of our respecting your right not to die is
that we don't kill you.
