I followed this case pretty closely when it broke, and the weight of
circumstantial evidence struck me almost entirely as wishful thinking by
law enforcement, combined with public hysteria over product tampering at
the time.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if she just had the misfortune to buy one
of several bottles tainted by someone else, and after being traumatized by
having her husband die in front of her, got fucked over by the system to
boot.

That the feds may have withheld evidence that proved her innocence isn't
particularly startling either.
