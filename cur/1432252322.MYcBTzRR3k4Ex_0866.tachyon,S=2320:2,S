Just saw this mentioned on Slashdot.

High Performance SSH/SCP - HPN-SSH

http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/

The internal flow control buffers in openssh are small
and static. The guys at Pittsburgh SC have created a
patch that can be applied to openssh that dynamically increases
the buffers which dramatically improves performance. They
also multi-threaded the crypto. So if you were wondering
about what to do with that extra core, now you have your
answer.
