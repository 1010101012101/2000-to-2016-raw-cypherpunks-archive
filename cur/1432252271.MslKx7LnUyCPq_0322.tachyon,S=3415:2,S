wouldn't that be perfect? a "collectable patent card game", as a way to
criticise patents (by using the most ridiculous ones on the cards),
which in itself violates a patent... hm, I like the idea...


"combine the 'patent for display of blablah' with the 'method or device
for remote information acquisition' and you can cross-license that
against your enemie's 'global computer network patent' for 10 points."
