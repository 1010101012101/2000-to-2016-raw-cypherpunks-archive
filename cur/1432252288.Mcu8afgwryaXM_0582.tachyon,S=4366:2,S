Commotion is an open source bdevice-as-infrastructureb communication
platform that challenges conventional communication infrastructures both
domestically and abroad. This new technology integrates usersb existing
cell phones, Wi-Fi enabled computers, and other wireless-capable
personal devices to create anonymous, peer-to-peer (mesh) communications
networks. Deployment of Commotion is potentially as valuable for
dissidents wishing to circumvent repressive regimes as for local
activists wishing to support autonomous, low-cost communicative spaces.
Josh King, lead technologist for the Open Technology Initiative at the
New America Foundation, will discuss the architecture, opportunities,
and challenges--both social and technical--of creating a distributed
secure network.

Bio:
Josh King is technical lead for the Open Technology Initiative at the
New America Foundation. Prior to joining New America, he was a Systems
Engineer for OJC Technologies and also served as an Americorps VISTA
Leader. Josh volunteered as a lead technology worker within the
