	The thing is, with the WTO protests, there isn't one X to 
demonize, and with anything from rifle-rounds to water cannons it 
isn't only the black bloc that's going to be hit. It's going to be 
the Pretty Little Hippy Chick who was Just Protesting Indonesian 
Sweat Shops. It's going to be the 40 something truck driver who was 
protesting the unsafe Mexican Trucks on the US highways.

	Sure, they'll get some of the Black Blockheads, but large 
crowds are chaos, and as soon as the shooting starts, things are 
going to get massively stochastic.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
