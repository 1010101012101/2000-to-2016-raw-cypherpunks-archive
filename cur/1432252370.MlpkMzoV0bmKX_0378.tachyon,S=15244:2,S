	I remembered somewhere having seen that the initial
	reaction to Pearl Harbor among the intelligentsia
	was disbelief that it was an act of war: 'rogue
	pilots had perpetrated the atrocity' --they must be
	located and brought to trial; Admiral Yamamoto 'had
	a lot of explaining to do'; the Emporer was a
	pacifist; 'we must not ruin the diplomatic progress
	of the past few years'; talk to the League.... <p>

	Well, here is Edward R. Murrow, the dean of the news
	beat, intoning the "sense of the moment": roll over,
	examine why the Japanese would even want to attack
	(don't even consider that US trade sanctions,
	particularly petroleum, left them no alternative). <p>

	Bush did not start out with the liberals wanting to
	analyze why, and hold out a hand (to be bitten off),
	but it is degenerating to that among our supposed
	allies --the Arab "allies" are only giving lip
	service with some 'intelligence' but hindering
	action to avoid being labeled "against the US" --eg:
	demanding that the UN lead any military search and
	extract, or retaliation. Yup, run your strategy on
	TV, get CNN in place first. <p>

	Let's wake up, smell the roses of our great
	country, and accept the fact we (and the Brits) are
	traveling the route alone; <b>--let's get it on.</b>

    						<b>
    December 8, 1941  				<br>
    What Should We Do? 				<br>
    By Edward R. Murrow 			<br></b>
    Washington, D.C. 				<p>

    President Roosevelt will call for a joint session of
    Congress today to discuss yesterday's bombing of Pearl
    Harbor and the reported loss of 2,400 Americans. I can
    report that our commander-in-chief is calm and will not
    ask for a precipitous "outright" declaration of war
    against the Japanese, but instead leans toward a general
    consensus to "hunt down the perpetrators" of this act of
    "infamy."  Speaking for the Congress, Senator Arthur
    Vandenberg promised bipartisan support to "bring to
    justice" the Japanese pilots. Many believe that the
    "rogue" airmen may well have flown from Japanese
    warships. In response, Secretary of War Stimson is
    calling for "an international coalition to indict these
    cowardly purveyors of death," and will shortly ask the
    Japanese imperial government to hand over the suspected
    airman from the Akagi and Kaga - "and any more of these
    cruel fanatics who took off from ships involved in this
    dastardly act."  Assistant Secretary Robert Patterson
    was said to have remarked, "Stimson is madder than hell
    - poor old Admiral Yamamato has a lot of explaining to
    do."  <p>

    Secretary of State Cordell Hull, however, this morning
    cautioned the nation about such "jingoism." He warned,
    "The last thing we want is another Maine or
    Lusitania. We wouldn't want to start something like a
    Second World War and ruin the real progress in
    Japanese-American relations over the last few years."
    Hull himself is preparing for a long tour to consult our
    allies in South America, Africa, and colonial France:
    "If we get the world on board, and make them understand
    that this is not merely an aggressive act upon us, much
    less just an American problem, such a solid front may
    well deter further Japanese action."  <p>

    Even as Hull prepares to depart, special envoy Harry
    Hopkins is calling for a general statement of concern
    from the League of Nations, condemning not only the most
    recent Japanese aggression, but also an earlier reported
    incident in Nanking, China. "If we can get an expression
    of outrage from the League, Japan may well find itself
    in an interesting pickle.  We're looking for some strong
    League action of the type that followed the banditry in
    Ethiopia and Finland."  Hopkins finished by emphasizing
    the rather limited nature of the one-day Pearl Harbor
    incursion, and suggesting such piecemeal attacks were
    themselves a direct result of past American
    restraint. "We did not rattle our sabers when they went
    into China.  Had we listened to the alarmists then, we
    might well be seeing Japanese anger manifesting itself
    from the Philippines to Wake Island in the coming days."
    <p>

    Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., a few
    hours ago reminded the nation of the current disturbing
    economic news. "Four million Americans are still out of
    work. Americans are not out of this Depression by any
    means. Are we to borrow money to build planes that we
    don't even know will fly?" The industrialist Henry
    Kaiser was no more optimistic: "There is simply no
    liquidity in these markets. We shouldn't even be
    considering rearming. It is not as if we are going to
    build a ship a day. Even launching a carrier every
    couple of years could put us back to 1932." <p>

    Military leaders, smarting over yesterday's losses, were
    no more ready for war. Even the usually colorful Admiral
    Halsey sounded a note of concern to this reporter,
    "Look, they have all the cards, not us. The bastards
    over there could give us a decade of war at least. Where
    do I get bases for my subs and flattops? Who gives me
    strips for the flyboys? This could be a new war with no
    rules.  Believe me, brother, we ain't going to Midway or
    some place like that in six months and cut down to size
    the whole damn imperial fleet. It's just not going to
    happen." Admiral King was nearly as blunt, "Hell's
    bells, no one has ever conquered Japan since they kicked
    the Portuguese out. Do the American people really want
    to go over to that part of the world and fight those
    samurai madmen? The logistics are impossible. These
    people have been at war for years. I've seen these Zeros
    - you put a suicide basket case with a wish to die for
    the emperor in with a tank of gas, and you've got a
    guided rocket that will blow our ships out of the
    water." Colonel James Doolittle was even more cautious
    than the top brass when told of calls for potential
    early American counterattacks. "Swell - the last thing
    we need is to send in some hot-dogger to drop a few
    bombs for the press boys that cause no real damage and
    get our fellas killed in the bargain."  <p>

    On the home front, prominent voices in the arts
    expressed far stronger reservations about possible
    American "revenge". Robert Maynard Hutchins of the
    University of Chicago explained to me that the Pearl
    Harbor incident cannot be separated from its larger
    cultural context. "We must guard against this absurd and
    ongoing moral absolutism on the part of the United
    States in seeing complex cultural differences in black
    and white terms of the Occident and the Orient.  We have
    no monopoly on morality or justice." His colleague,
    Mortimer J.  Adler, elaborated: "Far too often we look
    at the world through Western lenses. But in Japanese
    eyes, this rather desperate attack is seen as a "slap",
    a lashing out of sorts to get the attention of the
    United States, really more of a desperate cry of the
    heart than anything else." Adler went on, "Japan has had
    a tradition of isolation from and distrust of Western
    civilization - rightly so in some respects, given
    everything from past European missionaries to racism,
    economic exploitation, and colonialism. If we inflame
    passions, they may well simply divorce themselves from
    the world community - or worse, set off a conflagration
    of pan-Asian hatred toward Occidentals that could last
    for generations. It seems to me Pearl Harbor is rather
    more of a case of Admiral Perry's chickens at long last
    coming home to roost."  <p>

    Contacted at home, the noted naval historian Samuel
    Eliot Morison was pessimistic about the strategy
    involved in any U.S. response: "Good God, do they want
    us to fight the entire world - Germany, Italy, Hungry,
    Bulgaria, Romania, and now Japan? We lose 2,400 sailors
    - less than an annual poliomyelitis outbreak - and then
    we start a World War II? I find these calls for mindless
    retaliation not only na&iuml;ve, but disturbing as well in
    their failure to take account of America's strategic
    impotence. That's a part of the world we know very
    little about." <p>

    Prominent American clergymen blasted the very idea of
    armed retaliation, calling instead for interfaith
    services and greater tolerance of Japanese religious
    beliefs.  Cardinal Cushing warned against castigating
    the entire Japanese people for the actions of a few
    fanatics, adding that "Bushido, is, in fact, merely a
    variant of Shintoism, itself an age-old and
    misunderstood faith that is as humane as anything in
    Christian teaching." Cushing added, "There is nothing in
    Bushido, much less Shintoism that is inherently
    bellicose or at all anti-Western. These few extremists
    are hardly representative of either public or religious
    opinion in Japan." Cushing concluded, "The Emperor
    himself is a pacifist, a Zen scholar in fact deeply
    devoted to entomology, with no interest at all in
    bloodshed. And so the better question might be posed:
    'Why does so much of Asia hate us?'"  <p>

    Celebrated director John Ford reflected Hollywood's
    unease with the early rumors of war. "Hell, we are
    artists, not mouthpieces. What are we to do - join the
    Navy to make movies on government spec? Had we had more
    Japanese films available to the American people in the
    first place, we wouldn't have had this
    misunderstanding." A few Hollywood stars who were
    willing to speak on the record agreed. Jimmy Stewart
    called for a world conference of concerned actors and
    screenwriters. "There have been some great Japanese
    movies. We need to reach out to our brother actors over
    there. The last thing we need is a bunch of us would-be
    pilots storming over to Burbank to enlist."  Clark Gable
    was adamant in his belief in keeping America from doing
    something "stupid," as he put it. "If you haven't heard
    lately: We're actors, artists really, not
    war-mongers. I'm sure that our Japanese counterparts
    feel the same way. We need to put away the B-17s and get
    the cameras rolling on both sides."  <p>

    Celebrated veterans were especially angered about
    knee-jerk American anger. Alvin C. York, Medal of Honor
    winner and hero of the Great War, was reported as
    "madder than hell" at the "war scare." "We shouldn't
    fight in some jungle island just because the Japanese
    hate old man Rockefeller as much as we do."  <p>

    In an in-depth newsmaker interview, 81-year-old General
    John J. Pershing told Henry Luce of Time magazine, "I've
    made war before - long and hard. I've seen it. These
    sunshine sluggers talk a great game, but wait until our
    dead pile up. No, it is time to collect our thoughts and
    think like adults for a change. Lashing back is just
    what these extremists want us to do. If a war breaks
    out, then their mission is accomplished. I'd hate to see
    us playing into the hands of a few militarists who want
    to topple the moderates and the emperor. This ocean war
    with carriers is an entirely new challenge, nothing like
    we have ever seen before. Why get our boys killed only
    to make a few samurai martyrs?" <p>

    And so it is with confidence today that this reporter
    assures the American people and the world that sobriety,
    maturity, and prudence - not bombs - are the watchwords
    on the home front. Remember - our enemies can only win
    if they make us answer their violence with more needless
    violence.  <p>
