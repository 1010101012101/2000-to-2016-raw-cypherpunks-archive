The best way to do that is to produce a solution that's better than MAPS.
If you strongly beleive in end-user filtering, then make a better
end-user filter.  In fact you can start with mine (see web page)
and make it user-friendly enough that your Mom can use it.
Then it might see significant use.

MAPS might not have been perfect, and ORBS was overly agressive, but
they were actually doing something.  It was simple, just add
a couple lines to your sendmail.cf and much of your spam
would go away.  Great for ISPs with users complaining about spam.
(that's a hint about how your better-than-MAPS system might work).

It's easier to write a rant than it is to write code, but
code is what counts.
