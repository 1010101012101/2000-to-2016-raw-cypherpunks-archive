And the inevitable outcome of a _moderated_ list is that free expression
(loon-like or not) is sacrificed. 

No thanks.

Censorship. er, "moderation" is bad, regardless of any benign intent.

Wrong.  Nomen has long since placed him/herself into the position of not
being taken seriously.  Having groups of people who choose to turn a deaf
ear is a pretty real negative consequence, IMHO.

I see killfiling as more of a simple noise suppressor, akin to the muffs
you wear when shooting.  If Nomen has nothing useful to say, then the
[individually chosen] loss of his/her input is not "hiding", as your
head-in-the-sand metaphor would suggest.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
