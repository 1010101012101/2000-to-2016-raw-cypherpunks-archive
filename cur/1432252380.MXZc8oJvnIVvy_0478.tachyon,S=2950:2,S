    The difference being that in a system such as Sarad describes, if 
'None of the above' gets more votes than any candidate, the election is 
declared void and a re-election is called (possibly excluding any of the 
candidates from the first round, depending on the details); hence, the 
50% of the population who think 'they're all fvckers' have a reason to 
go to the polls.

    I've experienced such a system in action (within a student body) and 
it works well, provided you like your democracy to be loud and 
participatory.  For this reason it's unlikely to be implemented by an 
incumbent government, though I guess it's possible an uber-populist like 
Chavez or Lula might consider it.
