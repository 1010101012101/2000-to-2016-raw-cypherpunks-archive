    Is Judge Jackson Backing Away from MS Breakup?
    posted by cicero on Wednesday October 04, @12:07PM
    from the so-much-for-a-quick-and-dirty-breakup-eh? dept.

    Erick Gustafson writes in about a Valley News article on the
    Microsoft antitrust case: "Evidently Jackson is on a speaking tour to
    distance himself from the breakup remedy. Jackson seems to be
    deliberately lessening pressure for the appellate court to uphold his
    decision. What do you think?" Gustafson works for Citizens for a Sound
    Economy, a free-market group that opposes the lawsuit. He may have a
    point: Judge Jackson recently said similar things at another
    conference last week. The Valley News (a New Hampshire paper) article
    isn't online, so we'll include an excerpt below.
