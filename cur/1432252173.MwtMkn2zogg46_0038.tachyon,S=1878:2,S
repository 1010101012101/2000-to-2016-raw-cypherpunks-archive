Wherever the master's boot smashes into the face of a child, we
can rely on Chomsky to deny the master's crimes, while
simultaneously justifying those crimes, and demonizing the
child as a CIA agent.

Always Chomsky is on the side of evil, of hatred, of the
torturer, and against the torturer's victim, as he was on the
issue of Pol Pot's Cambodia, when he spread and endorsed the
lies of issued by Pol Pot's regime.
