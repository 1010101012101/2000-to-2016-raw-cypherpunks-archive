Yup.  It's the URL for the front page, and articles roll off
the bottom as new ones are posted, as Jim knows.

However, the project has some very interesting concepts,
and is worth looking at.   Distributed storage,
M-of-N replication, security handled mainly by
storing only plaintext.  I haven't looked at their approaches to
traffic analysis or anonymity, if any.

http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu is the project home page.
Publications are at 
	http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/index.html

I don't recognize the names of the principals on it - 
are there any Cypherpunks who've worked with them?
More of the real documentation is hidden in the
parent project's pages - 
	http://endeavour.cs.berkeley.edu/presentations.html
has <arrrgh> Microsoft Powerpoint presentations with the good stuff.
				Thanks!
