________________________________________________ The media is outraged that 
workers beat the Director of the Odra Factory in Szczecin. In my opinion 
(they televised the incident), he clearly provoked that reaction by telling 
people quite openly to fuck off. It doesn't seem to occur to the media to 
be outraged that women at Odra Factory, which as far as I know is still 
exporting clothes, haven't been paid in six months. This is the first time 
we hear about it in the media. Now the police who didn't arrest workers are 
dismissed and some workers are arrested. This is an important step in 
workers' solidarity as workers from the Shipyards came to support the 
struggles of the women at Odra. Just recently members of Workers' 
Initiative from FA Szczecin criticized the Shipyard workers for failing to 
see their struggle as connected and show solidarity to other workers. Maybe 
things will start to change.
