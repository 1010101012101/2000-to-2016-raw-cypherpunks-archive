But if you just want to show movies "securely" you need not use my general
purpose and today untrammeled computer.  You can either show movies in
movie houses, or use some slightly trammeled version of a "cable ready TV",
or the variant product mentioned earlier, the "donglified monitor/speaker".

There is no need for the MPAA to "verify the integrity of the processor" if
all the MPAA wants to do is sell me tickets to movies.

What does the enforcement of the laws against copyright infringement have
to do with my general purpose and today untrammeled computer?  There is no
relation of the sort you, and all the mass media, implicitly assume here.
Indeed no OS at all should be involved in the "secure showing of movies".
It is like using the standard C libraries to write "secure code"!

My donglified monitor/speakers combination, of course, offers greater
assurance.  Here is part of my argument: the explanation of my proposed
protocols can actually be understood.

The dilemma "Either give over all the computers in the world to the
Englobulators, or never get to see another big budget Hollywood movie." is
a false dichotomy.

oo--JS.
