a good (german) article in telepolis today:

http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/te/4774/1.html

an interview with the green speaker for media-politics (the green party
is currently in a coalition with the social democratics, thus part of
the german government). highlights: anonymous internet usage is
considered very important, nobody should be forces to reveal any
personal data and electronic signatures should be available to
pseudonyms and have equal rank than those made with a real name.
