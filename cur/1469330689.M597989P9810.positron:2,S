I am so absolutely overjoyed that somebody released these 19,000+ Democrat =
National Committee emails, showing that they were and are trying to sabotag=
e Sanders' primary campaign. =C2=A0If there is a way to destroy a political=
 party, this is certainly it. =C2=A0And the one about trying to get Bernie =
Sanders to state he's an atheist, because that would bother the Southern Ba=
ptists worse than if he were Jewish, that's clearly an example of making ju=
st about everyone angry at the same time. =C2=A0Wonderful act! =C2=A0Even b=
etter timing! =C2=A0
Maybe the Democrats (and the Republicans as well) will begin to appreciate =
the value of good encryption.
If anybody out there is old enough to remember the 1968 Democrat Convention=
 in Chicago, which turned into a "police riot", maybe we will see a repeat =
48 years later.
I will, of course, be voting for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, albeit=
 with a few reservations. =C2=A0(Only some of which can be seen by doing a =
Google-search for the words 'Nazi cake'). =C2=A0 I utterly detest pandering=
, even if (especially if!) done by people identifying themselves as liberta=
rians.. =C2=A0
