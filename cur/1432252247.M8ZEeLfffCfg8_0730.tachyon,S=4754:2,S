I admit I'm not familiar with the details of the corporate structure,
but my understanding is that McAfee is the anti-virus arm of Network
Associates. Another NAI appendage is McAfee.com, which is majority-
owned by NAI. So you're right, not precisely the same, but they're
close enough for this purpose: I got a near-word-for-word identical
denial from NAI, below.

Declan,

With regards to your message below, Network Associates/McAfee has not
contacted the FBI, nor has the FBI contacted NAI/McAfee, regarding Magic
Lantern.  Additionally, we do not expect the FBI to contact Network
Associates/McAfee regarding Magic Lantern.

Tony Thompson
