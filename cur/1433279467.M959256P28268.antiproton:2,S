Yes, I am. I'm assuming that, if someone were to see some sort of generic
parent solution, and they knew that their parents worked at the NSA and
were able to use specialized technical skills, then they would know that it
was just not applicable to their situation. But I'm assuming that that
would nevertheless be useful for 90% of people. Or am I completely wrong
about that?

I don't know exactly what I want/expected. Like, it would be absolutely
brilliant if there was some general,
accessible-to-an-arbitrary-more-tech-savvy-than-average-teenager, howto
security, possibly for simplicity specialized to parent-situations, but
accessible security is in general a huge unsolved and possibly unsolvable
problem. I suppose I was hoping to at least start.
