  Problem there is - Miller didn't write the story, pass on the info to anyone
else, or indeed do much more than have a conversation with an unnamed source
where a classified name was revealed.  The Grand Jury is aware that Miller had
this info but refused to reveal who the informant was.
  On the other hand - Robert Novak got the same information, REPORTED it - and
isn't in any sort of trouble at all. Somehow this isn't the issue though... and
I wonder why?
