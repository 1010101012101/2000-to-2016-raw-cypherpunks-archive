FBI Director Robert Mueller reports his bureau has no plans to investigate
the chief suspect in the international anthrax mailings case.
FBI Implicated in Anthrax Mailings Cover-up: Mueller Reports No Intention
to Investigate Chief Suspect
Sandpoint, ID FBI officials may be implicated in a conspiracy to impede
justice in the anthrax mailings case, if not treasonous dereliction of
duty, according to a growing number of scientists and consumer advocates.
After officials cited the likeliest origin of the powdered anthrax was the
U.S. Armys Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, or its Ohio-based supplier and
CIA-contractor, Battelle Memorial Instititue (BMI), FBI Director Robert
Mueller announced the bureau has no intention of investigating anyone with,
or formerly with, their chief suspectBMI.
Just weeks ago, major progress in the FBIs investigation seemed
forthcoming. The New York Times and Washington Post revealed that BMI,
Dugways anthrax facility supplier and chief administrator had contracted
with the CIA (in project Clear Vision) to produce, albeit illegally, the
1 trillion spore-per-gram strain of anthrax under investigation. BMI, while
heading the U.S. militarys Joint Vaccine Acquisitions Program worth more
than $1 billion in vaccine contracts, commissioned Americas top anthrax
expert, William C. Patrick, III, to deliver a report on the powdered
anthraxs prospects for being spread through the mail.
Thus, by mid-December, the public, including health scientists urged to
help federal officials identify suspects, realized that someone with high
level security clearance, a black-op budget, access to the BMI/Dugway
anthrax labs, and vaccine sales incentive, most likely took BMIs powdered
anthrax, and prepared it for mailing from Trenton, NJ; St. Petersburg, FL;
Atlanta, GA; and Malaysia.
For the first time since the 1975 Frank Church congressional investigation
of the CIA for illegally stockpiling anthrax and other biological weapons,
the public learned that the CIA had been violating the international Geneva
Accord moratorium on biological weapons developmenta revelation somewhat
embarrassing to American diplomats engaged in the global War on Terrorism.
The day before Christmas, an Op Ed piece in the Wall Street Journal
additionally implicated BMI, and potentially the FBI, along with rogue
elements within the CIA, in an international conspiracy to commit and
cover-up the anthrax mailings crime.
BMI and Bioport, a Michigan-based offshoot of Britains leading biological
weapons organization at Porton Down, were previously reported to be
collaborating on the manufacture and supply of Americas only anthrax
vaccine. Dr. Robert C. Myers, Chief Operating Officer of BioPort, told a
Senate Appropriations Committee in 1996 that he was part of a team of
organizations, led by Battelle Memorial Institute . . .  The Journal
writer Edward Jay Epstein cited the testimony of U.S. Army bioweapons
official David Franz concerning Americas reliance on British intelligence
provided by Porton Down officials regarding the development and use of the
powdered Ames strain of anthrax.
Thus, the FBIs disregard of foreign suspects, especially Porton Down, with
direct links to Bioport and BMIs anthrax vaccine, vaccine contracts, and
BMIs and Dugways anthrax experiments, was criticized by Epstein as it was
days earlier in the Washington Post.
More evidence of the FBIs intentional ineptitude came from the Columbus
Dispatch. Though the Washington Post reported that the FBI was allegedly
pursuing the possibility that financial gain was the motive behind the
anthrax mailings, and that two laboratories were especially implicated,
that is, BMI and Dugway, a contradictory announcement was relayed the same
day (Dec. 21, 2001) by Ohio Senator Mike DeWine. Based on an ABC News
report concerning a BMI employee who had been under FBI investigation for
an anthrax threat, FBI Director Robert Mueller had, according to The
Dispatch, assured Senator DeWine that the bureau was not investigating, nor
intending to investigate, anyone with, or formerly with, BMI.
Currently then, the FBI has no intention of investigating its chief
suspect, despite the grave likelihood that the remaining mystery will
continue to exact massive economic and socio-political tolls.
These proceedings have bewildered and even outraged many scientists and
public health professionals from whom the FBI requested assistance.
In defending the FBIs position, the Washington Post reported that the
bureau only learned of a BMI-administered CIA defensive biowarfare
contract involving the Ames-strain of anthrax in recent weeks. The CIA
program was [allegedly] designed to develop defenses to a vaccine-resistant
strain of anthrax reportedly created by the former Soviet Union, officials
defended. CIA spokespersons expressed certainty that the anthrax used in
the mailings did not come from their work.
Taking the agency on its word, the powdered anthrax may not have come from
their work, but their contractors work, that is, BMI.
Critics claim this CIA defense is deceptive for at least two other reasons:
1) the Soviet Unions most potent anthrax was only half as concentrated as
this new CIA/Battelle creation; and 2) it is an American/BritishAmes,
Iowastrain prototype, not a Soviet creation, and not resembling anything
available to Iraq or other countries favored by terrorists. This spoils the
excuse the powdered anthrax was produced for any form of defense,
including vaccines.
Vaccines are developed to help guard against pre-existing threats, said
Ingri Cassel, director of the national Vaccination Liberation associationa
consumer education and advocacy group. This anthrax powder was illegally
prepared, apparently for offensive military uses, sabotage, and even
terrorism. You simply dont develop a new hyper-weaponized strain of
anthrax powder for military defense, which implies preventive vaccinations
against old Soviet threats, and then commission the top U.S. anthrax expert
[William C. Patrick, III] to report on this new weapons capability and
lethality from mailed delivery, unless thats how you foresee it being
used, Ms. Cassel reasoned.
Many people are pondering the suspicious Machiavellian-like targeting of
the mass media and congressional Democrats (liberals) befitting the phrase
the ends justifies the means. Multi-million dollar vaccine contracts,
fast-tracked drug approvals, and frenzied consumer and legislative demand
for costly, risky, and largely ineffective vaccines, antibiotics, and other
high-priced preventives are the most obvious results of the anthrax mailings.
Referring to the unprecedented silica-based, electro-statically charged,
dry powdered form of hyper-concentrated anthrax sent through the mail to
members of the media and Senators Daschle and Leahy, Dr. Horowitz
concluded, It was the only form of anthrax that could be effectively
spread, as it was, through the U.S. mail with such far reaching effects.
Therefore, the primary suspects have been identified, their dubious
histories are well known, and their motives are clear. Any further effort
to impede this investigation places FBI director Mueller in the position of
an enemy national, or a traitor to the American people he is sworn to
protect.
