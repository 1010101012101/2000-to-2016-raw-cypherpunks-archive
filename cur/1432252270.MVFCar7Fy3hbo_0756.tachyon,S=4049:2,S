That's certainly a big part of it.
NSA has also always had the policy that they and only they will decide
what's strong enough for military use, partly because they
know what they (and possibly the KGB) can crack,
and they know that everything the commmercial world offered before DES,
and much of which it offered before PGP and before EFF's Deep Crack,
was either Snake Oil or DES implementations of varying quality
(e.g. some had inadequate random number generators for keys).
They also had a policy of not letting their crypto tech out,
because that would give the Commies technology as good as theirs,
which they desparately didn't want, and while security by obscurity
isn't real security, it still helps reduce attacks by less capable
cryptanalysts and makes data collection harder for the KGB,
or for other people they might want to hide stuff from,
like the Brits or French or Israelis.
