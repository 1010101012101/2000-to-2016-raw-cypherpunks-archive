Minister Andre Haermeyer said he would convene a working party of police, 
sports bodies and venue managers to develop a uniform code of conduct for 
crowd behaviour at Victorian sporting events. He foreshadowed higher 
on-the-spot fines of up to $10,000 for drunken behaviour and ground invasions.


Mr Haermeyer said the Government and police would consider banning known 
troublemakers.


He said digital face-recognition technology could also be used against 
terrorism for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games.

Navy death threat claims
 From AAP
15jan02
A FORMER navy sailor has claimed he received death threats after alleging 
he was brutalised while another sailor had a tampon forced into his mouth.
Sam Golledge, a former submariner, told ABC radio and television he was 
forced to see a defence psychiatrist after making complaints against the 
navy while he was serving in the Australian Defence Force.
He said he was ordered to take an anti-depressant against his will.
Mr Golledge said in a separate incident another sailor was held down and a 
used tampon forced into his mouth.
"He doesn't want to be named and he won't come forward with any information 
while he's still serving in the navy because he believes there is no way 
he's going to get the answers that he wants, and he's going to look like an 
outcast as well," Mr Golledge said of his former colleague.
"It's one of those closed places where it's not going to get you anywhere 
until you get out.
"And if you do, like I have, you're going to be alienated and you're going 
to receive death threats, things like that."
The navy last week established an inquiry to investigate allegations 
including the sexual assault of a young female sailor on Christmas Island 
in early December.
