  FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

  Usable Security (USEC'07)
  http://www.usablesecurity.org/

  February 15-16, 2007
  Lowlands, Scarborough, Trinidad/Tobago

  A workshop co-located with
  The Eleventh Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security
  (FC'07)

  Submissions Due Date EXTENDED: November 12, 2006, 11:59pm, PST

  Some of the most challenging problems in designing and maintaining
  secure systems involve human factors. A great deal remains to be
  understood about users' capabilities and motivations to perform
  security tasks. Usability problems have been at the root of many
  widely reported security failures in high-stakes financial,
  commercial and voting applications.

  USEC'07 seeks submissions of novel research from academia and
  industry on all theoretical and practical aspects of usable security
  in the context of finance and commerce. The workshop will bring
  together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners,
  allowing experts in human-computer interaction, cryptography, data
  security and public policy to explore emerging problems and solutions.

  ==    Submission Categories    ==

  USEC'07 invites submissions in three categories: (1) research papers,
  (2) abstracts and demos, and (3) working sessions. For all accepted
  submissions, at least one author must attend the conference and
  present the work.

  Research Papers

  Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
  been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
  conference with proceedings. Research  paper submissions should be at
  most 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices (appendices may
  include usability study materials and data).

  Accepted submissions will appear both in a pre-proceedings, available
  at the workshop, and in a formal proceedings. After receiving
  feedback from the workshop, authors will have the opportunity to
  revise their papers before submitting a camera-ready draft for the
  final proceedings.

  Abstracts and Demos

  Submissions in this category should consist of a short summary of
  work (1-3 pages in length) to be reviewed by the Program Committee,
  along with a short biography of the presenters. Accepted submissions
  will be presented at the conference, and a one-page abstract will be
  published in the conference proceedings. Where appropriate, software
  or hardware demonstrations are encouraged as part of the
  presentations in these sessions.

  Working Sessions

  We are soliciting topics for working sessions at the intersection of
  usability, security, finance and commerce. Working sessions will
  explore topics in depth with significant participation from audience
  members. Proposals for working sessions should include the proposed
  topic, format (e.g., panel of invited experts, moderated discussion
  session, design exercises), prospective participants, time required
  and a plan for engaging participation from audience members.
