Well, yes, there are many. I only even _tried_ to list a handful of the 
most important folks in just that one field: nuclear. Every field has 
its giants.

And the ones I cited in just the nuclear field were not just scientists, 
they were policy advisors. Szilard's soliciting of Einstein to write the 
letter to Roosevelt, Einstein's letter, Fermi's policy work in the 
1950s, Teller's lobbying for the H-bomb, Oppenheimer and the Manhattan 
Project (and later antiwar lobbying), and Von Neumann's powerful 
arguments for building up the nuclear arsenal. (VN favored a pre-emptive 
nuclear strike on Russia with bombers.)

The other examples (we could write all day listing such giants) were 
certainly scientists, but many had no interest whatsoever in policy. 
Kurt Godel, for example. Crick, as another. I don't recall Shannon 
having much interest in policy.

Washington _does_ listen to other than lawyers. The examples I gave 
showed this to be true in the past, and almost certainly still true. 
(And the SDI arguments were in many cases made by scientists, e.g., 
Teller, Lowell Wood, etc.)
