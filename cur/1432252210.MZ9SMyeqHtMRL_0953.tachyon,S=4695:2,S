Forest Defenders Engaged in Ongoing Global Struggle

In the Cascadia Bioregion, northern California to British Columbia, forest 
defense activism is reaching a fever pitch. In Oregon, demonstrations have 
been called to stop old growth logging in Roseburg. Meanwhile, the FBI has 
made arrests in connection to an arson that destroyed logging trucks in 
Eagle Creek last year. Tree spikings continue, with the latest at the Prior 
timber sale and in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. In northern 
California, forest defenders have challenged [ 1 ] the Maxxam Corporation, 
which seeks to fell even more old growth trees. The owner of Maxxam (and 
The Gap), Charles Hurwitz, is well known for engaging in questionable 
business practices.
Meanwhile, the World Bank has unleashed a development agenda for 
corporations in Ecuador. In response, indigenous peoples have come together 
to fight an oil pipeline in the Mindo-Nambillo Forest Reserve. Former 
Cascadia forest defender Julia "Butterfly" Hill was recently arrested for 
direct action forest defense in Quito, and tree-sits were established for 
the first time in Ecuador.
In Venezuela, while the threat to the Imataca forest is awaiting a court 
decision, indigeous peoples are leading the fight against deforestation. 
The U'wa people in Colombia celebrated victory over Oxy Petroleum, as the 
company pulled out of lands they threatened with deforestation and 
despoilment. Finally, indigineous peoples in Guatemala are organizing 
against Plan Puebla Panama.
