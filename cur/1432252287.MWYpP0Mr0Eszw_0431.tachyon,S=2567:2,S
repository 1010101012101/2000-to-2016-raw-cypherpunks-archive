Sure we have been asked.  We get asked every two years, which means
twice already since 9/11.  We keep electing the same assholes who gave
us the patriot act, and the national ID cards, and the "assault weapons"
ban and all of the Know Your Customer / anti-money-laundering
regulations, and the anti-drug laws.  "We" have the power to stop all of
this if we choose.
