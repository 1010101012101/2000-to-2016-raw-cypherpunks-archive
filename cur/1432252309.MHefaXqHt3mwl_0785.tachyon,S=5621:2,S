Which is *precisely* why I would trust information provided to me by a
capitalist than that provided to me by an idealist. A capitalist sees
everything as a product that will either further his desire for
success or hinder it. An idealist sees everything as a mission fitting
within their narrow agenda. A capitalist has much more incentive to
provide a good product (correct, accurate, information) than an
idealist who's sole goal is to further an agenda. Both have their uses
though and both can be manipulated to good and bad ends.

I disagree. The careerist journalists are "crony capitalists" in every
way. They know that, regardless of the accuracy of their information,
the 'other side of the coin' will smooth things over and keep the
public hooked on an inferior product. That's not a true capitalist.

That's one of my main arguments with socialists and other
non-capitalist believers: they point to our current system and say
'see, it's exploitive and hurts people!' and it does. But that's not a
true capitalist system. Will we ever actually have one? Doubtful. But
what we have now is definitely not a good example.
