Hairdryer ploy used on speeders
August 1 2002
Melbourne residents who used hairdryers like police radar guns to deter 
speedsters in their suburbs risked fights with motorists, Victoria Police 
said today.
Assistant Commissioner for Traffic Ray Shuey said local police would be 
talking to eastern suburbs residents who took the law into their own hands 
by pointing hairdryers at speeding motorists.
"It's not appropriate from our point of view to engage in that type of 
activity," he said.
He said the residents were risking altercations with motorists and urged 
them to look to their own behaviour on the roads first.
"Quite often we have the concept that we don't want people speeding in our 
side streets," Assistant Commissioner Shuey said.

"And yet we're quite prepared to go into other people's side streets and 
zip around and disregard kids or the elderly or anybody walking in those 
locations. It's okay to speed everywhere else but not in my patch."
Boroondara City councillor Judith Voce confirmed residents in her ward had 
been using their hairdryers against motorists.
She said speeding was an endemic problem in the east and residents were 
angry about "rat-runners" - motorists avoiding Citylink tolls or leaving 
the main arterials looking for short cuts through the suburbs.
"People did slow down (for the hairdryers)," Cr Voce said.
