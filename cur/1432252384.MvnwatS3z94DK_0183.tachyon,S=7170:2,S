I have worked with computer hardware and software systems for long
enough to know what the difference is between equipment failure and
sabotage. I can prove my Internet equipment was sabotaged immediately
after I first submitted my analysis to this tor-talk mailing list
yesterday. I had to reflash the corrupted firmware on my router to get
it to work again. My Internet connection was under denial-of-service
attack for a prolonged period of time afterwards where I could not make
a connection. This honestly happens every time I speak the truth
regarding the National Security Agency and corrupt government officials
who are abusing their power.

Someday in the not too distant future, those of you who live here in the
United States, who have been brainwashed into thinking this is a free
democracy, will find out the truth about what this corrupt government
are all about and will look elsewhere in the world to relocate. If I was
granted one wish, it would be that someone in another part of the world
would help me relocate away from this horribly oppressive regime that
are literally holding me hostage and turning anyone against me who I
appeal to for help.

Sincerely, Travis Bean
