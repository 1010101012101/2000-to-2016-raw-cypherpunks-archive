Of course they don't.  Carting stuff is a job for union workers,
so that's done by the General Services Administration, unless there's
some other local union contract that requires your city's workers to do it.
And deciding whether you own things or not is a long legal process,
as is identifying what things you might own that are somewhere else.
So instead they just have the aforementioned union or city workers
cart away everything you _have_, and cart back anything later determined
to belong to someone else, unless it looks suspictious, of course.

				Thanks!
