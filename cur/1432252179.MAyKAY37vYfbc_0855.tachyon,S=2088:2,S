Some critics of the drone strategy still vilify
Mr. Brennan, suggesting that he is the C.I.A.s
agent in the White House, steering Mr. Obama to a
targeted killing strategy. But in office, Mr.
Brennan has surprised many former detractors by
speaking forcefully for closing Guantanamo and respecting civil liberties.

Harold H. Koh, for instance, as dean of Yale Law
School was a leading liberal critic of the Bush
administrations counterterrorism policies. But
since becoming the State Departments top lawyer,
Mr. Koh said, he has found in Mr. Brennan a principled ally.

"If John Brennan is the last guy in the room with
the president, Im comfortable, because Brennan
is a person of genuine moral rectitude," Mr. Koh
said. "Its as though you had a priest with
extremely strong moral values who was suddenly charged with leading a war."
