i suppose an abridged description would be:

i write code to facilitate personal privacy because i feel privacy is
important and worthwhile for many reasons.

i write code for those who want to take responsibility for their own
privacy because governments and businesses will not give them the
tools to do so.

i write code to assist private communication because the ability to
communicate freely is a fundamental and necessary aspect of any social
context.

i write code because it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to build
something useful to myself and others.
