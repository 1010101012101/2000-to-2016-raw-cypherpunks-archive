Having worked on some complex banking and accounting systems before, I know
there is a lot more to the equation than simple coding up some crappy ruby
code and putting fixes in place whenever it doesn't quite do what you want.

Financial cryptography is expensive to do mostly because there is a strong
need to not only implement good code, but also make sure the engineering is
done correctly the first time and that it has the expensive physical
security to back it up.
