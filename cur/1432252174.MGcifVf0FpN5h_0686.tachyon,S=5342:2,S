Dear Friend:

Thank you for contacting my Congressional Office. Due to the tremendous
increase in emails I receive from Americans across the country, I have
closed this account. However, you can continue to email me by visiting my
web site, http://www.house.gov/writerep. Please resend your message there.
This format allows me to receive emails directly from constituents of the
First Congressional District and I will be able to provide you with a
response to any problem or question you may have. 
Again, thank you contacting my office.

Sincerely,
MIKE THOMPSON
Member of Congress
First District of California
