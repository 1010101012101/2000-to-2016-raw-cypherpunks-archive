This is an open letter to the person/s unknown who mailed anthrax letters 
recently.I reckon your a true blue american patriot and I ask you to not 
only keep up the good work but consider going for the real commiesymps in 
power.Such as so called president bush.This nigger loving puke is bringing 
back big govt in a big way.Socialized schooling and federal airport staff! 
Fuck that! This chicken hearted sows belly asked for NATO-euro-one world 
planes to fly over our sacred soil! How can we let this Treason stand? 
No,if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...Kill the president for 
christ and country.
George Bush is a cocaine sniffing, alcoholic, sleazy coward, who doesn't 
have an ounce of integrity or intelligence in his entire body.He clearly 
deserves a horrible death.We are not afraid to entrust the American people 
with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies and competitive 
values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and 
falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.
