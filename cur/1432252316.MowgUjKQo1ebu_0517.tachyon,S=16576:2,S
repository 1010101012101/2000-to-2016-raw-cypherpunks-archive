Anita

I'm not sure how I can personally help.  I'm a bit into IT with the feds =
myself.

The feds may have pulled all of the files on one of our websites.

http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/8327/

Try doing the blitz email to congress.

I think including links
http://orlingrabbe.com/ricono.htm
http://orlingrabbe.com/binladin_timosman.htm
would help identify who michael is and why the feds want to silence him.

good luck!

      Subject: Michael Riconosciuto is in the hole!


      Michael Riconosciuto was pulled from his cell at 5AM this morning =
(Nov 6/01).  He was not able to grab his records.  He has been moved =
from Allenwood to a place he did not want to go.  He is in the hole at =
Springfield, MO.  Michael was revealing details of terrorist networks, =
now communications are severed and he has been taken to a place which is =
very dangerous for him.

                  Michael J. Riconosciuto
                  21309-086    Box 4000
                  U.S. Medical Center
                  Springfield, MO
                  65801-4000

      He is in the hole because he would be attacked by other prisoners =
if he were in the regular facilities.  They will need to move the =
main-threat person into the hole in order to get him time out of the =
hole - this won't do him a lot of good because other prisoners are also =
threats, and he could be beaten & killed.

      Michael was presented to the people at Springfield as someone who =
is mentally ill.  Fortunately, he got someone to call Allenwood to =
verify the cancer problem.

      His new BOP councilors are Mr. Dunn and Mrs. Cunningham.

      CAPT Newton E. Kendig II., M.D., Medical Director and Phillip S. =
Wise, Assistant Director are two men who can make a real difference. =
Please call them and let them know how important it is that Michael be =
given every opportunity to survive this ordeal. The Federal Bureau of =
Prisons Central Office is located at 320 First St., NW., Washington, =
D.C. 20534. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, =
Monday through Friday. Phone 202-307-3055. Fax 202-307-0826.
      Another potential source for assistance would be Congressman =
Petersen's office. Phone: 814-827-3985. Calls to local representatives =
would also help.

      I have spoken with Michael on the phone as recently as Sunday.  He =
told me he has all the information needed to totally expose the =
terrorist networks.  We needed time to unravel them.  Now communications =
with him are cut off.

      How long he can live in the hole when he is already ill, I don't =
know, but it is no way to treat a sick man, and no way to treat a person =
who is attempting to stop a disaster.

      Sincerely,

      Anita Langley
