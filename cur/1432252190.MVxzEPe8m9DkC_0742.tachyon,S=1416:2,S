Conservatives want the adoration of their friends and the fear of  
their enemies;

Liberals want the adoration of both their friends *and* their enemies;

Libertarians want both their "friends" and "enemies" to leave them the  
hell alone;

and Anarcho-Capitalists want shoot *anybody* if they don't.

:-)

Cheers,
RAH
