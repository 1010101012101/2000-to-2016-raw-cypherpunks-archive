Again, I simply don't know and I'm not trying to be an overt JY apologist - I'm just saying sometimes, shit happens.  It would help if he would weigh in instead of having dorks like me positing hypotheticals.

Has anyone stopped to think that perhaps it was on absolute purpose as a warning of lack of safety on his servers due to known 'but unable to speak about’ system compromise? Ie. The same fashion as a warrant canary, or what have you?

JYA’s stance has always seemed to have been: You’re not safe, please do not be deluded into believing any systems, statements, or mathematical systems will always have your back. Perhaps this is just to bring it into the absolute light for those too dense to grasp this mindset.

The above scenario would also explain his general lack of input on the situation — I myself have been expecting miles and miles of (interestingly grotesque almost) prose about the situation.
