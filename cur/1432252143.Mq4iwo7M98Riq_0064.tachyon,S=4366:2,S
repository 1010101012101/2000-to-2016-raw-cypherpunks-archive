Hearing voices
By Bennett Ring
August 30 2002

Text has so far done a good job of communicating our thoughts across the 
Internet, via Web pages, chat rooms, instant messaging and message boards, 
but lacks the immediacy, tone and personal touch of speech. It also 
requires the user to type fluently. That's where VOIP (Voice Over Internet 
Protocol) applications are handy.
VOIP applications, known as voice comms, became popular in the PC online 
gaming world, where they are still used. Playing with (or against) human 
beings is one thing, but being able to scream orders and/or taunts at them 
is better. Team-based games benefit especially; before voice comms, the 
team leader had to bash out instructions on the keyboard. Once voice comms 
are set up it's as simple as hitting the transmit key and speaking.
One of the largest uses for the technology is as a substitute for the 
telephone, especially among those who make lots of interstate and 
international calls. Why spend serious money on an international call when 
you can chat for hours at a cost of a local phone call to your ISP? MORE ON

Wired magazine shelled out for Declans call to me last year,It's so much 
cheaper online,the only thing is the 1 second sattelite gap.It's a bit like 
ham radio,I used it to call my sister in NZ.
