Or maybe its counterpart fossil.

As GK Chesterton said about most nominal Christianity in the world 
in his day  - the original had rotted away leaving a space of the 
same shape and size. Like the impression of a leaf between two 
layers of mud which harden into stone leaving a fossil that has 
something of the shape and pattern of the original but none of its 
content.

Do you really think that politics only exists where there is a 
state?  I'd have thought the opposite is true. Most states 
actively prevent most people participating in politics. And even 
the more benign ones relieve people of the responsibility of doing 
politics - or maybe  the realisation that what they are doing *is* 
politics. Where there is no state everyone is a politician, all 
the time, and all public acts are overtly political.
