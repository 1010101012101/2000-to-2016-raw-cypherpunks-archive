the entire "Legislative Laundry of FBI+CIA+NSA+DIA Collusion" and
their enablers need to die in a fire.  sole focus on NSA a smoke
screen...

my greatest fears are not about what the NSA has intended,
 but what the NSA has built with the best intentions, which in turn
will fall into malicious hands.  history tells us this is but a matter
of time.

as an attacker, i see the capabilities so developed as nothing short
of abhorrent.  they should not exist, they should not be pursued.
they are means that are unethical no matter the end.

 to focus on NSA is to miss the underlying patterns of control at work...

conflating NSA as an institutional entity, NSA tasking, and NSA staff.

NSA tasking is bad and should feel bad.

NSA institutional culture is less bad, yet needs correction.

NSA employees individually? they have been deceived and demoralized themselves!
  this group is the least culpable, in my eyes.

i have friends in IC and i can tell you they feel no less sucker
punched by these revelations.  make no mistake, they've been similarly
mislead by "legal weasel words" and "exceptionally compartmentalized
deceptions", etc.

there are heads at the top that need severing from bodies.
 [wait, they've admitted that is too kind.
   life support in keep-away for centuries!!!!]

see also "compartmentalization".

i have a story to tell here about physical encryption systems in
surveillance satellites.  you think NSA staff even knew what they were
working on? that's the exception, rather than the rule.

your "big data science to optimize in memory representation of sparse
lattices" is just an innocuous cog in a machine cracking weak crypto
to target drones to metadata targets that resulted in the loss of
innocent life in some third world backwater you've never given thought
to.
 [and tomorrow's domestic oppression of opportunity unleashed through
the best intentions. if only we knew back then... if only...]

you think that's an accident?  this is precision engineering!

this means they're the least useful to question.  when does CIA/DIA
scrutiny begin?

NSA used like a tool, just like the sysadmin and cryptographer "tools"
they exploited and used so effectively...
