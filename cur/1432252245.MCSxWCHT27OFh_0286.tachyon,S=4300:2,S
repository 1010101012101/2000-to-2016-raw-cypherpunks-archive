Indeed, even when there are objective measures, all parties
may not agree because they may not agree on those measures.

If Alice Squirrel makes an alarm call and Bob Squirrel sees
a threat, but Charlie Squirrel doesn't see it, Bob and Charlie
will have different stats for Alice's alarm-call reputation.

But rep cap as an idea is surely *stronger* when you keep separate
numbers for different qualities -reliable vs. interesting posts,
for instance.  This is *necessary* since individuals vary greatly
within themselves.  Politicians with excellent reps on issue A
and mediocre reps on issue B, for instance.


Perhaps though authors should mention the *attribute* whose
reputation is estimated when its not obvious.  Similarly authors
should state *who* is doing the estimating when its not clear
its the author.

But what counts as  "good customer service" varies by culture
and person, much like whether WSJ publication helps or hurts.
