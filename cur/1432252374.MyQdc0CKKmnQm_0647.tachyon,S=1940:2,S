Subject: Inferno: Akila Al-Hashimi assassinated

A representative on the US appointed Governing Council in Iraq has died of
wounds from an assassination attempt this past Saturday.  She was one of
three women representatives on the 25-member council.  Strangely enough,
we are only hearing word of this assassination attempt today in the West;
now that she has in fact died it is newsworthy, I suppose?  Or perhaps
just inconcealable.

Riverbend briefly discusses the attempt in her Sunday September 21st blog
entry:
