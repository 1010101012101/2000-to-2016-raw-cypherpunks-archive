One is troubled by this rather excellent post by
anonymous.

I accept at face value the comments made, and they
certainly seem to match the facts and circumstances
of the times (the arisal of Keynsianism from the
roots of the Great Depression).

What troubles me is the pressumption of modern
economics somehow presenting an advantage.  What
would that advantage be?

And if that advantage would somehow ease the pain
of the Great Depression, or not have started it in
the first place, why is it that the IMF (claimed by
some to be a body that dispenses American economic
thought and American loans), advised the Argentinian
government to peg the peso, and gave them lots of
loans to keep it there?

Argentina is now in its 1st Great Depression of this
century, and it's pretty clear that the IMF and the
fixed exchange rate together were responsible as the
external events.

The only way I can reconcile this is to negate the
advantage or benefit conferred by modern economics?

Any other takes?
