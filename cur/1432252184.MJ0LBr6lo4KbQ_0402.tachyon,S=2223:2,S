Aren't the most vocal proponents of right-wing policies the Republican
apparatchiks themselves?  I think "the most vocal proponents of" is
redundant.

The notion of right-wing and left-wing as an axis/dimension is garbage.
I think anyone who votes Republican is right-wing and anyone who votes
Democrat is left-wing.  There is no remotely accurate one-dimensional
political scale, and left-wing or right-wing voting doesn't imply
anything about a person's views on the two-dimensional (personal vs
economic liberty) scale that seems to be "in" these days.
