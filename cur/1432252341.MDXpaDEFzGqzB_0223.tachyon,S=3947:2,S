As Stalin said

: : 	our enemies have guns, why should we let them have 
: : 	ideas?

Of course the SSSCA will not fly, it is already dead in the water,
but something that is a small step towards it will fly, and then
someone will complain that the loopholes in that small step need
to be fixed, and so on and so forth.

The laws will always get worse unless they are massively broken. 
The restrictions on cryptography went away because everyone defied 
them, but anti circumvention and regional encoding seems to have 
succeeded, which is going to result in more of the same.

Same thing with money laundering.  I am glad to see that the 
recent terrorism related crackdown on money laundering has led to 
a massive upsurge in defiance of these new and old restrictions, 
which will doubtless eventually lead to some reasonable easing 
back.
