Yesss!  Its only taken a month or so of plonklessness, and we've
got the geodesics back!

This recently occurred to me.  There is a type of bearer document
which is exactly like cash (anonymous, finder's keepers/spenders)
*except*
that it expires.  Its called a concert ticket.  The liquidators are
called
ticket agencies.  I suppose if I were more cultured this would
have occurred to me sooner.  Apologies if obvious.
