Of course, this is just part of the continuing trend in defining "crimes"
by the subjective fantasies of a party claiming to be aggrieved.

*I'M* afraid, therefore *YOU'RE* stalking.
*I'M* ashamed, therefore *YOU'RE* indecent.
*I'M* poor, therefore *YOU'VE* discriminated.
*I'M* offended, therefore *YOUR* book is pornography.

In legal circles, this bears a strong resemblance to the rightly-named
"Heckler's Veto," in which a crowd deliberately misbehaves in order to
have a speaker they disagree with charged with "incitement."

The ultimate evolution of such nonsense is clearly the current situation
in which Jeff "PussyBoy" Gordon's bad Hattie McDaniel impersonation means
Jim Bell has committed a crime.

Combine this with Judge Jack "Token Negro With Chip on Shoulder" Tanner's
attempts to compensate for his genital inferiority by sentencing people
before they commit crimes, and it is easy to see why Jim Bell can get 10
years and $10,000 for doing, as they would say on "Weakest Link,"
absolutely nothing.

The larger question is what are we going to do about it?  Somehow
"Cypherpunks Write Code" doesn't quite rise to the level of an appropriate
response to these pigfuckers.
