don't know what version of Word these guys are running, but "Track
Changes" works astoundingly often for me on outside mail, to general
hilarity at my law office, not "Properties."  Sorry he's letting the
secret out, in any event:)

Purely as an intellectual exercise, of course, some of us have 
occasionally kicked around MS's potential liability for this
egregious security hole, notwithstanding its "as is, where is,
nowhere, nohow" set of warranties.
