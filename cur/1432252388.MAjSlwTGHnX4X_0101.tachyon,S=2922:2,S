Amusing side note: Spamassassing 2.53 didn't catch this particular

I don't think this is usually the case. Spammers who talk seem to
indicate that they get commissions, not per message fees. In my mind,
this means that lowering delivery is good, but an arms race. For some
spam, driving up costs may be a short term good, but a long term evil -
if the commission is based on inquiries to a mortage refinance broker, 
lots of phony addresses will make for an extremely unprofitable
campaign which they hopefully won't try again, but that also puts 
money in the pocket of a spammer.

Yes. I'm writing up a rant about spam, that I'll send to the list
shortly. But I agree completely.
