Lets see... anything labelled 720 Winners Circle, St. Cloud, Minn is
safe?
What part of "social engineering" don't you understand?

Postal Service Informs of Mailings

                  The Associated Press
                  Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2001; 1:39 p.m. EDT

                  ST. PAUL, Minn.  With fears of anthrax in the mail
running high, postal
                  inspectors in St. Paul have given their colleagues a
heads-up that
                  Publishers Clearinghouse is sending out packages of
powdered detergent.

                  "There's nothing to be alarmed about in that package,"
Inspector Jeanne
                  Graupman said. She added: "Just the timing of it
wasn't very good."

                  The Oxyclean household cleanser is being sent out in
1=-pound packages
                  with the return address 720 Winners Circle, St. Cloud,
Minn.

                  The St. Paul Postal Inspection Service issued an
advisory to inspectors
                  Tuesday. Graupman said she sent the memo after postal
inspectors got a
                  call from a worried customer who had received a leaky
package of the
                  powder.

                  Chris Irving, senior director of consumer affairs for
Publishers
                  Clearinghouse in Port Washington, N.Y., said Oxyclean
is being mailed
                  only to customers who ordered it.

                  Publishers Clearinghouse sells household items in
addition to magazine
                  subscriptions.
