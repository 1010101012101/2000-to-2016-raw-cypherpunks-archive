I was reviewing the files about Jim Bell via John's Web Site noticed one of
the conditions of his probation:

(found at: http://www.parrhesia.com/jimbell/appeal1.txt )

15. The defendant shall not possess or use address or locator computer
database files, such as DMV, voter registration, national phone
directories, real estate records, etc.

I can't readily discern the time frame when his probation started, but it
appears that he is either still on probation, or has
just completed it.

I'm basing this conclusion on another one of his probation conditions:

13. The defendant shall not possess or use a computer or use the Internet
without permission of the Probation Officer.

Did he have permission ?
