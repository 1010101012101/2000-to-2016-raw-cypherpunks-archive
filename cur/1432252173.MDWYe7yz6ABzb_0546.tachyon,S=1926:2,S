IIRC, several states have taken to issuing a "no compentency" driving
licence (ie, the area that says what that licence allows you to
drive/ride, normally occupied by car, motorcycle, truck or whatever, is
blank) purely for use as identification. Few liquor stores (for example) 
accept anything else.
