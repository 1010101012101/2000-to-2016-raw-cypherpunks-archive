Particularly regarding the US, in what places are such prosecutions
or prosecutors permitted?

The quote refers to the States doing the making/enforcing of
abridging, the depriving, and the denying regarding fed law, or
other state's laws as applicable. I believe telecom/nsa immunity
happened only at the federal level, eg: fed wiretap law. (ie: The would
be equal blanket protection of fed law was duly wiped out at the fed
level, leaving suing AT&T in state court under state wiretap law
as your only remaining option.)
