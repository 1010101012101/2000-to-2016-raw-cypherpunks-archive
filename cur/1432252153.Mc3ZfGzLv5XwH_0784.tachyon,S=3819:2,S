	The impression that I get is that in Merry Old England, 
voting is done by county, whereas in this country voting is done by 
district.

	For the benefit of those not familiar with the American system:

	States (obviously) and counties have fixed boundaries, while 
voting districts are redrawn every 10 or so years to attempt to keep 
the population of each district relatively equivalent in population. 
At least that's the theory. What really happens is that since those 
in Power draw the lines, they attempt to draw the boundaries such 
that they maintain or gain power.
