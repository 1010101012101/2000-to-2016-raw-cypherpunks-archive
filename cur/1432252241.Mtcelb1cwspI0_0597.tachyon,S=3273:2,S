I may have started reading the list in 1994. To add something to the
above: Also in the early days, folks were still thinking through the
implications of the technologies, the future was a bit sunnier than it
is nowadays, and there weren't quite as many (this may be just wishful
thinking) loserflamers around. In addition, the FBI and Secret Service
and TIGTA and whatnot hadn't been interrogating and arresting list
members.

Things have changed.
