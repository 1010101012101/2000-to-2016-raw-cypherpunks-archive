    <font size=4><b>THE CASE FOR ANARCHY</b></font><br>
    <b>Cazadero, Winter 1988</b> <p>

    I'm going to give a simple, precise definition of
    anarchy.  Despite historical misunderstanding of the
    term, anarchy is </u><i>a form of social organization in
    which there is no sovereign state</i>.  <p>

    It does not connote social chaos or general lawlessness.
    It does not imply ownership in common.  The crucial,
    defining characteristic of anarchy is the abolition of
    one particular institution -- an allegedly
    &quot;sovereign&quot; government that claims a legal
    right to impose its will upon private citizens.  <p>

    In the United States, we have two layers of sovereign
    government: the Federal Union and the fifty states of
    which it is composed.  By a narrowly-ratified compact
    authored 200 years ago, the Feds claim to possess the
    legal right to make war, regulate commerce, coin money,
    suppress rebellion, impose taxes, make treaties, promote
    the general welfare, and do anything else that may be
    necessary to keep themselves in supreme power, anywhere
    on the planet.  The individual State governments claim
    to possess the legal right to regulate private
    behaviour, charter municipal and private corporations,
    grant marriages and divorces, impose taxes, compel
    attendance in public schools, and whatever else the Feds
    have not yet preempted.  At both levels of this system,
    private citizens are legally granted a relatively narrow
    set of &quot;liberties&quot;, which are not abrogated
    unless it is convenient to do so in order to serve the
    public good.  <p>

    Here we should pause to explain that no one has ever
    attempted to define who &quot;the public&quot; are.  The
    courts are just as confused as everybody else on this
    question.  The public is everyone.  <u>People v
    Ruthven</u>, 288 N.Y.S. 631.  The public is not
    everyone.  <u>Terminal Taxicab v Kutz</u>, 241 U.S. 252.
    It does not mean all the people, or most of the people,
    but so many as contradistinguishes them from a few.
    <u>Mary Pickford v Bayly</u>, 86 P.2d 102.  The public
    is the government.  <u>Oahu R. Co. v Brown</u>, 8 Hawaii
    163.  (The government?!)  <p>

    There is no clear doctrine on what the general welfare
    is either.  In 1937 the U.S. Supreme Court more or less
    stifled further discussion by saying: &quot;The issue is
    a closed one.  It was fought out long ago.  When money
    is spent to promote the general welfare, the concept of
    welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress.&quot;
    <u>Helvering v Davis</u>, 301 U.S. 619.  <p>

    This brings us to the ultimate justification for the
    alleged &quot;sovereignty" of American governments: the
    ballot box.  In 1787, a handful of men proposed a form
    of national government that was intended to solve some
    jurisdictional and political problems among the 13
    original colonies, which had become independent states.
    After a lengthy, hotly-debated struggle for
    ratification, it was approved by slim majorities in nine
    states.  New York and Virginia were among the last to
    ratify because their citizenry were vehemently opposed
    to the plan.  North Carolina and Rhode Island refused to
    ratify until 1790, when it became obvious that their
    economic and political interests would suffer if they
    remained outside the Federal republic.  <p>

    To put things in perspective, please consider that among
    the 3,317,000 people in the newly-organized United
    States of America, less than 20% could vote.  Slightly
    more than half of these voters had consented to the new
    form of government.  A total of 142 electors were chosen
    to represent &quot;the people&quot; during the first
    presidential election.  George Washington was selected
    by 69 of them.  <p>

    One of the great mysteries about democracy is the
    persistent assertion that, somehow, a miniscule
    percentage of votes entitles the sovereign to impose
    regulations over vast numbers of people who did
    <u>not</u> consent to be ruled.  But far more puzzling
    is the belief that 69 votes, cast two hundred years ago,
    somehow obligates 240 million Americans today.  Indeed,
    the claim is often repeated, that our Founding Fathers
    did this, or said that, and thus created a precedent by
    which we are all bound.  <p>

    Baloney.  If three people are engaged in a project, and
    one of them refuses to cut his throat for the benefit of
    the other two, by what conceivable right can the
    &quot;majority&quot; claim that they are entitled to
    murder the dissenter?  <p>

    Here, then, is the theoretical starting point for
    anarchy.  If anyone or anything is
    &quot;sovereign&quot;, it is each individual man, woman,
    and child, who is presumed to be endowed by nature with
    an equal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
    happiness.  Significantly, these principles, although
    prominently featured in the Declaration of Independence,
    somehow never found their way into the
    U.S. Constitution.  Human rights were all well and good
    when there was an external tyrant, but when the Founding
    Fathers turned their attention to establishing their own
    brand of sovereignty, it was no longer expedient to
    speak in terms of natural justice.  <p>

    Historically, anarchy is the newest kid on the political
    block.  Democracy, monarchy, theocracy, and communism
    have ancient roots which extend back to ancient
    civilizations.  Anarchy, like laissez-faire capitalism,
    is a child of the Industrial Revolution -- and, indeed,
    they have a great deal in common.  Laissez-faire
    capitalism means &quot;hands-off&quot; in terms of
    economic life.  Anarchy means &quot;hands-off&quot; in
    legal and political life.  <p>

    It is therefore especially embarassing to note that 19th
    century anarchists hated the institution of private
    property and aligned themselves with French and Russian
    communists, in an effort to abolish private property
    rights.  Classical anarchists rather stupidly believed
    that property was created and maintained by the state.
    Karl Marx theorized that the state would &quot;wither
    away&quot; under communist rule, so it is not surprising
    to that a rather confused sect of early anarchists were
    prepared to accept a temporary dictatorship of the
    proletariat as a way-station on the road to absolute
    freedom.  After all, &quot;absolute freedom&quot; is a
    confused idea -- about which I will have more to say
    later on.  <p>

    The endorsement of bloodshed and temporary tyranny was a
    miscalculation of enormous dimensions, for the
    communists and anarchists alike.  One does not promote
    liberty by abolishing it.  To suggest that anarchy can
    be achieved by coercion, is akin to saying that
    nutrition can be derived from poisons.  <p>

    Perhaps it is well to emphasize that anarchy, in the way
    I have defined it, is <i>a form of social
    organization</i> sans government.  Modern critics, as
    well as some 19th-century anarchists, solemnly decree
    that we cannot have one without the other -- that any
    hope of law and order (including property rights)
    depends upon the existence of a sovereign state.  Ayn
    Rand, a proponent of laissez-faire capitalism, for
    example, insisted that government was a natural and
    necessary arbiter among otherwise free men.  Robert
    Nozick, in <i>Anarchy, State &amp; Utopia</i>, argued
    that territorial sovereignty is essential to public
    order.  Between them lies the substance of so-called
    &quot;libertarian&quot; thought in contemporary America,
    which rejects anarchy in favor of a Jeffersonian ideal:
    The best government is that which governs least.  <p>

    The brief reply to such criticisms is to suppose a
    Robinson Crusoe island on which Friday has been granted
    a bed in which to sleep.  It is in Crusoe's interest to
    concede this particular division of property, and Friday
    is content with the arrangement.  No need of
    arbitration, or weighted ballots, or written
    constitutions.  Just two men who are competent to assess
    their social interests.  <p>

    Whether the political laboratory is inhabited by 2 men
    or 240 million, the central feature of their social
    intercourse remains singularly distinct, and I have come
    to think of it as custom that will someday become formal
    jurisprudence on the subject -- i.e., <i>de facto
    anarchy</i>.  To the extent that the state does not or
    cannot impose its will, you have de facto anarchy,
    whether you like it or not.  <p>

    Take democracy, for example.  If the sovereign cannot
    dictate how people will vote (or think, or speak), it is
    highly artificial to say that government is truly
    sovereign.  Who knows? -- they might be booted out come
    November.  In a monarchy, the reigning prince must be
    careful not to do anything that will undermine the
    confidence and loyalty of his subjects, as Machiavelli
    shrewdly observed.  The United States Supreme Court has
    seldom attempted to rule against public opinion -- and,
    during their brief period of stubborn opposition to
    Roosevelt's New Deal, they were doomed to recant.  It is
    a maxim of the common law that &quot;we imbibe it at
    every pore&quot;, and judges wisely limit themselves to
    an accomodation of whatever the local sentiments happen
    to be.  <p>

    Majority rule is a similarly hollow pretense.  We drank
    during Prohibition.  Kids are still buying narcotics
    after 50 years of fierce interdiction.  And, although
    the vast majority of Americans are dead-set against
    slavery, murder, and racial discrimination, no law can
    prevent these three evils from sprouting like stubborn,
    perennial weeds in our midst.  <p>

    Slavery? -- of course.  Women are <i>de facto</i>
    domestic servants to autocratic husbands.  Children
    scream in helpless anguish, as they are marched off to
    churches, schools, woodsheds and family gatherings,
    against their will.  Employees are enslaved by their
    hometown employers or by a majority of their unionized
    co-workers.  The list is endless -- and it is vain to
    say that government should have (or could have)
    abolished the practice by law.  Ask any lawyer about the
    legal status of children, or what happens when a citizen
    defies the will of his neighbours.  Every prisoner is a
    slave; every draft-dodger; every licensed business
    owner.  <p>

    Murders, of course, are impossible to prohibit or to
    deter -- not even by threats of ghastly retribution.  If
    we suppose that a miniscule 1/10th of one percent of the
    general populace might commit homicide, how many
    policemen, psychologists, prison guards and judges would
    it take to eradicate this gruesome anarchy?  1/10th of
    one percent of the U.S. population is still 240,000
    potential murderers.  What shall we do? -- kill them
    before they can kill someone else?  Lock them up in
    preventive detention for the rest of their lives?
    Eradicate every conceivable weapon in America (knives,
    bludgeons, screwdrivers)?  What about prospective
    abortions?  What about potential suicides?  Drunk
    drivers?  Daredevil youths?  <p>

    Far worse, as a fiction of sovereignty and a very
    hurtful social ill, is the matter of racial
    discrimination.  Why can't Jesse Jackson (or any other
    black man) be elected president?  Why is it so hard to
    get a job in Hollywood if you're not Jewish?  How many
    law-enforcers will it take to prevent businessmen from
    hiring and promoting members of their own families, or
    members of their church, social group, college class,
    political party, ethnic background, sex -- you name it.
    <p>

    <i>The &quot;sovereign state&quot; is an illusion.</i>
    <p>

    Have we eradicated poverty? -- No.  We doubled the
    number of people who are malnourished.  <p>

    Has our legal system settled disputes? -- No.  We became
    the most litigious society on earth.  <p>

    Did we achieve the central goal of the Founding Fathers?
    -- No</u>.  The Constitution's famous compromise plunged
    us into the Civil War, at a cost of nearly a million
    lives and five times the G.N.P. in 1860.  Instead of
    reducing the need for a standing peacetime army, the
    United States spawned a vast military-industrial complex
    unmatched by any other nation in history.  <p>

    How ridiculous! -- after exerting every talon and claw,
    the Federal Government is reduced to pitifully begging
    that we should "Just say No" to drugs.  Yes, it might
    work, if enough individual men, women and children
    decide to agree with that suggestion -- but let's not
    kid ourselves about who's ruling who.  <p>

    Individual conscience (and cowardice) create the bulk of
    tax dollars -- not the coercive machinery of our
    Internal Revenue Service.  What could they possibly do
    if more than a few obscure tax-resisters decided not to
    file?  What if 10% refused to file?  20%?  50%?</u> <p>

    You know, we learned a wonderful lesson in Vietnam.  You
    can't conquer people with napalm and bribery -- you have
    to win their hearts and minds.  All the U.S. support
    that was poured into Iran, the Phillipines and Lebanon
    went for naught, because coercion only works on the
    willing.  The moment any "sovereign" state attempts to
    physically force someone to change his mind, another
    anarchist is born.  Call him what you will -- tax cheat,
    rebel, freedom fighter -- it's a vote for liberty.  <p>

    This stubborn, voluntary aspect of the human mind is a
    subject well worth exploring.  Ayn Rand covered it so
    well that we need not continue beyond the conclusion she
    reached.  Any man can be free if he chooses to be.  <p>

    Based on rather cruel personal experience, I know this
    to be true.  As an inmate of a maximum-security Federal
    penitentiary for a short time, and being rather small in
    stature, believe me, there were many occasions on which
    my freedom, dignity, and consent were put at risk of
    extinction.  But there is a sage expression one hears in
    jail: &quot;Everybody has to sleep sometime</u>&quot; --
    which means that no tyrant, no rapist, no gang leader is
    immune from reprisal.  <p>

    Tyrants live short, frantic lives.  Their evil is not
    likely to be tolerated, even by the weakest and mildest
    of pacifists.  When Ghandi conquered the British, he
    taught the world that passive opposition works just as
    well as active warfare in certain situations.  When
    Martin Luther King adopted his strategy, America was
    shamed -- not coerced -- into reform.  And when Federal
    officials ordered forced bussing to achieve racial
    integration of public schools, those who refused simply
    moved to an all-white district.  <p>

    This is what I mean by <i>de facto</i> anarchy.  No
    matter how many votes are on one side or another, you
    might as well forget about enforcing a majority opinion,
    unless the majority is so overwhelming as to utterly
    crush a few stray nay-sayers.  But be sure that those
    dissenters are crushed, or you might find someone
    slipping a bomb under the Fuhrer's conference table.
    <p>

    It is so tempting to point to the world's dictatorships
    as evidence of the potential evil in any coercive state,
    that I shall not do so.  Instead, I will say that Hitler
    was incapable of ruling a majority of Germans without
    their consent.  The Nazis seized power at a time of
    social malaise; they scapegoated a small but visible
    minority; every effort was made to spy upon and control
    individual liberty.  "We are now at the end of the Age
    of Reason,&quot; Hitler gleefully confided to
    Rauschning. "At a mass meeting, thought is eliminated.
    And because this is the state of mind I require, because
    it secures to me the best sounding board for my
    speeches, I order everyone to attend the meetings, where
    they become part of the mass whether they like it or
    not!"  In the cafes and streets of Berlin a new type of
    behaviour swept the populace, known as <i>der Deutsche
    Blick</i> ("the German Look"), which consisted of
    surreptitiously glancing around to see who was within
    earshot, before uttering even the most innocent and
    trivial remarks, because they might be misunderstood and
    reported to the authorities as evidence of treason.  If
    you are thinking that this could not happen in America,
    you have not studied the history of the 1st Amendment,
    the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, or the McCarthy
    witch-hunts of the 1950s.  <p>

    The Nazis executed thousands upon millions -- Jews,
    communists, Poles, Dutch, French, German dissidents,
    hospital patients, scientists, parents and grandparents
    who had let slip a word of criticism that was overheard
    by a member of the Hitler Youth.  Here, if anywhere in
    the world, at any time in history, was a society gone
    mad with "sovereignty".  Millions could do nothing but
    obey, obey, obey -- or face the firing squad.  <p>

    Yet the Nazis could neither decree nor deter a single
    friendship, romance, or hatred.  Parents still loved
    their infant children.  Lovers did not cease to pine for
    their sweethearts.  Ideas could not be physically ripped
    from the minds of thinkers and ordinary laborers.  De
    facto anarchy ebbed to its lowest possible level, but it
    did not cease to function.  <p>

    Nor shall it ever -- not even in the midst of labor
    camps and hopelessly dark inner-city ghettos.  Every
    time an infant is born into this world, society must
    reckon that there is 50/50 chance that this new citizen
    is an anarchist at heart.  Every effort will be made to
    inculcate the newcomer with an imprint of social and
    civic duty, a constant stream of religious and moral
    imperatives, a steady bombardment of information and
    experience -- all of it aimed at baffling, bribing, and
    silencing the child's latent tendancy to think or speak
    the magic word of independence: &quot;No</u>!&quot; <p>

    When the prototype 19th-century anarchists spoke of
    &quot;absolute freedom&quot; and mankind's fitness to
    live in perfect harmony, they totally missed the boat --
    for one word is the key to human freedom:
    &quot;No</u>!&quot; When John Stuart Mill justified free
    speech by declaring that it served social utility, he
    was deaf to the very principle he was trying to defend
    -- the right to <i>defy</i> society, to reject the
    greatest good of the greatest number, to pronounce the
    word of social treason and of individual liberty:
    &quot;No</u>!&quot; <p>

    What is it that the Catholic Church fears most? -- the
    word &quot;No!&quot;</u> What is it that the Communist
    Party drives underground, in desparate revulsion of
    anything or anyone that would upset their precious
    bureaucracy? -- the word &quot;No</u>!&quot; <p>

    In a free society, the essence of freedom is to disagree
    with your neighbour.  To the extent that you can say
    &quot;no&quot; and remain free of legal compulsion, the
    society in which you live permits a degree of <i>de
    jure</i> anarchy.  And if a majority of your neighbours
    are legally permitted to vote away that liberty, their
    intention is to extinguish the one and only
    &quot;absolute freedom&quot; with which you were born --
    the freedom to think for yourself and to act in
    accordance with the product of self-propelled ingenuity,
    knowledge and values.  <p>

    In any society, at any moment in history, free men swim
    against the tide of custom and circumstance.  To devise
    a social system based on this freedom is the proper goal
    of anarchist theory.  <p>

    On January 9, 1975, a Federal trial judge scratched his
    head and searched his mind for a theory that would
    explain what he was about to do.  Before him stood a
    mild-mannered, reasonable young man named Perry
    Paegelow, who had to be sent to prison, even though it
    was highly doubtful that he had willingly broken the law
    -- or, if he had, whether anyone suffered on account of
    it.  Perry Paegelow had driven me to the spot where
    Federal agents arrested me for possessing a paper bag
    full of marijuana.  Here's what the judge said to Perry
    when he sentenced him: <p>

    THE COURT: I don't know that marijuana is good or bad
    for people.  All I know is that the authorities,
    Congress, our society, rightly or wrongly, has decided
    it is bad for people.  They can be wrong.  <p>

    THE DEFENDANT: I believe they are, sir.  <p>

    THE COURT: But no one seems to know the answer to these
    things, and so we are in the position of trying to
    enforce these drug laws, I mean society.  Now whether
    that is just or not depends on your point of view.  I
    respect your view, but I don't think it is the law of
    the land, and as long as you take the position that you
    are going to continue to traffic in these drugs, you
    don't give me any choice except to send you to jail.
    <p>

    THE DEFENDANT: I didn't say I was continuing.  <p>

    THE COURT: You think the law is nonsensical and you are
    not going to pay any attention to it, and so, therefore,
    certainly the impression I gather is that -- it is --
    you don't see any reason to -- <p>

    THE DEFENDANT: Perhaps nonsensical is the wrong word.  I
    think it's is blatantly fascist.  <p>

    Perry was sentenced to serve two years in prison, for
    driving a car.  I served three years for carrying a
    paper bag.  But the trial judge put his finger in the
    core-issue of social organization.  If an offender
    doesn't plead contrition and remorse, how can you show
    any mercy?  <p>

    Don't laugh.  This is an important issue in our criminal
    justice system.  If it weren't for the informant who
    fingered Perry and myself, it would have been impossible
    to bring us to &quot;justice.&quot; Informants, stool
    pidgeons, snitiches and turncoats put more drug users
    behind bars than the undercover and uniformed policemen
    combined.  And, if it weren't for plea bargains and
    sobbing confessions of regret, our prisons would be as
    commonplace as grocery stores, one or two in every
    neighborhood.  <p>

    What can you do with people who refuse to recognize the
    supremacy of the state?  Do we dare to teach our
    children the &quot;right of revolution&quot; contained
    in the Declaration of Independence?  <p>

    No.  We blind them and stuff their ears, with the logic
    of <i>Mugler v Kansas</i>, 123 U.S. 623: <p>

    <i>But by whom, or by what authority, is it to be
    determined whether (something) will injuriously affect
    the public?  Power to determine such questions, so as to
    bind all, must exist somewhere; else society will be at
    the mercy of a few, who, regarding their own appetites,
    may be willing to imperil the peace and security of the
    many.</i> <p>

    It doesn't matter whether the subject-matter of our
    discussion is narcotics, or anti-trust law, or an
    obstreperous neighbour who might pollute your garden
    with crankcase oil.  The central issue is the
    &quot;power to determine such questions, so as to bind
    all.&quot; In <i>Mugler</i>, the Supreme Court surprised
    no one by deciding that the power to bind all was lodged
    in the legislative branch -- the elected representatives
    of the will of the people.  Unfortunately, this is also
    the formula for unlimited folly and persecution.
    Socrates and John Locke come to mind, as dissenters who
    were hunted down as heretics.  But worse, perhaps, is
    the routine business of thwarting large minorites.  Abe
    Lincoln was put into power by 39% of the popular vote,
    for example.  No wonder we had a Civil War, with 61% of
    the electorate denied their &quot;will.&quot; <p>

    Coincidentally, I spent about a year in Allenwood
    F.P.C. with Gordon Liddy -- now there's</u> a fellow who
    knows about &quot;will,&quot; if anybody does.
    Unfortunately, our willfulness can't do much to alter
    the fact that the earth orbits the sun, instead of
    vice-versa.  Nor is one's desire, self-interest,
    prejudice or imagination a good set of criteria for
    justice.  I doubt that anyone would want to see Gordon
    elected to high office.  He used to sing
    &quot;Deutscheland Uber Alles&quot; in the shower and
    loved the Nixon White House.  <p>

    In a sense, this last observation perversely justifies
    the American democracy.  By and large, we do a pretty
    good job of electing people who more or less exhibit the
    basic values on which there is a broad consensus.  As a
    culture, American society is tolerant, sensitive to
    minority rights, quite wonderful when it comes to
    even-handed treatment of our neighbours.  But it is not
    perfect.  <p>

    The case for anarchy turns on whether no</u> government
    is better than good</u> government, right?  <p>

    Not necessarily.  <p>

    When Franklin Roosevelt abolished private possession of
    gold, his attempt to control economic supply and demand
    remained maddeningly elusive.  Banks refused to make
    loans, commercial failures increased, the stock market
    took another nose-dive, and government policy-makers had
    no choice but to conclude that deficit spending and
    &quot;pump-priming&quot; might become a permanent
    feature of the American economy (which we have yet to
    wean ourselves from, some 50 years later).  Clearly the
    best government on earth was incompetent to rule the
    markets.  The Soviets, too, find it difficult to command
    the economic performance of their enslaved masses -- so
    that we are forced to surmise that oppressive regimes
    are no better equipped to &quot;will&quot; prosperity.
    Freer societies create more wealth, more opportunity,
    more competition and greater diversity.  The
    19th-century laissez-faire economy outperformed our
    20th-century welfare state in every measurable respect
    (annual growth, consumer price trends, wage gains).  But
    these are topics best left to Alan Greenspan.  For our
    present purposes, we can quit the field of economics by
    recalling one of Dr. Greenspan's most memorable remarks,
    paraphrasing Gresham's Law -- that &quot;Bad protection
    drives out good.&quot; <p>

    What he meant was that any attempt to replace market
    chaos with government controls was doomed to fail in two
    respects: (1) The state's mechanism of control would be
    worse than &quot;invisible-hand&quot; outcomes; and (2)
    It would have a secondary and unintended consequence of
    driving other market mechanisms into disarray.  <p>

    The reason I do not wish to pursue this classical
    defense of economic anarchy is simple -- it is a
    utilitarian justification, which free enterprise
    advocates have droned, shouted and whimpered to the
    American people for the better part of a century,
    without success.  Ayn Rand correctly identified the
    locus of failure, namely, the tension between <i>de
    facto</i> capitalism and Christian ethics, which
    constantly crippled advocates of economic freedom.  Her
    entire career was devoted to the job of propagating a
    morality of selfishness, to give capitalism a spiritual
    leg to stand on.  <p>

    Apart from the questions of utility or effective public
    policy, it remains that anarchy is superior to the best
    possible sovereign in one respect: it is more logical.
    <p>

    I do not say that anarchy will better serve &quot;the
    greatest good of the greatest number&quot; -- in part
    because those claims are impossible to measure or test.
    I do not claim that any of our existing institutions
    (except the pretense of sovereignty) will be radically
    altered in an anarchistic society.  People will probably
    form themselves into local, regional and national
    associations, I suppose.  <p>

    Only one aspect of life must rotate, in order to achieve
    constitutional anarchy: our legal system.  <p>

    If, instead of the United States of America, we were
    served by USA Inc. -- a private organization with the
    same constitutional officers, agencies and
    &quot;stakeholders&quot; -- it is possible that a
    squadron of ships could be dispatched to the Persian
    Gulf, a prosecution could be leveled against drug
    dealers, an offender might be tried and punished; but
    they could not</u> <i>pretend</i> to represent the will
    of every man, woman and child in America.  Without such
    a claim, their power would be revealed exactly for what
    it is -- <i>de facto supremacy</i>.  <p>

    No &quot;divine right&quot; holds Microsoft in their
    dominant market positon.  Yet, it is inconceivable that
    any other organization might dislodge them from their
    leadership in the computer business.  <p>

    Surely, the great lesson of the American Revolution is
    that our forebears were loathe to snip the bond of
    allegiance which bound them to George III and
    Parliament, even though these guys were an ocean away
    and ill-prepared to compel obedience by the American
    colonies.  Whether, as a matter of law and justice, the
    dominant civic institution is viewed as the
    &quot;sovereign&quot; or merely the strongest alliance
    of free citizens, the utility of its traditional role in
    society will keep it afloat longer than any screwy
    theory of democratic or divinely-ordained social
    compacts.  Neither Hobbes nor Rousseau, Locke, Hegel,
    Kant, Oliver Wendell Holmes, or Jerry Falwell has
    produced a convincing explanation of how I can be
    obligated to a contract I did not sign.  It is stupid
    and vain to say that one man's consent binds another --
    or binds a generation yet to be born.  <p>

    Since the courts are creatures of government, is it
    silly to propose that &quot;sovereignty&quot; be somehow
    wiped clean from our law books?  <p>

    Not necessarily.  <p>

    Without reciting the complete history of American legal
    philosophy, it is highly significant that logic has been
    &quot;wiped clean&quot; from legal reasoning: <p>

    <i>We are bound to remark that logic as an instrument of
    legal reasoning has grown unpopular of late.  Any
    attempt to rehabilitate it is therefore unlikely to be
    received with a great deal of sympathy.  The chief
    objection to logic in the law is usually expressed in
    the form that logical thought processes are rigid and
    inflexible, whereas legal reasoning is empirical and
    discretionary.  This general distrust of logic is
    supported by three specific arguments: that decisions
    cannot be arrived at simply by deduction from existing
    legal principles, that legal rules are too fluid and
    uncertain to support logical inferences which could be
    drawn from them, and that the whole conception of law as
    a single, unitary, logically consistent system is at
    least an impractical ideal, if not an illusionary
    fetish.</i> (Oxford Essays on Jurisprudence) <p>

    Law students enter and leave law school without learning
    a lot about justice -- they learn the tricks of a highly
    dubious craft: casuistry peppered with theatrical
    displays of imagined grievance.  If such a course
    existed, our next generation of lawyers would be shocked
    to learn the truth about what was lost in the stampede
    toward &quot;positive law&quot; (i.e., the will of the
    sovereign).  <p>

    <i>17th-century theory had taken two directions. On the
    one hand it conceived of rights as the outgrowth of a
    social contract.  It held that there would be none
    without the social organization and that there would be
    no justice or law without the political organization,
    that is, the state...  <p>

    On the other hand, there was the Grotian idea of rights
    as qualities inhering in persons.  This theory put
    rights above the state and justice above the state as
    permanent, absolute realities which the state was
    organized to protect.  There was a state because there
    were rights and justice to protect and secure.  In the
    18th century the latter idea definitely prevailed...
    <p>

    18th century juristic thought, down to Kant, holds four
    propositions: (1) There are natural rights demonstrable
    by reason.  These rights are eternal and absolute.  They
    are valid for all men in all times and in all places.
    (2) Natural law is a body or rules, ascertainable by
    reason, which perfectly secures all of these natural
    rights.  (3) The state exists only to secure men in
    these natural rights.  (4) Positive law is the means by
    which the state performs this function, and it is
    obligatory only so far as it conforms to natural law.
    The appeal is to individual reason.  Hence every
    individual is the judge of this conformity...  <p>

    Pushed to its limits, this leads straight to
    anarchy.</i> (Pound, 27 Harv. L. Rev., 616) <p>

    Pushed to its limits, it leads straight to the
    Declaration of Independence -- the fundamental charter
    of freedom which no longer speaks for the American
    people.  <p>

    In a brief essay it is impossible to raise and analyse
    all the implications of an anarchist society.  The
    questions, the paradigms, and the practical answers
    exist -- but the space does not.  Fortunately, I can
    conclude this discussion by returning to a topic I
    promised to revisit when it was mentioned earlier -- the
    problem of war and peace.  <p>

    It's clear that every one of us has the right to life,
    liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that --
    whatever else the state has endeavoured to do on our
    behalf -- the purpose of national defense ranked first
    and foremost in the minds of the Founding Fathers.  <p>

    Removing the concept of &quot;sovereignty&quot; will not
    impede the legal right of the United States, as an
    association of free citizens, to make war or conclude
    peace.  It may or may not complicate the business of
    taxation -- with the likely result that our armed forces
    could not be deployed throughout the world, for the
    unearned benefit of other nations -- but I doubt that we
    would go wanting of strategic or tactical preparedness.
    Too many citizens and too many corporations have too
    much to lose by abandoning their agency of
    self-preservation.  <p>

    But consider how much suffering and turmoil could have
    been avoided, had the United States not proclaimed
    itself the self-appointed arbiter of democracy.  <p>

    No Civil War.  <p>

    No grasping imperialism under Teddy Roosevelt.  <p>

    No punitive Versailles Treaty to goad the Germans.  <p>

    No global depression, prolonged by Federal manipulation
    of money and credit.  <p>

    No hysterical division of the globe in the Cold War,
    forcing the Russians to arm themselves in parity with an
    adversary whom they had no hope of matching.  <p>

    No &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot; aimed at pushing the
    Third World into copy-cat democracies they were
    ill-prepared to manage.  <p>

    No Vietnam.  <p>

    No half-hearted, wimpy indecision in Nicaragua, trading
    arms for hostages in Iran.  <p>

    Our self-preservation is always a difficult factor to
    weigh.  But history emphatically links social philosophy
    with foreign policy.  It's about time we learned to
    practice the virtue of self-determination, both at home
    and abroad.  <p>

    Stripping away the flag-waving illusion of
    &quot;sovereign state&quot; is an excellent way to
    begin.  The U.S. Government is a power to be reckoned
    with, of course.  But it is only a number of men, with
    no greater or lesser right to compel a social outcome
    than a single infant child of any race, color or creed.
    <p>

    If it is true, in a de facto sense, that &quot;might
    makes right,&quot; it is equally true that civilization
    depends on the slow, steady growth of the rule of law.
    Blood-feuds and reprisals are too costly to persist.  We
    need to settle our disputes by recourse to impartial
    tribunals.  <p>

    And to be impartial, a court must have a basic principle
    upon which all men can agree.  I say it is this: All men
    are created equal.</u> <p>

    Our voluntary, consensual intercourse has never been a
    problem, and never will.  Mankind's agony lies in bloody
    conflicts between people who cannot agree.  You can pick
    up a club and threaten to bash my head in.  You can join
    a gang, bent on taking my land and bread.  You can issue
    an edict signed by 10,000 Hottentots or 10 million Jews.
    But nothing you can do or say will make it right to
    force someone to accede to a &quot;social contract&quot;
    which provides that his consent is unnecessary and
    irrelevant to an outcome that your gang intends to
    enforce.  <p>

    Murder, by any other name, is still a crime.  <p>

    Slavery is still slavery -- even when it is openly
    practiced by a &quot;sovereign&quot; in the name of the
    &quot;public good.&quot; <p>

    <i>Complaints are everywhere heard from our most
    considerate and virtuous citizens ... that the public
    good is disregarded in the conflict of rival parties;
    and that measures are too often decided, not according
    to the rules of justice, and the rights of the minor
    party, but by the superior force of an interested and
    overbearing majority.</i> (Madison, The Federalist) <p>

    Amen, brother, and pass me another round of intellectual
    ammunition.  It's going to be a long war of attrition in
    the struggle for human rights.  <p>
