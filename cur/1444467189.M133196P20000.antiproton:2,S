Still michael best you could have consulted the list here

That someone calls you a liar therefor you act is an ego based mindset

Answer why you decided to not consult this list that has profoundly smart
beings on it

You could have asked this list for help we are interested in helping with
such matters i would say and you could have done so without revealing info
... did this never cross your mind ?

If it never even crossed your mind to consult us i find there is something
terribly wrong
