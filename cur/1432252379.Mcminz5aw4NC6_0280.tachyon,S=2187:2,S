... but i would contend that the infrastructure costs associated with a 
billion or two spams per day are significantly higher than the costs that 
are currently being incurred by the spammers .... in effect the industry as 
a whole is underwriting a significant percentage of the actual costs, which 
makes spamming such an attractive economic activity. one of the issues is 
to reflect the fully loaded costs of a billion or two spams per day back to 
the spammers.
