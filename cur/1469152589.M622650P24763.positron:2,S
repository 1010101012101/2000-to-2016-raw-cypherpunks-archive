People renting out entire houses as investments on Airbnb are just a
reflection of the fact that the hotel business is a racket. Don't blame
Airbnb; they're just the messenger. Likewise Uber and taxis. Both
organizations take power away from the rent-seekers and by proxy the
government. Yes they are still centralized and self-interested, but the
real bad guys here are the corrupt city and state governments that are in
bed with the hoteliers and taxi companies. Get rid of the special
privileges (regulatory barriers etc) and Uber and Airbnb's profit margins
would be much lower.
