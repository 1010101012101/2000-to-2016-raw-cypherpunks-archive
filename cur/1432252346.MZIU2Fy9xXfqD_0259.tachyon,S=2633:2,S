Well, according to The News, reporting on the shutting down
of some Russian sites for KP: the U.S. government estimates
there are 100,000 WWW sites that are involved or related to KP.

Are you sure you can't find any?

----

Try "child pornography" (with the double quotes) at Google.

You'll see all sorts of sites for reporting KP.

Copy one or more of them, such as www.missingkids.com, into
your own new "reporting" site. You'll get direct tips as
to where KP is.

And, of course, there's Usenet.
