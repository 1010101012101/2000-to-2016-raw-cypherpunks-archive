I forgot - did someone say they keep cash & extra phone in a safe deposit 
box (pre paid or contract?  Contract phone is no use in a police crack 
down)?
If a deposit box, judge could freeze that too, so better hide it in  
someone else's house.  And what are they gonna say about that?  "I need to 
hide a phone, money, gun, etc. in your basement."
Even though I might think some of it's vaguely similar to preparing for a 
hurricane, most of my family would have me committed.

Though I empathize w/ him (read below), if William hasn't been charged w/ 
ANY thing, there's not much need for a full legal team - just yet.  Sure, 
he's sweating bullets - innocent or not.  But that doesn't translate into 
spending huge $ right now.  An attorney can't do anything (if he's truly 
innocent) unless there are at least some charges to start thinking about a 
defense; they arrest him, etc.

Unless William's goal is to get his equip back quickly.  A lawyer could  
file motions, but probably wouldn't do much good - at least for now.  It  
does appear that one in his situation would be building a defense fund  
before there is anything to defend against.  Now, if he could promise to  
pay everyone back, proportionally, for what wasn't used for defense... but 
how could one do that?  How would we make them, if they decided not to?

What if the defense fund is needed because he actually did something  
illegal (not necessarily porn)?  I agree, that in these VERY beginning  
stages, a guy w/ the credentials he's presented, should have the means to 
pay an attorney for an hr or 2, to tell him what to do / not to do, until 
such time that he's arrested, charges are filed, etc., (if ever).  Right 
now, that's all  he needs.

*How do I know?*  Cause I was put in a similar situation - of the  
*possibility* I might have to defend myself against false charges -  
unrelated to issues in this case.  I got basic advice on what to do / not 
do for now; have cash for bail bond, in unlikely event I was arrested.  
(Believe me, they could've arrested me & asked questions later).  Then, 
nothing to do but wait... and wait.  Nerve racking.  Lost bunch of weight 
when needed to gain some.  But, didn't need bunch of money.

I didn't have equipment or belongings seized, but police never "told" me  
anything later on, like, "We're not filing charges;" "the DA isn't  
referring this to a Grand Jury."  Nothing, nada.  No, "Sorry we came to  
your house w/ no justification & threatened you."  No arresting the other 
person that made false accusations, even though there were witnesses.  Even 
then, I only needed a lawyer to advise me of basic rights, of prudent 
behavior till something did / did not develop, etc.  No giant defense fund 
needed.  The whole thing just... disappeared.
How much is 10,000 EU anyway - $100 USD?

There's a reason I'd never run a Tor exit or probably relay.  I'd like to.  
If raided, I could never take the stress.  Too old now, w/ chronic health 
issues.  Plus I wouldn't want to spend my retirement savings hiring 
lawyers, if things got really ugly.

And people call me paranoid...
I should get started on my dooms day supplies & cash.  I don't know where 
to keep it.  We live in hurricane territory & you have to prepare way in 
advance of knowing whether the storm will hit nearby, or it's too late.
