Like you can't cut & paste the URL?

Let's see how long this takes

http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/2/700?maxtoshow=&HITS=150&hits=150&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=thermophilic+fingi&searchid=975498174408_10577&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=&journalcode=aem

Yep, 6 keystrokes to switch to the currently open web page, tab to the
top, cut the URL, jump back to here & paste it. Didn't even have to use
the mouse. And I'm only using Windoze.

(No, the URL  there isn't relevant to this thread, it just happened to
be on my Netscape at the time)
