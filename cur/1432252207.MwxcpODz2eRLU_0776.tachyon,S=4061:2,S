I mean Bill Ayers, Ghandi, Thoreau. We have to obey their laws, but they 
do not have to obey their own laws.

Bill Ayers bombs the Pentagon, comes up smelling of roses.  You bomb the 
Pentagon, you will not.

Just look at the smirk on Schwartz's face.  Obviously he never expected 
to be punished.  He committed suicide not because a year in a country 
club prison was terribly harsh punishment, but because it was revealed 
he was not above the law after all.

If anyone in the world was prepared to suffer for his beliefs, that 
person was not Aaron Schwartz.

Accessing someone else's computers without permission to obtain the 
information therein is trespass.  The powerful trespass against the less 
powerful.  He had mistaken ideas about how powerful he was.
