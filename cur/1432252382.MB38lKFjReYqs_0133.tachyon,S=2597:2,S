Sigh.  It probably doesn't even cost them anything -
it's just another user interface menu item.
(I suppose that's not strictly true - if I were trying to build
a GPS Big Brother feature into cellphones for minimum cost,
I guess I'd probably look at having the phone just take
satellite readings and forward them to a central site for calculations,
to avoid having to put any extra computing support into the machine.
Don't know if that's a win or loss cost-wise.)

I've already got a GPS, but I seldom carry it around
unless I'm camping - it's old, so it's too clunky.
