Included below is the ASCII CFP for our upcoming PKI research
workshop.  We're especially soliciting papers on ways to use public
key authentication/authorization that solve real problems, rather
than merely follow the traditional marketing patter about PKI.

======================================================================
===

1st Annual PKI Research Workshop
April 24-25, 2002. NIST, Gaithersburg MD, USA.
www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~pki02/

Sponsors include NIST, NIH, and Internet2.


To a large extent, the hoped-for public key infrastructure (PKI) has
not "happened yet."  PKI for large, eclectic populations has not
materialized; PKI for smaller, less diverse "enterprise" populations
is beginning to emerge, but at a slower rate than many would like or
had expected.  Why is this?

This workshop among leading security researchers will explore the
issues relevant to this question, and will seek to foster a long-term
research agenda for authentication and authorization in large
populations via public key cryptography.  The workshop is intended to
promote a vigorous and structured discussion---a discussion
well-informed by the problems and issues in deployment today.

We solicit papers, panel proposals, and participation.

     * Papers and Proposals Due: January 28, 2002
     * Authors Notified: March 5, 2002
     * Final Materials Due: April 1, 2002
     * Workshop: April 24-25, 2002.


Submitted works for panels and papers should address one or more
critical areas of inquiry.  Topics include (but not are not limited
to):


     * Cryptographic methods in support of security decisions

     * The characterization and encoding of security decision data
(e.g.,
     name spaces, x509, SDSI/SPKI, XKMS, PGP, SAML, KeyNote,
PolicyMaker),
     policy mappings and languages, etc.

     * The relative security of alternative methods for supporting
security
     decisions;

     * Privacy protection and implications of different approaches;

     * Scalability of security systems; (are there limits to growth?)

     * Security of the rest of the components of a system;

     * User interface issues with naming, multiple private keys,
selective
     disclosure

     * Mobility solutions

     * Approaches to attributes and delegation

     * Discussion of how the "public key infrastructure" required may
     differ from the ``PKI'' traditionally defined

Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF.  The final version
of refereed papers should ideally be between 8 and 15 pages, and in
no
case more than 20 pages.  Proposals for panels should be no longer
than five pages in length, and should include possible panelists, and
an indication of which of those panelists have confirmed
participation.

Full instructions will appear on our Web site by December 15, 2001.
