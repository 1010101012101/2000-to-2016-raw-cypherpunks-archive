What's the relevance here?

Also, this guy is a real Soviet-style thinker. He believes art should 
somehow be subservient to politics, or to the latest political winds. I'm 
wondering why WSJ even bothered to publish this: Is there some kind of 
political alignment test they see coming down the pike?
