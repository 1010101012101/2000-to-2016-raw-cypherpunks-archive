The loops in the road are, after all, analogue:

A general vehicle reidentification system using inductive loop
signatures to uniquely but anonymously track
individual vehicles, has been formulated and tested in recent years at
the University of California, Irvine. By using
non-obtrusive and anonymous tracking methods, individual vehicles can be
identified and correlated over numerous
identification stations, and very specific real-time data can be
obtained for each tracked vehicle.
