[... quite a lot snipped...]

This is almost an argument *for* re-running the election. If the Palm
Beach (or whatever the place is called) voters tip the balance to either
Gore or Bush can they in any real sense be said to have decided the
election? Their votes still won't count for any more than any other
citizen of Florida. 


ISTM that the real reason for avoiding a re-vote is is the practicality
of it. All that money, media attention and lawyerage will be focussed on
a small group of people, as Tim points out later:

But are there no rules in Florida allowing for a re-vote? If there
really are 19,000 spoiled papers from once county, that sounds "massive"
to me. It may not be fraud - the fools who designed the papers probably
thought they were doing right - but it has the same effect.

When did they make you a Florida judge?   (About the same time they made
me an expert on the laws of a state I've never visited & know nothing
about I suppose...)
