i'm as frustrated as anyone at the glacial pace of disclosure, and the
limited scope of disclosure, and the arbitrary censorship in the
disclosures, and ...

yet still what has been released is far from "negligable"!

serving over to completely overwhelm the ability to discuss and absorb
the breath and depth of these efforts. (i would still prefer a dump!)

diffusion of responsibility leaves plenty accountable parties
