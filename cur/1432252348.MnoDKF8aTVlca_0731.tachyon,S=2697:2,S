Osama Bin Laden has told the mass-circulation Dawn newspaper in Pakistan that 
his al-Qaeda group possesses chemical and nuclear weapons. 

But, while the English-language newspaper carries a clear message from Bin 
Laden that he has access to such weapons, he makes no such claim in an 
Urdu-language version of the interview.
