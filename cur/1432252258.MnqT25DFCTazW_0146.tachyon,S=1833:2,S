Where do I get 100 Usage Tokens to create a folder and try this loom thing?

It's an interesting approach, doing away with any authentication
requirements, and just hiding stuff in a virtually infinite grid.  The loom
itself is a single point of failure, but the provider of the loom service
need have no knowlege of who is using it, or for what.  Hide the thing
behind a bunch of Onion Routers, and it might actually last long enough to
be useful, unlike e-gold and the many other such schemes that have bitten
the dust over the years.
