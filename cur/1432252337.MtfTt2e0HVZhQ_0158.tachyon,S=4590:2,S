Anarchist occupy argentinian embassy in London!!

A group of Anarchists are occupying the Argentinian Embassy in support of 
the peoples' rejection of their "leaders".
For immediate release:
Argentinian Embassy occupied by Anarchists
Those Pesky Kids [TPK]: 07950 567 099
***PRESS RELEASE***
A group of Anarchists are occupying the Argentinian Embassy in support of 
the peoples' rejection of their "leaders".
The occupation of the embassy is in solidarity with the insurrectionary 
events instigated by the majority of the Argentinian population. We 
wholeheartedly support the dreams and desires of the peope as they reject 
the right of governments and corporations to rule them.
Once heralded as the golden child of economic liberalisation, the country 
has now plummeted into a state of poverty and chaos, saddled with US$155 
Billion debt and unemployment levels of 18%. The economic collapse in 
Argentina is due to the expansion of free-market liberalisation and the 
imposition of IMF enforced Structural Adjustment Programs including the 
relentless privatisation of public services. These very same policies have 
caused ruin across the globe, from the privatisation of water in Bolivia to 
the choas of Railtrack in Britain.
Instead of merely accepting the ruin wreaked by over a decade of IMF 
austerity measures and structural adjustment policies - policies that 
continue a centuries old system of profiteering and exploitation - people 
across Argentina have autonomously organised accountable and democratic 
self-governing assemblies to transfrom the country.
We have occupied this embassy to highlight the illegitimacy not just of the 
Argentinian government, but of all governments. The situation in Argentina 
shows both the failure of capitalism as a global system and the 
revolutionary strength of peoples' empowerment.
We endorse the peoples' cry of no leaders no governments!
We endorse peoples' liberation!
We endorse the creation of a new society, free from oppression and 
exploitation!
We endorse the continued destruction of capitalism!
La lucha sigue
