If you check the inet-one.com archive (derived from an unfiltered feed) 
you'll see them appear this week.

inet-one.com saves the attaches as *.bin files.  They are sometimes amusing to

"Jan" sounds like he was dicked around by "Juniper", pretty badly, from
Jan's telling of it.  There's also an "officers killed in action"
spreadsheet from Portsmouth VA.
