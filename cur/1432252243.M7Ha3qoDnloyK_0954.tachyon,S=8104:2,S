Sniffer dog picked up trail
By WAYNE HOWELL, Supreme Court reporter
04sep02

A POLICE dog tracked a fresh human scent just after two officers were 
gunned down, a jury heard yesterday.
The dog, Gus, picked up a scent near the shooting, the Supreme Court was told.
The four-year-old rottweiler led his handler, Senior-Constable John-Peter 
Murray, under three fences, apparently tracking a scent but never reaching 
its source.
Sen-Constable Murray said he believed Gus could distinguish the scents of 
innocent passers-by and offenders.
"Actual offenders . . . have an adrenalin rush . . . that the dog actually 
tracks a lot better and is more excited . . . to just a member of the 
public," he said.

Asked about Gus's intensity while following the scent, Sen-Constable Murray 
said: "I believe the track was fresh."
Sergeant Gary Silk, 35, and Senior-Constable Rodney Miller, 34, were 
fatally shot in Cochranes Rd, Moorabbin, early on August 16, 1998.
The prosecution in the trial of two men accused of the murders has told the 
court the police were shot when they pulled over two armed robbers who had 
been about to hit a restaurant.
The jury has heard that two other policemen saw their colleagues being shot 
from 100m away, and the car they had pulled over driving away.
The court has heard that despite being mortally wounded, Sen-Constable 
Miller managed to say there had been two attackers and one was "on foot".
The court heard yesterday that the day after the shooting, a television 
cameraman found a spent bullet casing while filming people putting flowers 
at the scene.
Christopher McHattie said that while he was filming he noticed a "shiny 
object in the grass" and called over the journalist who was with him.
"We bent down to give it a flick and realised it was what looked like a 
spent bullet casing," Mr McHattie said.
Bandali Michael Debs, 49, of Springfield Drive, Narre Warren, and Jason 
Joseph Roberts, 22, of Merrijig Drive, Cranbourne, have both pleaded not 
guilty to two charges of murder.
Their trial, before Justice Philip Cummins, was to continue.

Attacks on police soar
By TANYA GILES
04sep02
VIOLENT crime against police is rising: more than 2300 officers were 
attacked while on duty in one year.
Knives were the most common weapon used. More than 150 police were attacked 
or threatened with flick knives or blades last year -- a 64 per cent 
increase on the previous year.
Criminals shot at three officers and another 22 police were threatened with 
firearms in 2001 -- a 19 per cent increase. Total assaults against police 
jumped to 2310, an 18.5 per cent increase on the previous year.
Next month, Victoria Police will begin to issue the latest in bulletproof 
vests to all officers.
About 8600 police will be issued with the lightweight T-shirt style vests 
that, unlike the bulky vests worn over clothes, can be hidden under their 
uniforms.
The vests are made from a fibre several times stronger than steel and not 
only stop bullets but can prevent knives stabbing through the fabric.
Inspector Emmett Dunne, manager of the operational safety and tactics 
training unit, said police would have the choice of several types of vests 
offering different levels of protection, and would be trained in their use 
from October 1.
Insp Dunne said police did not deserve to be threatened or injured while 
protecting the community. He urged all Victorians to remember there was a 
"human being behind the uniform".
"Just remember they have got a family and friends to go home to as well," 
he said.
Other police statistics obtained by the Herald Sun revealed 50 police were 
threatened or battered with bats, bars or clubs last year, an increase of 
20 per cent.
In one incident, five officers were injured by a man wielding a large 
ceremonial crucifix inside St Margaret Mary's Catholic Church, Spotswood.
Another 17 police officers were rammed with vehicles, in a total of 83 
incidents in the past five years. One police sergeant narrowly escaped 
death when he was forced through a wooden fence and crushed in a hit-run 
incident involving a stolen car in Reservoir.

Insp Dunne said police were instructed on how to deal with potentially 
violent situations through conflict resolution and other evasive actions.

Police Association secretary Senior Sergeant Paul Mullett said police 
should not have to face attacks while doing their jobs.
"Our members are on the front line as far as keeping the community safe. We 
are the thin blue line, and any attack on police is an attack on society 
itself," he said.
"Our members should not be used as punching bags because they are doing 
their job protecting the community."
Sen-Sgt Mullett said covert ballistic vests needed to be introduced 
urgently to offer police immediate protection.
