My point was that without constitutional protection, it would be infinitely
easier for innocent people and arbitrarily-determined thought-crimanal "enemies
of the state" to be shot right along with the real criminals. In America as it
exists today, the Constitution is the only thing that stands in the way of 
full-scale repression in the name of "security". Be careful what you wish for,
that's all.
