It depends on how you define "better".


STARTTLS is defeated by Norton AV (silently!) and probably other
programs... if not now, then soon.  Mail is rarely stolen when in transit,
it's much easier to steal it from the destination spool, and STARTTLS does
nothing to protect stored mail.  The authentication option is only used
to authenticate roaming SMTP clients, and probably not often even then
since distributing client certificates is hard and too many IT folks
still think encrypted == secure.

If you define "better" as "more secure", or even "secure against
most classes of attackers", it's not better, it's a waste of CPU time.
But if you define "better" as "secure against passive eavesdroppers"
or as "increases the use of crypto", then it's better.

What's needed is something that IS better for both definitions
and is as easy to set up as STARTTLS... same thing that's been
needed for the last 10 years.
