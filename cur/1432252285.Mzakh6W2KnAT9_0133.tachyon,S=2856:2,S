The flight attendant didn't identify which six people were air marshals,
and since the normal number of them ranges from zero to two per flight,
she was almost certainly just lying to calm down the troublesome passenger
(who definitely had no class, middle or otherwise.)

One of the entertaining followup items from this event was that,
yes, the group of ~14 Syrian musicians were really just musicians on tour,
but in fact their visas had expired about 3 weeks earlier,
though the TSA thugs who interrogated them after they arrived
didn't notice it.

I was surprised they were musicians - I'd expected them to have
been a soccer team, and I've been on enough airplanes with
sports teams on them that their behavior sounds totally typical.
And Middle Easterners flying out of Detroit?  What a surprise!
(Detroit's one of the main places that Arab immigrants move.)

And she's obviously in favor of "protection", whether or not it takes a
police state to do it.
