Those who live by the sword, die by the sword. Forty years ago Rand 
was quite willing to "cook the books" to produce reports warning of 
the "missile gap" between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. At a time when 
the Russians were still hauling artillery pieces around with horses, 
they were portrayed by Rand and other think tanks as 10-foot tall 
military geniuses with vast manufacturing plants.

The buyers of Rand's product, the new Kennedy administration, was 
very happy with the product.

The military-industrial complex needs a major enemy to justify more 
Seawolf submarines (which the Navy doesn't want), more B2 bombers 
(which are too unwieldy to use in battle, too visible to radar to be 
called "stealth"), more aircraft carriers (to fight wars 
simultaneously all around the globe), and more sabers to rattle.

There had been some idle chatter about "terrorism" being this Scary 
Enemy, but it turns out that not a lot of B2 bombers and Seawolf 
submarines get justified as part of the War on (Some) Freedom 
Fighters.

So they're playing the China card. Same old same old.
