The fundamental problem is that crypto for rights protection doesn't
work in general, and certainly can't work where the decryption
technology has to be in the hands of the person you are trying to
protect it from.

Criticising the DMCA because it protects weak crypto seems to me to be
the wrong angle - it doesn't matter whether the crypto is weak or
strong, it can be broken. The important thing is that we should continue
to be able to demonstrate that fact.

Rights management can only be done by legal and social means, not
technological ones.

Cheers,

Ben.
