If so, then why did he spend a week denying it, calling me a liar, saying
the data is fake and accusing it of being disinfo? And why not notify
people on the website instead of the occasional tweet about how all logs
leak/it's "not the worst"?

And if it *was* purposeful, how is *that* okay? If he leaked four months
worth of his users' logs and metadata including search terms, *to make a
point*?
