For the next installment of Lessons From The DataDome, Vince Cate  
teaches his son Teryn (and little Amoni, too...) about Gresham's Law.

"Gresham's Law": another "big word", like "aerodynamics" to add to  
Teryn's vocabulary, I think...

Cheers,
RAH
And, yes, Virginia, I *did* mean Gresham's Law, legal tender laws and  
all:  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law>
