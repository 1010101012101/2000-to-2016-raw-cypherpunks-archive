Federal Prosecutor, a 
        Prominent Gun-Control 
      Advocate, Shot to Death in 
             Seattle Home
      By Peggy AndersenAssociated Press Writer

                Published: Oct 12, 2001
     SEATTLE (AP) - A federal prosecutor who headed a 
 prominent gun control group in his spare time was shot in his home 
 and died early Friday.

 Thomas C. Wales, 49, died about 1:15 a.m. Friday at Harborview 
 Medical Center. He had been shot in the neck and the side late 
 Thursday, a hospital spokeswoman said.

 Details about the shooting were sketchy. No arrests had been made, 
 police spokesman Mark Jamieson said.

 Wales was a member of the fraud unit in the U.S. attorney's office 
 here, specializing in prosecution of banking and business crime, 
 spokesman Lawrence Lincoln said.

 He also was board president of Seattle-based Washington 
 Ceasefire, a gun-control group.

 "The death of Tom Wales is a terrible loss to our movement," said a 
 statement from Michael T. Barnes, president of the Washington, 
 D.C.-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "Although we 
 do not yet know the motives for the shooting, we are angered by the 
 murder of this true visionary."

 Federal agencies were assisting Seattle police in the investigation. 
 Officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
 Firearms declined to comment.

 According to The Seattle Times, neighbors in the wealthy Queen 
 Anne Hill neighborhood reported hearing shots shortly before 11 
 p.m. Thursday.

 Neighbor Tom Olsby said Wales' wife, Elizabeth, a former Seattle 
 School Board member, was away visiting family in New England.

 On Sept. 30, Washington Ceasefire planted thousands of daffodils in 
 a popular city park in remembrance of people who had died from 
 gun violence.
