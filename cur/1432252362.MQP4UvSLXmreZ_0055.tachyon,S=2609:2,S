Yes, because in the vast majority of cases those 'social institutions'
failed.

This is the normal 'crypto-anararchist' blinder, the government regulation
came first and then the social institutions came in and tried to do it
(whatever 'it' might be) and because of government interference they
failed.

Unfortunately, it ain't so. What happens the vast majority of time is that
the state sits around watching private institutions attempt to regulate
themselves but fail because there is insufficient cooperation between
parties in an 'anarchy' for them to succedd.

Consider the discussion and the consequence of self-regulation in the
video game market with respect to selling adult games to children.
