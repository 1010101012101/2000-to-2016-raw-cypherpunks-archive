The Man Who Sold the War
Meet John Rendon, Bush's general in the propaganda war
By JAMES BAMFORD
RollingStone.com

...

John Walter Rendon Jr. rises at 3 a.m. each morning after six hours of
sleep, turns on his Apple computer and begins ingesting information --
overnight news reports, e-mail messages, foreign and domestic
newspapers, and an assortment of government documents, many of them
available only to those with the highest security clearance. According
to Pentagon documents obtained by Rolling Stone, the Rendon Group is
authorized "to research and analyze information classified up to Top
Secret/SCI/SI/TK/G/HCS" -- an extraordinarily high level of clearance
granted to only a handful of defense contractors. "SCI" stands for
Sensitive Compartmented Information, data classified higher than Top
Secret. "SI" is Special Intelligence, very secret communications
intercepted by the National Security Agency. "TK" refers to
Talent/Keyhole, code names for imagery from reconnaissance aircraft
and spy satellites. "G" stands for Gamma (communications intercepts
from extremely sensitive sources) and "HCS" means Humint Control
System (information from a very sensitive human source). Taken
together, the acronyms indicate that Rendon enjoys access to the most
secret information from all three forms of intelligence collection:
eavesdropping, imaging satellites and human spies.

...

James Bamford is the best-selling author of "A Pretext for War: 9/11,
Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies" (2004) and
"Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security
Agency" (2001). This is his first article for Rolling Stone.
