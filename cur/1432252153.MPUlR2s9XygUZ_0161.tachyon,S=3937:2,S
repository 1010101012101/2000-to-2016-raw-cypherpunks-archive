If the original anonymous author had the foresight to timestamp his code
together with a public key before he posted the code, he can now claim
authorship by publishing the timestamp and signing messages with that key.

BTW, if anyone wants a public domain implementation of SHA-2 (including
-256, -384, and -512) with known authorship, there's one available in
Crypto++. It's written by myself, based on Steve Reid's public domain
SHA-1 code.
