> law and crimes against the civilian population during last year's NATO air
> campaign against Yugoslavia.

> Veroljub Raketic, the presiding judge, said the arrest warrants would be
> issued for the convicted leaders and their sentences would start as soon
as
> they are arrested.

> During the four-day trial in the biggest courtroom in the Palace of
> Justice, in which 14 seats labeled with the names of the accused were left
> vacant, the officially appointed lawyer defending Clinton told the court
he
> could cite as an extenuating circumstances that Clinton came from "an
> incomplete family and lived with a step-father which probably left a mark
> on his overall behavior."
>
> Another court-appointed lawyer defending Albright asked the court to take
> into account her repressed psychological state as a woman subordinated to
> the U.S.  president and the fact that she had never before been sentenced
> for war crimes.

> Apart from Clinton and Albright the convicted included Defense Secretary
> William Cohen; British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary
> Robin Cook; French President Jacques Chirac, Foreign Minister Hubert
> Vedrine and Defense Minister Alain Richard; German Chancellor Gerhard

Europe,
> Gen.  Wesley Clark.

> They were ordered to pay legal costs within 15 days of the sentences
taking

> The indictments said that the accused were responsible for NATO forces
> using 31,000 shells each with 300 grams of depleted uranium at eight
> locations in Serbia and Montenegro and that 10 tons of this kind of
> ammunition were dropped on Kosovo.  This specifically polluted the
> environments of villages in the vicinity of Vranje, Bujanovac and Presevo
> in southern Serbia causing various types of cancer and death, according to
> the indictments, the court said.
>
> NATO also dropped a huge quantity of cluster bombs in the areas of Nis,
