It seems like one risk for hashcash is that, when mailing lists are
whitelisted, a spammer can then use the lists to amplify spam (which I
think is what Richard Clayton was suggesting above).  For instance,
you generated a single hashcash stamp for cryptography@metzdowd.com of
the same value as the stamp you generated for richard@highwayman.com.

That stamp would hypothetically induce metzdowd.com to send your
message to _all_ of the cryptography subscribers, all of whom have
hypothetically whitelisted the list.  That means that, if your message
were spam, you delivered it to the whole subscriber base at very low
cost.

Or does hashcash only help moderated mailing lists (where it "pays"
the moderator for her time)?  My current impression is that it will
benefit individual e-mail recipients but not help subscribers to large
unmoderated mailing lists.
