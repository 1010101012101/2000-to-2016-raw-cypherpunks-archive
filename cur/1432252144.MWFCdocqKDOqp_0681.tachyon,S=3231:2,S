Set all the pixels to the same value. Of course, you can trasmit a 
couple of bytes of information that way, and some more with the image 
size. So, I hereby decree that all pictures will be 256x256 pixels, 8 
bits per pixel, all bits set to 1. Guess we need to mandate the 
compression method, too, lest you transmit a few bits by choosing it. 
So, uncompressed TIFF format. Of course, there's massive benefit to 
this. Now all pictures can use the same URL. Consider the massive 
bandwidth saving caused by caching. What a benefactor I am.

Cheers,

Ben.
