"To strike at the mother country where it was most vulnerable, embargoes
were declared on all British goods carrying import duties. And the Sons of
Liberty attacked anyone who did not observe the ban by the liberal use of
tar and feathers and riding a rail.

The fiercest opposition to Britian's revenue laws was staged in Boston,
the principal port of Massachusetts, where a militant group of agitators -
led by an ex-tax collector, Samuel Adams, and a local merchant, John
Hancock - conducted a campaign that skillfully combined violence and
sophisticated legal and political strategy. Radicals were now sitting not
only in the elected Massachusetts Assembly, but on the Executive Council
that governed the colony."
