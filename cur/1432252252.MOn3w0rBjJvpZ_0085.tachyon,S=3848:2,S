Socialism says that if we let the individual manage resources then some
get right and come get poor. They claim that not only should people have
the opportunity to improve, society has a responsibility to make it
happen. And the mechanism is redistribution fo wealth through a
centralised mechanism. That may be a state like a 'federal' system or it
could be a distributed communal sort of thing. The point is that each
individual works for the collective best interest. The consequence is they
do not get representation (at least equal opportunity isn't guaranteed
with respect to politics). So the statism certainly doesn't have to be
'central' with respect to a single party. They are 'central' in that they
are the only parties (wether it's a central federal system or a
distributed communal mechanism). Since all persons work when and where the
state desires things like wage control are inherent and fundamental tools
of economic management. Since there is not equal opportunity with respect
to political potential it is also clear that 'free' speach in the Western
sense doesn't exist.

I'd say you're pretty much wrong on all counts.

And I can sue them or sick the big G on 'em.

The S. Americans are a perfect! example of why unregulated markets, such
as those proposed by some here, don't work. Russia and N. Korea are the
flip side of that extreme.
