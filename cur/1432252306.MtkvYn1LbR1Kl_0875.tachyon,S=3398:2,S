Any thoughts on this device?  At first glance, it doesn't seem
particularly impressive...

Lovely idea of two-factor authentication:

   The user then enters their user name (something they know) and the
   8-digit Quizid passcode (something they have) into the login screen
   of their application.

Excerpt from the BBC article:

   Users are issued with a card and a personal code, based on a set of
   colour keys on the card. Each time they wish to conduct a secure
   transaction, they punch in the colour code and a random number is
   generated.
