Depends on the price, and how readily it can be adapted
to P2P nets.  The need certainly increases with the lawsuits.

The folks profiting from P2P (eg
Sharman networks) will have to include IP anonymity features in future
releases.
Else folks don't share, ergo their tool is useless, and no eyeballs
to sell to the advertizers.   The punitive fines will drive anonymity,
or Sharman collapses.   Since ZKS et al. were existence proofs
that it can be done, and the techniques largely known, it probably
will happen, with or without ZKS' code.

Sorta like Hiroshima as an existance proof and
neutron physics as the techniques.

As an aside, I'm surprised the BSA hasn't joined in.
