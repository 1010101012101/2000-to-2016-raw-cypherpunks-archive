Right, though I see that being the case less so nowadays. The reasons
for this are many, and probably complicated, including the growth of
the federal government, the subcommittee structure divvying up power
in Congress, the rise of the permanent federal bureaucracy, and perhaps
most important, the stunning growth in nonprofit/advocacy groups.

Still, Congress and the agencies will invite stellar technologists and
researchers and scientists to testify on occasion. A handful of
congresscritters may even listen. But the rest will vote the way their
parties/backers/constituents tell them to. I recall there's only one
scientist out of 535 members of Congress, at least last I checked.
