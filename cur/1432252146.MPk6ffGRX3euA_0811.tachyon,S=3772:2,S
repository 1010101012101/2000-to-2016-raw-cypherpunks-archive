Call me unusually hawkish, but I don't see why that's necessary. Let's
say our fleet was attacked at Pearl Harbor 60 years ago -- but by an
enemy who did not paint his flag on his aircraft. Congress could, and
should, declare war on an unidentified enemy.

I admit the situation is not as clear here, since generally only nationstates
can raise air armadas and non-nationstate organizations could have trained
the Hijacking 19, but perhaps the parallels are nevertheless sufficient.
Think of it as an "unidentified co-conspirator" approach.
