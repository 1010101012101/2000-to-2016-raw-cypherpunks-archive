It was faintly disgusting to see jim leherer misting up over after TB's 
rabblerousing speech on Terror.Yet when you look at his leaders efforts you 
can understand why some displacement activity is going on.Blair gives good 
TV 'head',while the smirking chimp stumbles and bumbles his way through 
life like Homer Simpsons drinking buddy.
The killing joke over TB is what can he do by himself? He's the puppet of a 
pretzel scoffing clown. How many Bond movies lately have you suspended 
belief over the ludicrous projection of the UK's power?
It gets harder and harder.As a small favor,I'd appreciate a copy of 
'Goldeneye' with the theme music inserted at the appropriate points,if you 
can cut out jar jar Binks you can do this for me...please?
Thank you.
