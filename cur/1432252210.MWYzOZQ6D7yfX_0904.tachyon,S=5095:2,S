This is a terribly important point. Implementing this "atomic 
transaction" would be a major step. Having a Web site that does this 
EVEN WITH PLAY TOKENS would be a useful step. (Many dislike toy 
applications, but a site which did this would be a way to play with the 
software, test the reliability, and get ideas for further developments. 
The "Play Tokens" would be of literally no value, ostensibly.)

Like a cellular automata, the basic rules dramatically affect future 
evolutionary paths.

With the proper atomic transaction protocols, the rest unfolds naturally.

Money changers can profit by returning some fraction (e.g., 0.99) of 
what they are given.
