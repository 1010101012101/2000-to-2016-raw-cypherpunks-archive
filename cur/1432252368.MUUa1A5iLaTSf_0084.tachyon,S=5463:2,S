Well, what if the Devil stole that $ from you in the first place? What level 
of subversion is appropriate in order to re-appropriate those $$$? This case 
is clearly different from the true blue career war criminal, ehr I mean

while! So I don't mind too much if they're trying to dodge their commitment 
in this context.
