"Designing fairer elections" has very little to do with my points, 
about causality, re-dos, and re-votes. I can think of various 
improvements to the election process, such as operating the polls for 
a 15 hour period, nationwide, simultaneously.

Whatever. This is a matter for those involved in designing elections, 
not at all related to this business of whether some particular 
polling site should get a "do-over."

I urge you to get involved in the Election Commission in your state 
and to make your suggestions for future elections.

The voting periods are set by the states, not the Feds. You, 
ironically, seem to be arguing for more of a role for the Feds, not 
less of a role.

See what I mean? How do you square your "I would hate to have some 
faceless fed tell me what reasonable is" with "states should not be 
allowed to set up their own mechanisms..." point?

I really need to give up on you. You blather, you ramble, you 
contradict yourself, you lack a consistent point of view, you 
probably would have voted for Buchanan and then claimed you wanted a 
do-over.

You fail to grasp the essential point: the hours must not be changed 
once they have been established. It is utterly wrong to close the 
polls _early_. Your point "it's probably not a problem either someone 
felt..." is utterly vacuous.

It is also utterly wrong to keep the pollling places open longer. 
Especially when a political calculation is made that more Democrats 
appear to be straggling, as was the calculation in St. Louis on 
Tuesday.

That you don't get this point, about consistent rules, does not 
surprise me at all.

No, it is not irrelevant. It would give the courts the power to 
determine elections and would likely put an end to our system of 
government.

Perhaps we should adopt your suggestion. Let the lawyers take over 
the election process just as they have taken over most things.

We did just this--we had the election.

Do-overs are not allowed.


Fools like you just don't get it.
