I think that's it exactly.  Doesn't look like VerySafe is bringing anything new 
to the table.  PGP already does self-decrypting files, and has better support 
than just an Outlook plugin.  On top of that, all mail is mediated through the 
VerySafe server, so traffic analysis is built in, along with key escrow (your 
keys are generated by the server) and maybe even content escrow.
