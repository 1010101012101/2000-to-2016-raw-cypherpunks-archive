A Wired article by Jeffrey Benner ("No Smoking Gun in Terror Bill")
(http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,47286,00.html) uses the
phrase "gun show loophole" quite a few times, but doesn't mention the
Second Amendment (nor even the Ninth and Tenth) even once. No mention of
how "closing the loophole" would prevent any domestic terrorism. No
quotes from gun rights people but plenty from gun grabbers.

Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for Declan to emphasize that
the opinions and obvious biases of some ill-informed, probably inbred,
journalists are not necessarily the opinions of the publishers or other
journalists.
