Actually the M16 and M4 also suffer from this exact same problem in closer
quarters.  The 5.56 just doesn't cut it when Haji is taking a point blank death
shot at you.  As a result, most of the spec op, merc, and secret squirrel crowd
is using a variety of 7.62 weapons to included looted AK's.

What is even worse is the 9mm SMG's (for example, the modify DoE M4) ... talk
about useless.
