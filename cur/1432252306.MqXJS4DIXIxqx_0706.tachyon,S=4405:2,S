religion. But unfortunately i am a handicap, although
i was not born a handicap but as faith could have it i
had an accident two years back that was during my last
year in the university.I thank God to that am alive to
testify to the wonderful things that the lord have
been doing in my live.Today i am an accountant,but the
unfortunate situation there is that i lost my right
limb due to the accident that i had.this  condition
has made life immensely difficult for me,this have
made me to seek for your much needed
help.Please,kindly help me as i cant work and i need
to buy a[plastic Right Limb]and a wheel chair  to
enable me to move freely from one place to ther other.
    I am very sorry for this, as it's not in my
character to ask for such favour, but presently i dont
have a choice than to seek for your help.Please, i
must beg you that you should'nt hesitate to help me if
you can...I want to live a happy live againe.You may
want to know how much the wheel chair and the plastic

plastic limb.PLEASE KINDLY ASSIST ME WITH WHAT EVER
AMOUNT THAT YOU CAN, ACTUALLY NOTHING IS TOO SMALL,AND
I WILL APPRICIATE WHATEVER HELP YOU CAN RENDER TO ME.
