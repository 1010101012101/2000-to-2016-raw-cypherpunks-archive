I got a notice today from MOXON & KOBRIN Attorneys at Law representing =
the Church of Scientology International ("CSI") and Religious Technology =
Center ("RTC") stating infringement Under the Digital Millennium =
Copyright Act for a web site I currently mirror at =
http://xenu.pacer.com. It appears that some of the infringements may be =
true ( I will have to look to be sure) but what really gets me is the =
part quoted below.. They are saying since "Scientology", "Dianetics", =
"Hubbard" and "NOTs" are registered trademarks they cannot be used in =
metatags in a webpage... The restriction in use of words in a web page =
is just flat out censorship.. Absolutely ridiculous... It would be one =
thing if someone used the words to represent a business.. But I would =
think metatags at the very least would fall under the "Fair Use" clause. =
=20

Quoted from email=20
___________________________________________________________

Lastly, you have placed the following federally registered trademarks =
belonging to RTC as metatags on your web page:

"Scientology" which is registered with the United States Patent and =
Trademark Office under registration numbers: 1540928, 1342353,1329474, =
1318717, 1036997, 0898018, 1755441;

"Dianetics" which is registered with the United States Patent and =
Trademark Office under registration numbers 1347651, 1366410, 1432039;

"Hubbard" which is registered with the United States Patent and =
Trademark Office under registration numbers 1318637, 1505349, 1546167, =
1734728; and=20

"NOTs" which is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark =
Office under registration numbers 1372473, 1307552, 1305409 (NOTS).=20
