Eh. It's Cisco. Shouldn't be too hard to write an app that will lie to this 
network about where you are.

And then, of course, I'm not yet convinced it's impossible to lie (through 
layers 6 and 7) to such a network, even built of impervious software.

And of course, the moment some other company builds a different and 
overlapping network, all bets are off.
