I too was surprised to see some activity on the pfsense list, after
seeing only a few posts per week I checked today to find several dozen
messages talking about a topic I have been concerned with myself - as
a network security specialist, how much can I trust the firewalls I
use, be they embedded devices, software packages, or 'hardware' from
manufacturers.
There are many on-topic things to discuss here:
1. Which Ciphers & Transforms should we now consider secure (pfsense
provides quite a few cipher choices over some other off the shelf
hardware.
2. What hardware / software & configuration changes can we consider to
improve RNG and ensure that should we increase the bit size of our
encryption, reduce lifetimes of our SAs that we can still ensure we
have enough entropy in the RNG on a device that is typically starved
of traditional entropy sources.

This is so much on-topic, I am surprised that there has been a
movement to call this thread to stop, granted - it may seem that the
conversation may drift into a political one, with regard to privacy
law etc... however, that is a valid sub-topic for a discussion list
that addresses devices that are designed and implemented to safe-guard
privacy.
