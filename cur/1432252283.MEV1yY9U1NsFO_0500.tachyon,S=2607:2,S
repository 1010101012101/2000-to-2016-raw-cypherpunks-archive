Some time ago, the president of Somalia returned from his exile to 
Mogadishu, the former capital of Somalia, which was going to be the new 
capital of Somalia.  Lots of people gave lots of speeches about how popular 
and successful the new government was, and CNN gave a glowing account of 
how pleased the Somalis were to have a government again.   Approximately 
twenty four hours later, the new government did a moonlight flit out of 
Somalia back into exile.

Recently the new government announced it was returning from its exile to 
Baidoa, which is to be the new government of Somalia.  Lots of notables 
gave lots of speeches about how popular and successful the new government 
was, and CNN gave a glowing account of how pleased the Somalis were to have 
a government again.

Unfortunately neither the president or any senior members of the new 
government were able to make it Baidoa in time for the press conference.
