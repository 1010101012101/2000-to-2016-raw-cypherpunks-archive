Nation of Change (Dec 8) - "Drones Come Home, to U.S. Privacy Activists  
Dismay":
http://www.nationofchange.org/drones-come-home-us-privacy-activists-dismay-1354982443

Nice survey of anti-drone activism occurring in the United States,  
beginning with the notable victory obtained earlier this week by the  
Alameda County Against Drones coalition (ACAD).  ACAD headed off an  
attempt by the Alameda County Sheriff to win approval from the Alameda  
County Board of Supervisors to accept a DHS grant to acquire a  
surveillance drone.  I would love to hear a summary of the effort that  
went into successfully undermining that "stealth attack" from the ACAD  
representatives on this list.

The linked article also includes details about domestic drone activism in 
Buffalo, Syracuse, San Diego, Portland, and Seattle.
