Punch cards suffer from the defect of being visually readable.  5mb
Bernoulli are readily available, however, 3" (NOT 3.5") floppy is
*extremely* rare (I have two drives, and they are *so* obscure that I
offer sizeable ($500.00) for anyone who can find a way to read the ones I
bring for demonstrations :-)

For that legitimate 'What I'm Doing *Isn't* "Museum Theft" kind of
attitude. '
