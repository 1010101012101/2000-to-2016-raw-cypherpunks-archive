George Soros (for instance), NOT CIA. That's how you get true plausible
deniability.

The Russians have no person like that. They use their foreign policy
channels. Anyone as wealthy as Soros in Russia (if there is such a
person) is a Kleptocrat and generally want to destroy the Russian
government, not assist it.

Example of what Porter Goss meant:

Right now the US is making claims via the Daily Beast that the Russians
bombed a hospital in al-Nusra/ISIS HQ Idlib Syria.

The US government is making NO CLAIM AT ALL. They're leaving it to the
Western NGO backed hospital's staff and a guy whose CV is:

You know what the "Sons of Iraq program" was rysiek?

It was the publicly announced US attempt in Iraq to get al-Qaeda
affiliated Sunnis to work as militias for the government, paid for by
the US. The 'paymasters' were a little slow so most of them, much like
the ISIS fighters in Idlib, of whom some most likely are those former
'sons', 'defected to al-Qaeda, and the guy mentioned above is a LONG
TERM "Handler" for those folks as propaganda intermediary for the
"Syrian Coalition", western governments, working for a PRIVATE NGO with
no direct affiliation anymore to the CIA or Pentagon.

RR

PS. George Soros is only 4 degrees separated from al-Qaeda.

He funds the "White Helmets" in Syria, the "Free Syrian Army's"
fighter(1) SAR team that OCCASIONALLY rescues a civilian. Those FSA
fighters defect to al-Nusra. 70 just did so and stated that was their
intent from the git (2). al-Nusra swears allegiance to ISIS (3), and
ISIS was formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq.(4)

All the above has happened without one US dollar going through
government channels (except the publicly known funding to train the
defecting fighters).
