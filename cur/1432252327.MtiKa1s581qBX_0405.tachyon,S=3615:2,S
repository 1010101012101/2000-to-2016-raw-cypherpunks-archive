Holy faulty logic Batman! This has to be one of the more doofy things
I've heard. It's right up there with the EMI Grounding Strap thread.

What're you going to do, sell a product in CompUSA with instructions to
the cashiers that the NSA is not allowed to buy it? If the NSA is
willing to pay for some software that's great. They've got as much right
to buy it as anyone else. As long as they obey the law! and don't
reverse engineer it, let them share in financing further development.

I would find it more relevant to know which commercial product designs
have been influenced by which non-commercial agencies.
