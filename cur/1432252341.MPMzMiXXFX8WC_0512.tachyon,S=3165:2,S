You know, it occurs to me I need a little 'Bot.

What this Bot does is periodically make encrypted "calls" or send out 
meaningless encrypted messages on a regular basis. Then, it won't be as

In addition, let 'em spend themselves silly and tie up resources on my 
crapola. In fact, how 'bout a worm or something that does the same thing for 
everybody's machine?
