Rivest and Schneier's work factor discussions assume brute force or
streamlined brute force such as GNFS.  These remain exponential in time.

Now hypothesize the effect a new factoring or Feistel cipher attack would
have on these tables.

Too many crypto pundits spout extrapolations of exponential work factor as
proof that these ciphers are unbreakable.

These are merely postulates based on an assumption of a sort that has
generally proven wrong throughout the history of science.  "X requires Y,
but Y is impossible, so X is impossible."  Until Z comes along, and 20
years later its demonstrated in science or math classrooms as yet another
example of bad logic.

One of the points I believe is sorely missing in these discussions is how
important "improvements in algorithms" can be.  In the narrowest sense, I
agree with your statements - but I have also seen what elegant alternative
approaches can do to systems that were presumed to be vulnerable only to
brute force, and I've also seen how nicely they may be placed into custom
hardware.

I'm not stating that brute force silicon can be scaled to the point it can
attack a 256 bit key in reasonable time today.  What I do know is that
alternative attacks, implemented in silicon or sapphire, are another
matter.  Your position is predicated on the assumption that because no such
attacks are in the public domain, none must exist.  I believe this is
faulty logic, and advances a common, yet dangerous position.

Most people who have worked with military crypto systems do, off the
record.  The difference between what is public and what has been developed
with decades of unlimited resources is staggering.  How many cryptographers
or discrete math experts work in the public domain?  Now how many work for
the NSA?  That's how many orders of magnitude?  And how many orders of
magnitude difference in budgets, ect., even with bureaucratic and civil
service overhead.

Call it threat analysis - I think it is reasonable to assume they know a
few tricks that aren't public yet.  And any trick related to factoring or
Feistel networks is sufficient to obsolete those "age of universe"
extrapolations.
