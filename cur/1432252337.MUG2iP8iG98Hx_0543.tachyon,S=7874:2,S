The point is, the entry from the non-anonymous to the anonymous world
is a vulnerability.

If the number of remailers of small then this represents a vulnerability.  If the number is large (and especially if the first remailer link is encrypted and is a generalized P2P client able to perform a great number of functions, including remailing) then risk is greatly reduced.

>You are not stating their claims accurately.  ZKS does indeed have
information about who is using it at any given time, if they operate any
of the servers.  Or at least the server operators can tell.  Each user
sets up a route through a chain of servers, and any given server knows
exactly who is using it as the initial connection into the network.
Again, the entry from non-anonymous into anonymous networks is visible.

The hierarchical architecture of ZKS' network is, in my opinion, a weakness.  I greatly prefer a P2P approach, despite possible DoS shortcomings.  In a P2P approach the first remailer may be hosted on your own machine.  As Tim has noted as long as one or a few remailers are trusted (and one assumes you own PC is trusted) then the chain is sufficiently reliable.

the point is that as you enter the anonymous world your entry is visible.

As in the remailer case, if the number of ecash merchants is small and they don't accept cash then this may be true.  If the number of sales and redemption points is large and cash, or other anonymous bearer instruments, are accepted then the risk is greatly reduced.

If it can't pass the terrorist or pedo test its not ready for prime time.  Would you limit firearm ownership to pellet guns.  Would you trust or wish to pay for a missile defense system which would only defend against amateur rockets?


>The great thing about bin Laden as an example is that we can see
exactly what the consequences will be when he succeeds.  With McVeigh,
nobody knows for sure.  But chances are it would be much the same if
the militias achieved their goals: installation of a religious state.
Supporting these people means helping bring about another Afghanistan,
maybe right here at home next time.

And we can guess what happens when what we thought were our constitutional guarantees are slowly eroded "for our security and the safety of the Children."  I have no interest in living in a "safe" society virtually devoid of my civil rights and woe onto those who enact leglislation or enforce laws taking it from you or I.
