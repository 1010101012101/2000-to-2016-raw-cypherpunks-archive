Fuck Jim's CDR.

The WWA images were available only through the PACER
subscription service, so they are not likely to be archived
on the Web unless somebody else did it.

We downloaded many, but not all of them, and not all
provided full copies of filings; some offered only the first 
page.

Happily, the stuff Jim sent by snail the other day provides
the missing pages of the truncated docs and several other 
filings that were not on the WWA site. They'll be up tonight 
or tomorrow.

The docket through today shows that subpoenas are
going out for Jim's witnesses, er, his accusers, ratfinks
and alleged victims, posted here yesterday. That's if 
Jack doesn't deny Jim his licks as customary of blind 
justice WWA.

This mad rush to trial may be interrupted in order to
deny Jim his perfect appeal grounds that he was prevented
from required time for defense preparation -- and running 
down witnesses fleeing subpoenas and while praying for 
60 Minutes to answer the chalk mark.
