"A very large number of muslims, particularly arab muslims- a
small minority in the US, a large minority or substantial
majority in many muslim countries, continually seek to confront
the infidel in a wide variety of ways, and interpret our
politeness and care to avoid harming muslims as weakness and
fear."

I would bet that statements that sound very, very close to this were uttered 
prior to Iraq II.

"Care to Avoid harming Muslims"?

You are either trolling with better skill than even I, the Great Tyler 
Durden could muster, or else you are completely and totally ignorant of 
world history.

Go read some history books and you will understand the reason we (the US) 
has been targeted in particular. You'll quickly find that their hatred of us 
in not accidental.

As for your "looks like a mad bomber" ideas, are you suggesting that, the 
day after a militant Indonesian muslim commits an act of terrorism, we 
should then exclude all asians from our airplanes, buses and subways?

I don't think you've thought this out very well.
