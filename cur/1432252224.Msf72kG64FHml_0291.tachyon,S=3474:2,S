    Yes, I remember you saying "maybe this means...."  --- but when? I want

     And they also say "March 2001", but given the fact that the print
industry is much like the software industry in vaporous publishing dates,
who knows when?. Amazon compounds this by advertising all sorts of books,
etc. that they don't have in hand.
      But I'll probably buy the new edition when it comes out. I spend
ridiculous amounts of money on books every month anyway. Just went to one of
those remaindered book outlets last weekend and bought 6-7 books, then went
to Barnes & Noble and bought more.
       Like I said, I'd really be happy running a used book store. Guess I'm
just a book freak.
