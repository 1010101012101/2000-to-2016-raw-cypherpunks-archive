PGP Corporation Receives FIPS 140-2 Validation

  PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 24, 2004--

 
 NIST Validation of PGP Software Developers Kit (SDK) Enables PGP
Corporation to Better Serve Federal Customers
  



 PGP Corporation, the global leader in digital information security,
announced that the PGP(R) Software Developer Kit (SDK) 3.0.3 has received
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1 validation by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The PGP SDK is
the core software cryptographic module used inside all PGP Corporation's
products, including PGP Universal, PGP Desktop, PGP Mobile, and the newly
announced PGP Command Line. This module was validated to the standards set
forth by the FIPS PUB 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules
document published by NIST. Validation information is available at the FIPS
site http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/140-1/1401val2004.htm.

 "We understand the many certifications and validations required by U.S.
and international government agencies and technology organizations," said
Phillip Dunkelberger, President and CEO of PGP Corporation. "One major step
is FIPS validation of the core cryptographic capabilities that underlie our
comprehensive, secure messaging solutions. You will see other important
announcements from PGP Corporation in the near future."

 PGP Corporation has been providing secure-messaging products to the U.S.
and international governments and government agencies for many years. With
its Ingram Micro partnership, the Company is expanding the number of
qualified government partners, many of which hold Government Services
Agency (GSA) Schedule Contracts. Adding the FIPS 140-2 validation allows
PGP Corporation to continue to facilitate the procurement and deployment of
information security products for government agencies.

 PGP Corporation's email encryption technology is one of only two approved
email-related encryption standards approved by NIST under in its
"Guidelines on Electronic Mail Security"
(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-45/sp800-45.pdf).

 PGP Corporation recently hosted a Federal Roundtable held in Washington,
D.C. The panel included information security industry leaders, a number of
which have served in senior U.S. government Cybersecurity positions. Ted
Bridis, senior technology writer for the Associated Press moderated the
roundtable. Senior officials of the federal government, business leaders,
and members of the media attended.
