I just gave you a response, which you just deleted.   I may
not have given previous examples to you personally, but this
issue (bogus and misleading citations by Chomsky) has been
discussed on this list many times.

You did not ask for an analysis of Chomsky's views.  You 
asked for an example of Chomsky giving bogus citations.  I 
gave you some examples.  In your response, you will ignore 
those examples, and accuse me of misrepresenting Chomsky's 
views.

The fact that you are already preparing to change the subject 
shows that in your heart, you already knew that Chomsky's 
very impressive sounding citations were fictional.
