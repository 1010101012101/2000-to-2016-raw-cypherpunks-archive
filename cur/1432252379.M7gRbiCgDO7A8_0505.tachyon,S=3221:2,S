No.  If your anonymity set is small, then using the system calls
attention to you, and your adversary can simply attack all the users
with physical layer attacks (bugged keyboards, video cameras in
ceilings, tempest, etc.).  Further, if the user set is small you're
probably more concerned with unobservability than with unlinkability
or untracability.
