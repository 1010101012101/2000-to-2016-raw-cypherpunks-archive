The acceptable distance from a stable currency, as the concept of good
enough, depends again on what you are trying to achieve.

As a digital currency, and distributed system, Bitcoin is nothing less
than truly ingenious. I'm enthusiast about it.

However, Bitcoin it's neither local nor should be confused with a
system ready to be a sound alternative to the gold standard. And in
the debate was rised a question about the eventual effect of having
money backed by BTCs instead of gold. My argument stems from there.

Btw, there's a nice article published few weeks ago by Nathan Lewis on Forbes:
