The system as specified is harmless, because it can run anyone's 
code, and thus can run napster like applications (break once, copy 
everywhere.)  It also has many useful and valuable privacy
protecting applications.

However it is a system and set of institutions that can validate 
that properly authorized code is running, and thus with a 
relatively minor change can ensure that ONLY properly authorized 
code may be run -- (Hey, we will protect you from all viruses, and 
all poorly written code, and all code that facilitates anti social 
behavior.)

It is disturbingly similar to a system that is not harmless.
