More specifics on the sigint system:

This looks like a "Growth Industry" ...

Access to the beam is not restricted, anyone can pull signals out of
the reconaissance loop from any of its exposed vectors.***

Viable areas:
Terrestrial:
a: Spurrious emissions from tubes or conduit, beam deflection from
interior particles
b: Stray beams passing through field coils but not redirected
c: Direct access to tubes or conduit (any variety of methods)
Orbital:
d: Geo-Magnetic Shift (downlinks)
e: Refractive / deflection (downlinks)

As the rate of geo-magnetic shift continues to deform the containment
of the projected fields used to shape and steer the beams (which may
also have something to do with the sensor itself?), wider areas will
be accessible which are hit with the rogue spot beam from orbital (and
projected field electro-magnetic) guides.

This means almost anyone with a sensor can gather data from the downlinks.

Additionally, spurrious radiation from the terrestrial system is
available around endpoints and field coils, especially from damaged
conduit or particles in the tubes.

Time to raid the libraries for antique books about 1800s-1980s X-Ray
EM physics and electromagnetic wave guides!

It would not be rational to encode the carrier signal unless it was
certain that the encoding would not disrupt signals quality, however
raw X-Rated signals might have been too risky?

[There are Thz ring oscillators, detectors, and various photonic
rings, but properly implemented field-effect lenses, EM field vector
control circuitry and coils(/phased array) (abstract field
projection), and optimal tube design are all that should
theorhetically be needed once a rogue beam is identified. X-Ray
Materials and interference fields must be researched and made common
knowledge.]

Hopefully the data source is not too easily found and the dumps get
out, this is extremely relevant for "civil liberties", human rights,
and reconstructing your own personal history and records where your
data is otherwise mising.
