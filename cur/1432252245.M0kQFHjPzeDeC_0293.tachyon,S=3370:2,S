Maybe MS will implement something like the secure attention key in the old VAX
A1 VMM (Ctrl-Alt-Del already serves this purpose for logins) which gives you a
guaranteed non-spoofed interface to the kernel (see for example "A
Retrospective on the VAX VMM Security Kernel" by Karger et al for more
information on this).  They certainly have the VMS knowhow :-).
