DISCLAIMER: I don't follow the Snowden affair.

I don't believe your claim.

Why Merica wants Snowden if he can't hurt them?

Greenwald, et al appear to be on Merica's soil, so it is O(1)
the cops to silence them.

Merica wants no leaks, not a particular individual.

So Snowden went to Russia empty handed and Russia took him?

Appears to me Snowden still personally leaks enough from 
Russia to give merica troubles, no?
