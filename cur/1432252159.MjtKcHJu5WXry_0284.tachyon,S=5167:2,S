A state is a monopoly of legitimate force.  What makes a state a state is 
that the policeman can whack me, and I cannot whack the policeman.  This 
destroys and undermines law, it does not sustain law.

Only a few animals have such severe inequality of force, mostly less 
intelligent ones, (chickens, social insects), and humans have not had a 
pecking order this severe and extreme throughout most of our evolution.

What makes Gaza not an anarchy is that it has policemen, and these 
policemen answer to a single central authority.  It is not absence of laws 
that makes places anarchic, but absence of rulers.

"an organized system of corrupt thugs to whom we pay protection money in

government most importantly provides business with an institution upon 
which businesses may pass on risk (if necessary).

The businessman has no power.  The ruler has power.  So any risk will be 
passed in the other direction.

We are using the world anarchy to mean a system with no ruler, and seek an 
anarchy with laws and without rulers.  When you describe Russia and Gaza as 
anarchies, you are using the term to describe absence of laws, rather than 
absence of rulers.
