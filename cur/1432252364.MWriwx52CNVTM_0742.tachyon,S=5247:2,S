	Not really (and that's not "begging the question"). 

	Even if one assumes that the G8 reps from this country are directly appointed by elected officials (and it's not a bet I'd be willing to take), I'd bet that most of the others are not. 

	And the people who advise this Rep are even less accountable to the electorate.

	The system, at least the part that really bothers them, cannot be changed. 

	The laws of physics, as near a we can tell are, outside of a black hole, fairly impervious to change.
