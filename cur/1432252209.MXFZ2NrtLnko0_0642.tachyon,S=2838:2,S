Folks, the MSP has placed the following BE ON THE LOOK OUT BULLETIN (BOLO)
for a theft that occurred in New Jersey yesterday of a 45 foot
trailer/truck combo with hazardous chemicals inside:

Truck:  Freightliner, 2000,  license plate:  NJ  171469, Penske Leasing on
side of cab doors

Trailer:  45 foot, 1988, has name "Crew Rockland" on trailer and a trailer
number of 22A.  License plate NJ  T392VD

BTW warning was placed not to open up the trailer if found.

This is not meant to cause hysteria among us BUT again in our travels we
just might see that trailer somewhere!!!
