The Sopranos gets it right - the process is called "minimization", and is 
intended to limit the evidence collected to only that which discloses 
criminal activity - there are strict rules about how a conversation can be 
sampled, as the show portrayed.

But the agents don't need to follow the rules if they don't intend to ever 
use the proceeds of the tap in court, or disclose its existence.

Yes. There is a time limit for when they should be disclosed if they don't 
lead to a prosecution - that time limit can be extended by a judge, if the 
agents think they need more time to develop a case. I don't believe the 
(federal) law allows for taps to go undisclosed forever, but I believe it 
happens anyway. Since the undisclosed taps aren't likely to be the focus of 
litigation, there's no effective check on that practice.

Ask Randy Weaver's son, Sam. Whoops, he's dead, like his mom and their dog 
that barked at the secret police infiltrating their rural property.
