What's worse or funny (depending on your pov) is that some whacky 
fundamentalist groups have taken this to be the "mark of the beast", and 
go on about the "fact" that the optimum place for implant is in the hand 
or the eyebrow. 
Of course, exaggerated rumours about whole prison populations being 
under trial experiments and some rich folk doing this for their 
'protection' add to the hysteria.
