Nice!  I've been thinking I should move there for a while.  I also
heard that by 2006 London and all the major cities will have seemless
wifi coverage.  The reason Europe is on the ball with this is the EU
just passed five laws to deregulate emerging telecom companies so they
can compete with the monopolists.  

In the U.S., the monopolistic heavyweights are eating our lunch.
Telecom policy in the U.S. is warped by huge campaign contributions.
Consumers are getting butt reamed on high broadband costs, and
censorship is becoming a problem.

With this republican absolute "free market" philosophy, the U.S. is
going to end up eating it.  As soon as Europe is fully wired (and
unwired) I'll have one way plane ticket in hand.

That's okay- the antispammers are a bigger problem, and this needs to
be attacked first.  Europe is already a step ahead of the U.S. on
that.  I've got spamassassin to control spam.
