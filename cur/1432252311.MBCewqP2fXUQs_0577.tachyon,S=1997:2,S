Yes, of course putrescine is real. In fact, it has come up in some 
Cypherpunks list discussions from the Jim Bell case, as I recall. My 
organic chem friends in the 1970s routinely dealt with it.

In any case, widely discussed in various fora.

I don't why this has now come up here, or in fact who some of the 
posters now posting are, but the use of it in street disturbances is 
also not new.

Of course, my view is that any anti-capitalist protester who gases _me_ 
with putrescine needs to be killed. It's what guns are for.
