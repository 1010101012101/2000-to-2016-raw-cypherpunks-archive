You are referring to the value of Editors.  Yep, they have value.  Its

reputations.  Some will pay for reputable editors' filtering.  Its a
valid

Not quite, empirically speaking.  And mature P2P users simply obtain the
largest file that claims

posted link to that text, although I found the illustrations

So Bob either redistributes the decrypted bits, or cruises through
the analog hole.  Game over.  All your Valentis are belong to us.
