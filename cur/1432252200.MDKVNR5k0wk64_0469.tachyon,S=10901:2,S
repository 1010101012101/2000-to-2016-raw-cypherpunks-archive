Holy shit, Hettinga. Most of the time you make some sense. This ain't one of 
'em. So, in other words, if Salvador Allende is democractically elected in a 
foreign country, then it's OK for the US to send agents and train torturers 
and then assasinate their leader? This is a complete nonsequitur logically. 
The fact that "The Marxists would have killed even more" is irrelevant. As 
someone who seems to espouse a more or less deterministic viewpoint vis 
economics and crypto-anarchy, you yourself should support a notion of 
letting them figure things out on their own.

More than this, this is the exact thinking that has caused us all sorts of 
problem. The best (and most obvious) examples are Vietnam and China. Both of 
these countries repeatedly kicked our ass in several theaters and then went 
through a brief socliaist period. In both cases, socialism is practically 
gone. Had we instead been smart with Mao and China (who we sent the moron 
Ambassador Hurley to meet) and Ho Chi Min (who was actually our ally against 
the Japanese), might the excesses of, say, the cutlural revolution been 
nearly as bad? Would Mao have felt it necessary to try to move the 
industrial base to the countryside where things would be much less easily 
A-Bombed (As MacArthur recommended)? Obviously not. There probably would 
have been a cultural revolution/cleansing of some sort anyway, but this has 
always happened periodically in China, and Fa Lun Gong is merely another 
example.

In the end, China ended up being a major capitalist country, and our 
involvement against the Chicoms only slowed this process down. We're making 
a similar mistake in Iraq, and we New Yorkers will probably pay for it again 
(if Tyler Durden stops posting after WTC#2 comes tumbling down, you'll know 
what happened. I'll try to post one more time from under the rubble if I can 
sniff a WiFi hotspot.)
