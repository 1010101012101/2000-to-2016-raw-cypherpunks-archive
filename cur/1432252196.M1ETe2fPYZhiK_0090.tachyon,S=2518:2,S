Reminds me of my favorite billboard ever!

"Support Our Troops... At Home and Abroad"

http://www.nycpba.org/tadam/03/tadam-030428-billboard.html

| While the U.S. military is being asked to act more like police officers,
| collaring bank robbers and otherwise keeping the peace in Baghdad and
| other Iraqi locales, we police officers have to think and act more like
| the military as we continue to fight the war against terrorism. The bond
| between wearers of the uniform  both military and police  has never been
| stronger. This is why we launched this outdoor display advertising
| campaign.

And remember, you can't spell Troops without OOPS!
