Anyone have any idea how SPCS MSL codes are generated? I believe they're
essentially a hash of the phone's ESN, but I haven't been able to
determine exactly what algorithm they use. It would save me a lot of
time if I could figure out how they do it (this would be for legal
purposes; just need a timesaver).

Thanks.
