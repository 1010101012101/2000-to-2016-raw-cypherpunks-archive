STATE OF CONNETICUT REPORTED THE DISCOVERY OF A STRONTIUM-90 SOURCE

The item was found adjacent to a house in a wooded area in East Lyme,
CT. It was a cylinder measuring 6 inches in length and 2 inches in
diameter. The bottom of the cylinder had the following serial number:
M2477. It was a general licensed strontium-90 source. The source was
contained inside a metal box with a radioactive material symbol on the
outside. The State response personnel conducted a radiological survey.
The source read 250 millirem per hour on contact for gamma. The source
read 3.2 rem per hour on contact for beta. At 12 inches, the source
measured 5 millirem per hour. At one meter the source measured less than
1 millirem per hour. The State took the source to a secure locked
location for followup on Monday to try to determine the owner.
