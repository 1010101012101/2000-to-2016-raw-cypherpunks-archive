I'm not interested in trying to convince you or anyone else that it
happened. I am telling you why *I* am convinced. You can decide I'm stupid
if you like, just like I'll decide you're motivated by other reasons
besides just thinking there's a government/SJW conspiracy.

What I'm seeing here is hearsay.

Yep. Innocent until proven guilty only applies in court. For all others,
it's preponderance of evidence. You certainly don't seem to require any
evidence to believe his accusers are liars.

Lots of that going around... Ask Juan. It's one of his his specialties.

As I've said before, a large fraction of what we do is subjective and very
personal. And subject to a lot of passion. Nothing wrong with that.
