Blind humans aren't always good at recognizing screen images.

Neural networks are good at recognizing things.
Sometimes more precisely defined algorithms are good too.

Some examples of recognition systems - you can look in the archives
for pointers to the UCBerkeley "Naked People Finder",
which does a reasonably accurate job of distinguishing whether
pictures on the internet contain naked people.  The people who
did the research on that also designed the "Incredible Horse Finder",
which identifies horse pictures on the net.
I remember that those systems did a lot of modelling;
I don't remember if they also did neural nets or not.
If they wanted to describe shapes of dogs and cats and 
differentiate between them, it would be relatively doable.

There's also a company out there that does "passfaces" -
they pop up 9 pictures of people's faces, and you identify
which one is in the set that's you password-equivalent.
They do about 4 rounds of this, with random sets of faces;
it's closer to a PIN than a real passphrase in strength,
because they thought that was enough for their problem space.
An interesting aspect of it is that humans are very good at
recognizing faces, but not usually that good at describing them,
so it's hard to give somebody else your passface set.
				Thanks!
