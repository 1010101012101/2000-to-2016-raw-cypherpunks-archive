We have had a partial recount in certain selected districts.  This failed 
to change the  outcome.  So now Gore seeks a full recount.  If that fails 
to change the outcome, he will probably call for another selective 
recount.  If that fails to change the outcome, then another full recount 
with different rules for the chads.  If that fails to change the outcome ....

Since the result is smaller than the margin of error, if you keep doing it 
over and over and over and over with different rules each time, Gore is 
sure to get lucky sooner or later.  Then it will be a confrontation between 
the Florida executive, and the Florida judiciary.
