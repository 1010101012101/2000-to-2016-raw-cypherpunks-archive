I'm watching an ABC special on Gen. Groves, the builder of the Pentagon 
and manager/commander of the Manhattan Project.  (One of the first 
breaks from WTC-specific news, and even this is of course related to the 
events.)

Anyway, they just showed the papers that had J. Robert Oppenheimer on a 
list in May 1941 of those who were to be arrested by the FBI in the 
event that a "national emergency" was declared. As it happened, 
Oppenheimer was _not_ arrested, nor placed in concentration camps the 
way most Japanese- and (some) German-ancestry Americans were.

(They actually showed the papers authorizing the arrest, should an 
emergency be declared.)

But this shows that such lists have in fact existed. And that mere 
academic scientists were on such lists. Thought criminals, as they had 
no involvement in government agencies or the military.

We are now in a state of national emergency, declared by Bush yesterday.

Draw your own conclusions.
