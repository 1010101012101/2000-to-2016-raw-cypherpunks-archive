with the release of significant News regarding explosive
sales for the Company.  There will be huge volume and a
strong increase in price for several days.  The same
newsletters that profiled MCTR will begin coverage on

is highly advisable to take a position in VOLT as soon

As a provider of alternative energy and back-up power
systems, VOLT's assets jumped over 2,000% this year
to $5.8 Million along with solid net income versus a loss
in the previous year.  With these type of numbers and news
of contractual developments, we anticipate huge volume,
rapid analyst coverage, and broker participation.

The stock has built a solid base at its current level and
will start moving up immediately.  We think the stock can
easily reach $10.00 in less than a month.

Good luck and watch VOLT fly this week!
