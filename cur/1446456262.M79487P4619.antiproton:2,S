The theory, I thought, was a simple prediction market. Based on
actuarial statistics by Social Security, people usually have less than
a 1% chance of dying per year (Fidel Castro seems to have a 0%
chance), so guessing the right death year is pretty "lucky".

The person who guesses correctly would receive the pot of money.

The real problem is that the prediction market will be regulated out
of existence. You have any idea how regulated the resale of life
insurance contracts are?

That and, how do you trust the prediction market? It has to be a
company with a mailing address, otherwise one could just run away with
the money.

Personally, I believe a good prediction market would be one limited to
predicting deaths and the overthrow of governments.
