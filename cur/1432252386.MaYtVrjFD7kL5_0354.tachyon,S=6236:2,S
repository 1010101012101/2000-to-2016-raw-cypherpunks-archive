Yup. And we can make them better, more usable, etc.

Also, FBI has "over9000" BTC from SilkRoad bust. Enough to do whatever they 
want with this market. Who knows how that cash is going to be spent.

What kind of cost are you talking about. The cost of equipment and electricity 
to mine BTC/whateverCoin? Opportunity cost of some kind? Privacy cost (as in: 
"my address gets written into a public ledger")?

Also:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin

"Zerocoin is a proposed cryptocurrency that would be provably anonymous. It
 will employ cryptographic accumulators and digital commitments with zero-
 nowledge proofs to eliminate trackable linkage in a blockchain, which would
 make the currency anonymous and untraceable."

Yup.

Makes a lot of sense. Bitcoin is not anonymous, we already know that. It is 
pseudonymous at best.
