Subject: [Mac_crypto] "Security Update 2002-08-02 for OpenSSL, Sun RPC,
mod_ssl" does

**A verification of this security announcement mail fails**

The key is signed by Vinnie Moscaritolo - vinnie@vmeng.com which is a good
thing even if Vinnie is no longer at Apple ( which is a bad thing ), it is
also signed by someone who does not appear on any of the public keyservers
that I can find which is a bit disappointing.

Verified version is at the bottom.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Security Update 2002-08-02 is now available.  It contains fixes for
recent
vulnerabilities in:

    OpenSSL:  Fixes security vulnerabilities CAN-2002-0656,
CAN-2002-0657,
       CAN-2002-0655, and CAN-2002-0659.  Details are available via:
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html

    mod_ssl:  Fixes CAN-2002-0653, an off-by-one buffer overflow in the
       mod_ssl Apache module.  Details are available via:
       http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0653

    Sun RPC:  Fixes CAN-2002-039, a buffer overflow in the Sun RPC XDR
decoder.
       Details are available via:

http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=20823

client users
to apply this security update to their system.
