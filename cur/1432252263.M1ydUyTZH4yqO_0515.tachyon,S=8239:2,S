"high power corporate conflicts" include litigation, defense law firms 
and private investigators.

My theory is that the categories blend into each other. Former CIA, FBI, 
NSA, Homeland Security and law enforcement employees can immediately 
qualified for a private investigator license. They retain their 
government contacts. Do corporations, defense law firms and/or private 
investigators request NSA and/or Joint Threat Research Intelligence 
Group to place their targets on their watch lists? Free hacking and 
surveillance paid by taxpayers.

"Both the Obama and Bush administrations have refused to disclose the 
criteria for adding a name to one of its terrorist watch lists."

"It broadens the authority of government officials to “nominate” people 
to the watchlists based on what is vaguely described as “fragmentary 
information.”

Glenn Greenwald had promised to provide a list of names of people on 
National Counterterrorism Center's watch list. If my name was on the 
list, that would confirm my theory. Glenn Greenwald released numbers but 
not names. If names are ever released, I will provide an update:

"According a report by the Intercept, of the 680,000 people on the 
terrorist watchlist, the government classifies some 40 percent as having 
“no recognized terrorist group affiliation.” In other words, the federal 
government tracks some 280,000 people without any proven links to 
terrorism.

The government also keeps another database, and it takes even less 
suspicion to get a person place on it and under the gaze of federal 
snoops. According to the Intercept, most people on the watchlist start 
out on a classified list know as the Terrorist Identities Datamart 
Environment (TIDE).

The TIDE database actually allows for targeting people based on far less 
evidence than the already lax standards used for placing people on the 
watchlist. A more expansive—and invasive—database, TIDE’s information is 
shared across the U.S. intelligence community, as well as with commando 
units from the Special Operations Command and with domestic agencies 
such as the New York City Police Department.

According to the released documents, the feds monitor 320,000 additional 
people under the larger TIDE database. That puts the number of 
individuals on under the government microscope at over 1 million. The 
Intercept reports that as of the Summer of 2013, the watchlist included 
5,000 Americans, with another 15,800 targeted in TIDE."
