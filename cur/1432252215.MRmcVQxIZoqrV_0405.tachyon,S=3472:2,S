?

cyph relay CDR on Algebra.com has been sending null messages from owner-etc since Friday the 8th, 13:42 cst last coherent message.

Has there been failure/problems with the algebra.com server, or is there known reasons for these strange messages rather than the relay?

(I do not know the scope of this problem, nor if CDR admins are aware of the problem, hopefully so, if not, I have a nice log of 50 or so messages from the algebra.com server with null content and otherwise useless purpose :) )

(Since Algebra.com is sending out null messages, please respond directly)
