There's often "hand-waving" when reasoning about digital cash and how 
it is transferred, spent, redeemed, etc. Bell is not a cryptographer. 
Also, he didn't claim to have built a working system. (I think any of 
us could be called as witnesses to refute a state claim that he was 
deploying a real system!)

However, much of your reasoning below is _also_ hand-waving.

Fortunately, there's a way to cut through it. I'll cover this at the 
end, after your included section (which I would normally snip, but 
won't this time).

It's simple:

If payer-anonymity (payer is untraceable by the payee) and 
payee-anonymity (payee is untraceable by the payer) exists, then the 
buyers and sellers of some "thing" are untraceable to each other. 
Whether that "thing" is a piece of warez or a bet in a murder pool 
(cf. Jack London for a much earlier discussion that Bell's).

Arguing how complicated or confusing digital cash can be by citing a 
specific market like AP is what I mean by hand-waving.

If, for example, the Mojo Nation folks succeed in making "mojo" both 
payer-anonymous AND payee-anonymous, then all of the hand-waving 
above is beside the point.

RTFM.
