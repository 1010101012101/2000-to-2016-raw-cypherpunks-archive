other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

This deve|opment wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120

upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annua||y for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross

of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
