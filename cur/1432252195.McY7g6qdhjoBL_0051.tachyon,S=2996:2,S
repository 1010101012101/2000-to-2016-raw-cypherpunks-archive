Unless someone has come up with a new wrinkle to this since I last 
looked, the QKE system indeed requires three channels - the key photon 
one which must be optical, and a conventional comms pair (the latter of 
course can be substituted with any comms pair you have handy, but if you 
are running fibre from A to B you might as well run three)
As all three require MiTM to be mounted, it would be better to have a 
physically diverse path for the conventional pair - but in a small city 
where you are patching the optical channel though the nearest exchange, 
this may not be practicable.
The "regular encryption scheme" (last I looked at a QKE product) was XOR....
