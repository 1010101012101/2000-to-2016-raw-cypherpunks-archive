	It's not an objection to voting, it's an objection to 
manipulating the open and closing times of polls (in this case the 
closing time) to make it more convenient for a specific segment of 
the population.

	If I remember correctly, in Missouri Polls are open from 7 am 
to 7pm (though that could have changed), and IIRC it is mandatory for 
an employer to allow you time to vote.

	There is simply no reason for polls to have to be open longer 
than their allotted time, and specifically not just for specific 
sections of a state.

	If anything, it would make more sense to keep rural polls 
open longer, since they are often more difficult to get to.

	The thing is, voting should *not* be easy. It *should* 
require some effort (not a LOT of effort, but it should be 
non-trivial) so that only those who actually care to bother will.
