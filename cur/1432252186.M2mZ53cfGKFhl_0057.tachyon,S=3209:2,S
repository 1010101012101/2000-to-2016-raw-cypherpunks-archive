Hey, Protestantism gave us the "priesthood of all believers",
and if that's too much work, the ULC will ordain you for $20.
The Internet lets everybody be a journalist, or at least a political 
commentator.
Won't be a problem getting either of those jobs :-)
(However, as many people have discovered with acting or Internet startup,
getting a job in the field is easy, but getting a *paying* job is tougher...)
