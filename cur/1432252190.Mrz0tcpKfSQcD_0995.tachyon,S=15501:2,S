THE 7TH WORKSHOP ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC 2003)

University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

August 11, 12 & 13 2003

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT		      July 19, 2003

*********************************************************************
NOTES:

1) Please note that the deadline for registration is August 1.

2) The last lecture at ECC 2003 will end at 3:00 pm on Wednesday
   (Aug 13). This will give participants sufficient time to catch
   flights scheduled to leave Toronto after 7:00 pm. There are 
   hourly flights from Toronto to Ottawa for those who wish to 
   attend   SAC 2003.

3) If you would like to be removed from this mailing list please
   reply with a brief note. You will be immediately removed from
   the list.
*********************************************************************
*********************************************************************


ECC 2003 is the seventh in a series of annual workshops dedicated 
to the study of elliptic curve cryptography and related areas. 
The main themes of ECC 2003 will be:
- The discrete logarithm problem.
- Efficient parameter generation and point counting.  
- Provably secure cryptographic protocols. 
- Efficient software and hardware implementation. 
- Side-channel attacks.
- Deployment of elliptic curve cryptography.

It is hoped that the meeting will continue to encourage and 
stimulate further research on the security and implementation 
of elliptic curve cryptosystems and related areas, and encourage 
collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists and 
engineers in the academic, industry and government sectors.

Attendees of ECC 2003 might also wish to attend SAC 2003 
(Ottawa, Aug 14-15) and CRYPTO 2003 (Santa Barbara, Aug 17-21).
The last lecture at ECC 2003 will end at 3:00 pm on Wednesday 
(Aug 13). This will give participants sufficient time to catch 
flights scheduled to leave Toronto after 7:00 pm. There are hourly 
flights from Toronto to Ottawa.
