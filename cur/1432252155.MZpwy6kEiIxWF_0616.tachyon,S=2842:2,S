Actually, us old timers remember what it was like before google,
or even altavista (the first real search engine). Heck, some of us
remember what it was like before Usenet...

In the early days of the web, you would start from some site which
was vaguely associated with your topic, and follow links using a
hill-climbing search pattern. It was slow, and kind of hit-or-miss.
However, unlike today, many site maintainers really tried to maintain
up-to-date, useful, and annotated lists of links to related sites. Yahoo
started as just such a site, aglommerating link lists for many topics.
(The web was a lot smaller in those days).

Google is much goodness...
