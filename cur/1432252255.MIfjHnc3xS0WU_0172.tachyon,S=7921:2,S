Attempting to get this through. About half of the messages I have tried 
to send to lne.com have failed with this error, the same reported by 
others. Some of these I have resent, others I have just let sit in my 
error box.

I value lne.com a lot, but the various weirdnesses (e.g., 24 hours 
without any messages, then a burst of them, and these bounces) may cause 
me to switch to some other node.
