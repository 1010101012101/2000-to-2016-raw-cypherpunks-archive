Above is a declaration of war. Here's a modest counterproposal.

What do intelligence services fear most? Like cockroaches, 
they hate the light. Public scrutiny is their permethrin. 

So what we need is a hidden service (Tahoe LAFS as distributed
storage backend run by many volunteers world-wide) where annotated 
collection of personal information can be crowdsourced. You can 
start collecting license plates and match them to addresses and 
photos.

Let's doxx the spooks. All intelligence services, all countries.
Make sure to vet data against malicious contamination. Publish
them all, and let God sort them out.

P.S. If you intend to do it, make sure you never talk about it in
public. Just publish code anonymously, and invite collaborators
after a closed beta. Make it easy to use, make it secure. Good luck.
