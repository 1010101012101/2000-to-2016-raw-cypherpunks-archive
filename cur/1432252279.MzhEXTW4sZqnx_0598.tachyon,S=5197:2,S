And how do you fund all this, make it attain an economic life of its
own?

That's the big problem with all micropayment schemes. They sound good
until you try to work the business plan, then they prove themselves
impossible because it costs 2c to handle each penny. And more if
issues such as collections and enforcement (e.g., against frauds) is
taken into account.

This is why, for example, we have a postal system which manages
postage, rather than some scheme whereby every paper mail recipient
charges every paper mail sender etc etc etc.
