They've said they'll fall back on the traditional
"If we can't read the passport it's invalid and you'll need to
replace it before we'll let you leave the country" technique,
just as they often do with expired passports and sometimes
do with just-about-to-expire passports if you're a
Suspicious-Acting Person like Dave del Torto.

If you want to damage the RFID of a passport you're playing with,
microwave ovens should do just fine.
I don't know if Rivest's RFID-blocker chips use the same
frequency or codespace as the passport RFIDs,
but you could also leave one of them in the back of your passport.

I'd be surprised if you could put out enough energy to cook
the passport RFIDs of people walking by at normal speed
without also causing lots of other electrical problems.
