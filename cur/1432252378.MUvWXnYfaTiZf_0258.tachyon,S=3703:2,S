I am unfamiliar with the Extropian electronic token experiment, but I as
the first person on the planet to have conducted an Ecash-to-fiat
currency transaction, I can assure you that somebody out there may well
be willing to pay real cash for freely minted tokens. (I was on the
Ecash selling side. The USD 35 for which I sold my Ecash beta tokens are
still in my filing cabinet).
