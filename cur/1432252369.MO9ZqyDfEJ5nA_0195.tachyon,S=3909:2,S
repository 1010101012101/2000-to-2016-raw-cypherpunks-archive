I disagree.  We should all be ashamed.  The main reason we don't have the 
private payment system many have discussed is lazyness/"better things to do 
with their time" by those with the technical ability to create the SW (if I 
were one of them the SW would be done by now, as I've easily spent 1-2 many 
years and $10Ks trying to get others to write the code).  Funding the 
payment system, as Tim has noted, is not that hard.
