The DC Metro is one of the nicer subways systems in the country.
And for both NYC and DC, the subway definitely beats most other
transportation methods - neither city could support even the
parking needs for their residents or workers if everyone drove,
and busses aren't managed in a way that they could replace subways,
particularly because even with many more of them,
they'd be stuck in traffic that the subways can avoid.

Besides, especially in NYC, there are so many interesting people
that you encounter on the subways :-)
