Um, last I checked, phone cameras have really shitty resolution, usually
less than 320x200.  Even so, you'd need MUCH higher resolution, say
3-5Mpixels to be able to read text on a printout in a picture.

Add focus and aiming issues, and this just won't work unless you carry a
good camera into the booth with you.
