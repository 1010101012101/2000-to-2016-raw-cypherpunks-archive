Dear Mr. Choate,
	
	Please, oh please, actually read a little bit into that
wonderful process known as "the free market" and understand that the
very basic notion of the same is free consentual exchange between
two parties. If one is not free to deny service based on any grounds
(yes, as far as the free market is concerned, one should be well
free to deny services on the basis of race, gender, religion,
etc...)

You're wrong again Mr. Choate.

| A business can refuse to serve anyone they desire for any reason, but the

| free market that is universal in all human activity. Clearly this isn't
| possible operating under Tim and his supporters particular brand of 'free'
| which is nothing more than 'freedom for me, not for thee'. A business has
| the RESPONSIBILITY to refuse service to anyone which threatens that
| business' operations. They also have a responsibility to make that
| reaction as minimaly invasive as possible in all cases, no exceptions.

Mr. Choate, please do not use the good names of Mises and Hayek in
vain...if you are going to choose to sprout out ideas that you will
be attributing to Autrian Economists, please have the decency to
understand the works which you are allgedly writting about first.

| There is no "..., but..." in free market or American democracy.

There are always exceptions...for example, Mises and Hayek did not
subscribe to Democracy in the first place...and a free market, as
such can only exist when (yes, read the first paragraph again Mr.
Choate) consentual exchange occurs.

| [1] Never ascribe to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.

Never fear Mr. Choate, none of us have ever thought you were
malicious.
