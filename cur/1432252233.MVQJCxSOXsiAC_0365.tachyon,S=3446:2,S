Britain's Sunday Mirror newspaper quoted the 18-year old son of Osama bin
Laden as saying his father was hiding in a cave in the Afghan mountains
with 300 commandos and would never be caught. The Mirror quoted bin
Laden's son Abdullah, one of his 42 children, as saying his father had
disappeared with 60 trucks filled with satellite equipment on Sept. 11,
the day of the suicide hijack attacks on New York and Washington "America
and Britain will never track down my father," the son said in the
interview. "He has vanished into the landscape, he is invisible.

announcement was made through a bin Laden spokesman, the paper reported.
