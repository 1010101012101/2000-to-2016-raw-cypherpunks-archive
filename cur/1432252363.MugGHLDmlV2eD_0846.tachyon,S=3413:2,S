Actually this comment isn't about religions ---its about
what happens when a more aggressive culture meets
one less so.  The losers get to run casinos at best.

Guns germs & steel.  And suicide bombers.
A culture that has them has advantages over a risk-averse one.

My commentary also alluded to the demonization of the enemy,
done by the 'faithful' of both flavors.  I was sarcastic, ie expressing
author's disdain for this demonization.  This follows my
black humor, which is cynicism about the actual reality
of competing-civilizations (named by their dominant religion)
and the way they (ab)use their (young male) subscribers.

Thanks for the opportunity to clarify.
