What's the false positive rate?  It's one thing if you see some guy lighting a fuse sticking out of his shoe, and quite another if you say "You look kinda terroristy; I'm sending you off the plane."  This works as a reasonable strategy only if:

a.  The probability ratios don't work out so that the overwhelming majority of people you throw off planes are innocent.  (They almost certainly will, just because terrorists are so rare.)

b.  The terrorists can't figure out how to make themselves look less threatening.
