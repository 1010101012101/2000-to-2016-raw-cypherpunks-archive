http://www.spammimic.com/encode.cgi supposedly encodes your short
messages as imitation spam, postings designed to fail content filtering
& so (the author claims) bypass Echelon. Hmmm.  Whoever put the site up
doesn't seem to have a clear distinction between cryptography,
stenography & obfuscation.  Does everyone have to reinvent the wheel
every time? Are we going to go through it all *again* with mobile phone
text messages?

It seems to be a version of Peter Wayner's bumf generator from way back
when: http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/11.71.html#subj2 (Which has a very
funny bit in the style of a Neil Kinnock speech - maybe you have to be
in the Labour Party to get it...)

I don't think it is going to cause NSA any headaches. What chance do
they have of knowing about a method which has only been described in
Byte and on Risks? Presumably if you  identify a posting as having been
through Mimic & you can get enough text to recover the model you can
retrieve plaintext reasonably easily - so the secure use should be based
on ciphertext, not plaintext & perhaps would avoid using models freely
available on the web. (there was some discussion on similar stuff on
coderpunks & cypherpunks a few years back)
http://privacy.nb.ca/cryptography/archives/coderpunks/new/1998-03/0214.html 

But it generates mildly amusing  parodies of spam. Not as good as the
Neil Kinnock though.
