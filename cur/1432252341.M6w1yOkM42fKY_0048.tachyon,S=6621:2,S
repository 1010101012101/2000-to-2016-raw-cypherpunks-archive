No.  Would that chnge my assertion that he is "a freedom fighter"? Also
no.  His is fighting for the freedom of his peoples to follow the path
that THEY so choose (whether or not I find that path to be a personally
acceptable one is morally irrelevant).

As is George Bush and half the congresscritters.  As have been a great
number of supreme court "justices".  As are a very large number of
"minor" court "justices".  Painting your target with this brush does
nothing to forward your argument.

Along with the very considerable help of these United States of Fscist

We've never done anything like that now, have we?

Granted, we've gotten somewhat better in this respect, but then we've had
a longer period to try - and yet we are _still_ a helluva bad example
(using the rest of the "free world" as a backdrop).

And we send in armed police to attack when they see a ranch they might
like to own through a forfeiture setup.  Or when the "know" of men and men
"eating" behind closed doors, etc.

You are listing off a menu of items that we as a whole may consider to be
unacceptable, and then attempting to transfer this distaste to the target
of your disaffections.  This is both a normal and IMHO, acceptable
practice (seen as a simple promulgation of ones personal
opinions).  However, using this personal distate as an indicator that the
rest of the world somehow aggrees with you (apparently in direct
proportion to the level of distate expressed), is bogus.

> Oh, and last week they banned the Internet. 

At least they are being HONEST about it, no?  Here (USA) we are making
every attempt toeffectively implement the same policy, although via
different means ("chilling" such use with the arresting of victims by
your hated armed police, mock trials and very heavy sentences).

> Osama bin Laden, a perfect poster child for the cypherpunks

In very many ways, there is not a better example that could have been
picked.

Agreed.  Your picture is personal in the extreme, where as your tormentor
is looking in the global, and with smaller blinders.

May I suggest some light reading?  "The Clash Of Civilizations and the
Remaking Of World Order" by Samuel P. Huntington, $14.00 in trade
paperback, ISBN 0-684-84441-9

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
