Although some voters registered with minority parties do indeed cross lines 
and vote for the majority candidate they feel is the lesser of two evils, 
they are not the focus of my interest but rather what representation is 
afforded those that do vote with their registered parties.  In almost all 
other democracies independent voter turnouts in the magnitude of U.S. 
elections would guarantee at least one seat in a state (equivalent) or 
national assembly.  But in the U.S these voters are being denied 
effective  representation (and here 'effective' cannot be defined to mean 
the choice of the majority when voting is by district which eliminates any 
practical chance that a minority party candidate can be seated).

No, but voters should be able to withhold their tax money, where possible, 
until they do.  I think these disenfranchised voters would feel much less 
damaged if they weren't financially supporting a such an undemocratic system.

You are attempting to substitute an inherently winner-take-all contest for 
the legislative contests I have been discussing.  One has nothing to do 
with the other.

Its only 'wasted' because there is no chance that a majority in their 
voting district will also vote for the same candidate.

The manners for the selection of candidates under a proportional system are 
varied but well understood outside the U.S.  Perhaps these links might 
educate: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation  and 
http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/BeginnningReading/howprwor.htm

No, the reason the U.S. has a fixation on voting for one of two major 
parties is because of a lack of proportional representation like 
elsewhere.  I am certain you have the cause and effect interchanged.

I am not discussing presidential elections, this is another matter.

The part that isn't proportional has to do with the very establishment of 
'voting districts' within the states that are the key to the two major 
parties maintaining their electoral monopolies.
