It's not worth the effort. It's not worth the effort. It won't make a
damn bit of difference.

Oh, fuckit.

No.

Capitalism is a meritocracy. *Commerce* is simply a label for that class
of activities that include all forms of resource transfer from one
entity (person, company, nation, world) to another. Some of those are
meritocracies, such as capitalism. Others are not - true communism is
one example, almost any form of "planned economy", welfare. 

As for your definition of capitalism - lay the crack pipe *down*, and
slowly step away. Capitalism, pure and simple, is the idea that
competition and market forces will solve problems. Price of bread too
high? Someone will open a cheaper bakery. Too many bakeries for the
market? Those with the weakest support and poorest quality will fail.
That's all. Everything else is an add-on. It's a meritcracy because
emotion and sentiment are not supposed to enter into the equation -
either succeed or fail, based on how well you compete. Period. Reality
is not that simple, but then, reality seldom is.

Hello Mr. Pot, and how are you today? What's that? Who's black?

I'm beginning to think that Mr. Choate should never, ever, be allowed to
declare a discussion finished or claim to have the "last word".
