Actually, this is not true for the endoresement key, PUBEK/PRIVEK, which
is the "main" TPM key, the one which gets certified by the "TPM Entity".
That key is generated only once on a TPM, before ownership, and must
exist before anyone can take ownership.  For reference, see section 9.2,
"The first call to TPM_CreateEndorsementKeyPair generates the endorsement
key pair. After a successful completion of TPM_CreateEndorsementKeyPair
all subsequent calls return TCPA_FAIL."  Also section 9.2.1 shows that
no ownership proof is necessary for this step, which is because there is
no owner at that time.  Then look at section 5.11.1, on taking ownership:
"user must encrypt the values using the PUBEK."  So the PUBEK must exist
before anyone can take ownership.

I don't quite follow what you are proposing here, but by the time you
purchase a board with a TPM chip on it, it will have already generated
its PUBEK and had it certified.  So you should not be able to transfer
a credential of this type from one board to another one.

Actually I don't see a function that will let the owner wipe the PUBEK.
He can wipe the rest of the TPM but that field appears to be set once,
retained forever.

For example, section 8.10: "Clear is the process of returning the TPM to
factory defaults."  But a couple of paragraphs later: "All TPM volatile
and non-volatile data is set to default value except the endorsement
key pair."

So I don't think your fraud will work.  Users will not wipe their
endorsement keys, accidentally or otherwise.  If a chip is badly enough
damaged that the PUBEK is lost, you will need a hardware replacement,
as I read the spec.

Keep in mind that I only started learning this stuff a few weeks ago,
so I am not an expert, but this is how it looks to me.
