When "cell phones" get more programmable, and handle text, an interesting
"app" could be guerilla-net-like "routing".  If everyone's "phone" is
a RF repeater/router, its not impossible.

Battery life would probably be the worst impact.  A few airline bottles
of vodka will keep the fuel cells humming (for the future phone, I mean).

Lots of mil apps for fully distributed RF nets, too.
