PROVEN Work at Home System that GENERATES FREE LEADS! 

Hi, My name is Normie 

I am an ordinary woman living in the US who as learned how to make a 
living on the Internet working from home. I am willing to teach you to do 
the same, in simple easy to understand lessons so you can be successful 
to. I will work with you and teach you everything I know for FREE! This is 
an international business and everyone is welcome, it doesn't matter who 
you are or where you're from, anyone can do this.

You don't have to be a computer whiz or genius to learn to earn on the 
Internet. You just need a dream and be willing to give some time to 
learning and implementing the things I teach you. 

You won't GET RICH QUICK but you will be able to build a good solid 
income, an income that will depend solely on you and whether or not you 
are willing to learn. If you are willing to learn and want to get to know and 
work with a real person, then contact me. I am real and I promise to help 
you all that I can.

You are wondering why would I help you for Free? The company that I am 
affiliated with pay me commissions on what I do to promote their 
products/services. If I teach others to do the same they pay me 
commissions on how well you do at promoting their products/services also.

So my goal will be to teach you so well that you are making money and I 
am making money. I like it when the big boys pay me, and not the little guy 
like you and me. 

If you join me and my dedicated team I will even give you a fully working 
registered copy of Desktop Server 2000 & Atomic Harvester 3 ($500 
value). These two incredible programs have been solely responsible for all 
my success of the last few months.

I you are interested in learning more please send a blank E-Mail with “Tell 
Me More” in the subject line and mail it to walcott1968@yahoo.com

I look forward to hearing back from you soon and hopefully working closely 
with you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Normie M. Walcott
