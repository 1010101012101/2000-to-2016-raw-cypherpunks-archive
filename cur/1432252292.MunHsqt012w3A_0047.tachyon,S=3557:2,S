Oh, puh-leeeze! My argument is not a collectivist viewpoint.

It's just like any argument that drug laws are bad. (Being one of 
those who doesn't use drugs, and who never has, honest!, is any 
argument from me that drugs should not be illegal a "collectivist 
viewpoint"?) Ditto for thousands of other examples where the societal 
and legal and ethical implications dominate.
