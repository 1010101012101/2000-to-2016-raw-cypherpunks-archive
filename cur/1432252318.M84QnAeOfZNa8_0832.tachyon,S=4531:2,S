Right. See what I sent to Politech today:

Does Richard Clarke know what he's talking about?
http://www.politechbot.com/p-04403.html

More on Richard Clarke and root servers misstatement
http://www.politechbot.com/p-04405.html

Richard Clarke misstates Canadian elections cancelled?
http://www.politechbot.com/p-04404.html

Anyone think that Clarke is going to return my phone calls anytine soon?

It's human nature not to like criticism, and to shun (or, if sufficiently
annoying, to attack) your critics.

As another example, I got a call today from one of the popular Sunday
morning talk shows. They wanted my advice on whom to invite on. I
recommended someone, and they reminded me, "Um, didn't you watch the
program recently? Our host has been critical of that [person]. There's
no way we'll get someone from [that organization] on the program."

Sigh.
