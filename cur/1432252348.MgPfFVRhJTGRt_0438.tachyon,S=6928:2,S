Ok, we get the technology down to say $10k per bird. That would at least
be within the budget of most 'hobbyist' to come up with in a year.

Technology wise, I'm real keen on the Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyst engines, 
especially Platinum catalyst. Platinum is problematic, rare & expensive.
Say 1 out of 1,000 potential hobbyist can afford it. Hydrogen Peroxide
can at least theoretically be done in a garage lab, so we'll leave this
1-1 for now.

Miniaturize everything, since we've got chemical heat we can use Peltier's
to make power. Venting expanded gas is going to be problematic unless
we're symmetric. We could also use this same system for small orbital
corrections.

Whole thing will fit in 6in. OD pipe.

Simply outlaw any amateur rocketry, crack down on (like guns but w/o 2nd
Amendment protection) non-commercial industrial sales of machine tools,
etc.

All of the above, as well as things like Brilliant Pebbles or
laser/maser/micro-wave assaults. The USAF has had at least one successful
launch from a high altitude interceptor via missile, it was back in the
early/mid 80's (?: F-15).

Brilliant Pebbles. All the 'Brilliant' class weapons are space based (sort
of like 'Prarie' has to do with submarine ASW technology - eg Prarie
Masker, a bubble diffuser.) There's also one that is like a giant shotgun,
I don't remember it's designator :(

Who has the technology lead? Is the 'movement' organized or a bunch of
chickens with their heads cut off? I'd think the chickens would be very
hard to stop. The communications could be used to identify the others.

The reality is that an army of 10,000 well armed individuals acting upon a
common belief and with common goals, but acting completely independently
and unknown to each other, would be next to impossible to stop. Even if
the other army were 10 or more the size.

Yes, this sort of requirement pretty much limits it to either solids or
hybrids, and the occassional exotic (ie H2O2/Pt). Note that storage of
H2O2 reliably for more than a few weeks is probably prohibitive.

It depends on the 'splatter' of the entenna you were transmitting with. If
it has a lot of side lobes then probably. It would help to make it
digital, spread sprectrum, encrypted, and burst. You'll need lots of power
because the Can-Sat antenna can't be that big (it could be a long wire of
course).

How fast will it come down? What sort of warning window for the boys in
blue? How far are they from the recovery site? Is this a new event or
something they've seen before?
