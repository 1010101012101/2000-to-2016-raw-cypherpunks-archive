Hi y'all, time for a new update

The 0.4.2.6 release has a whole slew of bug fixes, reliability
improvements, and bundles Ragnarok's addressbook as a client
application.  The release is backwards compatible and should not
be too disruptive, so upgrade when you get the chance.

As mentioned in the weekly status notes [1], the addressbook
essentially just automates the anonymous fetching and merging of
hosts.txt files from locations of your choosing (defaults being
http://duck.i2p/hosts.txt and http://dev.i2p/i2p/hosts.txt).  More
details can be found on Ragnarok's site [2], and the source is in
cvs [3].

If you don't have the addressbook installed already, you have no
additional work to do.  However, if you previously installed the
addressbook and manually wired it to run in your router (through
the lines in clients.config and a reference to the .jar file in
wrapper.config), you will need to remove those.  Existing
addressbook configuration and data files will be honored if they
are located in the default addressbook/ directory.

[3] http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/apps/addressbook/

Anyway, thats that.  The full list of updates in the release can
be found in the usual place [4], and upgrading uses the same process
as before [5].
