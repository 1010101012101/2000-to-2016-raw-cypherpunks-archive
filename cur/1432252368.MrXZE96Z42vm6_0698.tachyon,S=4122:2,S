This looks very similar to the dLock device.
http://www.enovatek.com.tw/realtime-hd.htm

Perhaps they are using the same ASIC? If so, the product is pure crap.
Based on conversations that I had with the booth staff at the last RSA
conference, the dLock employs DES and 3DES in ECB mode. Meaning the
ciphertext on disk can be broken with the most trivial of cryptanalysis.
