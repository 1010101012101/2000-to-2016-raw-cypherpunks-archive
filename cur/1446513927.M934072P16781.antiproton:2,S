I don't think it was ordered by Facebook leadership or something like
that. The truth is that FB has pretty flawed mechanism of blocking, so
any page that received many abuses from FB users will be banned for some
time without any action from FB mods. Both pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian
pages were banned many times this way, including ones with verified
accounts. Here is some The Guardian report on blocking Russian
opposition activists and Ukrainian bloggers pages, for example
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/17/facebook-pro-kremlin-attacks-russia
So there is no conspiracy, just a lot of users abusing FB's abuse
mechanism and FB doing nothing with that.

But FB really censored an event page of opposition rally in Russia
following Russian request
