I was thinking more of the rumor that Longhorn's filesystem would start 
at '/', removing the 'X:' and the concept of separate drives (like unix 
has done for decades :) ).  When I first saw this discussed, the 
consensus was that it would break any application that expected to use 
'X:\PATH'-style filenames or chdrive() (or whatever that lib call to 
change the default drive is).  Someone suggested that MS might ship an 
emulator to handle translation (at some non-trivial cost in performance, 
else no one would have an incentive to refactor) until the vendors could 
rewrite their apps to use the new native filesystem.
