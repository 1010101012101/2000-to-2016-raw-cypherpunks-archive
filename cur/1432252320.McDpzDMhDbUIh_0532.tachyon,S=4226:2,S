Late reply I know.
But as I like to repeat, in the credit card world there's little or no
reference to meatspace per se. In the vast majority of card defaults no
real-world collateral is taken: It's more often than not written off, but
one's reputation is damaged for seven years. Commercial cards are the same,
even more so: They are 'uncollateralized' short term loans.

As the population increases and physical world collateral goes to zero, seems
to me the only thing many humans will "own" is their reputation: Their
physical world assets will be uninteresting or negligible. Is this the same
thing as anonymity?

Of course, many folks will have many reputations and will choose to burn one
every now and then to cash in or take a big risk. But even now it's possible
to detect when a reputation is about to blow and so any loans are quickly
ramped down.
