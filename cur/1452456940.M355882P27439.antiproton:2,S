Ofc, due to the Wapo's owner's BFF relationships with "Other Government
Agencies", what goes unstated is that the Zetas were/are the only major
drug gang in Mexico NOT AFFILIATED with the CIA.

The Gulf Cartel was also the beneficiary of the ATFE's "botched"
(sure...) 'Fast and Furious' gun-running "sting" where they gave
hundreds, if not thousands of military grade weapons to the CIA's drug
smuggling buds in Mexico and never bothered to track them... even if
they could.
