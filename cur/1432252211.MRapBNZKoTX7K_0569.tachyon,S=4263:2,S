As an example, consider the Richard Serra's 'Tilted Arc', a 12 foot
high, 120 foot long, 70 ton slab of rusty (and usually grafitti covered)
steel which blocked the entrance to the main Federal building in 
lower Manhatten for several years. After about a zillion complaints,
it was moved, and Serra sued the GSA for $30million, on the grounds
that the piece was "site specific", and that by moving it the GSA had
destroyed it.

I frequently walked by the Arc, and it was a powerful presence, but
once it ceased to be a suprise, it was mainly an irritating obstacle. 
One of Serra's arguments was that the Arc echoed the staircase 
of a courthouse across the street. I wonder if he'd have sued them 
for altering that building?

discusses the  'Visual Arts Rights Act of 1990, which is highly
relevant to this topic.
