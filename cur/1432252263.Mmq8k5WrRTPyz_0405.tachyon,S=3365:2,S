Interresting note. Did they deserve 9/11? If you go by "eye for an eye" 
then yes.

If you think that Ossama (if it was him) and his cronies are evil, then 
yes, they deserved it too (wasn't Jesus all about suffering for the 
greater good?).

If you think that nobody has the right to terrorism than they didn't. 
But neither did the Iraqis during the sanctions, nor the countless 
people who died in South America because the "good guys" were waging a 
war. Let's not even talk about all the things that were done by the 
"good guys" in Vietnam.
