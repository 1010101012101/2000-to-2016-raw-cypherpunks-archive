>>Mr Wobber and his group calculated that if there are 80,000
seconds in a day, a computational "price" of a 10-second levy
would mean spammers would only be able to send about 8,000
messages a day, at most. 

"Spammers are sending tens of millions of e-mails, so if they had
to do that with all the messages, they would have to invest
heavily in machines." <<


Replace "invest" with "trojan" and remind Mr. W. that he
works for the major facilitator of trojaned machines.
