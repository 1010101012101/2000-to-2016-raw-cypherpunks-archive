MA wiretapping law applies only to secret recording. In theory, holding
the thing in plain sight should be ok.

That's the written law. Case law might be different, and I might know it
if I were a Massachusetts lawyer, which I ain't. Also, as measl pointed

had a similar encounter which resulted in my equipment being smashed and
the pigs lying about it when I complained. I wasn't arrested in that
incident, though.)
