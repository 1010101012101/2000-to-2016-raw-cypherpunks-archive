Give me a large mining pool with a dedicated low-latency (worldwide)
network and I bet I can show a marginally higher rate of return (more
blocks) by running SPV mining software.

What's unknown is if the network + wrong-fork costs exceed the return
from being able to start mining a new block sooner or not.

This is a very small advantage with Bitcoin. 

But with any short-block coin (litecoin) or the 1-minute altcoins, seconds
(or maybe even milliseconds) matter. On the 1-minute alts you could have 
40% of the hashpower and probably get 60-80% of the blocks by starting 
mining earlier and then mining on top of blocks you just found.
