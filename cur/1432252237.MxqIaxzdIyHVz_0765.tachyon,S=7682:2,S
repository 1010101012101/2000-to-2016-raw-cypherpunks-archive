If so, and if "many have tried", then either:
they have not been systematic xor the passage is deeply in there.
The explorer's traversal rate constrains its depth.

He is risking that you have not put a tracer on him.  So he has a UV
lamp
and a geiger counter.  And carries a fully closed breathing system,
trails
brush behind him to conceal footsteps, etc.
And has sanitized the cave to a much larger depth than he uses.

Why is the film record assumed more reliable than your recollection?

The time it takes him to demonstrate it constrains the depth of the
solution.

Perhaps he will require you to dose yourself with a time-distorting
amnesic
(E.g., tequila :-) which will make others not believe you?

>Another way must be found.  The explorer tells you what to do.

Merely showing that something can be done (nukes, a blue LED,
public key crypto) motivates others to investigate more,
even without the ability to reverse engineer an instance.
Again, the time it takes for the explorer to solve it constrains
solutions.

As a counter to the "twin" deception, you give him a tamper-"proof"
sealed token which lets you know that its "him" that emerged.  This does
not
work if Paul Kocher is the explorer :-)

I don't see why it matters that the entry point is unknown to the
tester.

This would be rational (to you) even if the entry point is unknown AND
he never
calls off a test.

He would have to guess

Infinitismal for large versions of "dozens"

If the token is untampered with, ie no "identity" fraud.  How good
are the explorer's Flaps & Seals & Forgery friends?

Use a more believable RNG.  (Eg parity of hash of closing Dow Jones
price
that day, assuming you can't control this (without a lot of
collaborators),
and its publicly verifiable.)  Keep filming as you rush the tape to the
bar.
(If you have a good video processing lab, you might have faked all
outcomes
well in advance, however.  Are we assuming tape is always trustworthy?)

The "zero (public) knowledge" part seems to depend on the observer's
private (but publicly untrustable) generation of random choices.  Is
that the point?

>2. What counter-measures and conditions could the explorer have put in
>place to prevent you from getting a convincing tape in this manner?

He could generate counter-tapes which are also submitted to the bar,
reducing trust in your tapes.  The tequila he splashes you with also
helps
(the UFO abduction discrediting attack on credibility :-)
As does the sudden appearance of extra funds in your bank account.
(Humans reason about other humans motivations.)

Stimulating puzzle.

Of course, we only have to believe what we can verify (or we can
start a religion..), so if it is true in reality, others can verify it,
xor
it was a folie-a-deux, a commonplace phenomenon since the invention
of language.
