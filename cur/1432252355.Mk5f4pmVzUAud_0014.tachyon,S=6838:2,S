21 MILLION. What's that, 20% of the workforce?

>   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A closely divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled on
>   Tuesday that government whistle-blowers are not protected by free-speech
>   rights when they face employer discipline for trying to expose possible
>   misconduct at work.
>
>   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled against a California prosecutor who
>   said he was demoted, denied a promotion and transferred for trying to
>   expose a lie by a county sheriff's deputy in a search-warrant affidavit.
>
>   Adopting the position of the Los Angeles prosecutor's office and the 
>U.S.
>   Justice Department, the high court ruled that a public employee has no
>   First Amendment right in speech expressed as part of performing
>   job-required duties.
>
>   Writing for the court majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said there is
>   protection for whistle-blowers in federal and state laws and rules of
>   conduct for government attorneys.

>
>   The court's liberals, Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth

>   Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, dissented.
>
>   Stevens wrote, "The notion that there is a categorical difference 
>between
>   speaking as a citizen and speaking in the course of one's employment is
>   quite wrong." He called the majority ruling "misguided."

>   Souter wrote in a separate dissent that government employees who speak 
>out
>   about official wrongdoing should be eligible for First Amendment 
>protection
>   against reprisals.
