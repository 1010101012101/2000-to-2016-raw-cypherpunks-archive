Tor is not practically untraceable.  The Tor documentation asserts:

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination.

http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/design-paper/challenges.pdf

Use of a nym server is practically untraceable because of the high
random latency and mixing with other traffic provided by the
anonymizing remailers through which a nym server is controlled.
