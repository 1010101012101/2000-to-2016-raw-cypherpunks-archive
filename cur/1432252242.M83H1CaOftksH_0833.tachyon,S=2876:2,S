I refuse to be a property. Whoever handles me as such, gets open
disrespect and either my open refusal to obey, or, in compliance with
Czech national tradition, a hidden refusal to obey[1]. Unique concept of
sabotage by obedience.

This is enforceable only with purely money-based economy. But there are
activities that are done for non-monetary profit: knowledge, experience,
fun. Or plain barter. I remove a virus from your computer, you later drop
by to repair my TV; barter, no paper trail. Help me and I will help you
when you'll need. Instead of shelving out money for expensive courseware,
drop by and I'll explain you how TCP/IP works. Then do the same for me
with SQL couple weeks later. Skills and knowledge are a kind of capital
as well - the kind of ownership no IRS can audit you for.

Tax this. Regulate this. Good luck.
