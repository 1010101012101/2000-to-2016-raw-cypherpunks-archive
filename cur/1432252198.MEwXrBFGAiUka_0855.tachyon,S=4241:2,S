Right, the Microsoft operating system as host for virus
/ malware attack for stealing bank and payment systems
value has been going on for a couple of years or so
in a serious (industrial) way.

That sounds like a version of phishing, 'cept
for being 2 orders of magnitude too small.

Er, no, that doesn't sound like any finance system I
know.  See that post to the Register which I think RAH
forwarded, with 2000 in the class.  That's just this
week's news.

As per my observations, all FC systems bubble along
with something about 1% fraud plus/minus an order of
magnitude.  The credit card people currently report
about 0.1-0.2 % although I think that might be under-
reporting on their part.

Out of that, some people might get
recovered, but enough do not that we wouldn't be able
to push proposition b. with any strength.  We know for
example that even though the banks might recover any
direct losses, they won't accept liability for any
other costs including where their fault caused problems
elsewhere.
