Agreed that reduced-size images are desirable. One or more of
the mirrors are offering those, Parrhesia for example. We elected 
to initially offer the full size to not limit what can be offered by others
and to feed those with terabyte maws.

When image downloads jam shut Cryptome, which seems likely 
soon, we'll de-PATRIOT the bloat.

And if I was *nix-savvy what would I need this suck-palace for.
