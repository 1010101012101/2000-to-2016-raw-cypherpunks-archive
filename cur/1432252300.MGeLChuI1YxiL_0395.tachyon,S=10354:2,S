New Century Companies, Inc. Provides Update on Pending Merger

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- New Century Companies, Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: NCNY - news) announced additional details
regarding its pending merger with Smith West, Inc.  The merger
will further position the Company as a leading, vertically
integrated provider of machinery and cylindrical turbine parts
for the power generation, defense and aerospace engine
industries.

The US machine tool industry is an industry with annual sales in
excess of $30 billion.  Upon consummation of the merger, the
combined companies will have expected annual sales for 2002 in
excess of $50 million and an order backlog between $70 and $80
million.  Smith West is operating three state-of-the-art
facilities in excess of 32,000 square feet each and has such high
profile clientele as GE Aircraft and Gas Turbine Divisions and
Honeywell.  Moreover, New Century has been experiencing a recent
upsurge in new orders from defense and power industry companies,
adding to the significant synergies between these two companies.
 

"Our long standing relationship with Smith West, as a client of
ours, will enable us to quickly and efficiently integrate the two
companies," said David Duquette, CEO of New Century Companies,
Inc.  "This combination places us at the top of list for many new
defense and energy projects.  The defense and energy industries
have recently enjoyed the benefit of obtaining significant
government contracts and we are just starting to see that trickle
down into our businesses.  We strongly feel that we will continue
to see a material increase in our sales as these companies fully
ramp up to meet their commitments."
