NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
PETROLEUM AND PROJECT DIVISION
TEL: +234-1-4702516,FAX: +234-1-4400023
P.M.B 2071, LAGOS - NIGERIA.
28TH JUNE, 2002

DEAR SIR
This letter is not intended to cause any embarrassment in whatever form,
rather is compelled to contact your esteemed self, following the knowledge
of your high repute and trustworthiness. Firstly, I must solicit your
confidentiality, this is by the virtue of its' nature as being utterly
confidential and top secret though I know that a transaction of this
magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. A bold step taken shall not
be regretted I assure you.

I am Mr. Tony Okeke and I head a seven man tender board in charge of
contract awards and payment approvals, I came to know of you in search of
a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business
transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to foreign
account requiring maximum confidence. My colleagues and I are top
officials of the NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION {NNPC}. OUR DUTIES
INCLUDE VETTING, EVALUATION AND FORESEEING THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
REFINERIES IN ALL THE DESIGNATED OIL PIPELINES. We are therefore
soliciting for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the
said funds. Our country losses a lot of money everyday that is why the
international community is very careful and warning their citizens to be
careful but I tell you "A TRIAL WILL CONVINCE YOU".

The source of the fund is as follows; during the last military regime here
in Nigeria this committee awarded a contract of US$400million to a group
of five construction companies on behalf of the NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM
CORPORATION for the construction of the oil pipelines in Kaduna,
Port-Harcourt, Warri refineries. During this process my colleagues and I
deliberately inflated the total contract sum to the tune US$428million
with the intention of sharing the inflated sum of US$28. The government
has since approved the sum of US$428 for us as the contract sum, but since
the contract is only worth US$400million, the remaining US$28million is
what we intend to transfer to reliable and safe offshore account, we are
prohibited to operate foreign account in our names since we are still in
government. Thus, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our
name right now, I have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust by my
colleagues to look for an oversea partner into whose account we can
transfer the sum of US$28million.

My colleagues and I have decided that if you/your company can be the
beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your company will retain
20% of the total sum US$28million while 75% will be for us the officials
and remaining 5% will be used for offsetting all debts/expenses incurred
during this transaction.

We have decided that this transaction can only proceed under the following
conditions:
1. That you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality
and conviction of your transparent honesty.
2. That upon the receipt of the funds you will release the funds as
instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20%. Please
acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above telephone and fax
numbers. I will bring you into the nomenclature of this transaction when I
have heard from you.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we catching on the next
payment schedule for the financial quarter. Please be assured that this
transaction is 100% legal/risk free, only trust can make the reality of
this transaction.

Best Regards, 
MR. TONY OKEKE
