Well, walking around with an apparatus like that he's one step from being 
gay. We don't want his kind in our country. Thank goodness to the folks at 
homeland security for remembering Our Values, and taking the opportunity to 
enforce them at the borders.
Sincerely,
Tyler S Durden

>management can be long-term.
>On arrival in New York in August,
