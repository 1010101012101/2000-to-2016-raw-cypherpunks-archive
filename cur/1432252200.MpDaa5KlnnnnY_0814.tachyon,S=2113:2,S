I wouldn't want to live near a death camp, either, but that doesn't 
mean I would think designing better gas chambers is a noble or 
interesting thing to do (well, maybe for ten million or so statists and

Designing systems to thwart free speech is not noble, and not very 
interesting.

(Campaign finance laws are thwartings of free speech, clearly.)
