Go read the 12th. It all assumes the basic vote is valid. This is the same
mistake Declan made in his (typically) self-inflating way.

And then ask yourself, ok. Let's assume that the vote does go to the EC as
it stands. The people in general won't have any faith in the results. Now
Congress recognizes this and decides to step in per the 12th. Will this
resolve the issue? No. Most people are still going to see a bad election
followed by the people who managed the bad election (in principle if not
practice) making the choice. Another indication of 'vote value' or lack of
it.

However it goes, this one is going to wake some folks up.
