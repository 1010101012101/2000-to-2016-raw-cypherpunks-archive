There's a good article on software and hardware for reconfigurable computer
systems (e.g. FPGA's) in the June 2002 ACM Computing Surveys for people who are
interested in that sort of thing.  This is the sort of hardware which is often
used for crypto when a full ASIC isn't economically viable (one of those
combined PPC+FPGA cores would be quite interesting for crypto use).
