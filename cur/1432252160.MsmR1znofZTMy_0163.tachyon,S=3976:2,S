This case seems to be of value to the list. Ex-CIA Officer John Kiriakou
on Tuesday pleaded guilty to disclosing the name of a CIA figure to
former ABC News journalist Matthew Cole. The indictment against
Kiraiakou released in April indicated that Federal authorities had
obtained emails between Kiriakou and three journalists including Cole
and another ABC News journalist along with Scott Shane of The New York
Times. The indictment also indicates that authorities intercepted a
subsequent email by Cole (with information from Kiriakou) to a defense
investigator with attorneys for terror suspects being held in
Guantanamo.

No case better underscores the need for U.S. journalists covering
national security to start practicing digital security. More information
may or may not become available. I'd welcome any thoughts here. Thank
you. Frank
