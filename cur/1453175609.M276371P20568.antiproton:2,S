Absolutely. It's a shitty situation for some counterintelligence folks
since it boils down to something that only hurts their Intel Community and
helps the opposition but there's nothing inherently wrong/bad with the
effort and the people behind it might not even be indirectly sponsored by a
foreign intelligence service.

I personally think that in most cases it's better to make a difference from
inside than outside. There are exceptions and situations where that's
impossible, of course, and sometimes an external shock to the system is
necessary to instigate change... but it's always uncontrolled. I want
people to stick around to fix things, not exit and point out the problems.
That's a very personal choice with a lot of variables though, so I respect
people that come to a different conclusion.

If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,

100% agree, with the additional thought that the exit interviews should try
to find a way to 1. solve the problem and 2. hopefully retain the employee.

Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)

And now we get into the CI nightmare again. It can be a ripe field for
recruiting, theoretically. At least one study (I think more, but can't be
sure off the top of my head) has shown that for people who were current and
active personnel at the time, ideology played a relatively low motivation
in betrayals and leaks (to the press or foreign agencies). Usually it's
money or revenge, both of which could certainly play a role for people
exiting the service.
