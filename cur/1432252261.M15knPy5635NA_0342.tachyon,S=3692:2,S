Or, slightly more complicated and much more flexible, tunnel a port on
the local machine to a public proxy (or one that you're running
yourself) outside the firewall, then direct your browser to use that
port as its proxy.

Of course, the best way of getting around the firewall problem is to
tunnel a PPP session over SSH and give youself an entirely new network
interface that acts like it's outside the firewall.  With *IX, this is
a trivial application of PPPd.  Surprisingly enugh, the AOL client is
the easiest and cheapest way I've found to do this in Windows.
