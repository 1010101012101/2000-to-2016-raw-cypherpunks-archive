If getting the design "eventually" were good enough, why the keen interest 
in putting in a large order for the beta? There's a reason. 

Maybe in the long run, it's right to view any objections as being little 
more than irrelevant, moralistic hand-waving. But I don't find the "they're 
going to compromise it anyway so why not make a buck when we can" line of 
reasoning particularly satisfying.

Do you?

You call that pontificating? My saying "Either way, the prospects 
for "dissident-grade untraceability" are fairly bleak" is either 
interesting enough to address, or it isn't (for whatever reason.) Going for 
the gratuitous ad-hominem regarding whatever queer notions you happen to 
have about what I know or don't know is quite beneath you.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you a thing about the centrality of a secure 
implementation. Likewise, I'm sure you know that being a "formidable 
challenge" never prevented anything from being broken before, and it never 
will. 

All place-in-the-pecking-order issues aside, roughly how long do you think 
it's going to take before "dissident-grade untraceability" becomes a 
reality?  If anyone deigns to show me why the prospects are better 
than "bleak", I'd love to be proven wrong.
