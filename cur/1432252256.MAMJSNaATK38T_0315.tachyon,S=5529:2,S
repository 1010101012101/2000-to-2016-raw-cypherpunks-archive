Trying to get a large group of any profession to do one thing is next to
impossible.

I can see what this is going to do to third party due dilligance.

Say you have a company that wants to use product X.  But the lawyers set
in and say "prove it is reasonably secure" as a CYA measure.

There are many cases where you do not want to give the company advanced
warning that you are doing this, otherwise they may try and skew the
results.  (Making "special" versions that don't work the same as the
normal one. Taking out especially dangerous features.)

BTW, this is *not* a hypothetical example.

I worked on a project under contract to break a security method used by an
e-commerce system.

When the company found out what we discovered, they were very pissed off.
If we had not had one of the bigger computer companies backing us up on
the project, they would have probably sent lawyers after us.  (At some
point, the information will get out.  The details of snake-oilness are
pretty funny, in a sad sick way.)

The security industry is going to be seriously burned by this.

If I were to get a group of people together, it would be the security
profesionals. I would have them boycott the US Govenment and any of the
supporters of the DMCA.  Just refuse to do work for them and explain why.
(Something like "If I do my job, you might decide to put me in jail on a
whim".)
