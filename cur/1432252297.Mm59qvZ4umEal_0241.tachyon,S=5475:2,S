Indeed. We used to have the reasonable expectation that nearly 
everyone on the list had some familiarity with the "classics." For 
example, Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom," Hazlitt's "Economics in 
One Lesson," Hayek's "The Road to Serfdom," Vinge's "True Names," 
Card's "Ender's Game," Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," Brunner's "Shockwave 
Rider," and maybe even some of the writings of Spooner, Benson, Von 
Mises, Tannehill, Hospers, and Rothbard. These works helped to 
establish a common vocabulary, a common set of core concepts.

Not that everyone was a libertarian, let alone a Libertarian. But the 
core concepts were known, and those who didn't know about them were 
motivated to go off and look them up. We had fewer folks arguing for 
socialism in those days.

Today, it's like, whoa, dude, like the insurance companies are, like, 
big meanies and they, like, have lots of money and so they should, 
like, be forced to help the little guys. And besides, like, socialism 
was never really given a good test. I mean, like, the stuff they're 
doing in Cuba is really rad. Like, they're _spanking_ private 
corporations!

Of the half dozen or so clueless ranter who have appeared recently to 
argue that corporations are the real enemy, that government is just 
trying to do its job, that all crypto is broken anyway so why 
bother?, that free markets can't possibly work, and that crypto is 
for helping to force insurance companies to help the little guy, most 
of them are a waste of skin.
