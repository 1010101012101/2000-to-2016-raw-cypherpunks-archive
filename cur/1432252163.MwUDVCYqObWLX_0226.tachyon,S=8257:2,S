Nortel Networks, Cambridge Positioning Systems Plan to Develop Location
Technology 

BARCELONA, Spain - Nortel Networks* [NYSE/TSE: NT] and Cambridge
Positioning Systems (CPS) have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop
Location Technology for 3G (UMTS) wireless networks. 

The resulting products, to be developed once the parties successfully
negotiate a final license agreement, will provide location-based, value-added
services for 3G network operators. 

CPS will develop Location Technology based on the Observed Time
Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) standard. This is an extension of its success
in promoting the 2G equivalent - Enhanced Observed Time Difference
(E-OTD). 

Nortel Networks will integrate and market CPS products into its e-mobility*
Location Center, part of an end-to-end solution for Wireless Internet. Nortel
Networks believes that OTDOA will become a powerful location method that
will have minimal cost impact on both handsets and infrastructure. 
Nortel Networks e-mobility Location Center is a pivotal component in the
next generation Wireless Internet. The e-mobility Location Center is the
intelligent hub/gateway between a suite of location determination
technologies and mobility applications and services. Nortel Networks
strategy is to pursue an open standard and standards compliant universal
platform that will enable integration of best-in-class location determination
technologies. This will allow Nortel Networks to provide a fully tested and
integrated, carrier grade, end-to-end solution for location determination,
management and interface into value-added applications and services.


In a recent study, the Strategis Group projected a mobile location market
estimated at more than US$30 billion in 2005. 

"We are driving the evolution of a profitable, new high-performance Internet,"
said Alastair Westgarth, vice president, Wireless Internet, Nortel Networks.
"With this effort, CPS and Nortel Networks will be able to provide consumers
and businesses with speedy downloads of location-based services on mobile
devices, whether they be mobile phones, handheld devices or laptop
computers." 

"This letter of intent today builds on the work in 2G that we have been
concluding with Nortel Networks," said Chris Wade, chief executive officer,
Cambridge Positioning Systems. "We believe that location enablement will
be a fundamental technology platform for 3G networks." 

Cambridge Positioning Systems Limited (CPS) is a company focusing on
the provision of Mobile Location systems and services for mobile phone
users. CPS has two product streams to its business: its high accuracy
location technology called Cursor and a wide range of location-based
applications for corporate and consumer use called Coverge. Visit us at
