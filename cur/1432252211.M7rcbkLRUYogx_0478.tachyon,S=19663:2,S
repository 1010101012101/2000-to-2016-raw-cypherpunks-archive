i dont remember ever a journalist putting themselves in a shot like that

i dont see how jeremy's head in that shot gives ANY context that brings it
out of the abstract cerebral place - that it isnt actually in in the first
place - dead bodies in mogadishu or the moon are not abstract or just
floaty... not in my head at least not in my gut either or my big toe

jeremy is from wisconsin i think is that what you think brings context?

please you will have to bring more to the table than that... i am not
swallowing

listen i am all for showing a lot of stuff truelly really i am... but if
you are on the ground as a journo you run across things that are just not
ok to even film - its just like that

i have other things as i originally posted that make all of this much worse
for me > jeremy attacked mona eltahawy on twitter over her media 'junkets'
in new york regarding the revolution in egypt he was really fucked up in
doing it and i was like after that questioning his ethics then i saw this
scene and i was like wtf

i do not think he is ethical and for other reasons as well so... things
pile up ya know and then you have to acknowledge them or you are a part of
it in a way
