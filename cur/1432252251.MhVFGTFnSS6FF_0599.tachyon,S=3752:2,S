Nope, only to the support of those who advocate it, just like I support
your right to free speech. I daresay you're much more dangerous to children
than any NAMBLA member could ever be. All they want is a childs body. You
want to destroy their soul.

I support the right of people to post recipes for stir-fried cat on their
web pages. It's disgusting, but it's their right. If they tried ACTING on
such impulses, of course, they'd discover why we have a SECOND amendment...
