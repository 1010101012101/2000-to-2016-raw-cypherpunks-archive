Quoted by Declan McCullagh:

:>This week's "Give Me A Break!" is about Montgomery County's new ban on
:>smoking in your own home if it bothers a neighbor.  It's not surprising
:>that Montgomery County is the first to do this; it is right next to
:>Washington D.C., where politicians are famous for running other people's
:>lives.
------------------


This past Sunday, George Will was on one of those morning shows like "Meet
the Press", where he referred to the Taliban "Ministry for the Suppression
of Vice and the Promotion of Virtue". Then he announced that there is a
'Taliban' operating right there in his own Montgomery County where he
lives - and related the story above, about the smoking ban.  He then
expressed the wish that when the U.S. Armed Forces are done in Afghanistan,
they would come over and deal with the locals in his county.  What will it
be next, he queried:  barbecue smoke (and other similar examples)?  Cokie
Roberts laughed and said, well,you can always vote against it.

(but if the majority votes for it . . .)
