Um, Tim, I was talking about silver-halogen photographic 'films'.


You do raise the question of what happens to 100-atom thick gate oxides...
but that's not what *I* was writing about.

Radiation can also change the color of gems --used to 'cheat' and make
them more valuable--- but probably not a lot of diamonds go through the USPO,
and I don't know what dosage is necessary to introduce the appropriate defect
density.
