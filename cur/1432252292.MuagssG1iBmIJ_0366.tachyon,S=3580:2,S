One of the recent worms did exactly this.  I can't remember which one,
but it also set the From_ line to _victim@host.com, i.e.  it added a
leading '_' character.  I'm still getting them (but on linux
they don't do anything).

This is the same worm that installed a keyboard sniffer.  The
log was emailed to an account somewhere and of course that account
was quickly shut down.

The worm author should have encrypted the logs and posted
them to alt.anonymous.messages or some other newsfroup instead.
That would have been truly dangerous, especially if the worm
was stealthy.

It's properly called the Email Worm Author's Toolkit.
