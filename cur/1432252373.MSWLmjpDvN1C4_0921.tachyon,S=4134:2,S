Cordian correctly points out that merely XORing with a random bit gives 
the same statistics as the random bit(s).

Now that I think about it, I recollect the proposal was something along 
these lines:

Alice is confronted with a question with a yes or no answer. She flips 
a coin. If the outcome is "H," she answers the question honestly. If 
the outcome is "T," she then flips another coin and gives that outcome 
as her answer.

Half the population of pollees is ostensibly answering honestly, the 
other half is randomizing. No particular person can be linked to an 
answer.

More sophisticated versions, as I recall, had more complicated series 
of coin tosses (to reduce "noise").
