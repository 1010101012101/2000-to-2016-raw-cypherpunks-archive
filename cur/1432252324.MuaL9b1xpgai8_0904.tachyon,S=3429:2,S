The code running in the trusted sandbox isn't magic, so if it's complex
enough there will be vulnerabilities (not a problem in theory, but in
practice).

My thought is, can cryptosystems be broken? Not by 31337 h4x0rs, obviously.

Not you -- somebody else. Generated on board, probably, or generated
externally, and loaded into the hardware.

So far, so good.

If you mean by good tools 100 k$ worth of hardware (and a skilled operator)
to read out the state of bits on die, after etching away the enclosing,
you're correct.

Why do you think a system designed to contain and keep a secret will contain
a convenient backdoor?
