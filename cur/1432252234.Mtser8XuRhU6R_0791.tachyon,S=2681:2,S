#    He's getting better. Jim's posts used to consist of a cryptic 
#    subject line, the URL, and the entire HTML page (sometimes 10's 
#    of kb) included as an attachment.
#    
#    Just a cryptic subject line and a URL are a big improvement. 
#    It's my hope that one day he'll also add a descriptive line or 
#    two to his posts, so we can decide whether to check the full 
#    article.

Yeah, he over-compensated in response to complaints.

So now he's got a signature several times larger than his content.

If only the weirdo would put a single paragraph blurb with the URL,
and bunch them up into one post once a day. Like Declan & Politech.

Right now he's like a kid with an impulsive urge he can't control.

I wonder if he wets his chair anytime he feels like it too.
