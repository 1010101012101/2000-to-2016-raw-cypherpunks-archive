David,

You have a simple view of China-Taiwan relations, but you are more of a
computer specialist than an Asia one, so your deficiency is quite
forgivable.

I recently heard a story about policeman in Taiwan who is close to
retiring. When he was asked what he planned to do when he retires, he
said that he wanted to go back to the Mainland. 

To the outsider, this would seem strange, but it would be hard to believe 
that Taiwan and China do not have a workable and effective MO.

Someone who responded to your post stated that it is far more likely that
China would be the aggressor in a cross-strait spat. Now, where the
Taiwan-China working MO might break down would be when individuals
act. In a way, hacking is the attack of the powerless: it allows geeks
like us to launch an assault when we cannot afford tactical weapons. So it
is wrong to think that angry Taiwanese would hesitate from waving the red
in front of the bull.

As you state, there is no cyberterror treaty governing how information
regarding attacks is treated. Many of us take for granted that other
informal arrangements govern how this information is treated. 

The questions you ask are valid. Indeed, they are some of the reasons why
this listserve exists. You are asking core questions as to how we
should treat state activity and personal responsibility. When you find the
answers, let me know ; )
