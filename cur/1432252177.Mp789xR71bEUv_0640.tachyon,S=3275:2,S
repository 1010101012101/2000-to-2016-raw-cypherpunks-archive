In the much translated classic,"The 7 willows of Pissdom,"proffr of Arabia 
describes the crossing of the boofhead desert,the rear assault on crapaba 
and his capture by a Berkish May.After torture's indescribable including 
listening to the cenobite,el proff fools the pontius warthog into releasing 
him.From then on el proff takes no prisoners.His temper not improved by the 
loss of 2 faithful companions,el proff blows up trains containing Berks and 
slaughters all the occupants.
A straggling column of Berks and aryan supremeists also gets wiped out.When 
the cypherpunk tribes finally reach damesrus,they devolve into squabbling 
trolls before looting the casinos and returning home.Proffr1 takes up 
motorbike riding even starting his own outlaw club.The road warriors.It is 
truly written.
"My cause will continue after my death," Mir quoted proffr1 as saying. 
"They think they will solve this problem by killing me. It's not easy to 
solve this problem. This war has been spread all over the world."
