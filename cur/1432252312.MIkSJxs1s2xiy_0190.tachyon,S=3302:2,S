    I'm being obtuse? Give me a break. I clearly said that "I think that's the
only way gov't ought to be allowed to fund itself, is by selling lottery
tickets." 
    I can't imagine how anyone could read that and think that I was talking
about the situation we live in today. Who cares if gambling is illegal  
today? WTF does that have to do with anything -- I was clearly talking about
some hypothetical future scenario, as in a vastly reduced government where
lotteries were what they used for funding instead of taxes.
