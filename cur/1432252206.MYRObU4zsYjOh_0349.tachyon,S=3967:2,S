I believe it was the McClure-Volkmer Amendment (or somesuch spelling) 
of some years back that clarified the laws regarding interstate 
transport of firearms. Instead of having to know the details of every 
single state one might be driving through on a trip, one was exempted 
from the local firearms laws while the guns were locked up in a trunk 
or suitable lockable container. This was hailed at the time as a major 
step towards stopping one state from busting those from North Carolina, 
say, when they passed through Maryland on their way to a hunting trip 
in Maine.

The reasonable interpretation of McClure-Volkmer would have protected 
someone while in  their vehicle, and probably while at a motel in some 
state, but would not have protected those staying for more than what a 
simple trip would take.

I'm not surprised to hear that some jurisdictions think they can exempt 
themselves, especially for such trivial paper violations as having a 
shotgun shell.

Mexico is like this, too. Gringos have spent time in Mexican jails 
because they neglected to thoroughly inspect every square inch of their 
vehicles, and the shakedownistas found a .22 cartridge under the floor 
mats. (The intent was probably to collect $100 mordita.) All this while 
drug operations run more or less without interruption and as they are 
equipped with fully-automatic HKs and FALs, the Army-issue rifles. So 
they bust a tourist for having a .22 cartridge while MP-5s and Uzis 
abound. Typical government.)

As for Bill's point about a gas can strapped to the roof, this is a 
common way of carrying extra fuel, and is generally legal if the can is 
DOT approved (the red ones). LandCruisers and suchlike are often seen 
this way. As noted, safer than carrying them inside.

Of course, normal rights and liberties are dispensed with when mere 
suspicion of planning to use the gas is involved.

I'll bet this all gets kicked, unless an Arab was in the vehicle.
