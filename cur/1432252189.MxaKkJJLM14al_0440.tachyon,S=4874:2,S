Why is it "nice"?

This may or may not have been what Jeff believed, or wanted to believe, 
or told you was the case, but I don't buy that this is their business 
model.. Their Web site is filled with stuff about how "Save" menus are 
subverted, so as to, they claim, make it impossible for copies to be 
saved, blah blah. This hardly fits with your view of a bunch of benign 
little bears all sitting around cooperating.

Further, the site natters about how Omnivora will support government 
requirements about unauthorized persons seeing mail (how? how will even 
their crude expiry approach stop unauthorized viewings of mail?).

This is again inconsistent with the picture of friendly little bears 
all cooperating. Friendly little bears don't need to have their "Save 
As" buttons elided (not that this will stop screen grabs and photos, as 
I mentioned). Nor would friendly little cooperating bears show their 
messages to "unauthorized viewers," now would they?

(Speculatively, I would not be even slightly surprised if Omnivora is 
doing more than just nominally erasing some messages. To wit, storing 
copies for later examination by Authorities with Ministerial Warrants. 
As Jeff Ubois no longer seems to be attached to Omnivora, perhaps his 
vision was rejected.)

Something called "Ryze" and something else called "Minciu Sodas."

"Minciu Sodas is an open laboratory            for serving and 
organizing  independent  thinkers.      We bring   together    our  
individual projects      around shared  endeavors.      We remake our   
lives and our world by  caring about thinking.

"Minciu Sodas helps        your enterprise work openly to integrate  
constructive   people      around      your purposes."

Plus several other "advisory panels" and "boards" of, as you put it, 
"squishy" topics.

But not as bad as the squishiness poor Max has gotten himself into, 
granted. There's a whole subculture of bottom feeders who think high 
tech needs some new version of Werner Erhard (originally born Nathan 
Goldfarb, or somesuch...there was a Jew with major self-doubt).
