That's also my assessment. Gulen had the misfortune to know a RAND
analyst who was CIA and later vouched for him when his visa was
threatened. But he's no Dalai Lama or the guy who defected from the
Libyan army then spent 30 years living in Vienna Va before the CIA
tapped him to lead the nascent groups that killed gadaffi, or a Manny
Noriega. The fact that his visa was threatened says he's involuntary...
Also note no one was saying he'd be invited to the coup party...

MOST writeups claim he's a moderate Sufi with minor mystical tendencies.
I think he's rather stay in Pa.
