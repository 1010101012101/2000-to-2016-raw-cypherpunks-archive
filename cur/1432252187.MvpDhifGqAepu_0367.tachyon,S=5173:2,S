 Riiiight.... Sigh.

 Weirdly, I saw my friend Bernard yesterday, and he handed me
 what now is probably one of the only copper Ron Paul dollars. I
 have now admitted to owning it, too, so I guess I can expect the
 Feds shortly...They've already stolen 400 of them from me via
 this illegal action. :(

 Dear Liberty Dollar Supporters:

 I sincerely regret to inform you that about 8:00 this morning a dozen
 FBI and Secret Service agents raided the Liberty Dollar office in
 Evansville.

 For approximately six hours they took all the gold, all the silver, all
 the platinum and almost two tons of Ron Paul Dollars that where just
 delivered last Friday. They also took all the files, all the computers
 and froze our bank accounts.

 We have no money. We have no products. We have no records to even know
 what was ordered or what you are owed. We have nothing but the will to
 push forward and overcome this massive assault on our liberty and our
 right to have real money as defined by the US Constitution. We should
 not to be defrauded by the fake government money.

 But to make matters worse, all the gold and silver that backs up the
 paper certificates and digital currency held in the vault at Sunshine
 Mint has also been confiscated. Even the dies for mint the Gold and
 Silver Libertys have been taken.

 This in spite of the fact that Edmond C. Moy, the Director of the Mint,
 acknowledged in a letter to a US Senator that the paper certificates did
 not violate Section 486 and were not illegal. But the FBI and Services
 took all the paper currency too.

 The possibility of such action was the reason the Liberty Dollar was
 designed so that the vast majority of the money was in specie form and
 in the people's hands. Of the $20 million Liberty Dollars, only about a
 million is in paper or digital form.

 I regret that if you are due an order. It may be some time until it will
 be filled... if ever... it now all depends on our actions.

 Everyone who has an unfulfilled order or has digital or paper currency
 should band together for a class action suit and demand redemption. We
 cannot allow the government to steal our money! Please don't let this
 happen!!! Many of you read the articles quoting the government and
 Federal Reserve officials that the Liberty Dollar was legal. You did
 nothing wrong. You are legally entitled to your property. Let us use
 this terrible act to band together and further our goal - to return
 America to a value based currency.

 Please forward this important Alert... so everyone who possess or use
 the Liberty Dollar is aware of the situation.

 Please click _HERE_ <http://www.libertydollar.org/classaction/index.php>
 to sign up for the class action lawsuit and get your property back!

 Thanks again for your support at this darkest time as the damn
 government and their dollar sinks to a new low.
