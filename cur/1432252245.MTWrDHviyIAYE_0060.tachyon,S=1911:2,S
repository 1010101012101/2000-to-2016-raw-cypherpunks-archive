I regularly use the internet through other people's unprotected 
wireless networks, simply for convenience while travelling, not 
for any stego or anonymity purpose.   So do lots of other 
people.  I only target places convenient to tourists and likely 
to be rich in unprotected networks.   Maybe your network is 
located someplace where it is not worth the trouble to find it.
Sometimes I go down the street and steal some bandwidth just
because I find it a change to work in the open air.
