The harshness of a digital bitstream can be softened by operating LED 
clocks in the same room as the bitstream. The Tice Clock, for example, 
works by plugging in to any electrical socket in the room where the 
listener is located...of course, all that matters is that he _sees_ the 
Tice Clock plugged-in, and remembers that he paid $399 for this piece 
of wondrous technology, for the effect to work.

That the bitstream as measured with a logic analyzer is unchanged with 
any of these "digital enhancers" is beside the point.

Monster Cable, by the way, is doing a nice business selling Extra 
Special, Oxygen-Free Copper Shielded, Insulated with Rubber Hand-Rolled 
on the Thighs of Taiwanese Virgins cables for _USB_. Yep, for USB. 
Never mind that the bitstream either is there or it isn't...some people 
think they get superior data with special $80 cables.

As for hearing heterodyning in 28 KHz and 30 KHz signals, maybe. CD 
players have brickwall filters to of course block such frequencies. 
Some analog groove-based systems can have some kind of signal up there 
at those frequencies, but not much. Very, very few microphones are 
rated at 22-25 KHz, so I have to wonder just where this signal is 
coming from. If not coming from actual musical instruments, and 
detected by the microphones, why bother?

Sure, we may as well push the CD spec up to 24 KHz or so. That will 
probably even satisfy Neil Young.
