Cryptography Research's Nate Lawson to Speak at USENIX '04
Monday June 28, 9:05 am ET

Presents Lessons Learned in Secure Storage for Digital Cinema

SAN FRANCISCO, June 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital cinema transforms the
protection and physical transport of film cans into an outsourced storage
security problem, but security expert Nate Lawson believes that
conventional IT solutions are not up to the task. Lawson, senior security
engineer at Cryptography Research, Inc., has used open source software to
rapidly prototype digital cinema storage solutions and will offer advice on
how to maintain security throughout the entire cinema life cycle, from
filming and production to projection, at the USENIX '04 Annual Technical
Conference.

Lawson's presentation, "Building a Secure Digital Cinema Server Using
FreeBSD," is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 29 in the Boston
Marriott Copley Place Hotel.

"Traditional storage security solutions are designed to operate within a
data center under the data owner's physical management and control, but in
digital cinema, the data representing the film passes through multiple
parties with different incentives and levels of security," said Lawson.
"While encryption is important, it is not sufficient to ensure data
integrity or provide the evidence needed to ensure accountability and
mitigate leaks at critical junctures in film production and distribution."

According to Lawson, the projection booth at the local cinema is rapidly
taking on many of the aspects of a traditional IT data center, with racks
of computers and storage devices, high-bandwidth LANs and SANs, and other
equipment. Digital cinema is still in an embryonic stage, with about 90
digital cinema-ready theaters across the U.S. Lawson's talk will present
new criteria for evaluating storage security solutions, from disk
encryption or file system encryption to other storage security products,
and show how open source software supported the rapid development of a
prototype digital cinema server in a proprietary environment. Lawson will
also discuss the importance of standardization efforts, including the
Digital Cinema Initiative.

Nate Lawson, senior security engineer at Cryptography Research, is focused
on the design and analysis of platform and network security. Previously, he
was the original developer of ISS RealSecure and various products for
digital cinema, storage security, network mapping, and IPSEC. Nate has
evaluated cryptographic systems for FIPS 140 and other secure standards. He
is a FreeBSD developer in his spare time, contributing a SCSI target driver
and working on ACPI and CAM. Nate holds a B.S. computer science degree from
Cal Poly and is a member of USENIX and SMPTE.

USENIX, the Advanced Computing Systems Association, supports and
disseminates practical research, provides a neutral forum for discussion of
technical issues and encourages computing outreach into the community at
large. USENIX conferences have become essential meeting grounds for the
presentation and discussion of advanced developments in all aspects of
computing systems.
