1.US official makes PNR demands to the European Parliament
============================================================

As the negotiations of the PNR (Passenger Name Records) issue continue
between the US Government and the European Parliament, during his visit to
Brussels on 14 May, US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asked
for more relaxed restrictions on the personal data transfer from the
airline companies.

The interim agreement on PNR between EU and US expires in July 2007 and
unless a common agreement is reached by then, airlines are in a difficult
position, facing either being sued in Europe for providing these data in the
US or in the US for not sharing the information.

Chertoff addressed the Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice
and Home Affairs asking for looser privacy safeguard conditions in the
transfer of the personal data of passengers flying from Europe to US. The
European Parliament has resisted until now, being concerned on personal data
protection issues.

One of the restrictions Chertoff referred to in asking for looser conditions
was the use of the data limiting their dissemination to institutions that
have strict privacy safeguards standards as in the EU.

Chertoff considers that in order to stop terrorism, the data have to be
shared among all US government agencies. He also stated the U.S. wanted to
hold the data for 40 years but he also said this was negotiable.

While the European Commissioner for justice and home affairs Franco Frattini
said he was confident the EU and the US could reach an agreement on how to
handle personal information about European citizens flying to America, there
were voices that asked uncomfortable questions to Chertoff.

MEP Sophie in 't Veld, the rapporteur responsible for PNR policy asked if
PNR were used for purposes other than counter-terrorism, such as control of
infectious diseases, or private purposes of certain companies such as
insurance companies. The answer was that the use of PNR by private companies
was illegal and those infringing the law would be brought to justice.
But PNR data are first of all commercial records created and used for
commercial purposes by travel companies and Chertoff 's answer would imply
that these companies are forbidden to use these data and that would make
impossible for them to operate. US has generally more lax laws on privacy
and data protection and there is no law restricting them from passing part
or all of those data to a third party, or using the data for other purposes
than those for which the data had been collected.

Chertoff also claimed that "PNR data is protected under the U.S. Privacy Act
and the Freedom of Information Act, among other laws, as well as the robust
oversight provided through ... American courts." However, Privacy Act
applies only to U.S. persons, not EU citizens and residents.

Sophie in 't Veld also asked Chertoff if he was really interested in a
compromise "instead imposing unilaterally US standards and wishes" but she
did not get a clear answer.

"It is never justified to give unlimited and uncontrolled powers to any
government," said in 't Veld.

============================================================
2. UK implements the Data Retention Directive
============================================================

The UK Home Office is presently implementing the Data Retention Directive
that will oblige telephony and internet service providers to keep data for
12 months. The decision was taken without any debate by simple "affirmative"
votes in the parliament and the Directive is to be implemented by 15
September 2007 for fixed and mobile telephones and 18 months later for
internet services (including VOIP telephony).

The Home Office intents to implement the Directive by a Regulation that will
replace the current "voluntary" Code and does not seem to have taken into
consideration any risk related to the privacy of personal data.

Moreover, the government says that the EC Directive covering serious crime
can be used for any crime and that there is no need for public or
parliamentary discussion on privacy, civil liberties or human rights issues
as these have already been discussed at the EU level.

Tony Bunyan, Statewatch editor, comments:
"The collection and retention of everyone's communications data is a
momentous decision, one that should not be slipped through parliament
without anyone noticing as the government plans to do.
The government's proposal changes a voluntary agreement into a binding law,
on these grounds alone there should be primary legislation.
Moreover, the EC Directive limits the purpose for which data can be retained
to "serious crime" but the government intends to extend the scope to all
crime however minor."

Having in view the character of the data retained, consumers and telecoms
companies need safeguards concerning the use of these data. Under the EC
Directive, all countries are required to adopt measures that ensure the data
can only be used by competent national authorities. Yet, UK's draft
regulation and consultation process makes no reference on this. Also there
is nothing in the Regulation covering sanctions and remedies for
unauthorised use of the data as stipulated in the EC Directive.

Further more, the data can also be obtained in the absence of existing court
proceedings and can be available to anyone who can convince the Courts that
they have a right to access them.

Keeping personal data should help law enforcement authorities in their fight
against crime and for national security purposes. On the other hand, telecom
companies must protect their customers' privacy and, according to the draft
regulations, they will not be able to protect these data by destroying it.

The only positive element for them is that, at least, the government
proposes to compensate them for compliance costs and litigants are obliged
to pay for disclosure of documents which they request from third parties.

3. Google is profiling online gamers
============================================================

Google has filed a patent in Europe and in US on a profiling technology
planning to create psychological profiles of web users based on their
behaviour at playing on-line games. The company thinks it can gather up
information to shape the personality of web users according to the way they
react and take decisions while playing online and then sell these
psychological profiles to advertisers.

The patent says: "User dialogue (e.g. from role playing games, simulation
games, etc) may be used to characterize the user (e.g. literate, profane,
blunt or polite, quiet etc). Also, user play may be used to characterize the
user (e.g. cautious, risk-taker, aggressive, non-confrontational, stealthy,
honest, cooperative, uncooperative, etc)."

On the basis of these profiles, adverts inside online games could be shaped
to address the people's interests, tastes and tendencies. Adverts that
appear inside the game could thus be more "relevant to the user", Google
says.

The patent says that information from previously saved games could be
accessed from memory cards. "Such saved information may be thought of state
information, and offers a valuable source of information to the advertisers"
and also that Google could also monitor people playing on any game console
that connects to the internet, including the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Wii
and Microsoft's Xbox.

These plans have created concerns for privacy campaigners, who consider that
the implications of compiling and storing such detailed information are
"alarming".

Sue Charman the Open Rights Group said: "I can understand why they are
interested in this, but I would be deeply disturbed by a company holding a
psychological profile. Whenever you have large amounts of information it
becomes attractive to people - we've already seen the American federal
government going to court over data from companies including Google."

The patent gives alarming examples of the invasive type of approach the
advertisers could use, such as: "In a car racing game, after a user
crashes his Honda Civic, an announcer could be used to advertise by saying
'if he had a Hummer, he would have gotten the better of that altercation',
etc. If the user has been playing for over two hours continuously, the
system may display ads for Pizza Hut, Coke, coffee."

The experts say that although such scanning is already done by some web
companies that use keywords for online advertising based on basic
attributes, such kind of complete profiles viewed by the Google patent would
go much further in combining information sources to put names and addresses
to the anonymous profiles.

Google stated to The Guardian that it had no plan in the next future
regarding this patent and that this was only one of the large number of
patents filed during the last months by the company. "Google registers
different patents irrespective of whether we actually intend to use them"
was Google spokesman's statement.

4. UK House of Commons culture committee wants copyright extension
============================================================

The copyright term for sound recordings is back on the public agenda in UK,
after a report from the House of Commons culture committee has recommended
its extension from 50 to 70 years, despite the negative feedback received
earlier from Andrew Gowers' report or a recent study commissioned by the
European Union and made public in January 2007.

The Culture committee report considered that the musicians have a "moral
right" to keep control of their creations while alive and that 7000 people
will lose in the next years their royalties from the 50s and 60s recordings.
Also the report considered there was a non-reasonable difference between the
copyright term for songwriters, whose families keep the copyright 70 years
after the  death of the author and the 50-year rule for sound recordings.

"We recommend that the government should press the European Commission to
bring forward proposals for an extension of copyright term for sound
recordings to at least 70 years.", concluded the report.

77 UK MPs have signed a parliamentary motion calling for this extension.
EDRi-member ORG has publicly opposed the change asking from the people to
remind the politicians to debate this issue on the basis of evidence - which
points firmly against extension - rather than nostalgia.

The decision of the UK MPs is opposite to Andrew Gowers' report, backed by
the Treasury, that recommended not to extend the copyright term for sound
recordings.

Moreover, Gowers exclusively revealed to Out-Law Radio last month that, far
from leaning towards extension, he almost recommended shortening the term of
copyright:

"I could have made a case for reducing it based on the economic arguments,"
he said. "We certainly considered it, and if you look at the report that
came from the academics that we commissioned to examine the arguments and
examine the evidence they also argued very robustly that 50 years could be
arguably more than enough."

5. The Italian Big Brother Awards for 2007
============================================================

On 19 May 2007, the two-day e-Privacy Conference in Florence hosted the Big
Brother Awards Italy. The candidates for the awards were selected by a jury
made of seven members.

The people's choice price "The People's lament" was won by far by Telecom
Italia especially for the Tavaroli & Co case when a vast system of illegal
eavesdropping of telephone conversations was discovered under the company's
umbrella. The company's financial maneuvers and court actions have also
contributed to its victory.

The Municipality of Milan won the award "The Worst Public Agency" for having
installed several cameras in the city starting with public parks without
giving any information on who would use the recorded data and for having
sponsored a private initiative that proposes to the Milanese traders a 50%
reimbursement for the installment of cameras on their sideway part.

The "Worst private corporation" award was received again by Telecom Italia
for having illegally intercepted the conversations of millions of Italian
citizens without any constitutional guaranty or requests from the secret
services for emergency situations. In a best scenario, the management of the
company had lost control over their employees' actions.

The award for "The Most Invasive Technology" was received by Google for
the large amount of data retained. The company is considered the second most
dangerous entity for privacy in the world. With the recent acquisition of
DoubleClick.com, the advertising giant, its motto could now be "Don't be
evil, buy the Devil!".

Paolo Gentiloni, the Minister of Communications received the "Boot in the
Mouth" price. He considers that the eavesdropping is not a problem as long
as unless such data is made public, especially by the journalists.

The "Lifetime Menace" award was adjudicated by the Italian Parliament for
having approved a law against the illegal interceptions only when its
members considered they were personally in danger. The Italian Parliament
has proven lately that the defense of the privacy rights of the Italian
citizens is no longer a focus.

The positive award "Winston Smith - Privacy Hero" was awarded this year to
Representative Maurizio Turco who has presented the Winston Smith Project
law against Data Retention, the only law proposal issued during the last
year in favor of privacy.

6. Bulgarian actions against online piracy - "collateral damage"
============================================================

Bulgarian authorities went beyond the EU limits in investigating Internet
users and website owners in 2005 according to MEP Antonyia Parvanova who
thinks the Bulgarian officials have caused the bankruptcy of some Internet
clubs and brought serious damages to a website owner by prosecuting people
who had not actually committed any crime.

She believes that these cases should be investigated and she stated she
would address this matter to the European Commission to verify whether the
actions of the Bulgarian authorities did not infringe the European laws,
especially article 11 of the Chapter of Human Rights.

Rumen Petkov, Bulgaria's Minister of Interior, stated the actions involving
the serisure of all the equipment of some Internet clubs followed by very
strong mass media coverage had been triggered by EU pressure to "control
Internet piracy".

The case was dismissed after two years of litigation, the Internet clubs
were found not guilty and the equipment was returned but the clubs has
already gone bankrupt and the equipment was already outdated.

Actions were also taken against the "black boards" where users post and
exchange what they have. One of these actions was against ArenaBG.com, one
of the most popular websites of this kind. As a result of the police raids
and prosecution the owner was out of business. According to Parvanova, due
to the publicity created around the case and to false reports regarding his
wealth he had to hide for fear of being kidnapped.

These cases were brought to the attention of Parvanova by representatives of
EDRI-member Internet Society Bulgaria.

7. Opennet Initiative publishes alarming results on Internet filtering
============================================================

On 19 May 2007 the Opennet Initiative (ONI) held a conference on the
state of global internet filtering. On the conference ONI presented the
results of its research over the last years. It concludes that an
increasing number of coutries is applying filtering to the Internet. The
core of the results can be found on ONI's website and will be published
in a book in the end of 2007.

"It's an alarming increase," according to Ron Deibert, one of the
academics leading the ONI Initiative. "Once the tools are in place,
authorities realize that the Internet can be controlled. There used to
be a myth that the Internet was immune to regulation. Now governments
are realizing it's actually the opposite."

The academic study has categorized their findings on government Internet
filtering into four broad categories: political (such as opposition
material), social (such as pornography, gambling), conflict/security
(armed conflict, militant groups), and Internet tools (such as
anonimizers). There are country reports on 40 specific countries and
eight regional reports, including Europe, the last opening with: "In
less than a decade, the Internet in Europe has evolved from a virtually
unfettered environment to one in which filtering in most countries,
particularly within the European Union (EU), is the norm rather than the
exception."

An important conclusion of ONI is the lack of tranparency of the
filtering that was discovered. "What's regrettable about net filtering
is that almost always this is happening in the shadows. There's no place
you can get an answer as a citizen from your state about how they are
filtering and what is being filtered.", according to John Palfrey,
director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, one of the
partners of ONI.

Internet filtering in Europe is a point on the agenda of the Council of
Europe Group of Specialists on Human Rights in the Information Society
(CoE MC-S-IS) in which EDRI is an observer. The first exchanges during
the March 2007 meeting of the MC-S-IS group on the technical filtering
of content seemed promising, EDRI-Gram reported on 12 April 2007, as a
large majority of participating member states expressed strong doubts on
both the usefulness of technical filtering measures and their
compatibility with Article 10 of the ECHR.

8. OECD finds the real piracy losses
============================================================

Financial Times obtained an executive summary of a new report produced by
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that estimates
the trade losses due to piracy and counterfeiting did not exceed 200 billion
USD.

The report should be endorsed by the OECD board this month and is considered
politically sensitive, taking into account that the estimates from the
industry show figures up to 3-4 times higher than the OECD estimates based
on reported customs seizures in various countries.

The efforts of the international business lobbists, that have pushed for
Germany to put the fight against counterfeiting on the next G8 summit
agenda, could be undermined by this new report. This is why the
International Chamber of Commerce Secretary General quickly reacted by
considering the OECD figures as "underestimated" and said that "up to 1 000
billion USD in international trade was lost annually" to piracy and
counterfeiting.

9. International Declaration on G8 and Intellectual Property launched
============================================================

The German non-profit organization "Netzwerk Freies Wissen" (Free Knowledge
Network) heavily criticizes the goals of the conference held by the G8
states' ministers of justice starting on 23 May 2007.

The most important item on the agenda is a stronger enforcement of
intellectual property. For this reason the Network, together with other
organizations and private persons from many countries will present the
"Civil Society declaration on the G8 summit 2007 and intellectual property
rights".

"The goal of this declaration is to point out the severe problems in this
area, which have grown throughout the world in the last years", says Petra
Buhr, speaker for the network. "Furthermore we demand radical changes in the
politics of the G8", she adds. Be it patents on drugs, the protection of
seeds that prevent the cultivation of plants or the freedom of education
which is threatened by strong copyright laws. The paper demands, that a
state has to decide by itself on how far it wants to introduce intellectual
property laws and that the pressure, mainly on developing countries, must
stop in order to allow a fair development.

Also the paper talks about the problems in the G8 states. It claims software
patents are a threat to innovation and digital rights management a threat to
the worlds cultural heritage. It also demands a massive aid towards
alternatives such as free access to knowledge or free software which was
financed by public funds. It shows concern at the increasing privatization
of public research.

Finally the Network demands from the hosting German Government to show its
true colours: "It is perfidious to talk about fake T-Shirts and unsafe
medicine while actually trying to stop the important production of generic
drugs in developing countries", Buhr answers to a statement of Brigitte
Zypries, the German minister of justice. "The government arguments are
one-sided. The problems caused by ever increasing intellectual property
rights are complex and very serious. Alternatives should be chosen instead
of enforcing a very corrupt system worldwide" Buhr concludes.

The declaration is open for signatories starting today. Among the first
signatories of the Declaration are also the EDRI-members Netzwerk Neue
Medien, Chaos Computer Club and Swiss Internet User Group SIUG.

10. Romanian open source community gets together
============================================================

Probably the most important conference in Romania on open source and free
software took place at the end of the last week - on 18-19 May 2007 in
Brasov. The eLiberatica 2007 conference was organized by a new group of IT
specialists called Romanian Open Source and Free Software Initiative (ROSI).

The conference aimed at bringing community leaders from around the world to
talk about the hottest topics in FLOSS movement demonstrating the advantages
of adopting, using and developing Open Source and Free Software solutions.

The international participants that included Monty Widenius, the main
engineer and supervisor of MySQL, Brian Behlendorf, one of the Apache
Project initiators or Zak Greant, representing Mozilla Foundation, provided
a high level view on the entire FLOSS movement including business, social
and technical aspects.

Aleksander Farstad, CEO of eZ systems explained how open source development
can be used in creating a successful business and the presentations from the
Romanian speakers showed examples of locally developed open source products
from ERP/CRM solutions to Open Source for Public Libraries or VoIP
solutions.

The use of open source software and open standards in public administration
were highlighted by Georg Greve (president of Free Software Foundation
Europe) in its presentation on the necessity of adopting open standards and
supporting them at the national level as well. A practical example on
adopting FOSS in public administration was shown by Jim Willis, Director of
eGovernment and Information Technology from Rhode Island.

As some of the Romanian participants pointed out, the Romanian Government
preferred until now proprietary software and technologies (with closed
source code) at very high prices, "making Romania directly available to
foreign corporations and paying hundreds of millions of Euro from public
money as licenses."

The necessity for a better-organized open source community was highlighted
by Bogdan Manolea from EDRI-member APTI Romania, who presented the
obstacles the Romanian copyright legislation creates for open source
developers and why the open source community should react to those actions
supposed to "fight piracy" of the authorities.

A similar message was projected by Lucian Savluc, the main organizer of the
event, who promoted ROSI as a good framework where the Romanian open source
community can be gathered, if there is support, work and involvement. The
first step will be the creation of a public portal that will present all the
Romanian activities related to FOSS, both in Romanian and English. Other
projects will follow as well.

11. Polish people arrested for publishing movie translations
============================================================

A popular subtitle exchange community in Poland, Napisy.org, was in shock,
after nine of its members were accused of posting illegal translations of
movies and were held by the Police for questioning.

The Napisy.org community, that gathers approx. 600 000 users, allowed the
submission of translated subtitles for movies (especially from English into
Polish) for free. The translators did not get any money for their work.

The Polish Police had a common intervention in 6 cities of Silesia,
Podlachia, Cracow and Szczecin where they entered at 6 AM in some of the
translator's homes and took them for questioning. According to the Polish
Police, 2000 CDs with allegedly illegal copied movies were also found
and 17 computers were seized.

Krzysztof Czerepak, the webmaster of napisy.org, contested the information
made public by the Police, explaining that he knows only about 6 persons (2
admins, 3 moderators and one translator) and denied the existence of the CDs
found by the Police. "The two admins had laptops with fully legal software,
while the woman-translator had a company-owned laptop" he added.
The webmaster also commented that " most of the amateurish translations
appear long before a "professional" translation is prepared. It is also an
often omitted fact that a lot of "professionals" use (or steal, naming the
things) our translations to do their job. Nobody calls this a violation of
the law."

The website that was hosted on a German server was shut down and the
Polish Police explained that it was a collaboration with the German
colleagues for this activity. The people held for questioning could be
accused of illegal publication of copyrighted works and could be sentenced
to up to 2 years jail time.
