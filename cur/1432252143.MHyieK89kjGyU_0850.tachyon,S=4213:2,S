???? Black Panthers exist today...

But they did provide a 'extreme viewpoint' and made it easier for the
powers that be and more moderate groups to meet and make progress. A sort
of implied 'or else'.

In your opinion...opining on alternate futures is rife with problems you
seem to blithefully to ignore (at your own peril). Claiming omniciance
isn't a convincing argument.

Actually I'd say it has, as a result of this civil war the chance of
Ireland getting their independence sooner rather than later (how long do
you figure the Brit's would have sat around if there had been no responce
- till hell freezes over I'd suspect).

Give a single example where absolute non-violence has worked...(there
aren't any)

It isn't in the human psyche to say "Well, we've oppressed them long
enough, let them go free. We'll make our profits and express our civil
authority some other way".
