Doesn't hitting a world financial center impede the funding of imperialism?

If you apply the same standards the US uses to classify dual use 
infrastructure, and organizations "linked to" the enemy, I think the WTC is

The US bombed water treatment plants, electrical facilities, and bridges in 
Iraq.  Certainly not military targets either.
