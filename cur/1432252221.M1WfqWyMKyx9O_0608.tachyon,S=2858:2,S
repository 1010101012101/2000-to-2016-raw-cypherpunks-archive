Judge Refuses to Dismiss Tax Payer Lawsuit Against Bank of America


Irwin Schiff who is regarded by many as being the Nation's leading authority
on the income tax is suing the Bank of America for triple damages for
turning over approximately $8,000 of his money to the IRS in response to a
Notice a Levy.  Third parties, such as banks and employers, that turn over
bank accounts and wages to the IRS in response to IRS Notices of Levy are
used to having suits brought against them for doing so summarily dismissed.
That was not the case on November 13, 2001 in Clark County District Court,
Las Vegas, Nevada.
