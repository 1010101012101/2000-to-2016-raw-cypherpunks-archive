Some ideas: Start with a highly ornate script font. Anti-alias. Try a font
with lots of gaps and other topology breaking features. Pluck out a decent
perceptual model from one of the better image compressors and try doing
maximum modifications beneath a given perceptual error bound. Low contrast,
with information encoded in the hue channel.

(Dead trees: Use a colorless, fluorescent ink, or a combination of such inks
to throw off the scanner. Print your stuff on extremely heat and/or light
sensitive paper.)
