> Abstract
>
> Haystack, a circumvention tool, emerged in the wake of
> the repression after the Iranian election of June 2009.
> After achieving considerable public prominence, its use and
> distribution was recently halted. Important questions have
> been raised about Haystack's effectiveness and security,
> as well as the roots of its reputation.
>
> Evgeny Morozov, who emerged as a leading critic of Haystack,
> and Daniel Colascione, who wrote the Haystack code, will
> discuss the Haystack experience and the lessons it carries for
> circumvention technologies and, more broadly, for the evaluation
> and political deployment of new information technologies.
>
> Daniel Colascione co-founded the Censorship Research Center
> in June 2009 in the aftermath of the Iranian election and has
> had a lifelong interest in internet freedom and technological
> measures to mitigate censorship.  He created the Haystack
> anti-censorship system and holds a BSc in Computer Science
> from the SUNY University at Buffalo.

> Speaker
>
> Evgeny Morozov is a leading thinker and commentator on the
