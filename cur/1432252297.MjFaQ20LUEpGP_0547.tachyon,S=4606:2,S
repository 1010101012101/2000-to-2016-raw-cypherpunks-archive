You, thank Baal, have no knowledge of what "pushes my buttons." You also 
have almost no list experience here (though this has never stopped you 
from lecturing us on things you've read about in books).

I write about what I desire to write about.

Now that the training camp is over, there is no threat to the security 
of the operation. They lack time machines.

And which "anti-paramilitary traning statutes" would these be?

Tell us what your college professors told you...but check it against 
reality before passing it on.

What you "resent profoundly" does not matter.

And what is done by other memmbers of a list does not establish guilt by 
association, except in your fevered mind.

For example, the discussion I contributed to on hacking the air traffic 
control system for political purposes makes you guilty of which crime 
and in which way?

You are ignorant of my mental state of mind. Twit.
