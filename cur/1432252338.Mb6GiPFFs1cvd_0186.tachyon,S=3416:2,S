It's not quite that bad.  I mentioned the blinding.  What happens is
that before the master storage key is encrypted, it is XOR'd with a
random value, which is also output by the TPM along with the encrypted
recovery blob.  You save them both, but only the encrypted blob gets
sent to the manufacturer.  So when the manufacturer decrypts the data,
he doesn't learn your secrets.

The system is cumbersome, but not an obvious security leak.
