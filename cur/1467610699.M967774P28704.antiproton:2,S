Problem is, most religions have bits about love thy neighbour, but also
how here and there "God" calls upon "his" "subjects" to sacrifice a son
for example, or to "cut off the head of the unbelievers [of this
particular religion]" for example.

So perhaps "every religion" has some proclamation to love thy neighbour,
I don't know, cannot vouch for that, but this is not enough to make an
assessment of a religion and whether those who subscribe to that
particular dogma are likely or not to kill me, and or my family, and or
my friends.

Even if a religion is "the religion of peace" or says "love thy
neighbour" does not mean there are not other beliefs written in that
religion's holy books, which call upon the believers to commit evil
crimes.

Yes it's good to focus on the love.

But for survival, sometimes we must focus on the evil, just so much so
that we can protect ourselves. If we don't do this, we are in denial of
reality of religions, and also, sadly, of humans..

Yes, from an artistic point of view, exploding a city could be seen as a
"beautiful thing".

I won't use those terms together in that way, and I think doing so often
causes conversational contention of no benefit. Contention can be
useful, but not when we end up disputing "artistic" or "obviously
fallacious" points...

This is very useful type of communication. No point we waste time
running down rabbit holes for no benefit :)

Love y'all
