I have heard from people who ought to know, that a popular satellite
phone protocol actually *broadcasts* the reported/calculated location
of each phone, in plaintext beacons from the satellite that anyone who
tunes to the right frequency can receive.  I wonder what sort of NSA
influence was used in designing *that* protocol.

If you care about location privacy, don't use a satphone.  Or hack
your phone deeply, to report a false location, perhaps one that
belongs to your enemies.
