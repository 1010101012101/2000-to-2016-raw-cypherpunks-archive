This is why we are supposed to be a nation of _laws_, not of _men_. It 
doesn't matter whether these soldiers are country bumpkins or not: the 
Constitution still applies. (Scholars may opine that Bangor 
International Airport has "invited" soldiers onto its property, blah 
blah, or that ordinary search and seizure provisions are waived, blah 
blah, but the fact is that soldiers are now frisking people without 
search warrants. At this rate, the entire Fourth will be mooted.)

"At the time it apparently was a good idea"?

You are hopeless. Every one of the guards, judges, and processing 
officials should have been tried for kidnapping and then hung by the 
neck until he was dead.

(One reason I have been cynical dates back to 1969 when a teacher was 
piously explaining the Nuremberg precedent, that "just following orders" 
is no defense. I brought up the imprisonment of Japanese-ancestry and 
Italian-ancestry persons, without constitutional due process. My teacher 
just shrugged and said "We won the war, so it didn't apply to us.")

I never understood why the survivors of the American concentration camps 
didn't track down their captors and quietly kill them during the 50s.

This nation is not one of those shitholes, a point you seem to be 
oblivious to.

We are talking about the Constitution, not what is commonplace in ad 
hocracies like Canada or in police states like Singapore and Indonesia.
