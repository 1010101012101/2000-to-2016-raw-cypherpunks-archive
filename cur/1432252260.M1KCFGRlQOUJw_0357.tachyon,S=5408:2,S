One of the fun things about the internet is that
you can't just put things behind you -
information is never forgotten unless it's useful.
There are flames I wrote on Usenet back in the early 80s archived;
if only it were as easy to find the useful stuff.
As the song says, "C'mon Joe, you can always change your name".

If you did know, you'd have written to the people who run the
archives, not the people on the mailing list you once spammed,
not that either will erase it.  And there's more than one archive.

Looks like the Mitch's original "remove-me" request didn't make it to the 
lne.com list,
but it's in the inet-one archives.   Tim's reply included the spam.
The address of Mitch Shoemaker, the spammer, looks very much like
the address of
SHOEMAKER'S AUTO BODY  82  Iron St Rear N  Bloomsburg PA 17815 (717) 784-3585

which probably explains why none of the four listings in Anywho
have the same address as Mitch the spammer.
Shoemaker, Angie  90 Alexis Dr  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-389-1834
Shoemaker, Charles E  345 E 8 St  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-784-2690
Shoemaker, Paul  90 Alexis Dr  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-389-1834
Shoemaker, William L  918 E 7 St  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-784-1218

I'm guessing that the area code for Shoemaker's auto body is now 570.

You should have known that it was rude and deceptive,
and had some clue that the only way you can make money from it is
by getting a bunch of suckers to lose money.
Whether or not that's illegal is really a secondary issue.
