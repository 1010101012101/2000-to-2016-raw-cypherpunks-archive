Uhhhh, how about.

1. Big multi-national corporation buys off politicians to pass laws to protect 
their business model (DMCA anyone ?)
2. Gets meter maid to enforce said law.
3. See above.

Ahhh, I see. Let's just get rid of the middle-man (government) and then the 
corps can take take of enforcement directly (pirate a song, get whacked).

Much more efficient I would guess.
