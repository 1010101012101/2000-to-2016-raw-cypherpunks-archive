Found out that my PTO for family reunion has been approved I can't wait till July. I have some extra time off and have already sent my pops an email so we can plan a fishing trip after the reunion. I love fishing with my pops, after all the fights we had when I was a BRAT, and then I finally found the friend in him and respect I was looking for I truly love hanging with him. Moms is a blast she has always been, I think she gets a little jealous sometimes because she always stayed in between dad and I when we fought, Now that we get along Pops and I do more things together. I really enjoy when I get in the kitchen and help her out with the meal, and we talk about all kinds of things, she really helps me whenever I ask and there is nothing I wouldn't do for her, I can talk to her about things I can not talk to Pops about. I look forward to sneaking away on the weekends to see them and get some QT time with them. well gonna run for now. 3</SPAN>
