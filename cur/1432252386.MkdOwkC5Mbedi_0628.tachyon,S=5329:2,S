Ryan suggested earlier that the Ipaq with Fireball isn't up to the task.
I don't think this is correct. I point you to

http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs344/staff/group10/final_report.pdf

in which some Stanford students produce a wireless ipaq2ipaq
VoIP system. Biggest problem is that it's simplex, not because
of cpu limitations but rather that the Compaq HW can listen or
make noise, but not both simultaneously. Using a headset which
interfaces through the expansion port might enable you to 
avoid this problem (and the BT headset could also offload the
codec). A 206 MHz Ipaq would, I think have sufficient HP to 
do the crypto.

I've toyed with the idea of porting SpeakFreely to Ipaq, but have
not actually done anything at this point.

I've x-posted to coderpunks, since that group is more germane.
Serious further discussion should be over there, IMHO.
