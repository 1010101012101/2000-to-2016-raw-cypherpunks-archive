No, by this argument nearly all the regimes of the world
would be illegitimate. Saddam ruled a terrible regime, but he
also overthrew a terrible regime.  Anyway, Saddam enjoyed the authority
of democratic acquiescence, which is the accepted standard.  Even if
Saddam's regime were illegitimate, which it was not, the aggresive acts
of the US were still illegal.  No authority can be derived from an
aggressive and illegal invasion.

By definition, a puppet government rules by the leave of the military
power, the US, which has no claim in this case to any legitimacy in
Iraq. Thus, the puppet government can have no claim to legitimacy
either.
