AOL dumps sender ID

@2Brute?

By  Nick Farrell:  Thursday 16 September 2004, 07:25


POPULAR  ISP AOL has knifed Microsoft's anti-spam technology Sender ID.

 According to internetnews.com, AOL has dumped the idea following concerns
expressed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), coupled with the
tepid support for Sender ID in the open source community.

 However, AOL says it will press ahead with in favour of the Sender Policy
Framework (SPF)which was a component of Sender ID.

 The company said it will also publish Sender ID files so its users'
e-mails are compliant with Sender ID-enabled servers and applications.

 A spokesman said that AOL also has serious, technical concerns that Sender
ID appears isn't backwardly-compatible with the original SPF specification.
