Thank you.  We will now begin contacting these companys and asking whom
they have turned down for due to drug related convictions.  We hope to
have you under surveilance within a week.  This is PROTECTIVE
surviellance, mind you.  We just don't want you to make any mistakes
that you may regret later.

Big Bro
