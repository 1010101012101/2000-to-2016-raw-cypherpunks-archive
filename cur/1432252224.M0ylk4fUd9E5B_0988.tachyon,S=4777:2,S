Understood.  But the NSA's budget is somewhat higher than most crypto
think-tanks.

Why aren't people understanding that I'm not saying that the NSA has
found a miraculous way to break ciphers?  They may have, I don't
know.  The point is, when I said they could break "ciphers," I should
have said "cipher implementations."  I.E. software that does
cryptography.  Software is damn near always buggy.

Look, people, you can continue to ridicule me for what I said
earlier, but it would be a waste of time.  We're essentially agreeing.
