Kinko's spy case: Risks of renting PCs

                 NEW YORK (AP) -- For more than a
                 year, unbeknownst to people who used
                 Internet terminals at Kinko's stores in
                 New York, Juju Jiang was recording
                 what they typed, paying particular
                 attention to their passwords.

                 Jiang had secretly installed, in at least 14
                 Kinko's copy shops, software that logs
                 individual keystrokes. He captured more
                 than 450 user names and passwords, and
                 used them to access and open bank
                 accounts online.
