Hi Dave, remember a couple of years ago when you said you wanted to
clone
and repeat RFIDs - apparently someone has built the system to it.

VeriChip's human-implatable RFID chips clonable, sez hackers
Posted Jul 24th 2006 4:14PM by Donald Melanson
Filed under: Misc. Gadgets, Wireless

In case anyone needed more proof that we're all living in a Philip K.
Dick
novel, a pair of hackers have recently demonstrated how human-
implantable
RFID chips from VeriChip can be easily cloned, effectively stealing the
person's identity. Annalee Newitz and Jonathan Westhues showed off their
handiwork at the HOPE Number Six conference in New York City this
weekend,
with Newitz herself playing the role of guinea pig, implanting a
VeriChip
RFID chip in her right arm. To clone the chip, Westhues first red
Newitz's
arm with a standard RFID reader, then scanned it again with a homebrew
antenna connected to his laptop, which recorded the signal off the
chip. He
then used the same RFID reader to read the signal from his laptop, which
promptly spit out Newtiz's supposedly unique ID. For its part,
VeriChip has
only said they haven't yet had a chance to review the evidence but still
insist that "it's very difficult to steal a VeriChip."
