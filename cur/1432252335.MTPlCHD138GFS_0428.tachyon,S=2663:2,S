IP conference: copyright law has gone too far
The recording industry and the Business Software Alliance squared off 
against the Electronic Frontier Foundation and US Rep. Rick Boucher 
Wednesday in a debate over laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act aimed at protecting large copyright holders, with the hearts and minds 
of a crowd of Washington, D.C., decision-makers as the prize.
