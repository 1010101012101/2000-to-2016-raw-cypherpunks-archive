Well, that's what they call "openness of process" in more civilized times.
I believe the reasoning was roughly that when every financial institution
across the nation gets the list, it's bound to leak.

What's funny, really, is that the list was withdrawn based not on
investigatory reasons but on privacy laws -- you cannot go spreading
people's addresses and personal details over the Internet, now can you?
