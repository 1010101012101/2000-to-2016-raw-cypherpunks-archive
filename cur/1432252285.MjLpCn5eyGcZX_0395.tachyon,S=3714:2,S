Yes, it is the right of their parents to protect their children. They have
a right to demand that products and services targeted at their children
conform to the parents desires. The business has no say in it, and
shouldn't.

Labeling products as to target audiences and requring parents ok to allow
children to buy adult products is NOT (let me repeat, NOT) cencorship in
any way, manner, or form. It is responsible parenting and the recognition
of business that they have a social duty as well as a economic duty to
provide products with the features their customers want. And if that means
no tobacco adds in kids stores or parental permission to sell certain
types of products to those kids then too damn bad for your profit margin.
If you can't do it then you don't deserve to be in business.

You're real position isn't that the government is telling you how to label
your products, it's that ANY party is saying they want products with
features you don't want to provide.

The failure of capitalism is the failure to recognize that human beings
have rights and that business is simply an expression of individual
rights. Rights allow one to pursue an activity until that behaviour
infringes anothers right to engage in their activity (in this case raising
their children).

Libertarian/crypto-anarchy/capitalism is nothing more than a mechanism to
use the masses for the benefit of the minority. Fucking socialism.
