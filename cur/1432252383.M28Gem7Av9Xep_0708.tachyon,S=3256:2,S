They worked fine when I looked at it, though Jabbascript is
unreliable enough on Netscape that I may have gotten lucky
(e.g. looked at it when the memory leaks hadn't leaked much,
caches weren't too full, rest of the memory on my pc wasn't
swapping itself to death, etc.)

It's unsafe for the users to enable it, because they might
encounter web pages with malicious or broken scripts,
but when it's well-written it really does work ok,
at least most of the time.
