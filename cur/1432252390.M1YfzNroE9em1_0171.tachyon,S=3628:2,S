If it goes in without any delay, without any chance for Suzie the 
Sheeple to examine it, then why bother at all? Simply issue an 
"assurance" to Suzie that her ballot was duly copied to an adjacent 
memory store or counting box.

When she says "Then why did you people even bother?," just shrug and 
say "They told us to do it."

As Major Variola said a few messages ago, as soon as human eyes can see 
it, machines and cameras and cellphones and eavesdroppers and Vinnie 
the Votebuyer can see it.

I expect there may be some good solutions to this issue, but I haven't 
yet seen them discussed here or on other fora I run across. And since 
encouraging the democrats has never been a priority for me, I haven't 
spent much time worrying about how to improve democratic elections.

And since a person should be completely free to sell his or her vote, 
99% of the measures to stop vote-buying are bogus on general 
principles.
