Some discs disable the FF button and the menu button.  You can still skip
the ads, but you have to skip each ad individually (with the chapter skip
button).  I recall usenet discussions citing 6 - 8 ads at the beginning of
some discs.

I do recall Disney putting out a few DVDs that really did block all
attempts to skip ads, but they have since backed off on it.  I suggest
using google to search the newsgroup alt.video.dvd.
