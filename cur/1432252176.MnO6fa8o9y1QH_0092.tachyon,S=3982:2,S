Which is beside your point. Your statement was that the government didn't
do ANY identification for ANY of the soldiers in WWII. Patently wrong.
Quit trying to change the rules in the middle of the game.

AFTER the war started, not before. When the initial draft was executed it
was for 21-25 year old males only. They were required to register so that
the government knew who was getting drafted. That qualifies as
'identification' and is proof contrary to your assertion.
