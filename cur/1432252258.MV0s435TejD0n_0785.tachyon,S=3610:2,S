Well, sure.  And no one forces me to run Microsoft office, either,
except Microsoft's monoploy.  And when the document format can phone
home to prevent piracy or openoffice from running, no one will be
'obligating' me to pay monopoly rents to Microsoft.

In the same way, no one forces me to have a drivers license.  But its
damned hard living life without one.

The security of the system to make attestations is built on that
assumption.  However, there are other values that a TBC can offer,
like secure key storage or trusted boot of a known OS image, that I
might like.

My ability to attest to any falsehood is limited by the statements the
key is expected to sign.  How broad are those?  I thought they were
quite limited.

Interoperability.

The ability to run purchased software..

That's off the top of my head.
