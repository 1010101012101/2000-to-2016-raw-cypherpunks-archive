Though I understand you are joking, the obvious point is that "Mein 
Kampf" was translated into French many years ago...sometime between 
1940 and 1945, one would expect, if not earlier.


I did a quick Google search to see if the French translation is 
online anywhere. I couldn't find any obvious links. Much discussion 
of the Yahoo and Amazon issues, though.

The Thought Police are coming!
