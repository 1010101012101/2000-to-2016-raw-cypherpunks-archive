	It is insanity to reply to this, but then I am quite certifiably
insane...

	Observers saw and timed the osculation of the radio signals from
the spacecraft in lunar orbit by the moon, saw correct Doppler for the
geometry involved from THEIR site (and correct timing for osculation)...
and saw the coherence of the signal consistent with a direct
transmission and not scattering from the moons rough surface (which
creates a considerable smearing of a wideband signal such as the Unified
S band telemetry/voice signals (and especially the video) due to the
path length (and thus delay) differences from all the random reflecting
points.

	And during the journey to the moon and back from the moon the
angles (and Doppler) observed when the highly directional ground
antennas were pointed for maximum signal corresponded to those predicted
from the the path of the spacecraft and not the reflective moon - which
eventually was not even close to being inside the beamwidth of the
antennas used.

	To simulate all of this realistically for tracking sites in
multiple continents would have required actually sending dummy
spacecraft  to carry out the maneuvers and emit the "fake" signals.

	And if it isn't obvious, not only did private hams follow radio
signals from these missions, but so did various professional
intelligence and radio (and optical) astronomy sites, some with
substantial dish antennas and sophisticated gear. Many of these folks
(some obviously not friendly to the USA) would have to have been very
well fooled - or in on the game - not to have called our bluff.
