Philippines - Public Announcement
December 31, 2000

On December 30, 2000, the American Embassy in Manila, Philippines made the
following announcement to the local American community in the Philippines.

There were several explosions in the Metro Manila area on December 30, 2000.
The first one occurred at approximately 12 PM and the latest at about 2PM.
The devices went off at the LRT station at Blumentritt; Plaza Ferguson,
which is near the Embassy compound; Pasay Road near the Dusit Hotel in
Makati; the cargo terminal at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA); and
on a bus in Cubao, Quezon City. Unconfirmed reports of casualties indicate
more than 12 dead and 50 injured. No American citizens are reported among
the casualties and there has been no damage to U.S. Government facilities.

The following is very important guidance for American citizens:

--The Embassy strongly encourages all Americans to remain at their
residences for the remainder of December 30 unless it is absolutely
necessary to do otherwise. Please direct any further questions to the
Embassy's Marine Security Guard at 523-1001, extension 2311 or 2688.

--If you are in the vicinity when such an incident occurs, leave the area
immediately. Do not approach the scene of a bombing or simply stand by
during the initial investigative phase.

--If you see a suspicious object or package, do not disturb it. Immediately
notify an appropriate official, such as a police officer or building guard,
and then depart the premises.

--If you are involved in any of the above, immediately notify the Embassy
with details.

All Americans should continue to review their personal security, remain
vigilant in their personal surroundings and exercise caution. Please remain
particularly alert when out in a public setting.

For further general information on travel to the Philippines, consult the
Department's latest Consular Information Sheet for the Philippines and the
Public Announcement for the Philippines dated September 1, 2000 which this
Announcement supplements. This Public Announcement expires on March 30,
2001.
