Our need does still exist. Should you be chosen for this
seven-month term assignment, your recurring task would be to pick
up 50 - 75 units of audiobook in Eagle Pass, Texas and upon
review of the each audiobook's quality, deliver them to a ranch
in Corralitos, California.

You will be paid with e-gold, at a value of $2900 per successful
trip.

If you are still interested, please submit a more detailed resume
and references.
