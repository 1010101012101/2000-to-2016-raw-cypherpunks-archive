Forgive me for being naive wrt the law,  but as I interpret what you
have written,  the critical distinction is,  if you refuse to comply
with a judge's orders (for whatever reason) you'll get cited for
contempt,  but if you cannot comply with his orders you're ok.
Correct me if I'm misinterpreting you.

So it seems to me that if you, say, publish documents to freenet 
(encypted or not) then you're ok;  it's right there in the spec,  
docments cannot be removed,  even by the original author.  If your
life depends on removing the document,  then you die.
How is this wrong?

If it's a crime to take actions specifically for the purpose of later
rendering you unable to comply with a judge's order (is it?),
how is escrowing it on the isle of man any different?

Thanks,
George
