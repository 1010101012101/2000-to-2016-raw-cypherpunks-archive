Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

This development wil| be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards of $120
mil|i0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,0OO homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 17O,0O0 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross

its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
