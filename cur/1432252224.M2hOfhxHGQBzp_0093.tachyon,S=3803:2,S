To flesh this out a little more - the judge was Stephen Trott, speaking on
September 18 2002 at the Commonwealth Club. Trott credits the torture
warrant idea to Alan Dershowitz, whom he describes as a good friend and a
"great civil libertarian".

Edited transcripts and a RealAudio recording of Trott's speech are
available at 
<http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/02/02-09trott-intro.html> -
Trott's discussion (and apparent endorsement) of torture begins at
about 16:28 into the audio, and again during the Q&A session.
