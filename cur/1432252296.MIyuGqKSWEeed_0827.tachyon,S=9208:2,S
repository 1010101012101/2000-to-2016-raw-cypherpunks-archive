Well, no; he wants them to use it as much as they like, as long as they 
give back to the commons on which they built their foundations. There's 
nothing at all wrong with asking that.

RMS would likely be insulted at the idea that he would forbid essential 
freedoms to *anyone*, including the companies he hates.

There's an undercurrent in some patches of this discussion, if I may, 
that suggests that openness is orthogonal to commercial success; the 
idea being that GPL is "anti-business" and weaker licenses are 
"pro-business". I'll just throw in "citation needed" with the reminder 
that correlation does not imply causation.

Users (more like "Used") buy Windows all the time even though everyone 
knows it can be had for free. Music lovers continue to pay for music 
even though it's common knowledge that it can be had with less malware 
on torrent sites, or simply cribbed from friends. Same for books, same 
for everything.

Artificial scarcity creates artificial demand, but a natural abundance 
does not diminish natural demand. And if you want to sell open code, it 
had better be GPL, or your competitors will steal all your best ideas 
and leave you with an inferior product. With GPL, you *invite* your 
competitors to improve with you, while you both crib one another's work 
and get better and more usefully distinct over time.
