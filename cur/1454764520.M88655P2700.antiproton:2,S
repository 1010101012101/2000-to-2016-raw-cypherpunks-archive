have to submit it ... i remember some foto of a horrid dress she was
wearing onstage ... did she like scream into the microphone 'i dont want to
be famous' or something ... i missed the whole ceremony or coronation or
wedding ... X(

Laura Poitras has a talent for disappearing. In her early<br>
documentaries like My Country, My Country and The Oath, her camera<br>
seems to float invisibly in rooms where subjects carry on intimate<br>
conversations as if they=E2=80=99re not being observed. Even in Citizenfour=
,<br>
the Oscar-winning film that tracks her personal journey from first<br>
contact with Edward Snowden to releasing his top secret NSA leaks to<br>
the world, she rarely offers a word of narration. She appears in that<br>
film exactly once, caught as if by accident in the mirror of Snowden=E2=80=
=99s<br>
Hong Kong hotel room.<br>
<br>
Now, with the opening of her multi-media solo exhibit, Astro Noise, at<br>
New York=E2=80=99s Whitney Museum of American Art this week, Snowden=E2=80=
=99s<br>
chronicler has finally turned her lens onto herself. And she=E2=80=99s give=
n<br>
us a glimpse into one of the darkest stretches of her life, when she<br>
wasn=E2=80=99t yet the revelator of modern American surveillance but instea=
d<br>
its target.<br>
<br>
The exhibit is vast and unsettling, ranging from films to documents<br>
that can be viewed only through wooden slits to a video expanse of<br>
Yemeni sky which visitors are invited to lie beneath. But the most<br>
personal parts of the show are documents that lay bare how<br>
excruciating life was for Poitras as a target of government<br>
surveillance=E2=80=94and how her subsequent paranoia made her the ideal<br>
collaborator in Snowden=E2=80=99s mission to expose America=E2=80=99s surve=

state. First, she=E2=80=99s installed a wall of papers that she received in=
<br>
response to an ongoing Freedom of Information lawsuit the Electronic<br>
Frontier Foundation filed on her behalf against the FBI. The documents<br>
definitively show why Poitras was tracked and repeatedly searched at<br>
the US border for years, and even that she was the subject of a grand<br>
jury investigation. And second, a book she=E2=80=99s publishing to accompan=
y<br>
the exhibit includes her journal from the height of that surveillance,<br>
recording her first-person experience of becoming a spying subject,<br>
along with her inner monologue as she first corresponded with the<br>

The heavily redacted documents show that the US Army Criminal<br>

at the time, and reported that she =E2=80=9Cbecame significantly nervous=E2=
=80=9D and<br>
denied filming from the roof. He later told the Army investigators<br>
that he =E2=80=9Cstrongly believed=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94but without apparent ev=
idence=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CPOITRAS had<br>
prior knowledge of the ambush and had the means to report it to U.S.<br>
Forces; however, she purposely did not report it so she could film the<br>
attack for her documentary.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
One page shown in the Whitney exhibit reveals that the New York field<br>
office of the FBI was tracking Poitras=E2=80=99 home addresses, and Poitras=
<br>
believes the reference to a =E2=80=9Cdetective=E2=80=9D working with the FB=
I indicates<br>
the New York Police Department may have also been involved. By 2007,<br>
the documents reveal that there was a grand jury investigation<br>
proceeding on whether to indict her for unnamed crimes=E2=80=94multiple<br>
subpoenas sought information about her from redacted sources. (Poitras<br>
says that the twelve pages she published in the Whitney exhibition are<br>
only a selection of 800 documents she=E2=80=99s received in her FOIA lawsui=
t,<br>
which is ongoing.)<br>
Being Constantly Watched<br>
<br>
Private as ever, Poitras declined to detail to WIRED exactly how she<br>
experienced that federal investigation in the years that followed. But<br>
flash forward to late 2012, and the surveillance targeting Poitras had<br>
transformed her into a nervous wreck. In the book, she shares a diary<br>
she kept during her time living in Berlin, in which she describes<br>
feeling constantly watched, entirely robbed of privacy. =E2=80=9CI haven=E2=
=80=99t<br>
written in over a year for fear these words are not private,=E2=80=9D are t=
he<br>
journal=E2=80=99s first words. =E2=80=9CThat nothing in my life can be kept=
 private.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
She sleeps badly, plagued with nightmares about the American<br>
government. She reads Cory Doctorow=E2=80=99s Homeland and re-reads 1984,<b=
r>
finding too many parallels with her own life. She notes her computer<br>
glitching and =E2=80=9Cgoing pink=E2=80=9D during her interviews with NSA<b=
r>
whistleblower William Binney, and that it tells her its hard drive is<br>
full despite seeming to have 16 gigabytes free. Eventually she moves<br>
to a new apartment that she attempts to keep =E2=80=9Coff the radar=E2=80=
=9D by<br>
avoiding all cell phones and only accessing the Internet over the<br>
anonymity software Tor.<br>
<br>
When Snowden contacts her in January of 2013, Poitras has lived with<br>
the specter of spying long enough that she initially wonders if he<br>
might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like Julian<br>
Assange or Jacob Appelbaum, an activist and Tor developer. =E2=80=9CIs C4 a=
<br>
trap?=E2=80=9D she asks herself, using an abbreviation of Snowden=E2=80=99s=
 codename.<br>
=E2=80=9CWill he put me in prison?=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
Even once she decides he=E2=80=99s a legitimate source, the pressure threat=
ens<br>
to overwhelm her. The stress becomes visceral: She writes that she<br>
feels like she=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cunderwater=E2=80=9D and that she can hear=
 the blood rushing<br>
through her body. =E2=80=9CI am battling with my nervous system,=E2=80=9D s=
he writes.<br>
=E2=80=9CIt doesn=E2=80=99t let me rest or sleep. Eye twitches, clenched th=
roat, and<br>
now literally waiting to be raided.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
Finally she decides to meet Snowden and to publish his top secret<br>
leaks, despite her fears of both the risks to him and to herself. Both<br>
the journal and the documents she obtained from the government show<br>
how her own targeting helped to galvanize her resolve to expose the<br>
apparatus of surveillance. =E2=80=9CHe is prepared for the consequences of =
the<br>
disclosure,=E2=80=9D she writes, then admits: =E2=80=9CI really don=E2=80=
=99t want to become<br>
the story.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
In the end, Poitras has not only escaped the arrest or indictment she<br>
feared, but has become a kind of privacy folk hero: Her work has<br>
helped to noticeably shift the world=E2=80=99s view of government spying, l=
ed<br>
to legislation, and won both a Pulitzer and an Academy Award. But if<br>
her ultimate fear was to =E2=80=9Cbecome the story,=E2=80=9D her latest rev=
