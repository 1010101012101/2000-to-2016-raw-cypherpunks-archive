Remark: Just wonder how many later hackers started by bypassing
parental/school network limits.  Strict rules are just encouraging the right

With limited budget is also not a bad idea to collect the components and other
'computer waste' from luckier friends and build an own computer for free.

Kids will always win. At least in the long run. ;-)
