Doing the same, see lower.

Or they have your IP listed in a block of "Cable/DSL" and reject mail from
there as suspected spam. (Not everything is done for surveillance, even if
it is the side effect.)

I had a brief correspondence on this topic with RoadRunner, who was
refusing my mail for this reason. The workaround was adding a rule to the
smtproutes file, routing the mails for *.rr.com through another server in
my care, which is on different IP block.
