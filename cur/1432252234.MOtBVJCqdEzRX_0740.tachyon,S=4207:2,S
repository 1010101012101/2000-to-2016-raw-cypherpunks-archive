Polycentric law is not anarchy. The fact that something is unregulated
does not equate to anarchy either. Polycentric law is clearly not
equivalent to unregulated either. For each center to communicate and
cooperate there MUST be agreements (ie tests of faith and intent) between
the factions. Those agreements must, in a large part at least, follow the
tenets and beliefs of each party. If there is too disparate a difference
between the cultures then no cooperation is really possible. Anarchy is the 
denial of regulation, not the lack of same. Randomness does not equal
anarchy.

Most people (actually most life) live lives where one day looks pretty
much like the next. Anarchy is not a norm anywhere (ie animal societies or
even say a rain forest as an example of a multi-dependent ecology) except
in human society. Why? Because there's no possibility for a 'leader' to
develop in the first place.

Anarchy is a function of human psychology, not some axiomatic aspect of
nature. It's a rejection of 'community' in a real sense (consider what
happens to a wolf that breaks the pack code).
