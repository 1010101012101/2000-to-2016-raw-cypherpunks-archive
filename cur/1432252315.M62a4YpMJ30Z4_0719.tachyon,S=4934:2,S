	Indeed. 

	And what I'm getting at is that there are people in the
	'security'  industry who either consider politicians and the
	state to be a 'necessary evil', or worse, think that politicians
	and the political system they serve, are A Good Thing.

	In a nearby mailing list, there are a bunch of people who are
	funded by the american military(psycho killers) to create a so
	called 'anomity network'. Regardless of how good they are at
	writing code, their political beliefs are sick garbage. They
	operate on the laughable premise that they are the 'good guys'
	
	Same people who, when called out on the source of their
	funding  have one argument : "you're a tinfoil conspiracy
	theorist!" (Wait, of course, that's not an argument, just
	puerile name-calling)

	So, I didn't mean that politicians are above engineers. I mean
	that political beliefs and understanding of political theory
	are more important than crypto knowledge.


	When a guy comes along quoting thomas jefferson and the like,
	rest assured he's part of the problem.
