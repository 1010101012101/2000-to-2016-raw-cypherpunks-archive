Do you think its creating a hash of normalized data base 
entries?  Oppsss... it is.

Nah, that's not how its done at all... the U.S. government gets someone 
(even the cruiseline, which after all is a regulated carrier) to place a 
back-door in their software so it can be remotely accessed just like the 
NSA sits on top of peering-pint routers and has a duplicate data stream 
quitely created so it can sift through passenger logs without 
asking.  Rememeber the bruhaha over the KLM flight that was denied entry 
into U.S. air space last year when the DHS reported that the flight had two 
people aboard on their watch list?  Now I just wonder who they knew that.....

Imagine the possible impact to this clandestine monitoring when people 
start using the recent 'Gilmore' ruling and traveling (at least 
domestically) without presenting identify papers.
