Seems to me that having people in public places armed with
weapons is wonderful. Mostly hand stuff so far, but there were
a few heavy MGs around Lower Manhattan for a brief period
after D-Day. RPG launchers and backpacks filled with reloads
is darned exciting compared to the usually attention getting
couture. You see this good stuff in photos of foreign lands
but seldom here at home where most of it manufactured
but not worn around the neighborhood and at work and play.

Well, sure gun shows show piddly fashion ornaments, but
not the heavy killers. And air shows of WMDs are widely
spaced, the best overseas. More needed at home, mix
the warplanes with the airliners, good for protection and
exciting for passengers and top guns alike.

We get very sexy carrier fighters overhead producing hand
pumps of drugged-carzed adorables, and even kids unhooked
of Ritalin happily play at Stingering Army copters racing up 
the Hudson shuttling arm-chair generalas to and from West 
Point to the day's battleground at the television networks.

Militarizing the United States at home finals brings into the
open what has been going on in the national security closet
since Pearl Harbor, the original world's greatest work of art.

Do not indelicately use the F-word to describe this phenom,
just dress up and enjoy flaunting your best and meanest
attitude. 

Hate takes less muscle than love and a lot more expensively
wasteful and cowardly armaments.

*ill, *ill, *ill! It's so 7th Avenue. Not at all fascist, except like a
darling *itler couture wind-up-doll.
