I talked to Datacell roughly a year ago. They were fine with an exit
relay, but at the time were distracted by suing Visa. 

The only issue was pure cost. Traffic leaving Iceland costs a lot. I
wasn't prepared to spend ISK300,000 per month for a 100 mbps exit relay.

Maybe times have changed and traffic from Iceland is not so expensive
anymore.
