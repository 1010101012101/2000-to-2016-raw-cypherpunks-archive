Thanks. I try not to quote my own ancient writings, but it's clear that 
a lot of the posters of the past couple of years are not familiar with 
the older writings (which is sort of excusable...) and have not thought 
deeply about the issues (which is not).

I take no position one way or another. But "common carrier" status is 
not something that is automatically achieved. The telephone companies 
got it, to prevent phone companies from being shut down or from 
listening in on conversations. I'm not an expert in the history of 
"common carrier" legislation. (It may be described in Ithiel de sola 
Pool's seminal history of the telephone and liberty, though.)

My point was the claim some are making that government may "license all 
remailers" seems unlikely.

I often talk about "re-commenters" (hyphen added to emphasize the 
"commenter" part). If I get mail, or letters, or e-mail, and then pass 
it along to my friends or others, WHERE IN THE FIRST does it say I need 
permission from government?

Imagine someone sent to prison for the crime of passing along messages 
he received.

There may be an item in the Cyphernomicon about this misconception, that 
common carrier status is something people apply for. It used to be 
claimed by some (don't here it as much anymore) than even bookstores 
could be treated as common carriers "so long as they didn't screen the 
books they sold."

The CDA did indeed give safe harbor...but what the CDA giveth, CDA II or 
the Children's Protection Act can taketh away.

No significant precedents in this area that I have ever heard of.
