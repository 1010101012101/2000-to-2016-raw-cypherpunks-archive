Well finally. An actual republican CONSERVATIVE (or at least right now).

The thing that most neo-Cons don't seem to get is that "speed" doesn't 
matter. If it hasn't been authorized by law, then tough luck: We'll just 
have to take the Al-Qaeda hit until we authorize otherwise. Supporters of 
any extra-legal plan deployed by "leaders" without our collective legal 
consent need killin'. Quick.

Fuck the plan. Fuck their "protection".

>   WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the
>   Senate Judiciary Committee, says President George W. Bush's warrantless
>   surveillance program appears to be illegal.
>
>   Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Specter called the administration's
>   legal reasoning "strained and unrealistic" and said the program appears 
>to
>   be "in flat violation" of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
>
>   Hearings into the surveillance program are scheduled to begin Monday on
>   Capitol Hill.
>
>   Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, the former head of the National Security
>   Agency, defended the surveillance on ABC's "This Week" and the Fox News
>   Network, the International Herald Tribune reported.
>
>   "It's about speed," General Hayden said in his ABC appearance. "It's

>
>   The Bush administration says the surveillance has been carefully

>   and targeted at individuals with known or strongly suspected terrorist
>   ties. But officials have also given different estimates of the amount of
