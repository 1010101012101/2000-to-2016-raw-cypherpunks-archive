Well, if I was smuggling capacitors into Iraq I certainly wouldn't use a 
thumbdrive!
But the above is pretty much the way I see it: 'reglar' folks can't 'figure 
out' my thumbprint, and couldn't use binoculars or whatever to see my 
password.

More importantly, I don't have a lot of time to try to come up with some 
soft/hard gadget on my own these days. I pretty much need to be able to BUY 
something and come up to speed pretty quickly on how to use it. I need it 
like sex: cheap/dirty/fast. I can't really spend a lot of time worrying 
about some hyper-evil, hyper-powerful fed (just yet).

Aside from the deniability aspect, another "upgrade" would be for me to be 
able to use my thumbprint as a PGP password. Then this thumbdrive wouldn't 
be readable via some off-the-shelf pin reader that any helpdesk knucklehead 
could buy.

SO both of these upgrades might be available by fairly simple hacks, or by 
pestering Trek for them. I wouldn't have to spend a few weeks down in 
Dexter's laboratory coming up with a completely new, God-proof device. And 
then as further easy upgrades become available, I'll grab 'em. And who 
knows? With enough little hacks, some gadgets may eventually morph into 
inexpensive but quite fierce little black boxes. (As guitarist Robert Fripp 
has said: "Incremental changes are transformative.")

Cheap, fast, easy, and MASSIVELY scalability: that's the real end-run.
