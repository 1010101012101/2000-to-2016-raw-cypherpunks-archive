If you are trying to influence poles and the polish government, why the 
"international media"?

What it actually means is that you are asking the American elite and the 
New York Times to live up to its professed principles and go easy on 
Poland - acknowledging that that US is the hegemon.

Nothing terribly wrong with this on ACTA, an international treaty.  But 
when you are supposedly revolting against your own government, seeking 
the overthrow of a supposedly oppressive regime, appealing for US 
support is treason against your local elites and local people.
