IRS Agent Goes Berserk, Assaults Citizen Local Cops, Sheriff Refuse to
Prosecute
http://www.4bypass.com/feature.htm

by Pat Shannan Dec. 2001

A sign spotted recently over the door of one IRS office says: "Seizure
Fever ­ Catch It!" Word has it that the IRS agent with the best seizure
rate for the week is rewarded with a brief respite and other job "perks."
Apparently the pressure to hit his weekly plunder bonus was more than one
revenuer could stand, and when he was asked to show the law justifying his
actions, he blew a head gasket.

The Oct. 2 incident occurred when Wiley Davis, an IRS Team Manager from
Colorado, became agitated with Las Vegas resident Ken Nicholson, 37, during
a hearing to discuss an IRS lien against some property owned by Nicholson's
friend, Keith Milbourn. Davis, 45, had been brought in from Denver
specifically for the Milbourn case.

The Las Vegas Tribune first reported the altercation as arising from a tax
dispute involving an IRS lien against some property belonging to Ken
Nicholson. This was inaccurate. Nicholson had gone along as counsel for his
friends, Keith and Shawna Milbourn, and as a witness to the proceedings. It
was Milbourn's case that was in dispute. They had also taken along court
reporter Beatrice Conner, who caught the whole incident on audiotape.

Nicholson had Power of Attorney to speak for Milbourn, 32. Davis was
assisted by a female agent. Throughout the hearing, the two men made it
clear that they were not going to take Davis' word for anything and would
need actual documentation to prove the IRS' stand. Finally, Nicholson said
that they would be willing to pay whatever the IRS claimed Milbourn owed if
Davis could:

1) Produce a Notice and Demand for the tax; and

2) Give a Code Section which made Milbourn liable.

Nicholson said, and witnesses as well as the tape recording concur, that
Davis did not attempt to produce that evidence but instead became visibly
angry, lost his self-control and attacked Nicholson.

Offense is the Best Defense

"Out of nowhere," said Nicholson, "he jumped up out of his chair and came
around the table, grabbed my chair, and began bouncing it up and down. He
shoved it forward and pushed me toward the table. [In the process,] my legs
came apart and were straddling the arm of the chair. With three or four
quick jerks, he yanked the arm of the chair upward and into my groin. Then
he grabbed me and began to physically evict me from the room."

Security officers came in and stopped the melee at the Oakley Boulevard
office of the IRS in Las Vegas.

Court stenographer Beatrice Conner was shocked speechless when Nicholson
was knocked to the floor. "It was totally without provocation," she said.
"He (Davis) was so angry and violent that if he had had a gun, he would
have pulled it out!"

Keith Milbourn, who witnessed the whole meeting and scuffle, gave more
details:

"By the time we called the police there were about ten people in the
hallway including other agents, the witnesses and security guards,"
Milbourn told us, adding that the other IRS agent who was in the room,
Renee Swells, was "surprised and shocked" by Davis' action. Swells was
unavailable for comment.

Milbourn and Nicholson had called 911 "and the cops arrived in five minutes
all gung-ho and ready to arrest Ken. However, when they heard the tape
played back, they all fell silent, not knowing what to do."

So the officers did nothing. No arrest was made.

Both men said they tried to report the incident to the U.S. attorney's
office, as well as the FBI, but both Justice Department entities declined
to take their report. The same proved to be true at the county level with
Sheriff Jerry Keller.

"I know that if I would have assaulted the IRS agent, I would be sitting in
jail right now," Nicholson said. "But because the IRS agent is the one who
assaulted me, Metro [Las Vegas Police] only took a statement and let him
go."

Hidden Ball Trick

When the Metro police came out, Nicholson gave a voluntary statement backed
up by his witnesses and the tape recording. He was told that he would have
to wait five days before the report would be actually recorded in the
police records.

"On the sixth day, I went in and found out that no police report had been
made at all. When I demanded that the report be filed and made official, I
was told that I had a statute of limitations of five days to ask and demand
prosecution from the date of the incident and that now I was too late."

In other words, Nicholson was hoodwinked by officialdom. A spokesman for
the Las Vegas Police Department said that investigators informed Nicholson
he had to contact the department within five days of the incident if he
wanted to initiate action against Davis, since it was "just a misdemeanor
battery." LVMPD officials are sticking to their story that Nicholson had
not contacted the department seeking action against Davis.

The spokesman also said the department gave all of the information to the
IRS Criminal Investigation Division. No announcement has been forthcoming
as to whether Davis has been terminated, placed on leave pending an
investigation, or is being held for psychiatric observation.

"If Nicholson wants prosecution, he can contact the general investigations
division within the department and they can move forward on it," the
unnamed spokesman added. However, the frustrations of not seeing any
justice in the criminal courts have motivated Nicholson toward a civil
action.
