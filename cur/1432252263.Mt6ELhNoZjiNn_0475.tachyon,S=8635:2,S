(sidenote: what if a future "electronic monetary system" that relied on
community taxation would have a voting option, such that 50% of taxes go
towards a general system of operation, and the other 50%, say based on
income, can be steered into categories of funding (e.g. crime prevention).
such that localities or demographics could focus their tax contribution
towards the issues of most relevance. in a realm of electronic currency,
perhaps this could even be fractional, 0.001 percent of individual taxes
going toward certain issues, say specific hereditary disease research based
on given genetics, etc. and perhaps this micro-level adjustability of taxes
could help both at the general level and allow steering of policy towards a
more ground-up or public representational approach, via constituencies, by
how they vote through their directed tax-feedback; with a robust fielded
electronic monetary system, perhaps even a flat tax or sales tax model
could do such fractional micro-taxation at the POS cash register, via a
centralized system that sorts or divides a particular tax (for clothing,
say, at a store) and takes some amount for a general fund and a remainder
for such issues, as preferenced by each individual. info tech & currency
versus paper-based bureaucracy as it seems today with formwork, outdated
modeling for lightspeed data exchange and information transmission.)
