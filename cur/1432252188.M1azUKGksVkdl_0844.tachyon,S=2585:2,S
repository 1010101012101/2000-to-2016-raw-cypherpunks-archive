For those of you who want to defend the Bill of Rights a bit more 
assertively, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership and Investment 
Arms, Inc. have produced a Second Amendment Commemorative Pistol.  Based on 
the 1911 Colt .45 auto pistol, and limited to a run of 100, the gun sells 
for $2495.00.  In addition to a lot of 2nd amendment commentary on the 
slide, the whole Bill of Rights are engraved on the artificial 
mother-of-pearl pistol grips.

Photos of the gun are available on the JPFO website:
