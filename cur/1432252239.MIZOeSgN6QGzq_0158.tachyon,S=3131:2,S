How dare they try to stop an important person such as her? Checkpoints
are for the little people!


As for the headline, "Clinton OK After Airport Accident", truly, her
health was not the first thing on my mind. Nor would I have called it an
accident. I would call it Aggravated Assault upon a Police Office or
Peace Officer (NY Penal Code 120.11). But of course that's for the
little people.
