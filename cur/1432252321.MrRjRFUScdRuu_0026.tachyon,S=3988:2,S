Ah, I was talking about Florida law. To wit:

a.  One witness, who is a registered voter in the state, must affix
his or her signature, printed name, address, voter identification
number, and county of registration on the voter's certificate. Each
witness is limited to witnessing five ballots per election unless
certified as an absentee ballot coordinator. A candidate may not serve
as an attesting witness.

b.  Any notary or other officer entitled to administer oaths or any
Florida supervisor of elections or deputy supervisor of elections,
other than a candidate, may serve as an attesting witness.
