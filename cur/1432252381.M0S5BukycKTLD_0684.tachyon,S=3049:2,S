Compatability with Wurd users. A lot of customers, especially suit
types, give you Word and Excel files (or, worse, PowerPoint, gag), even
when the app is being implemented on *NIX. A fair number of commercial
publications want articles and stories to be submitted as Word docs. And
sometimes when you're putting in a bid to a corp, they require the
proposal both as hardcopy and as Word and Excel files.
