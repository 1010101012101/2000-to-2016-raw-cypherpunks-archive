That's a fair argument. But again, you work with what you have.

We all use knives, which military use to kill. One of my favorites is an
old German gravity knife, used by paratroopers. It's very convenient for
one-handed use.

If he had done it without Tor, he would have been in jail a lot sooner!

It is likely that he pushed his luck too far using Tor.

Nested VPN chains are also vulnerable to global adversaries. It may be
that all low-latency anonymity systems that can scale to many users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.

Yes, we do keep coming back to the same circular discussion, don't we?

I'm concerned that Tor is pwned by US military, but I'm not convinced
that rejecting it entirely is the best course.

That's not really a backdoor. You argue that Tor is vulnerable to global
adversaries, and was designed that way. But it's not just Tor. It seems
that all low-latency anonymity systems that scale to numerous users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.

I'm just saying that you don't know for sure. You may think that you do.
But there's just too much uncertainty. You said as much in another
thread. The issue is what to do when there's uncertainty. We disagree.

Pretty much ;) At least, initial development of computers was mainly
driven by military.

I was pointing to the difficulty of interpreting global intercepts.

Yes. I thought that was clear.

OK, thanks, that's what I thought.

More than damaged, I want to see governments gone.

Sure they would. Nuclear weapons, for example. Or biological warfare,
which is now pretty much doable at home. Or personal computers and the
Internet :)

>> I'm just wanting to clarify your position.

Thanks.
