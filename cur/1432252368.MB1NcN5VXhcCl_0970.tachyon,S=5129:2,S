You may well be right about the accepted definition of 
non-repudiation, but if you are then I would amend my remarks to say 
that known cryptographic technology cannot provide non-repudiation 
service unless we are willing to create a new legal duty for 
individuals and corporations to protect their secret key or accept 
what ever consequences ensue.  I don't think that is acceptable.

I find the rest of your comment a tad too opaque.  Could you give 
some examples of what you have in mind?
