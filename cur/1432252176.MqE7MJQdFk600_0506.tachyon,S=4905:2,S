Hi:  You may be interested in covering a meeting on Internet Privacy
and E-mail Security hosted by the Kitchener Waterloo Internet Users
Group on Tuesday, 26 September 2000 at 7:00pm in the William G. Davis
Computer Research Centre in the University of Waterloo campus.

Robert Guerra from the Toronto Cypherpunks and cryptographer Richard
Outerbridge will be discussing the lack of Internet privacy -- what
can Web site operators find out about you without your permission,
and
how do they profit from it?  There will be demonstration of the PGP
software available to secure your e-mail from the FBI snooping tool
Carnivore, a discussion of the Anonymity decision by the Ontario
Superior Court and an update on the Canadian Privacy law.  Those
people already protecting their privacy with PGP will be able to
exchange encryption keys.

The Kitchener Waterloo Internet Users Group (KWIUG) has been meeting
since 1995 to provide information about the Internet to everyone from
"newbies" to experienced industry professionals.  Meetings are free
and open to all; there is no membership fee.  KWIUG meets on the
fourth Tuesday of every month in the William G. Davis Computer
Research Centre on the University of Waterloo campus.

For more information please see the KWIUG Website at
<http://www.kwiug.org> or contact Bob Jonkman at <bjonkman@sobac.com>
or by phone at +1-519-669-0388.
