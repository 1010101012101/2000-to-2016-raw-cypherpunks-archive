Most of the experience I have with Akamai is with them hosting 
high-traffic websites with geographically distributed servers.  I 
thought they had mostly gone bust, but it's possible they're still 
doing it.   A lot of websites a couple years ago talked about being 
"akamaized", meaning that they had their site hosted by akamai to allow 
for good server response time all around the country.
