	This is NOT Code Red but another assinine E-Mail worm that
also tries IIS and netbios propagation.  Unfortunately, it is being
VERY successful at all of the above.  More like "Code Red on Steriords".
Not just Grannie and her hotmail account with an MS Mail client but it's
even propagating to Samba shares and other SMB connections with "guest"
accounts.

	Nothing targeted like that...

	To paraphrase the movie "Labyrinth"...  No...  Just a worm...
