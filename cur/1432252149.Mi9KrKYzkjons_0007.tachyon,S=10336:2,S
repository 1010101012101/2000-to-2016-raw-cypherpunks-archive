Cross-posted without permission from another list. This one's on-topic
in a know-your-enemy sort of way. As near to a reasoned argument for net
censorship as you can get. Needless to say I disagree with it. (As does
Yaman - he is merely the messenger here). The section that begins "The
fact that the Internet is an international medium " is particularly
incoherent.

The IWF is a UK ISP's club, John Carr is a well-known campaigner against
freedom of speech, the issue is whether ISPs should be expected to
censor newsfeeds.
