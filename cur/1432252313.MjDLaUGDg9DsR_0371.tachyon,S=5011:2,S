Panelists Say Combating Terrorist Threats Must Not Erode Freedoms
By Derrill Holly, Associated Press Writer
Published: Sep 24, 2001

ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - A national strategy to combat terrorism should not
compromise the Bill of Rights, members of a presidentially appointed
counterterrorism panel said Monday.

"Americans must never be asked to give up a single solitary right that they
have under the Constitution," said Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va.
Gilmore has chaired the advisory panel, charged with assessing the nation's
ability to respond to terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, since
its creation in April 1999. He said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 have
accelerated efforts to produce the panel's third and final report.
Although the document is not due until December, it will be released to
members of Congress early next month as members consider a raft of
counterterrorism proposals.

"We're not trying to set up some super intelligence agency," said Gilmore.
He and other panel members see the role of the new Office of Homeland
Security as a planning and coordination agency. Its primary duties would
include budgetary oversight, with little emphasis on investigation,
interdiction and apprehension of suspected terrorists.

Gilmore said state and local officials should work with federal law
enforcement agencies to respond to any threats. "If that's overwhelmed you,
bring in the guard or the military as a last resort," he said.

The meeting was held at the RAND Corporation Headquarters just blocks away
from the soot-stained western wall of the Pentagon, where terrorists flew an
American Airlines jet into the building.

The 17-member panel was also directly touched by the attacks on the World
Trade Center. Member Raymond Downey, the New York City Fire Department's
commander of special operations, died when he was struck by falling debris
as the Twin Towers collapsed.

Those on the panel contend the events have not altered the recommendations
they will make to the White House.

"Some of the things we've been saying now for two years are still very
relevant," said Michael A. Wermuth, a senior policy analyst at RAND.
The creation of a National Office for Combating Terrorism was included in
the panel's second report, released last December.

"There's going to be reaction in this country, and we want to ensure that
it's well timed and appropriately focused," said panel member George
Foresman, Deputy State Coordinator for the Virginia State Department of
Emergency Management.
