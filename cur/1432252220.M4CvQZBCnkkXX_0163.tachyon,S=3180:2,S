Subject: [liberationtech] What I've learned from Cryptocat

https://crypto.cat will soon stop being a web-based service, and will
only exist as a browser extension.
The question is, what should future web-app developers do if they need
crypto? Rewrite all crypto primitives from scratch [and hope there's
enough interest in reviewing the code], then let users install yet
another extension?

I believe there's a better solution. I've posted something about it. I
hope some of you would  find it interesting.
