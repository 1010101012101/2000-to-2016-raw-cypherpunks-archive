third party verification and split encryption key structures,

                              Here we get to the meat of the issue... the

    Sick em Adam!!
    A cypherpunk whois tiring of government schemes to shell out
    privacy companies.
p.s. that freedom source code 2.0 for linux I was porting to BSD I guess will go
