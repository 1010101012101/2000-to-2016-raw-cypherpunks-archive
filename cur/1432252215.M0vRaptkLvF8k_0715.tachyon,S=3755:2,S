the answer to THAT is quite obvious, isn't it?

I never sign anything that's not plain text.


if you put your signature on a multi-page document without opening it,
that's your fault.
I know the word example is more complicated, and most people have 0.0
clue about those possibilities, but again: that's their problem. don't
sign something that you don't understand.
