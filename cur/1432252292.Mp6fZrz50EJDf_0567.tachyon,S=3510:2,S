I agree, but both of us are possessed of some clue.  It can be 
argued that nymity also benefits the non-techie, but this is the 
same audience that doesn't use PGP because it's too complicated 
(notwithstanding the Eudora and Outlook plugins).  For the 
Linophobes, Windows is the only apparent choice.

On second thought, perhaps this isn't the problem I had thought it 
to be.  "Think of it as evolution in action."
