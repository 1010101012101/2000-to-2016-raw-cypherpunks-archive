This actually pisses me off.

Unlike more hard-line cypherpunks, I'm not (yet) convinced that 
government-originated laws are an inherent evil, even when I don't agree 
with them. The main problem comes when administration of these laws pretty 
much boils down to the whim of a local "authority". In this case the 
traveler didn't "look" like a terrorist, so he was OK. If the very same guy 
attempted this same procedure on the very next day, though wearing a "Stop 
Bush" shirt, I'd bet any amount of money he'd be denied the right to fly. So 
what it all boils down to is the personal whim of the law "enforcement" 
official, who at best is corrupt and at worst stupid and incompetant.
