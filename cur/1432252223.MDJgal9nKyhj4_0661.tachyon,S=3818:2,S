They stopped selling them to the general public, but you only have to stop
by a DJ record shop (as opposed to the consumer shops) to see a wide
selection of vinyl albums. DJs prefer vinyl primarily because it allows beat
matching by hand, scratching, etc. The only disadvantage I know of for vinyl
is that it degrades as it is played, for a DJ this isn't much of a problem
since tracks have a lifespan that's measured in days or weeks the vinyl
becomes useless after a few weeks, which is how long it lasts at good
quality.
