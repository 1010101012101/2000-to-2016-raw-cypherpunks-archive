Ah yes. Someone else remembers when all those scary Japanese and Germans 
were going to eat all our jobs. So we gave up everything because they had us 
so fucking terrorized. Now we have far fewer vacation hours than either one 
of those countries. Coincidentally, it's around the same time that it became 
fashionable to bitch about how evil the unions are. Question one of the 
'sheeple' on why the unions are so bad and they'll give you little anecdotes 
and incomprehensible arguments ("the unions are bad because they force 
employers to pay overtime"). (And let's remember that I'm not attempting to 
make a pro-union point here. I'm pointing to media and other manipulation of 
the American psyche into accepting the ratwheel we're all on now.)


"The US spent the Soviet Union into bankrupcy, and rebuilt a military force
that can threaten any nation in the world, not because of Manifest
Destiny, but by working its citizens harder than any other decent nation
was willing to do.  Citizens too dumb to understand that economic control
of a population is not morally superior to control at the point of a gun."

Damn straight. "Too dumb"...I might agree with that but I think there's a 
lot more to it. Too terrorized, too successfully propagandized, too willing 
to live vicariously through the ostenisbly functional relationships on TV, 
and don't forget just too damned tired to give a crap about anything but 
trying to get a decent night's sleep when possible, and make it safely to 
the grave without becomming homeless in the process...
