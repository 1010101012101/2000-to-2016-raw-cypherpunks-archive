There's been lots of net speculation about maliciousness, but for me the odds
of 3/4 failures of undersea cables in such  a relatively  small area and over
such a short amount of time is extremely suspicious, particularly given how
robust such cables are. (ie, there's maybe a dozen in the whole world at any
one time, over millions of route miles).

Whether these are JbT-type terrorists is, I think, doubtful given the revenues
traveling over these things and particularly how  ineffective the cuts were.
The cuts certainly appeared to me to be attempts to get a working+protect
sides of fiber rings by people who didn't have access to that level of detail
about how the rings are deployed over the wavelength/fiber/cable pairs.
