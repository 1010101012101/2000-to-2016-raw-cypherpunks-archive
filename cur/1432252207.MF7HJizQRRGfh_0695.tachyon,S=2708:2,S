Your skepticism is fitting.  In fact, even the TOR documentation
concurs:

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination.

Good stuff.  Stick with it.

    Long, random latency is part of the price of Internet anonymity.
