=A0=A0=A0 I don't quite know why I received the message below, but I am ans=
wering (including cypherpunks@cpunks.org) since it seems a good time to do =
so given the humorous connection to my isotopically-modified optical fiber =
invention.=A0 And, I would like to make a request, indeed an offer.=0A=0A=
=A0=A0=A0 A few weeks ago, when I re-appeared on cypherpunks.org, I pointed=
 out that my patent application was recently (mid-July 2013) published by t=
he US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).=A0 See=A0 http://www.freepatents=
online.com/WO2013101261A1.html=A0=A0=A0=A0 This is an invention that I thou=
ght of in December 2008, stuck in a prison cell at USP Tucson:=A0 I realize=
d that much of the index of refraction of ordinary silica (which is about 1=
.46; of that amount above an index of 1.000) was due to the presence of Si-=
29 atoms.=A0 (Si-29 is the only naturally-existing silicon atom with an 'el=
ectromagnetic spin', due to its unpaired neutron circulating in the nucleus=
.)=A0 I concluded that by dramatically reducing the proportion of Si-29 ato=
ms, which amount to about 4.67% atom/atom in ordinary silicon, it would be =
possible to make silica with a much-lower index of refraction:=A0=A0 Probab=
ly between 1.10 and 1.02, but the amount is uncertain.=0A=A0=A0=A0 One big =
advantage of this fiber will be a far-higher 'velocity factor', approaching=
 0.90-0.98 of 'c', where 'c' is physicist-speak for the speed of light in a=
 vacuum, compared with ordinary silicon optical fibers with a velocity fact=
or of 1/1.46, or 0.685 of 'c'.=A0 This will amount to a dramatically-faster=
 signal velocity.=A0=A0 While not quite as fast as line-of-sight microwave,=
 or neutrino-beams piercing the earth, it would be significant.=A0=A0 =0A=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=0A Other advantages will be a=0A reduction in optical loss by =
perhaps a factor of 10x (from perhaps 0.19 db/km in existing fibers to 0.01=
9 db/km), a reduction of optical dispersion by a similar factor of 10x, and=
 an increase in useable optical bandwidth from 50 nanometers wavelength (15=
10-1560 nm) to 800 nm (1000-1800 nm).=A0 (The practical limit on fiber tend=
s to be the limitation on the gain-bandwidth of EDFA's;=A0 Erbium-Doped Fib=

eparing a prototype for this fiber, which will cost between $200-250K.=A0 (=
USD).=A0 I have received a committment for this amount.=A0 However, having =
filed for a US Patent (specifically, a PCT or 'Patent Cooperation Treaty' f=
iling), it will be necessary to file for many dozens more 'national-stage' =
patents:=A0 The way patents work, around the world, is that a person must f=
ile for a patent in each nation around the world that he desires to have pa=
tent-protection in.=A0 A national-stage patent costs about $10,000.=A0 Gene=
rally, the reasoning is that an inventor should file for a patent in any co=
untry:=0A1.=A0=A0=A0 Where a significant amount of the invention will be ma=
de.=0A2.=A0=A0=A0=A0 Where a significant amount of the invention will be us=
ed.=0A=A0=A0=A0 If I assume that the royalty per meter of fiber is $0.25/me=
ter (25 American cents per meter), it would be worth filing for a patent if=
 the amount of fiber made or used is $10,000/$0.25, or 40,000 meters of fib=
er.=A0 This would be about 1.1 kilometers of cable that has 36 fibers in it=
.=A0 Obviously, even the smallest country would use enough fiber to justify=
 obtaining a patent.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 There are 148 PCT-signatory countries.=
=A0 =A0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_cooperation_treaty =A0=A0 I wou=
ld like to obtain, at the very least, national-stage patents in at least 40=
 nations, probably 80 nations, and possibly as much as 120 nations.=A0 That=
 would cost about $400,000, $800,000, or $1.2 million. (USD).=A0=A0 I have =
considered raising the money by means of a Kickstarter campaign, but that s=
ite is oriented to collecting donations of money:=A0 It is specifically pro=
hibited that a project proponent promise a financial return on such a contr=
ibution.=A0 But I'm not looking for a handout:=A0 I'm looking for a loan wh=
ich will be paid back.=A0=A0 Perhaps that's called a 'bond'? =0A=A0=A0=A0 H=
ow would it be paid back?=A0 Corning says that 300 billion meters of fiber =
were manufactured in about 2012.=A0 If I get a market-share of 10%, that's =
30 billion meters per year.=A0 At a royalty of, say, $0.25 per meter of fib=
er, that would be $7.5 billion per year.=A0 With even a tiny fraction of su=
ch a value, I could pay a huge return on a loan to finance these national-s=
tage patent applications.=A0 I see nothing wrong with a 3x return:=A0=A0 $3=
 returned for each dollar loaned, probably within 1-2 years.=A0 Does this s=
ound interesting?=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 Jim Bell=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A________________=

nbsp;&nbsp; This is an invention that I thought of in December 2008, stuck =
in a prison cell at USP Tucson:&nbsp; I realized that much of the index of =
refraction of ordinary silica (which is about 1.46; of that amount above an=
 index of 1.000) was due to the presence of Si-29=0A atoms.&nbsp; (Si-29 is=
 the only naturally-existing silicon atom with an 'electromagnetic spin', d=
ue to its unpaired neutron circulating in the nucleus.)&nbsp; I concluded t=
hat by dramatically reducing the proportion of Si-29 atoms, which amount to=
 about 4.67% atom/atom in ordinary silicon, it would be possible to make si=
lica with a much-lower index of refraction:&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably between 1.=
10 and 1.02, but the amount is uncertain.<br><span class=3D"tab">&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp; </span>One big advantage of this fiber will be a far-higher 'veloc=
ity factor', approaching 0.90-0.98 of 'c', where 'c' is physicist-speak for=
 the speed of light in a vacuum, compared with ordinary silicon optical fib=
ers with a velocity factor of 1/1.46, or 0.685 of 'c'.&nbsp; This will amou=
nt to a dramatically-faster signal velocity.&nbsp;&nbsp; While not quite as=
 fast as line-of-sight microwave, or neutrino-beams piercing the earth, it =
would be significant.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br

eduction in optical loss by perhaps a factor of 10x (from perhaps 0.19 db/k=
m in existing fibers to 0.019 db/km), a reduction of optical dispersion by =
a similar factor of 10x, and an increase in useable optical bandwidth from =
50 nanometers wavelength (1510-1560 nm) to 800 nm (1000-1800 nm).&nbsp; (Th=
