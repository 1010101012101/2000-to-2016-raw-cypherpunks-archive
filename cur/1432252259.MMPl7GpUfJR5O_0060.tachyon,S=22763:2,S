its not a 'claim' watch his film that was up for an academy award

there is a scene in mogadishu where he is in the morgue there is a dead
body and him in the scene he is standing right next to it - the person was
hit by a drone strike

no journalist gets filmed with dead bodies it is unethical it never happens

perhaps if you were a journalist in the field you would understand

it isnt 'slander' if it is true so maybe you dont know anything about law
either

just because you have not run across other people criticising the great
perfect white guy jeremy scahill doesnt mean it isnt happening - you seem
to assume a lot and not ask questions just flame out assuming you know
everything i think that is known as narcissism which people go to
psychiatrists to get help working out of as its such a lethal condition but
it isnt easy because narcissists think they are right all the time

besides even if i was the only one criticising jeremy that doesnt prove me
wrong - prove me wrong > go ahead try...

also i knew the 'report' was false that you assume i thought it was true
again proves my premise that you are narcissistic
