Climategate version 1.

One thousand incriminating emails, several hundred incriminating 
documents, released for everyone to see.

Now, we observed the uniform reaction to climategate from the press 
"Nothing to see here, move along", even though every single email was 
incriminating and newsworthy - they were not random emails, they were 
emails someone had selected as being especially and notably vile and evil.

If, however, he had slowly released the emails first to selected 
pressmen, those pressmen would not have been able to refrain from 
exploiting their advantage over other pressmen, and so the documents 
would have received coverage in the mainstream media, first one 
incriminating email, then the next, torture by slow drips.

So, optimal behavior is selective release of incriminating documents to 
specifically chosen and favored individuals, followed by gradually 
broader release of more and more incriminating documents to more and 
more people.
