You don't need to do HTTP at all. Apache can rewrite incoming URLs, so
that "http://" is translated to "https://", eliminating the need for a
redirect.

Metering encrypted email is more difficult... (note that he didn't say
"PGP mail" he said "Encrypted mail"...

But if you stick to something simple, such as PGP only, you could require
the entire message to be a PGP message, and strip off Comments headers,
etc., with relative ease.

Check the mixmaster code to see how non-PGP messages can be rejected in a
simple manner.
