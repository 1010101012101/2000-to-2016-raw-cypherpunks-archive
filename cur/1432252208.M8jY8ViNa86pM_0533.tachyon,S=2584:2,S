That won't help unless you find a way to get random number as good as
the keysize.  The hack itself is trivial but I don't do it because
large keys are a headache for low-end machines and they trick users
into false security assumptions.  I am pretty sure that any PC or
usage of GnuPG can be broken by spending far less money.
