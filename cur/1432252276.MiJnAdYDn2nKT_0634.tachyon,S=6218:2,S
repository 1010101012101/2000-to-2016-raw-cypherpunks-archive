This collection of hypereal, cyberfiction is a the reaction of the
visible-human to everything that is vital hypermodern-translation and
respire our era.
--the development of the insanity in the middle of the DNA=channel that got
complicated!

--read sample--
The cosmic soul-machines of clone boys_mode to the air-line of an ADAM doll.
_resembles to be whether I think about the vector of the cadaver that fused
to the brain universe of asphalt the sun line of lonely masses of flesh:the
love-replicant although cyber dog is road the line of \"the suspicion\" of
replication heaven:that respires the clonical reproduction area of an
artificial ant:the random hatred of the DNA=channel is controlled....the
gene of her grief commits suicide:the matrix body fluid of TV free wild
fancy BABEL animals witnesses....was approximated to nomansland
planetary:her brain cell:the hybrid body of an ant_drug-motion. Noise that
an eye unstable eyes fly radiate heat recovered birth:that becomes broken
unknown:the herd....vital non=being of uterus-machine makes the storage of

Digital=vamp season of the monochrome earth:

Her digital solitude leaps....her digital solitude is cut....her digital

grief of a chromosome is shut down. _like the lost_earth of pupil:of the end

It also shut down even [love]:is eroded to the inorganic substance emotional
circuit of the gimmick girl....the sun of the storage loss the soul-machine
of an ADAM doll/I turn off. Zero speed of....impossibility death replicant
suicide line:that swims gene++TV to the hell of her cell_LOAD

FUCKNAMFUCKNAMFUCKNAM:the lonely nightmare of a cold machine dismantles the
pity=gene of the amniotic fluid mechanism on the human genome TV screen of
an ADAM doll. Storage to that that does her non=being

The brain cell

Emotion that sun eradicated

It breeds like TOKAGE....I solve off/on:the far sleep of an ADAM doll and
release it. The vaioof three/her reproduction quality of the devil of a
chromosome. :image of the threat of an ADAM doll only that respire

The LOAD line machinative angel of her inorganic substance artificial sun
