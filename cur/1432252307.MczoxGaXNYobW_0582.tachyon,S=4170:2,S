> 	Cyber-anarchists don't wear panties.

It is nice that you saw fit to reply to our query.  It is, however, well known
that self-reporting produces the least accurate data[1] an so we are therefore
inclined to discount your responses for the specific purpose of our study.

This is of course by-the-by.  Perhaps we were unclear in our original message.
Our purpose at the present time is to obtain *third* party anecdotal accounts
concerning the pantie question.  After obtaining such, we propose to perform a
detailed second-order analysis with an eye to formulating an intervention
plan.  (Our methodology will be explained in detail at such time as we publish
our findings.)

Since we have found that a subtle approach to intervention works best, you may
in fact never be aware of our efforts, should it come to pass that we decide
to help you become more comfortable with yourself.  You may, in fact, simply
find that one day your reticence to discussing matters concerning underwear in
a definite and uninhibited manner will disappear.  This will be the result of
our contractor's hard work.  You need not worry about a single thing; all this
will be taken care of for you.

You should in no wise take this to mean that we are uninterested in your
feedback and opinions.  We highly value your feelings and should you think it
appropriate to express yourself, please feel free to do so at any time.  We
would like to thank you for your input and would like you to know we look
forward to reading your comments in the future.


Sincerely,

Steve Thompson, PHd
