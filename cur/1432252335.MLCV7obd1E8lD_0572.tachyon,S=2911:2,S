The mainstream Confucian belief, like the mainstream legalist
belief, was that the emperor should have absolute power.  The
Qing dynasty was successful in giving effect to this belief,
and justified that effect on confucian grounds.  This makes
them more confucian, not less confucian, than the Sung dynasty,
for the Sung were confucian merely in intent, much as the
current chinese regime is communist merely in intent.

The Qing dynasty prohibited anyone other than themselves from
owning seagoing boats - that is why I called it the equivalent
of the iron curtain.

The prohibition was not against foreigners sailing, but chinese
sailing, so the intent was not fear of foreigners, but as with
the iron curtain, fear of chinese wandering outside government
control and being contaminated with unauthorized foreign
thoughts.
