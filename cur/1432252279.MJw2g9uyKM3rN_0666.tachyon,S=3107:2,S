At 11:13 PM -0500 11/26/06, Ulex "Europae" (s/b Ulex europaeus, a small
highland shrub; maybe it's trying to speak in the royal 'we', but more
likely Yet Another EuroLefty, apparently of the Scottish* variety) wrote:

Might makes *fact*. "Right" is a fact made palatable by rationalization.
When facts change, ethics change. If you don't believe that, you haven't
read enough history yet.

Physics causes finance, which causes philosophy; ethics in this particular
case.


>penurious antipathy

Blah, blah, blah.

Go back under your bridge, troll. Or at least masturbate about your
"rights" on a list where people give a damn.


Again, for the groundlings, at least, since shrubbery doesn't have ears:
When the market needs ubiquitous easy-to-use encryption it'll get it. When
that's the case nothing the state can do will "repress" it.

And, when somebody writes code worthy of being ubiquitous and easy-to-use,
there's nothing the market will be able do to "repress" it, either. And
somebody will get rich writing it, because the market will pay for it.

So, take your shot, um, Mr. Shrub, and *write* the code you want. Until
then, stop bleating around here about your "rights", and how other people
should do your work for you for free.

Cheers,
RAH
