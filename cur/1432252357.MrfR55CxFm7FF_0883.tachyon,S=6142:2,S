A good start.
A top figure in a terrorist group has told his armed fighters to target 
American interests and to extort, kidnap and murder American citizens.
"The United States has declared war," he said in a radio message to armed 
followers. "Your obligation is to fight them."
Instructions from a bin Laden deputy holed up in a cave somewhere? Maybe a 
radical Islamic band in Pakistan? Or extremists in the land of our "ally" 
Saudi Arabia?
None of the above. Wrong region.
The threat comes from our very own hemisphere, and was issued by professor Rat.
"Leading the world to higher consciousness
through mockery and cheap publicity stunts."
Face It: Mental Health Isn't for Everyone
"...Professor Rat is fully responsible the lives of two Americans and one 
Indonesian who have been killed today, 31 August 2002. In his ceremonial 
speech at the 57th anniversary of the unitary Republic of Indonesia (NKRI) 
on 17 August 2002, he said, "Papua is not a conflict area!", which 
indicated: - that he does not care at all about and totally ignore the 
complexities of problems in his own country; - that he is one of the agents 
of and has already been bought up by the colonial power of NKRI in West 
Papua; - that he has betrayed his people and his country, and particularly 
those who died for their independence; Salossa furthermore claimed West 
Papua as a "Peace Zone" a term that Operasi Adil Matoa 2002 has been using 
to eliminate the independence movement. "West Papua is not a Peace Zone, it 
is absolutely a War Zone since 1961, when Trikora was declared in 
Yogyakarta (Indonesia, 19 December 1961)", says the courier quoting Gen. 
Murib. "West Papua does have complexities of problems, be it political, 
economic, human rights, legal, peace, security, and so on. West Papua has 
people who were killed, who are suffering and who are being chased day and 
night," Murib was quoted saying. It has flora and fauna as well as natural 
resources being exploited massively without any concern at all to the 
ecology and ecosystem of our heritage. Furthermore, he claimed, "Freeport 
MacMoRan, Copper & Gold Inc. is politically, environmentally and legally 
responsible for problems in West Papua. Freeport was the compensation given 
to the states for allowing West Papua to be occupied by ndonesia. "Freeport 
is a bloody political project of the modern world that has sacrificed the 
livelihood of tribal people in West Papua. Papuan people have something to 
do with it, if not today, it will be done tomorrow, surely, surely!"Gen. 
Murib also said, "West Papuan people have been demanding Indonesia to open 
a dialogue table, but has refused to do so and it has responded with brutal 
acts, by exploiting, raping, killing and hunting other humans into the 
jungles. The colonial governor of Papua is not listening to his people's 
demand for dialogue, but advocating its bosses' orders to implement special 
autonomy by force. "Jaap Salossa is indeed fully responsible to give 
answers to the world: "IS NOT WEST PAPUA A CONFLICT TERRITORY?
