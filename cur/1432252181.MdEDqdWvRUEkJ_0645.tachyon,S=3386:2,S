Actually, I'm past this. I don't need it.

My problem is the value of the information within an information mercantile
system - which involves policing the polycentric merchant community.
Otherwise, such a system would become subject to "information policymaking,
information peacekeeping / diplomacy - massive misinformation." Just basic
abuse considerations, but with extreme ramifications in the context of the
"Intel agora" hypothetical I posed.

(I'm just playing around with your concepts.... unless I envision an complex
contextual framework, I can't envision the applications and the obstacles.)
