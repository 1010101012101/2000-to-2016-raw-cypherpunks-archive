BORDERS U.K. USES FACE-RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR CUSTOMERS
Borders Books in the U.K. is employing SmartFace technology to compare
the "unique digital face-maps" of customers against similar face-maps of
known shoplifters. Privacy advocates such as the director of the
Scottish Human Rights Centre are outraged by the development: "I can see
why they don't want shoplifters in their store, but I would question
whether this is proportionate to what they are trying to do. We are
talking about having a bank of pictures of everyone going into the shop
-- I would consider that a serious breach of privacy. There is no
control over what they do with those pictures, or how they are kept --
are they safe? Nor is there much control over whether Borders could sell
the information on, or whether people will actually know this is
happening." (Sunday Herald 26 Aug 2001)
