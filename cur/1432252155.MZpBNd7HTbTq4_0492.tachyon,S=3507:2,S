It used to be one had to go into a house to search it.

That takes a search warrant.

Now, technology means you can view things from outside
the home that you previously needed a warrant for.

Thus, this too should need a warrant.

What is the relationship between 'search' and mechanism?
Reread the "Then the Supreme Court ruled" part of my
previous post.

Hard to believe, considering your main concern was frequencies
and not privacy. You even admit the information is NOT visible
by human eyes without the hardware.

As far as I'm concerned you've outed yourself
as an alien species, just visiting this planet.

NANU-NANU.
