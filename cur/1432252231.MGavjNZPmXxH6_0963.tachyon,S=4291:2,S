It can be a useful feature, but it does not circumvent DNSSEC in any
way, that I can see.  DNSSEC see yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com and can
verify that the IP addresses for that host are the one that the owner
of the y.c.a.c domain publishes, and that is what DNSSEC delivers.
The bad judgement I referred to was if your software, after DNSSEC
verification, confuses yahoo.com with yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com.

I think it is simpler to have the DNSSEC root key installed with the
DNSSEC software.  If someone can replace the root key in that
distribution channel, they could also modify your DNSSEC software, so
you are no worse off.
