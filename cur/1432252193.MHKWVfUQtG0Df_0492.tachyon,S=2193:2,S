Ban corporate Skype usage immediately, says Info-Tech Research Group
Thursday November 10, 10:22 am ET

LONDON, ON, Nov. 10 /PRNewswire/ - Technology industry analyst firm
Info- Tech Research Group (www.infotech.com) is telling enterprises
to ban Skype - the freely-available Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) phone service - from their organizations.
"Companies that are already banning peer-to-peer applications, such
as instant messaging, should add Skype to its list of unsanctioned
software programs," says Info-Tech analyst Ross Armstrong.

"Approximately 17 million registered Skype users are using the
service for business purposes," says Armstrong. "Unless an
organization specifies instances where Skype use is acceptable, and
outlines rules for client-side Skype settings, that's 17 million
opportunities for a hacker to invade a corporate network."
