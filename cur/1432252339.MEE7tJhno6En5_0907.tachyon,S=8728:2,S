I only tell you what they are telling us. I do not agree with this

Where the war begun is probably debatable. The US had (and has) their 
fingerprints over a lot of things that are happening. And all of these 
you could construe as an act of war.

But the regime has been replaced, thus the war is over, no? That was 
the case in Europe. Germany was defeated, a new government installed 
(with a lot of people from the old one) and you called it "done deal". 
Same in Japan. So what's different this time?

I am answering to your statements. We have already established that if 
they are POWs then they should be released because the war is over (see 
above). If they are not POWs but held because of terrorist charges, 
than they should be tried no?

Our "enlightened" western society, led by the USofA who proclaims to 
know what right and wrong is (and who wants to teach it to all those 
"primitive" cultures in the middle east).

Sure sure, nobody has flown another plane in a building. Is this 
because of the US Army and all those nifty security screenings at the 
airport (just last weekend I flew out of Dallas and saw more than 
enough ways to get something through security), or because nobody 
really wanted to do it right now? Guess we'll never know. But of course 
the Spinmeisters are going to say it's because of the war in Iraq and 
added security. I wonder who or what they are going to blame the next 
time someone gets blown up.

Nifty, isn't it? "Well people, we see your point. But you have to 
Understanding, even though we control Guantanamo Bay and even though 
Diego Garcia is a British Island which we just annexed, we can't really 
do anything to help those poor people. But don't fret, if they would be 
in an Afghani jail they would be off worse. Remember, we are the good 
guys, we only do what's in humanities best interrest."

If they would be held in New York State they would have more rights. So 
let's just not even try that, we might actually HAVE to treat them 
according to the gospel that we preach.

That's not what I said. What I DID say was that if they are not POWs 
and are not charged with a crime, they should be set free.

The term "unlawful combatants" doesn't exist either. So the question is 
mute. Let's say "Human being" instead.

Than you have a problem with your government. But neither British, nor 
Canadian nor French authorities were notified / could be contact OR, 
after they found out, were allowed to talk to their people.

It is not only about people from Afghanistan, it is also about other 
countries, see my text above.

There have been several reports. What about John Walker? Whatever

Perhaps you just look for the easy way out?
