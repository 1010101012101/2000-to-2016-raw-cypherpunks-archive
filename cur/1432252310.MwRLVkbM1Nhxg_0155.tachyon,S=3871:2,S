That timmy thinks he's hung like donkey kong yet is actually well below 
average.? Probably,the jerk's nutless anyway so thats academic.No,I refer 
to a teaser in this weeks nude scientist.>>OPEN SECRET: An unbreakable code 
could soon become free for all.Sounds like a nightmare for professional 
spies...<<
Weel sheet! Thats got to be good fucken news! Stale but still NS is a 
conservative mag,digesters reader for scientists.(They still broke the 
anthrax-US govt link.)This issue also has a story on the lost biowarfare 
battle and for Quantum crypto-punks the hope that with superconducting 
cables operating now in Denmark and Detroit and the news of single photon 
emissions in supercooled conditions,the quantum road to crypto-anarchy 
edges ever closer.On this day-1863 -- Russia: Nihilists annihilate Chief of 
Police.1971 -- US: Vietnam veteran antiwar protesters peacefully
end their occupation of the Statue of Liberty.
"The statue of Liberty welcomes innumerable
pilgrims...while it is announced that the center of the
world, which took millennia to shift from the
Euphrates to the Thames, is now on the Hudson River.
In full imperial euphoria the United States
celebrates...but novelist Mark Twain, the old spoilsport,
proposes changing the national flag: the white stripes
should be black, he says, & the stars should be skulls
& crossbones."
1973 -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn publishes Gulag
Archipelago.
"One word of truth shall outweigh the whole world."
1984 -- Straw That Broke...?: Sam Peckinpah, film
director, rides the high country, of cardiac arrest at 59.

Any of you punks want to go back and get Angel?
