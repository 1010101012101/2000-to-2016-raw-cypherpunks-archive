And equally anecdotally, my prescription has changed very little since 
when I was 14, when I first got glasses. I am now 51 and I can easily 
wear my glasses from 20 years ago as a backup pair. (Somewhere I have 
my old John Lennon-style glasses from _32_ years ago, and they are 
close to my current prescription.) Wearing glasses has not worsened my 
vision, and I doubt strongly that _not_ wearing glasses would improve 
my vision...though it might make me squint and strain and pull my eyes 
the way the girls in high school used to do to see the blackboard.

I don't see any evidence that wearing glasses weakens eyes...the issue 
of vision correction is primarily one of eyeball shape, not the muscles 
which can, through squinting and straining, improve vision.

Most people become nearsighted if they are young and lose their 20-20 
vision. Some become farsighted. I see no evidence that those who become 
nearsighted when they are young would keep their good vision if only 
they skipped getting glasses. (I did notice a very large fraction of 
the girls in my high school squinting and using their fingers to pull 
their eyes, this to avoid wearing glasses. Perhaps this is why so many 
of them did so poorly in class? The several girls who did well in our 
school all wore glasses. The cheerleaders didn't, except for one, but 
they all got pregnant shortly after graduation and worked for 
Piggly-Wiggly and various banks, as tellers.)

If you have some real evidence that wearing glasses is the cause of 
poor vision, I'm all ears, so to speak.
