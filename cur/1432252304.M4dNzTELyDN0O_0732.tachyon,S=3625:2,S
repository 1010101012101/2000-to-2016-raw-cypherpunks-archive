I interpreted that not as working around MD5, but as working around the
procedure which would use MD5 to get a single number for an entire file
system.

Example: mark the logging software's keylog file as a device file, which
wouldn't be processed by the file system checksum procedure. When the
logger needs to write to its log, the file type is changed to "ordinary"
and then back to "device" again.
