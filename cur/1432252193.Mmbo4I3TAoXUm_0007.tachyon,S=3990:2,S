  OpenSSL version 0.9.6 Beta 2
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The second beta is now released.
  This beta is in fact two releases, one for the current mainstream
  OpenSSL, and one with an "engine" branch incorporated.  The "engine"
  branch contains an interface to external crypto libraries, which is
  currently used to support the hardware devices CryptoSwift (by CryptoSwift
  Inc), Atalla (by Compaq) and CHIL (previously called HWCryptoHook, by
  nCipher) as well as the internal OpenSSL routines.

  The two beta releases are available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the two betas are:

    o openssl-0.9.6-beta2.tar.gz
    o openssl-engine-0.9.6-beta2.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 84 changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a
  complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Changes that have been made since last beta are a lot in the
  documentation, in Win32-specific code and in VMS-specific code,
  and there has also been small changes that may affect everyone
  (for the better).  Tests on Win32 and VMS need to be made very
  soon.  Tests on other platforms should be made very soon as well,
  to verify that we haven't messed up since last beta.

  Also, new (non-default) targets for HP-UX have been added.  Since
  they are non-default, they won't get chosen implicitely, so they
  are non-critical in nature, but it would be nice if they got tested
  as well, for future reference.

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team...
