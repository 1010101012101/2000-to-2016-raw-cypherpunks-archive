The extra 4 bits add quite a bit, subjectively. I've compared the same

The other formats of note are probably SACD and then DVD-Audio. SACD
is multichannel 16-bit/44.1kHz... so multichannel CD without additional
sample resolution (if I recall). SACD is not "backwards compatible"
though, whereas HDCD is.

DVD-Audio is really the way to go, though... 24-bit/96kHz multichannel
or up to 192kHz two-channel. Lots more bits, lots more samples. It makes
a huge difference on "pretty good or better" gear.

Jeremey.
