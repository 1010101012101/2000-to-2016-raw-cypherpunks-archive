You won't and Bill won't. But those who employ such NIC's will have no
difficulty obtaining certification.

Sure you can use shell scripts. Though I don't understand how a shell
script will help you in obtaining a dump of the protected data since
your script has insufficient privileges to read the data. Nor can you
give the shell script those privileges since you don't have supervisor
mode access to the CPU. How does your shell script plan to get past the
memory protection?

What am I missing?
