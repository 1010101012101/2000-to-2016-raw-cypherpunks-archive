There's very good evidence that Al Qaida does *not* use strong crypto.

I blogged on this at http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/000561.html

is was the first time I'd given such a talk since 9/11. It wasn't
useful after we'd made the decision to stop hemorrhaging money by
shutting down the Freedom Network. (That was May or June of 2001.) So
I did a fair bit of reading about Al Qaeda's use of crypto. One of the
more interesting techniques I found was the 'draft message' method.
(http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/002871.php)

It seems consistent that Al Qaeda prefers being 'fish in the sea' to
standing out by use of crypto. Also, given the depth and breadth of
conspiracies they believe in, it seems that they might see all us
cryptographers as a massive deception technique to get them to use bad
crypto. (And hey, they're almost right! We love that they use bad
crypto.)

There's other evidence for this. In particular, the laptops captured
have been exploited very quickly, in one case by a Wall St Journal
reporter. So rumors of steganography or advanced crypto techniques
have a burden of proof on them.
