I know he's theoretically one of the good guys, but for some reason
Godwin pisses me off.

More likely Finns just won't come to the US, and the software
industry will move to Hong Kong or  Thailand or Costa Rica
or basically anywhere but here.  Stupid fucks.  Software can be 
written anywhere, so why is so much written here in the
high cost of labor USA, in particular in the San Fran Fucking
Cisco bay area? Well, people do kinda like it here for whatever
reason, but writing software is one of the few things that you can
do that is still (for now) almost completely unregulated.  Anything
remotely resembling the SSSCA would be the kiss of death for the
American software industry, and worse. The day the SSSCA 
passes is the day I tell Tim May, "I'm sorry I once considered
you an extremist, if anything you weren't extreme enough.
Fuck it to death, and keep fucking the corpse."
  
But I don't think that day will ever come.
