Then let them. A self-sufficient subsistence farmer won't be bothered by
the trade his neighbors are carrying out. [1] His farm can be a
neolithic bubble as the world progresses.

If he _isn't_ self-sufficient, then he does care about the trade going
on around him. That's been the case forever, and new trade always
disrupts someone who was making his living with the way things were.

And if he wants to make use of metal tools, then he'll have to exchange
as best he can for them. But, again, he's not self-sufficient, unless he
can dig and forge his own metals. Complaining that the world isn't the
way it was for Grandpa shouldn't get a sympathetic ear from anyone who
uses metals, plastics, or medicine, or who eats fresh produce out of
season.


[1] Assuming they don't pollute him out of raising his crops or
livestock, tax or regulate his farm out of existence.
