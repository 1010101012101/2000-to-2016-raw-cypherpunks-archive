ah. Sorry, I don't think of dns as a name service (apart from once
removed) - we are talking DHCP or similar routable-address assignment.

yup - I recognise anything as a naming service that allows you to associate
a routable name with a node that otherwise has only a mac address;

Indeed so - but of course the current internet *does* work that way, so any
new solution that advertises itself as "Free Internet access" *must* fit
into the current scheme or it is worthless.

Unfortunately, such abstraction fails unless the *sender* knows how to push
the packet in the right direction, and each hop knows how to get it a little
nearer; this more or less requires that each node be given a unique
identifier compatable with the existing system, and given the existing
system is still ipv4, there are problems.
