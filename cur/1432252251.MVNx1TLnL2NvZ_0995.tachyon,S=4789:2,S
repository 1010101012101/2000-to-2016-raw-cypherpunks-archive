Google turns up many cites for the existence of both agri-chemicals and
herbicides before WWII.

http://www.pestmanagement.co.uk/culture/history.html  is one such cite.

Some excerpts from a timeline:

1890's Introduction of lead arsenate for insect control

1893 Recognition of arthropods as vectors of human diseases

1896 First selective herbicide, iron sulphate, was found to kill broad
leaf weeds

1901 First successful biological control of a weed (lantana in Hawaii)

1899-1909 Breeding programme that developed varieties of cotton, cowpeas
and water melon resistant to Fusarium wilt

1915 Control of malaria and yellow fever carrying mosquitoes allowing
completion of the Panama Canal after its abandonment in the late 1800's

1920-1930 More than 30 cases of natural enemy establishment were
recorded throughout the world

1921 First aerial application in insecticide against Catalpa sphinx moth
in Ohio, USA

1929 First area-wide eradication of an insect pest against Meditteranean
fruit fly in Florida, USA

1930 Introduction of snythetic organic compounds for plant pathogen
control

1939 Recognition of insecticide properties of DDT

1940 W.G.Templeman observed the amazing selectivity of the herbicidal
activity of 7- naphthalacetic acid. The subsequent development of this
compound led to 2,4-D in 1944 and MCPA which revolutionized weed control
in cereals. Use of milky disease to control the Japanese beetle as the
first successful use of an entomopathogen
