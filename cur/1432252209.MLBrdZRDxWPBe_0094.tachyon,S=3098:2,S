 From Google:

Your search - "Help field" PKI NSA "40 bits" Netscape - did not match 
any documents.

returned similar results.

A quote from Petro's Archives:   **********************************************
Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
