You missed by a whole continent, that's the latest salvo in a barrage

RAH. I haven't trolled at all in these last couple of replies either,
perhaps you wished I had so you could dismiss these uncomfortable

No. Galileo advanced a fact and might swatted him for it, that the
Earth was the center of the universe has never been a fact. There are
other "facts" that simply aren't so despite consensus to the contrary.

It sounds like you are engaging in your own rationalizations.

You haven't been paying attention, have you? A refresher: the EFF is
suing AT&T for getting into bed with the NSA and the widespread
eavesdropping that has been engaged in. Widespread encryption has been
needed for quite some time, it hasn't been particularly wanted because
it isn't easy or accessible. Yet.

Prove it. You could use a few extra million dollars, couldn't you?

Let's review. I asked why Mixmaster software was not available for the
Win32 platform. The underlying question, why fully-encrypted
communications were not more widespread - you've more than amply
demonstrated why.
