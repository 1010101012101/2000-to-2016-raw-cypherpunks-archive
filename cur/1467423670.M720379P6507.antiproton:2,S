I think his key point here is that we must not be in self delusion.

It is ok to dream. Cypherpunk dream is a great dream. A dream of
freedom, hope, for everyone.

But when we are in a denial of a particular problem, or speaking as
though a particular limitation does not exist, or a particular piece of
software provides some guarantee which it does NOT provide - then not
only are we deluding ourselves, but (and I see this as a pain for Juan)
we are leading others astray.

This is why over and over, when the facts don't support an assumption,
especially when that assumption could endanger life and or liberty of
someone trying to do some good (e.g. a whistleblower), then how can we
say anything but support for Juan's outspoken vehemence?

Juan says "I will not compromise the safety of a fellow fighter no
matter what", and he sacrifices the appearance of civility to try to
achieve this - to try to support our brothers who want to fight, who
want to whistleblow, who want to undermine the murderers in our world.

Leading potential fighters astray in their thinking is essentially
unforgiveable - which is why I am bound by my own conscience to always
say "Juan, thank you! So few speak up as much as you do, for those who
genuinely need someone to speak up for them!"

How can we let down our brothers so much?

Yes, speak our dreams, our hopes! But do so honestly!

"Positive thinking" is not about deceiving ourselves or those who read
our proclamations on crypto anarchist software. And in fact it's quite
the opposite as I hope is clear by now - let's get off the hippy flower
power "positive speaking will magically manifest secure anonymising
software" bullshit bandwagon, and speak bluntly, plainly, and clearly so
onlookers are NEVER deceived!

Surely this is the LEAST we can do for our potential future brothers in
punk land?!
