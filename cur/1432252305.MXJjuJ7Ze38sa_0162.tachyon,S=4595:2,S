I didn't say that contributors are not fired for non-economic 
reasons. Maybe they're not putting out for the boss, maybe he doesn't 
like people who supported Gore. Whatever. Not for anyone but the 
property owners to deal with.

>and one reason such people are _not_ fired is also fear of lawsuits.

Depending on the terms of an employment contract (most have none), 
employees are employed at will. In a free society, that is.

In a free society, so what?

Which is as it should be....

Because we don't live in a free society. Which was my point.
