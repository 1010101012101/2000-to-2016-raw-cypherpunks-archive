That's easy.  If one's purpose is to communicate to a given audience, it is
the responsibility of the communicator to find the words, images or whatever
that will have meaning to most members of that audience.

On the other hand, if one's purpose is intellectual masturbation, than
whatever gets one off is fine.  (I guess it gets a bit more complicated if
purpose is intellectual masturbatory exhibitionism.)  :-D
