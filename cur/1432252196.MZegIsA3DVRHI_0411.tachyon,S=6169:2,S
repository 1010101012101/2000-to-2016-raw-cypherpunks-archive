One other point regarding this. Reading the IP list where it came
from, there were a number of concerns raised about how this is a mass
surveillance technology that would turn us into a Big Brother state.
This is a reasonable issue these days but I think the technology is
less threatening and more neutral than this.

it is less threatening because I don't think it is efficient enough to
be useful. A few years back I looked at another application of the
same idea, Private Information Retrieval for anonymously receving
email. You could have a mail server with say a thousand messages on
it, and you want to receive message #327, without the server knowing
which message you would get. So you give it 1000 encrypted bits, all
of them encrypted zeros except for the 327th which is an encrypted 1.
The server multiplies each encrypted bit by the corresponding message
and adds them together, which gives it an encryption of message 327,
that it sends to you. It doesn't know which one you read. This is good
in theory but in practice it takes about a multiply per bit in the
whole database. If you have 1000 messages at 4K bytes each, that is 32
million bits or 32 million multiplies to compute a result. It's too
slow. I think the new technique has a similar work factor.

The neutrality comes from the potential for using it in more
privacy-protecting applications. If it did become possible to have an
efficient version, it could be used to let people search data streams
for words of interest without identifying what the words are.
Eventually this technology could lead to the Holy Grail for
privacy-preserving search: a blinded Google. Imagine if you could do a
Google search, and the search engine were not able to tell what you
were searching for! All these concerns about search engines recording
our activities would be gone. Of course their business models would
disappear too, but hey, you can't get rid of bathwater without
throwing out a few babies, right?

Anyway, the technology may never allow this extreme application, but
the general idea of private search is good for far more than the
government surveillance case that everyone is worried about. I'd hate 
to see this technology get a bad rep just because some PR hack spun it
that way.
