One mistake the author makes is that he seems to think that there are
only anarchist hackers out there who should forget the hacking thing and
become lobbyists. There are already people doing that work who are
probably better at it than 99/100 hackers. There may be a need for more
people and resources to lobby for rational laws but the space is not
empty.

Another mistake is in lumping the private uses of the net in with the
commercial. I doubt that the personal uses can ever be fully subjugated
to commercial needs. However, I think it's pretty clear that a great
deal more could be controlled and punished than is currently. It'll be
like the drug war : the first 2% or so costs USD25B to get off the
streets. What will the last 2% cost? USD25B? Not likely. Draw the $ vs.
%control curve. The entire US GNP is not enough.

Is the article Total Bullshit? No, but I'd put on my Wellies.

Anyone have any strong opinions on laptops as far as reliability and
Linux-friendliness? I like HP and Toshiba at this point.
