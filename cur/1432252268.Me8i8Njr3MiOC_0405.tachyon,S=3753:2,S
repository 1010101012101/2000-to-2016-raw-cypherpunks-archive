Yeah, I've had a lot of discussions about how dumb the NPP voters must 
feel at this point.  Awarding him a prize for things he was promising to 
do, before he actually *did* ANYTHING, was (to use Ted's words), "stupid".

And under Obama, it never will. That we can spend hundreds of billions of 
dollars on foreign aid, and more hundreds of billions of dollars on Wall 
Street Aid, and *trillions* on Halliburton & Company Aid, without spending 
anything significant right here in River City (while simulatneously 
subjecting the already destitute to "austerity measures") galls me no end.

Who says there was a change of heart and mind?  What proof do we have that 
this wasn't just another professional election player doing an incredibly 
good PR fuck on all of us?

All too true.
