I was thinking about how longly stretched this piece is and how little of a
point he's making. Concluded intermittently with "This guy should write
books!". Turned out to be an excerpt. I don't like that about one-topic
books. They need to fill ~200 pages, and they try hard.

His point is horribly shallow and unelaborated. A side effect of how hard it
is to concisely point out why even someone without anything to hide would
like privacy.

Anyone up for a try?
