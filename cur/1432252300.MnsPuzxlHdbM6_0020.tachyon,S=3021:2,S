It has to be the second one. If it were only 3 times faster than
vanilla RSA, while RSA-CRT was 4 times faster than vanilla, then
rebalanced would not be a speedup over the usual way of doing things. 
Rebalanced RSA is 3 times faster than RSA-CRT.

What "rebalanced RSA" means is that you choose the private exponent d
so that exponentiation with it is fast. This speeds up decryption at
the expense of encryption. You can't just choose a small d; this is
known to be insecure. Instead they propose to choose a d such that the
two exponents in the CRT, d mod p-1 and d mod q-1, are relatively
small, about 160 bits. This gives a factor of 3 speedup vs the usual
512 bit exponent in 1024 bit RSA-CRT.

Is this safe? Who knows? I wouldn't recommend using it until Don
Coppersmith chewed on it for a while. He's the guy who pushes the
state of the art on small-d attacks. I'd wait for his opinion on
whether this variant on small-d escapes his attacks.
