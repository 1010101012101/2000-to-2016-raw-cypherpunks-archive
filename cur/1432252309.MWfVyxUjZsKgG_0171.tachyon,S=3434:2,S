California has "shut down"--through a threatening letter--a site 
which matches up folks who are willing to say they'll vote for Nader 
in states where Gore is sure to win if other folks who had hoped to 
vote for Nader will instead vote for Gore in order to help him in 
swing states.

(Sounds complicated. But it's really simple. "I'll scratch your back 
if you scratch mine." No money is changing hands, no actual "ballots" 
are being traded.)

The Web site doing this is/was: http://www.voteswap2000.com/

The article on California's actions is: 
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001031/wr/campaign_traders_dc_1.html


BTW, I just "expressed my preference" at the site: 
http://Winchell.com/NaderTrader/default.asp



No doubt I am even now more of a speech criminal. I wonder if a raid 
is imminent.
