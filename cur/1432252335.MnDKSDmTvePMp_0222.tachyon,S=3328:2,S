Well, you could get US papers, but if that's hard,
and if you haven't overly annoyed the Canadians and 
can get papers there, the border's extremely permeable.
Our right-wing politicians try real hard to keep Mexicans out,
but somehow Canadians don't bother them. 
So walk across the Yukon, stagger into Anchorage,
and fly south.

A friend of mine found 20ish years ago that the
price for going past the Soviet/US border guards
was a bottle of booze (give the Americans Stoli,
and the Russkis Jack Daniels...)


Or you can go to DisneyLand and cross the border from there
into California.
				Thanks!
