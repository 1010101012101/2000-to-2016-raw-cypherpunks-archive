  Maybe I'm being dense today, but I don't see how this is going to work. So
they have a key on your drive, they encrypt the data using this key, but at
some point the data has to be decrypted and used, which means that it can be
intercepted.

  The article isn't too clear, but it appears that a 'compliant application'
is going to be needed to do the encrypt/decrypt? All software is subject to
disassembly, so there is no real protection there.

  Not that it isn't a really dumb idea, they're trying to remove your
control of the bits stored on your harddrive -- a Really Bad Thing
obviously.

Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of
authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was
made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions. There
are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to
govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.
