Stanford Law School Media Release
For Immediate Release: Thursday, October 30, 2003

CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER TO ADDRESS
CYBERSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE AT
STANFORD LAW SCHOOL

Conference at Stanford Law School, Saturday November 22, 2003, 8:00 a.m.
to 6:00 p.m.
Early registration deadline is Nov 1, 2003.

Reported computer security breaches have almost doubled since last year,
and the vast majority go unreported. In two high profile incidents
earlier this year, hackers downloaded U.S. Navy credit card numbers and a
worm paralyzed Bank of America's ATM network.

In July, California became the first state to require businesses to
notify consumers if hackers illegally obtain their personal information
from company databases.

California Attorney General Bill Lockyer will talk about enforcing this
measure and other initiatives to achieve Internet security in the face of
increasingly severe breaches of computer systems. His talk is part of a
day-long conference hosted by the Stanford Law School Center for Internet
and Society.

Lockyer will join twenty top high-tech executives, encryption experts,
and law professors, who will propose ways that technology vendors, their
customers, government officials, researchers, and consumers can
accelerate vulnerability research, computer security, and consumer
privacy protection.

The conference discussion will occur against the backdrop of a national
debate as to how to respond to growing threats to cyberspace, and how to
balance security needs against heightened exposure and the disclosure of
proprietary information. On the one side are those who seek a federal
measure like the one in California that mandates disclosure of security
vulnerabilities. On the other are those who believe that non-disclosure
("security through obscurity") better protects privacy while continuing
to enable research and development.

The conference brings people from both camps together with technical
experts to hammer out solutions and recommend policy for both industry
and government.

Other speakers include:

Matt Blaze, AT&T
Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle
David L. Dill, Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University
James Duncan, Cisco
Gerhard Eschelbeck, Qualys
