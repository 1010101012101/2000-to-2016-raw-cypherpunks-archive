In a project similar to Wikileaks, ICIJ comments on tools it used to  
secure its team-based project work:

"ICIJbs team of 86 investigative journalists from 46 countries represents 
one of the biggest cross-border investigative partnerships in journalism 
history. Unique digital systems supported private document and information 
sharing, as well as collaborative research. These included a message center 
hosted in Europe and a U.S.-based secure online search system.  Team 
members also used a secure, private online bulletin board system to share 
stories and tips."

"The project teambs attempts to use encrypted e-mail systems such as PGP 
(bPretty Good Privacyb) were abandoned because of complexity and 
unreliability that slowed down information sharing. Studies have shown that 
police and government agents b and even terrorists b also struggle to use 
secure e-mail systems effectively.  Other complex cryptographic systems 
popular with computer hackers were not considered for the same reasons.  
While many team members had sophisticated computer knowledge and could use 
such tools well, many more did not."
