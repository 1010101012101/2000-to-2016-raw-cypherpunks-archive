MP3s are probably a better approach, though somebody has to write a
decent MP3 stego program.   Live concert recordings are good cover,
since they get around the problems of intellectual property (usually)
and the problems of visible differences between widely available
recordings with or without stego (and they have lots of background noise.)

Peter Wayner did a paper a while back on "Mimic Functions" - ways of
encoding data in material that matches cover text using whatever level
of detailed grammar productions you want to use.
