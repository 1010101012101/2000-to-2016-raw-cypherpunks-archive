	Many European police departments also insist on condition 2 carry. 
In fact if you look at the slide on a CZ100, there is an odd "dongle" or 
lump between the rear sight and the ejection port. Rumor has it that 
this dongle is intended to be used to engage the slide on the pistol 
belt to rack the first round into the chamber enabling a patrol officer 
to bring his pistol into action single handed (apparently many European 
officers also tend to work with police dogs, and having one hand on the 
leash means it can't be used to rack the slide).
