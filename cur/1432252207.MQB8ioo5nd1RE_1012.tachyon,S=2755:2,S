This may not be as much a blow to free speech as an opportunity to promote 
the civic virtue of psuedo-anonymous speech.  Cypherpunks should focus on 
how whistle-blowers can use available technology to authenticate themselves 
to reporters and secretly correspond to help the press investigate and 
corroborate the story without having to come forward and expose themselves 
to presecution.
