About this conference:
As government becomes more dependent on e-business, databases, information storehouses, mission critical information storage and information sharing, new requirements are posed. These emerging requirements are in the areas of improving service aimed at:
*  Citizens, through the development of one-stop Web portals for access to large stores of government databases and data warehouses.

*  Businesses, by using the Internet for transactions with government and consolidating reporting requirements.

*  Intergovernmental, through simplifying reporting of performance on grants programs.

*  Internal, by using commercial best practices, such as knowledge management, to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

In order to achieve these goals we are beginning to see the convergence of several diverse management disciplines:

*  Documents
*  Storage
*  Archiving Policy
*  Records
*  And… Knowledge Management

Conference Goal:

The purpose of this training conference is to examine new techniques and strategies now being explored by federal agencies and commercial best practices. We will profile agency initiatives, management strategies and shifts in policy.
