For sure there are worse. A librarian cited to be Wiley, Taylor and Francis as
being awful to deal with. Open Access is a great initiative (especially for the
taxpayer that invested in the research!).  Let's hope it's not taken down with
the Research Works Act. 

In my experience however, as someone working entirely independently of a
university, I find myself up against a JSTOR paywall far more often than any
other.  Quite often research into the authors produces a publicly funded
university behind the paper. Perhaps this was why Aaron chose JSTOR over others
- they are so often what comes between the public and their own desire for
learning.

Here's an article in The Atlantic written by a woman in response to her
experience with JSTOR. While researching autism - her son has it - she is met by
a paywall:

    'Locked in the Ivory Tower: Why JSTOR Imprisons Academic Research'

    http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/locked-in-the-ivory-tower-why-jstor-imprisons-academic-research/251649/    

My experience is akin to a commenter at the base of that article:

"If the public isn't interested, who are the people trying to read those 150
million JSTOR articles a year? I can tell you who they are. People like me and
the person who wrote the article. I graduated from an Ivy League university and
don't work in academia. I read widely and often want to follow up on some
subject I am reading about. I write and want to research a subject I am writing
about. I have relatives who have problems or interests and try to help them. You
gravely underestimate the ability of a non-academic, with a real reason for
researching a subject or interest in it, to acquire expertise. Do you think
academics write Wikipedia?"

Cheers,

Julian
