** CNN host Don Lemon destroyed by Secret Service agent over Donald
Trump’s 2nd amendment speech [Video]

Secret Service agent Dan Bongino called the media’s excessive commenting
on Donald Trump’s recent second amendment speech “comical”. Liberal
progressive host Don Lemon was quick to side with Hillary and sound the
alarm bells, that Donald Trump is calling on NRA card holders to take
out Clinton.

Dan Bongino found this narrative ridiculous, interpreting Trumps’
comments as nothing more than a call to all NRA supporters to get out
the vote against Hillary.

Lost in the latest media Trump bashing, is the fact that just the other
day CNN host and Hillary supporter Bob Beckel openly called for the
assassination of Julian Assange
(http://theduran.com/kill-julian-assange-says-cnn-host-and-democratic-strategist-because-a-dead-man-cant-leak-stuff/)
, while former CIA deputy director and necon Hillary supporter Michael
Morell, told Charlie Rose that the US should assassinate Syrian, Iranian
and Russian officials
(http://theduran.com/bizarre-tv-interview-former-cia-chief-hillary-clinton-backer-calls-covert-programme-murder-russians/)
.

Of course these overt and detailed calls to murder people was barely
reported in the main stream news. Maybe that has something to do with
the fact that the death calls came from Hillary surrogates.

(http://www.bizpacreview.com/2016/08/09/now-cut-off-mic-bongino-refuses-bullied-don-lemon-trump-2nd-amendment-heated-376846)
on the hearted exchange between Lemon and Bongino…

Things got real personal Tuesday night between CNN’s Don Lemon and
former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino while discussing Donald Trump’s
much maligned comment on Second Amendment supporters possibly stopping
rival Hillary Clinton.

Perhaps Lemon took exception to Bongino summarizing the hyperventilating
on the left as being “in the comical realm.”

Either way, Bongino correctly labeled the charge that Trump was somehow
calling for the assassination of Clinton as “absurd” while explaining
his point of view.

Throwing any pretense of neutrality out the window, Lemon clearly did
not agree with that point of view.

“What you’re saying right now makes no sense!” the CNN host charged.
“I’m sitting at home, I’m watching Donald Trump. I have two ears and I
have two eyes and I can see the reactions… We’re not stupid!”

“You should be ashamed of yourself!” Lemon added.

“I’m ashamed that you’re talking to me as if I’m a child!” his guest
fired back, as the two began going at one another.

“You don’t know crap about this, Don! You’re a TV guy!” Bongino said. “I
was a Secret Service Agent! Now cut off my mic! Do what you wanna do!”

Lemon countered by telling Bongino he was “lying to the American
people,” prompting Bongino to again correctly label the left’s reaction
as “nonsense.”

More "subtle" Donald Trump:


** Donald Trump says Barack Obama is the “founder of ISIS” and ‘crooked’
Hillary Clinton is the “co-founder” [Video]

Hillary Clinton is the “co-founder” [Video]

While very few people in the media or in government would ever say such
a thing, Donald Trump did say it, and he is correct in a certain way.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, through their actions in Libya and
Syria, gave birth and funded ISIS, until the group they once called
“moderate rebels” took a life of it’s own, and violently turned on its
western masters.

Zerohedge reports
(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-11/trump-accuses-obama-being-founder-isis-crooked-hillary-clinton-co-founder)
that Trump is focusing in on the Obama-Clinton foreign policy mess, that
is the middle east:

Obama “founded” ISIS, a statement that has already incited angry
rebuttals from the media even if it confirms what a secret Pentagon
report revealed
(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-23/secret-pentagon-report-reveals-us-created-isis-tool-overthrow-syrias-president-assad)
last May according to which ISIS was created by the US as a “tool to
overthrow the Syrian president.”

“ISIS is honoring President Obama,” he said during a rally in Fort
Lauderdale, adding that “He is the founder of ISIS. He founded ISIS.”

He did not spare Hillary either: “I would say the co-founder would be
‘Crooked’ Hillary Clinton,” Trump added of his Democratic rival.

Trump criticized Obama’s decision to withdraw U.S. military forces from
the Middle East and leaving behind a void ISIS could fill.

“We should never have gotten out the way we got out,” he said. “We
unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.” Alternatively, one
can argue that the US should have never gotten in but that debate is
beyond the scope of this post.

“Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep
it under control, we pulled it out,” the GOP’s presidential nominee
added.

“Then Obama came in, and normally you want to clean up and he made a
bigger mess. We’re not respected. We’re laughed at all over the world.”

Trump made similar comments last week, when he called Clinton the
“founder of ISIS” and said “she should get an award from them.”
