I'm tired of hearing my fellow Americans referred to as cowards, weaklings, 
sheep, ignorant, easily mislead - this is a profoundly undemocratic 
sentiment, the same kind of crap spewed by totalitarian and authoritarian 
types from the far left and the far right as justification for abandonment 
of the democratic process and the use of force to impose their ideology on 
the rest of us.

It is the cry of someone unwilling to do the hard work of actually speaking 
to their fellow and convincing them of the rightness of the cause being 
professed; the frustrated rant of someone who is convinced he or she has 
"The Truth" on their side - the same opinion shared by Timothy McVeigh, Osma 
Bin Ladin, and folks of a similar ilk.

I won't deny that I think our government is unduly influenced by factions 
(from certain labor unions to untold numbers of corporations) with financial 
and other interests at stake, but my answer is to become a more dedicated 
citizen, to work harder to educate my fellow citizens and elected 
representatives about what I think is right and just.

I refuse to give up on our way of life, my fellow citizens, or to write off 
my government as completely and irredemably lost. To do so is criminally 
irresponsible, in my view.

***

I encourage everyone to read this book - it says more about the strengths 
and weaknesses of this country (and more importantly, the "cowards" and 
"weaklings" who make it work) than anything I've ever read. It is written by 
an Arab-American and a profound patriot, someone whose life represents the 
American dream in all it's glory and gore.

America, More Than a Country
by Salom Rizk

Book Description
Salom Rizk, author of this autobiography, was born in 1909 in a tiny 
poverty-stricken town in Syria. Two brothers and an uncle in Iowa paid his 
passage to the United States, but he arrived penniless, homeless and with no 
knowledge of the language. The story of his incredible experience in 
self-education and his rise to one of the most sought-after and 
inspirational speakers on American lecture platforms is contained in 
"America, more than a Country."

The Chicago Tribune
"This is the kind of book you pick up to skim through and find yourself 
reading every word avidly...It's excellent to read aloud to the family -much 
more effective than pompous essays of freedom."
