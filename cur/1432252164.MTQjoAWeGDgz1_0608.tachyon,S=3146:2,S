The New Yorker last week had an interesting article on this and also described
the drone "pilots" as residing in the US.

However, there's something a little unclear here: Pure speed-of-light
limitations would add, you'd think, unacceptable latency (a couple of
seconds?).

Does this mean there's some kind of automatic lock-on that commits the drone
to fire upon targets, or is there some kind of propaganda-typre reason why the
gubmint would go out of it's way to make it appear that the operators are in
the US?
