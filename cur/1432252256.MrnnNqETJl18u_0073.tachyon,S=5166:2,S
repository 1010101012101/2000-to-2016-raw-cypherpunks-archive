I agree that there is no proof that this bug was introduced on purpose
and it might be a simple oversight (no matter what it looks like or
could be). We have to keep in mind that one of the things spies do is
sow suspicion and doubt - it's a powerful weapon! All these
vulnerabilities we're finding in critical software /might just be/
mistakes and oversights. Or they might be deliberate attacks by the
NSA/GCHQ. Part of the power these agencies wield is that /we'll likely
never know/ and so we suspect...everyone. Everything.
