Oh I have certainly experienced those back in my retail days during college. 
I was working in a Waldenbooks where the auto-inventory was sent based on 
sales (as a scaling factor). The store I worked at was basically quite 
small, but with Class A sales, so during some seasons we were DUMPED with 
books that we simply couldn't keep up with. They were eventually thrown out 
or listed as "shrinkage". (But all of that was behind the scenes...the 
customers couldn't SEE the pileup.)
But, notice how Waldenbooks has gotten WACKED by these big Borders' and 
B&Ns. Maybe these are smarter (or, these "giant" bookstores don't really 
need to consider shelf space...).


Continuing...

"I repeat: the "despised by anti-capitalists" Borders store has a deeper and 
broader inventory of books than the "cherished by Greens and locals" 
locall-owned bookstore. And they also use UPC and POS and reorder books 
dynamically."

Well, don't lump me in there. My point was not that such stores COULDN'T 
provide the level of service that an indpendent could. My point was that the 
"statist" culture that we are so used to prevents many big retail chains 
from taking advantage of their "human capital". If Borders learned, then 
great. (In fact, I helped quash a local bookstore during aforementioned 
stint...the guy was just a shitty, arrogant businessman and deserved to be 
run outta town. My only regret was that I made $3.35/hour to do it.)

Food is different from music or books, however. Books are much less of a 
commodity in that a particular neighborhood may respond very strongly to 
certain types of books, and ignore other kinds. Inventory systems can't 
really get the ball rolling on that kind of thing...they don't tell you what 
the locals want (but you don't have), they only tell you what they've 
already bought. Thus, a well-run chain would hire smart local college kids 
and let them order (in additionto the "basics" that come from the inventory 
systems). What I've yet to see is where a low-level retail kid is actually 
given a piece of the action: "Here kid...if you increase the sales of this 
Sci-Fi section by 45% then you'll get 2% of each book sold after that." I'd 
like to see a chain try that kind of a thing, but that seems WAY too down-up 
for most corporate cultures.
