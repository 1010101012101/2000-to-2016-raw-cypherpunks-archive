I just called Diner's Club, and was suprised to be asked for a
password to (replace? supplement?) my mother's maiden name.

Is this something that Citibank in general is doing?  How long before
this becomes a standard of due care?  Also, I'm curious what the
forgot-my-password recovery mechanisms will be...
