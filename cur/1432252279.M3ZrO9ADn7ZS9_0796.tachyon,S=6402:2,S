Here's an empirical result, if we can ignore theory a minute :-)

A few years ago, I was using my laptop a few feet away from
my parents' TV set, and text from my laptop showed up on the screen.
It was shredded into a couple of pieces, because the sync was hosed,
but it was quite identifiable as my text, so a spook with good
equipment shouldn't have much trouble reading it.
If you want more details, dredge the cypherpunks archives.

One of the issues is that most laptops have video ports
on the back to allow you to plug in real monitors,
and if you don't have anything plugged in, they're sitting there
with raw pins pointing out.  I'm not sure if my PC was in
"use both displays" mode or "only use the LCD" mode -
most laptops don't have an indicator other than "the LCD is dark"...
Among other things, most laptops are designed so that the 
PC model of display card interface is maintained,
so it's transparent to software that's poking around where it shouldn't.

Palmtops probably behave differently, but I wouldn't trust them either.
