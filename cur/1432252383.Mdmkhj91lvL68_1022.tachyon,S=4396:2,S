Why do you keep bringing your native-americanness in every otehr post is 
beyond me. I'm a native Pole, somebody here is probably a native German, what 
does it have to do with anything? Just drop it already.

It would also be beneficial to all parties involved if you read the e-mails 
you're (supposedly) answering to, and tried to choose analogies accordingly.

But answering your question: if there is a demonstrable fault in the way the 
road was built -- for example, there is an *outward* slant at a turn on a 
highway/motorway -- then I would say "to some extent, yes". To what extent? 
That's for the jury to decide, but if the fault contributed to the tragedy, 
the builder of the road is (partially) responsible.

By the way, I would greatly appreciate you making the effort to respect the 
by-laws of the (let's call that) Internet-natives of this list, and using 
English instead of the t33nz lulzspk tht u seem 2 b usng, kthx. If you want to 
encrypt your messages, use PGP instead of lulzspeak, it will work much better.

That's my problem with this idea, that's why I am floating it and asking for a 
discussion. Maybe there is a way to do it properly?
