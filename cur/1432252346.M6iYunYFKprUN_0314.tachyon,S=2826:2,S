We're not talking about just sci.crypt chatter here, he has been
forwarding posts on one of the single most interesting (to anyone
crypto-inclined) topics in *years*.  And not everyone (crypto-inclined or
not) subs to all of the many sources: if you want to get the word out to
the less than hard-core, this list is a great starting point.

You complaints on this appear (based mostly on your banter with RAH) to be
more a personal problem than anything else.  Perhaps you should step back
and look at the big picture here?
