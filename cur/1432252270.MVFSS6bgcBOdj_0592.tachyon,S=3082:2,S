I just signed up to donate blood at St. Vincent's, which is near where I'm
living. They have a waiting list to donate blood roughly 3 days long
(unless you're 0- or extra rare, neither of which I am). They expect to
use everyone on the list. So yes, please donate.

There's *nothing* where the WTC used to be except smoke. At least not that
I could see from a midtown office.
