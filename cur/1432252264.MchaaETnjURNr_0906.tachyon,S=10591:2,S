become a leading supplier of VoIP technology including the fo||owing 
milestones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
a|| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cellu|ar or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,OOO 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a global sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met
