   from the mission-possible dept.
   [1]Anlan writes "A Swedish student wrote her [2]Master's thesis about
   current fingerprint technology. After a thorough literature study some
   live testing took place. Simple DIY fingerprint copies were used
   (detailed how-to in the thesis). Have current commercial products
   improved as much as proponents claim? Well, this qoute from the
   abstract says it all: 'The experiments focus on making artificial
   fingerprints in gelatin from a latent fingerprint. Nine different
   systems were tested at the CeBIT trade fair in Germany and all were
   deceived. Three other different systems were put up against more
   extensive tests with three different subjects. All systems were
   circumvented with all subjects' artificial fingerprints, but with
   varying results.' You can guess how happy the sales people at CeBIT
   were - most systems claim to be spoof proof..."
