i wager $something_equivalent_to_the_cost_of_a_few_beers that the
safety concerns will scuttle this program within a year or two.

some radio punks with an fpga modem and homebrew front ends will deep
6 one of these units if occasional failure doesn't do it first.  with

sats and manned planes are almost as effective at invading such aerial
privacy anyway...
