There have been some proposals to build privately owned toll roads in
California.  One proposal was from the San Francisco Bay area to
Sacramento.  As far as I know, that one died from lack of interest.  I
think there was also one in the LA area, but I know less about it.  The
idea is a private toll road would have less traffic, and be faster.

In fairness, these proposals are "government-private partnerships", and not
true private roads.  The government provides the eminent domain, and the
private provides some of the capital.

I never heard a large amount of enthusiasm for these proposals.

Cheers - Bill
