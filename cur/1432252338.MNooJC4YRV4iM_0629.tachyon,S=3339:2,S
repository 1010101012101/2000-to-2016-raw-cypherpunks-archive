I'd get a few freq generators (could be real simple, like a crystal osc), a
bunch
of antennae, and a spectrum analyzer or two.  Probably some sheets
of RF adsorbing foam to use as attenuators, and for calibration.  And the 
ARRL handbooks.  A preamp after your antennae would increase sensitivity.

A lot of scanning radios have a signal-strength output which
can be used as a wideband spectrum analyzer.  With a WinRadio
(computer-controlled
scanner) you could capture the time-domain waveforms too, which could help
with diagnostics.  And then I'd spend some time in the desert, or a
foil-lined bomb shelter or cave, doing my testing.
