> This private toll road would be very hard to build in any other place,

Not impossible, though:

http://www.dullesgreenway.com/cgi-bin/dginfo.cfm

The Dulles Greenway is a privately owned 14-mile toll road that connects
Washington Dulles International Airport with Leesburg, Virginia. The
Greenway is the first private toll road in Virginia since 1816.
Since the Greenway's dedication on September 29th 1995, commuters have
enjoyed a non-stop alternative to Routes 7 and 28.
