I've written a blog post inspired by this: http://log.nadim.cc/?p=107


Why Young Hackers Are Killing Themselves

bThe hacker community needs more mutual support, empathy, and
forgiveness. The cattiness and paranoia serves no one but those with
the most resilient egos.b

This quote was sent to me just five days ago by an old friend. The
conversation we were having was one of reconciliation, and I had
half-jokingly blamed being part of the hacker community as the reason
why I can be so abrasive sometimes. But there was no humour in what
she answered. That quote was exactly true.

There are sometimes a couple of blog posts, a couple of discussions on
some social, behavioural issues we may have in hacker culture.

But there havenbt been discussions as to why young hackers, especially
those striving towards new methods of sociopolitical change, are
killing themselves. And there was no discussion as to whether the
hacker community itself might have something to do with it.

I cannot speak for Aaron Swartz. I knew Aaron only briefly and
distantly. But Aaron Swartz wasnbt the first. There were other
suicides: Ilya Zhitomirskiy, the co-founder of Diaspora. Len Sassaman,
the renowned cryptographer. They are united with Aaron Swartz via
their goals, their methods, their drive and their youth.

The hacker community is plagued, and our plague is a plague of
ruthlessness, of a lack of mutual reinforcement. A plague of keeping
up appearances. A plague that has managed to convince us that seeing
people and their efforts in black and white is alright. A plague that
makes us believe that personal attacks are valid against hackers,
programmers and entrepreneurs we donbt agree with, that defamation and
harassment are valid weapons when our online personas are attacked,
when therebs a project we donbt like or that we feel somehow threatens
us. And the harassment can be ugly. It can be pervasive, as if those
committing it see their target as part of a video game that they just
know they can beat. It can involve race, sex, and intense gas-lighting
and demoralization. Itbs a plague that makes us all busy in regular
part-time, making each other feel like failures. Criticize ideas, not
people.

Hackers are unique in that for some, federal subpoenas are a fact of
daily life. Handling zero-days that can bankrupt corporations may
happen weekly, amongst many other surreal, Hollywood scenario
problems.

On top of this, the community is not supportive, but jealous. Not
empathetic, but insecure. Not forgiving, but spiteful. Hackers, all
together facing the same surreal problems that alienate them
permanently from the rest of natural society, find themselves stuck in
a bubble of self-destruction and self-deprecation. This is what drives
young hackers to kill themselves. This may not have been what drove
Aaron Swartz specifically, but it is a contributing factor and a
serious problem in our community.

Criticize ideas, not people. Stop it with all the lip service. Public
discourse of the most difficult issues has largely only been elevating
the jealousy, insecurity and spite. Endless discussions without any
reconciliation as our community so slowly falls apart.

It also means that it will not always be clear whether or not an article you publish will end up in JSTOR unless you make sure that you are publishing in a fully open access (OA) journal (which is the route I would recommend for anyone concerned with information equity). A directory of OA journals can be found here http://www.doaj.org

This is probably due to the fact that they are non-profit, distribute little in the way of current content (where the profit margins are higher), allow for perpetual access to back runs that are bought, and was established as a way to expand access to journal content in academia. If there was an effective business model to allow for total open access I would not be surprised if JSTOR would be one of the content aggregators most open to such a model.
