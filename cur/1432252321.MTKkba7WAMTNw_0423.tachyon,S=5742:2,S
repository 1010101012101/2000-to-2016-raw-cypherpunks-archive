But they AREN'T deregulated, at least not yet.  In any case, the
debate was about what companies should do NOW, not about what they
would/could/should do in the as-of-now imaginary world of total
deregulation.

I can't debate about the deregulation of insurance, because I'm not
well-read on that subject.

Come on, now.  Our disagreement doesn't automatically classify me as a
"thoughtless whiner."  I have thought about these issues; I just
haven't reached the same conclusions you have.

The costs for the few would rise much more than the savings for the
many.  Therefore, the number of people with genetic abnormalities who
could not afford insurance would rise, while the number of genetically
normal people who could afford insurance would not be altered
drastically.
