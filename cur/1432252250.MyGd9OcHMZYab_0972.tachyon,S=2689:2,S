This kind of stuff really makes me wish Indigogo would allow donations
via Bitcoin as well as PayPal. Too many people have had trouble with
PayPal and they've done this kind of thing before. I, for one, am
encouraging anyone who wants to donate to do so via Bitcoin on the
MailPile site. Who the hell needs Paypal!
