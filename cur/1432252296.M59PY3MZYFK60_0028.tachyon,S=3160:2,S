I was thinking of what would be available and somewhat effective as an 
improvised weapon on a hijacked aircraft since we've been deprived of guns 
and decided that laptops fit the bill best.

No Sony Vaios.  Something a bit heavier.

Held in front of you it could deflect an edged weapon.

Slammed around it could make a short, blunt club.

And laptops are certainly available.

Even though your laptop would probably not survive the experience; if *you* 
did, you could probably get the manufacturer to give you a replacement in 
exchange for the good publicity.
