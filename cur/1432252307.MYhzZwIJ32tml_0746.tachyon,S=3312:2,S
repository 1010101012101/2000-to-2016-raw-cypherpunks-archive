You are.  The moment that they stop doing that, the legitimate network
overtakes it and restores order.  It would have to be a sustained attack until
all users of the network had abandoned it.

Furthermore, it is really only a minor denial-of-service, because solving 100%
of the blocks going forward only allows you to deny confirmation of the
transactions of others, and to double-spend your own pre-existing coins.

The moment the attack stops, the legitimate network would begin catching up,
and would soon overtake it.
