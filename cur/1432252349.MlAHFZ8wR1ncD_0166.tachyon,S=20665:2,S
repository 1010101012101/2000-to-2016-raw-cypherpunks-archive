Parents of 15 yr.old Find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet=20
& "CASH JUST KEEPS COMING IN MY MAIL" ! !=20

Dear Friend, It Works, Its Legal, Its Easy, so Why Not? Parents of =
15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet.=20

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely =
have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news =
program (USA).=20

His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a =
large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes =
and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing =
could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag =
and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and =
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.=20

"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old =
woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- thats more than my =
husband earns in a year". The woman immediately called her husband at =
the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. =
He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and =
picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from =
was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.=20

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of =
"chain-letter" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off of the Internet. =
Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this =
right on his computer in his bedroom."I just got the E-mail one day and =
I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said =
and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.=20

The E-mail letter listed 3 addresses and contained instructions to send =
one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address =
at the top and move the other 2 addresses up, and finally to add your =
name to the bottom of the list.=20

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand =
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter =
with your name at the bottom of the 3-address list. "I get junk E-mail =
all the time, and I really did not think it was going to work", the boy =
continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post =
Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine =
subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes =
containing $5 bills.=20

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box =
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a =
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I =
thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up =
to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to =
ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it =
all".=20

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The =
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in =
the closet, I barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding =
his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills =
for twenties, fifties and hundreds.=20

"I didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different =
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack.I would usually =
tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to =
exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady =
gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to =
do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode =
to the next bank down the street (laughs)."=20

Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The =
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called =
"chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a =
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US =
Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, =
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, =
Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must =
be exchanged for money received.=20

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that =
read, "Please add me to your mailing list". This simple note made the =
letter legal because he was exchanging a service (adding the purchasers =
name to his mailing list) for a five-dollar fee.=20

Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail, you =
can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the =
instructions in this letter. Here are instructions on how to make =
$10,000 US cash in the next 2 weeks: ("to help you with your mailing =
list")=20

There are 3 addresses listed below.=20

Send EACH PERSON on the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to =
securely hide it), along with a note that says: "Please add me to your =
mailing list".=20

Then delete the name at the top, move the other 2 up and put your name =
at the bottom.=20

Now start sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. When 20 people =
receive it, those 20 people will move your name up to the middle =
position and they will each send out 20. That totals 400 people that =
will receive this letter with your name in the middle.=20

Then, those 400 people will move your name up to the top and they will =
each send out 20 E-mails. That totals 8,000 people that will receive =
this E-mail with your name on it and they will each send you a $5 bill,=20

8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill =3D $40,000 cash, Thats if =
everyone responds to this E-mail, but not everyone will,so you can =
expect more realistically to receive about $10,000 cash $5 bills in your =
mailbox,=20

This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but =
send only US CASH $5 bill.=20

The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive, If each =
person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people that =
receive this letter with your name on it. If only 1% of those people =
respond, you will still get $50,000 cash,=20

Here is the list: (Send US $5 bill to EACH PERSON on the list.Total=3D =
$15)=20

#1.Mary jones P.O. Box 261 Norman, OK 73070

#2.Joyce Nattrass, 18 Wentworth Way, Hunmanby, Filey, North Yorkshire, =
UK YO14 OLA

#3.Troy May, 6131 OLD PLANK RD. WINSTON SALEM, NC 27106=20

THERES NOTHING MORE TO DO. When you start sending this out within a few =
days, you will start receiving $5 bills from other people just like =
yourself, who are willing to invest three $5 bills to receive $10,000 =
cash,=20

EVERYONE on this list gets Paid EVERY TIME invest $15 & get your name on =
the list, you will not regret it !=20

Just Think...If every person who got this did it the Results would be =
PHENOMENAL ! ! ! Try it, all you have to loose is $15 & the chances of =
you loosing the $15 are VERY,VERY,Slim.=20

If you dont try it- you will never know.=20

** Remember to send a $5 bill to EVERY PERSON on the list,=3D$15.SENDING =
THE MONEY is what makes this work.=20

NOTICE: This is NOT a lottery,illegal chain-letter,or scheme.You are =
BUYING A SERVICE.(US Postal and Lottery Laws,Title 18,Section 1302 and =
1341,or Title 18,Section 3005in the US code,also in the code of federal =
regulations,Volume16,Sections 255 and 436,which state a product or =
service must be exchanged for money received.) You are paying $15 to be =
added to 3 mailing lists($5 per list) The $15 is not refundable.=20

This is the new way of the new millennium! God Bless You
