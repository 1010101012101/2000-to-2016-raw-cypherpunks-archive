???

Each parent was in a position to make that decision. It was the regional
headquarters for several agencies, it was by definition the place where
such decisions are made. I do not know if the particular individuals who
ok'ed the decision to allow it in the building actualy had or have kids.
However,  to limit the scope of this to only the location decision is an 
unreasonably narrow definition of responsibility in what happened.
