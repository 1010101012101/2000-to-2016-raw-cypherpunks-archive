Hi,

Nope, the sender's public key is included by pbp with the encrypted
message. Since yesterday pcp does the same. However, I use a dynamic
keypair on the sender site now. I'm currently in the process to change
the encrypted output format of pcp to match the one of pbp.

Absolutely. Speaking of mistakes: I had even a note in the manpage where
I mentioned that it might be a bad idea to include the key-id with
encrypted messages, though I totally forgot it :) Oh - and I didn't
really include the key-ids, but a hash from it instead. However, this
has already been changed.

Well, now you know, I don't like linux :)
