The problem under discussion on the remailer-operators list is
different from the problem mentioned on the CDR.  The latter
question is, Why are there only five useful remailers on
publius.net's Mixmaster list?  The answer to that question is on the
page itself (http://www.publius.net/mixmaster-list.html):  the
keyring was last updated *199 days* ago. 

Comparing publius statistics to other Mixmaster statistics sources
(http://www.eskimo.com/~turing/remailer/stats/db/mlist.html) shows
that publius is the only statistics (stats) source to list several
remailers, doesn't list a dozen remailers that a majority of other
stats sources include, and lists many remailers at 0.00% reliability
(as noted on CDR).  In short, publius is out of date. 

A recent list of stats sources is available on the comparison page
cited above, or in the alt.privacy.anon-server FAQ on anonymous
remailer use section on statistics
(http://www.eskimo.com/~turing/remailer/FAQ/faq.5.html). 
Particularly relevant to the questions on CDR ("Why are half the
remailers down...?" and "Is there a better list?") are these FAQs: 

	Where can I find stats pages?
	http://www.eskimo.com/~turing/remailer/FAQ/faq.5.html#3

	Why are there dead remailers on the stats pages?
	http://www.eskimo.com/~turing/remailer/FAQ/faq.5.html#4
