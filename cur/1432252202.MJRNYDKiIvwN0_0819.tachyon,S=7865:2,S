Certicom Announces Security Builder NSE (National Security Edition)
                         
    Cryptographic toolkit enables government contractors to add security that
        meets NSA guidelines to protect mission-critical information

    MISSISSAUGA, ON, Nov. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Government defence
contractors got a helping hand today when Certicom Corp. (TSX: CIC), the
authority for strong, efficient cryptography, announced Security Builder(R)
NSE(TM). This developer toolkit enables organizations to build applications
and devices that meet the field-of-use guidelines set out by the National
Security Agency (NSA) to protect mission-critical national security
information. According to the NSA, there are over one million high-grade
devices in the U.S. Government today that will need to be replaced to include
security based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
    At an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting on November 11, the
NSA presented their requirements for strong security over the next 50 years
and further information about their licensing agreement with Certicom for its
ECC-based intellectual property. The NSA presentation can be found at
 http://www.machshav.com/~smb/saag-11-2004/ .
    In October 2003, the NSA selected elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as
the public-key cryptosystem to meet these new, stronger security requirements
under its crypto modernization program. The agency purchased licensing rights
for 26 ECC-based patents from Certicom for a particular field-of-use, defined
as implementations of ECC that are over GF (p), where p is a prime greater
than 2 to the power of 255.
    "This toolkit is a logical next phase for Certicom as it helps
contractors meet the NSA guidelines for protecting the most critical
government information. The agency has set out the guidelines and made the
crypto licenses available to contractors. We're now providing a tool to help
developers integrate optimized security features that meet those guidelines,"
said Ian McKinnon, president and CEO of Certicom.
    With this toolkit, organizations can be assured of proven implementations
backed by Certicom, a team of cryptographic experts that has focused on
optimizing public-key cryptosystems for almost two decades. The Security
Builder NSE toolkit covers the technology that was part of the 26 patents
licensed by the NSA plus optimized implementations that enable developers to
meet the NSA field-of-use guidelines and FIPS 140-2 validation requirements.

    The toolkit, which is available in C code, includes:
        -  Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)
           (FIPS-validated) for digital signatures;
        -  Elliptic curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) for key agreement and
           transport;
        -  SHA-1 and SHA-2 (FIPS-validated) for hashing;
        -  Advanced encryption standard (AES) (FIPS-validated) for strong
           encryption;
        -  Random number generation (RNG) (also FIPS-validated);
        -  Point compression for size and performance efficiencies; and
        -  Support for Windows and Linux platforms.

    Security Builder NSE is part of the Certicom Security Architecture, which
unifies all of Certicom's existing toolkits across a single API and enables
developers to quickly migrate their applications to whichever cryptographic
module is required.

    Pricing and Availability
    Security Builder NSE will be available in the first quarter of 2005 and
priced at a one-time license fee with no royalties starting at US$50,000 per
project in the field-of-use plus support and maintenance. A free license for
the patents in the NSA field-of-use is available from the NSA or Certicom.
