*Is* it finally about to appear?  It's been just about to appear
Real Soon Now for the last couple of years, I gather due to
Stupid Publisher Tricks.  It'd be nice if it finally happens.

Meanwhile, A Local Cypherpunk has my copy (relatively large print
paperback, found for about $4 in a used book store);
there was at some point a plot to scan and OCR the thing,
though I'm not sure that ever materialized.

My wife used to program for a calendar publishing company,
located upstairs from the used book store operated by the same people.
The bookstore was an expensive habit, subsidized by the 
real business; fortunately the size of the place (large but full)
put limits on the owners' bookbuying frenzies :-)

Of course, if you're in the SF Bay Area and *want* to work in
a used bookstore, there's a local religious cult that runs
a really good one in downtown Mountain View.


				Thanks!
