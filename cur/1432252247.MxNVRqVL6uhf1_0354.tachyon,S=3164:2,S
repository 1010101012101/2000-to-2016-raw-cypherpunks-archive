And you said...

So there was no Vietnam war? The US was not involved? It didn't occur in the 
60s? Are you saying that the cultural revolution didn't begin in 
approximately 1966? That the Sino-Soviet split didn't occur in the late 
1950s?

>The US never followed an aggressive policy towards the PRC.

Like I said: Uh...wha?

Let's put it this way: Mao and China clearly interpreted US involvement 
around China (ie, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc...) as having a lot to do 
with containing the 'communist meanace' and restoring the Chiang regime to 
power (we had funded Chiang and the incredibly corrupt Soongs with billions 
of $ during the 30s and 40s). Whether you agree with this actually 
constituting "aggression" or not is almost irrelevant. Clearly, our 
involvement in all of those areas (along with the rhetoric along with 
MacArthur's words which got him fired) could easily be interpreted as such.

But let's sidestep this and point out that it's the US that did this then 
and is doing this in the middle east. Almost no other countires can be said 
to be involved in a meaningful way. So is it your belief that the US is 
somehow more moral/courageous/godfearing than all the other countries in the 
world? Why is it always us (and not other countries) meddling in foreign 
affairs? Doesn't that strike you as odd? Is it merely a coincidence that we 
continue to be the focus of lots of international hostility?
