I seem to recall you lot claiming that the Taliban had
successfully restored order - (you see the Taliban being able
to massacre civilians unoppose as order)

There was some truth in that claim.  They controlled 95%.  Had
their been less truth, the Taliban would have had less ability
to make trouble.

So we should therefore make sure they cannot offer some kind of
peace.

In Iraq, the Pentagon cannot supply peace.  Why then should we
allow those who wish to destroy us provide peace?   If we
cannot have peace, no one should.

Nonsense.  The ugly thing about the period before Taliban rule
was that the Taliban, or people of much the same ideology,
would persistently destroy murder and rape in order to get
people to submit to their rule.  When opposition largely
collapsed, their massacres did not cease, though their rapes
became more discrete.  Instead, they decided to expand their
terror onto a wider stage.

The war was not warlord vs warlord, it was radical Islamists vs
the rest, the rest being warlords and conservative Islamists. 
The radical Islamists won, but victory did not appease their
appetite for terror.

All the big crimes were committed by the Taliban or their ally
Hekmatyar.
