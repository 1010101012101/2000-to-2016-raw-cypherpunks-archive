Beryllium is valuable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons,China recently 
used some tipping their ICBMs.One atom of it was used in an experiment to 
decide the fate of Schroedinger's cat.From.

The recent breakthrough of single photon emission in Britain brings quantum 
manipulation/encryption tantalizingly closer.The states days are almost 
certainly numbered but getting back to the cat.The Schroedingers cat 
experiment is based on the standard model of Quantum mechanics.The SMQM,if 
true means a universe must exist for every physical possibility.The 
notorious *parallel worlds* theory.
This could guarantee uncrackable encryption yet its a big swallow for 
some,not just pussy.The double slit experiment is even cited as providing 
evidence for neighboring universes.(D.Deutsch.new scientist.july.01.)Its 
truly bizarre to see exactly what some present *concrete* beliefs are 
really based on.Shared hallucinations indeed,possibly even kitty litter.
Is there a human Schroedinger? What of ralph Mc Gehee? Would looking to 
hard for his missing usenet posts kill him?
Uncrackable quantum encryption will save ralph and us from the out of 
control rogue terror state yet if the SMQM breaks down even an higgs 
boson's worth then we could all be back to square one.
