We are not "post-national." The "end of history" forecast by Fukuyama 
has not happened.

I can't speak for _you_, but *I* am not supporting "global copdom." 
Don't volunteer my money, please. Join the Foreign Legion if you want to 
fight in Sudan.

Fatuous nonsense. Those who choose to live or work near "soft targets" 
should deal with the consequences, not those of us who understood the 
nature of soft targets many years ago and took steps to distance 
ourselves.

(Paying to "harden" football stadiums is a lot like paying to help 
people rebuild houses on beaches.)

You are not a friend of ours. This is such a leap into the Surveillance 
State Void that I am speechless that any member of our list, even Choate

You are dangerous to the cause of liberty. It is not *my* business as a 
free citizen of these united states to tell the Arabs and Zionists where 
there border must be and then to enforce it. Reread what George 
Washington said 200 years ago about foreign entanglements. Reread the 
U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.


It's scary that so many people like you are out there, screaming for 
intervention and crackdowns on liberty.
