Yes, because CPUs couldn't/can't keep up with SSL's DH modexp at
*commercial server*  rates.   For lower rates, eg initiating a secure
phone call, or the client-side of SSL, you can tolerate the delay of
using a CPU.  You only dedicate hardware if you need to do
something a lot, and fast.  Could be polygons on a gaming video
board, mbuff operations in a network processor [1], or modexp
on an SSL enhancer.

[1] look into Intel's IXA processors.  They have hardware support
for everything you do in IP stack processing.  Amazing.  Later versions
also include linerate AES.  For large values of "linerate".
