    Title I -- Security System Standards

    Sec. 101: Prohibition of Certain Devices

      (a) In General -- It is unlawful to manufacture, import, offer to
      the public, provide or otherwise traffic in any interactive digital
      device that does not include and utilize certified security
      technologies that adhere to the security system standards adopted

      (b) Exception -- Subsection (a) does not apply to the offer for
      sale or provision of, or other trafficking in, any previously-owned
      interactive digital device, if such device was legally manufactured
      or imported, and sold, prior to the effective date of regulations
      adopted under section 104 and not subsequently modified in
      violation of subsection (a) or 103(a).

    Sec. 102: Preservation of the Integrity of Security

      An interactive computer service shall store and transmit with
      integrity any security measure associated with certified security

      must be allowed by certified security technologies]

    Sec. 104: Adoption of Security System Standards

      [Summary: The private sector has 12 months to agree on a standard,
      or the Secretary of Commerce will step in. Industry groups that can
      participate: "representatives of interactive digital device
      manufacturers and representatives of copyright owners." If industry
      can agree, the secretary will turn their standard into a
      regulation; if not, normal government processes apply and NTIA
      takes the lead. The standard can be later modified. The secretary
      must certify technologies that adhere to those standards. Also:
      "The secretary shall certify only those conforming technologies
      that are available for licensing on reasonable and
      nondiscriminatory terms." FACA, a federal sunshine law, does not
