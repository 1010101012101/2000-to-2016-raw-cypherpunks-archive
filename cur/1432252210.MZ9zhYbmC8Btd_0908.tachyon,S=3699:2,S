Shortly before that term, the servants of the soviet union
were waging war in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru,
Afghanistan, Cambodia, and numerous other countries that have
slipped my memory, making democracy impossible.

During that term all these war efforts collapsed, or
diminished to a pale shadow of their former selves, making
democratic elections possible, elections that for the most
part returned governments far more capitalist than the
previous regimes.
