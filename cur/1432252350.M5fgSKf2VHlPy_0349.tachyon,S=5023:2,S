The Taliban's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice 
has been out of work since being so rudely interrupted by the infidel last 
fall. The MO worries that having these guys just sitting around might be a 
case of idle hands becoming the Great Satan's workshop - remember what 
happened with all those T-men after they repealed prohibition? So to 
prevent the Committee from turning into a bunch of nuevo-federal narcs 
who'll terrorize us all for decades, the MO suggests the Committee be put 
to work reviewing pornos and adding appropriate sound effects per Islamic 
law. Ludicrous dialog could have a laugh track added, just like in Chica 
Boom #12 The depiction of adultery could have the sound of stones falling 
on flesh; public nudity would have the sounds of lashing, all with suitable 
scrams and cries. You get the idea.
And in certain special cases, like Hershel Savage doing one of his 
disgusting stepfather routines, you would have the sound of a firing squad. 
Anything by Max H. would of course be drowned out by sounds of the 
urination of 1000 fat lesbians. Truly, the possibilities are endless. The 
MO offers to bring all the members of the idle Committee to his bunker in 
Quatar, set up editing bays, and put them to work in exchange for a modest 
federal grant. Surely this is preferable to a bunch of towel-headed dildos 
sitting around looking for work.

Site also seeks well hung asians if thats not an oxymoron.There has to be 
some legal asian hardwood out there somewhere.Get yer wood on!
Lets not forget big Jim,tax rebel par exellence..Like most guests of the 
state penal system,JB is working in prison for what amounts to slave wages 
and has "virtually no money for toothpaste, magazines, socks, 
snacks,(well,maybe thats good.) writing paper and stamps." None of these 
items are allowed inside the facility from the outside world but JB can 
purchase them from the prison canteen. http://www.bop.gov/facilnot.html
