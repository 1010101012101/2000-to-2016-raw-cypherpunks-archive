I agree.  Even India has a few with wealth far beyond the imagination of
most Americans, and many with the same living standard as Americans.  They
certainly see it.  Sarad, care to give us a short political description of

their suffering?  What fraction of India's population is "dirt poor"?

Patience, persistence, truth,
