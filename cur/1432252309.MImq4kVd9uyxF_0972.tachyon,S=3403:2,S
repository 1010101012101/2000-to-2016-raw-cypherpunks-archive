I agree that compromise of the client is relevant. My current belief is that
nobody is doing this on a mass scale, pwning entire populations at once, and
that if they do, we will find out about it.

My goal with the S4 product is not primarily to help people who are being
targeted by their enemies, but to increase the cost of indiscriminately
surveilling entire populations.

Now maybe it was a mistake to label it as "PRISM-Proof" in our press release
and media interviews! I said that because to me "PRISM" means mass surveillance
of innocents. Perhaps to other people it doesn't mean that. Oops!

Regards,

Zooko
