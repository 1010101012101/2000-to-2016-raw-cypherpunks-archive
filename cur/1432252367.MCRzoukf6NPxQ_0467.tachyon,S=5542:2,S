This woman and her daughter just "happened" to be far from home, out 
near the AN compound, and their car, they claim, just "happened" to 
backfire.

I doubt the backfiring theory very much...none of my cars has _ever_ 
backfired, and I've been driving since 1968. I would bet a lot of 
money that this woman, a leftie simp-wimp, took a shot at the 
compound she hated so much.

A pseudonymous person sent me a note on this woman and her plans, 
including this excerpt, which I agree with:

"The fact the woman, supposedly a random passing stranger, intends to use
the money and convert the compound to a 'Peace Center' makes me think
the entire thing was a setup. "

In any case, if she was roughed up, without provocation, then those 
who roughed her up are solely to blame. Suing AN was merely an 
example of "deep pockets" and "joint and several liability" 
doctrines, motivated by PC sentiments. The Southern Law Poverty 
Center routinely uses this tactic to silence those it doesn't like.

I still say we should sue Operation Push for every asset it has. 
Hymietown, indeed.
