Seriously?

If I had a security clearance and my job was to identify idiots to watch
more closesly, I'd make that image, post it anonymously, over tor, then
see who has an emotional reaction and starts posting a lot of links about
freedom of whatever.

That being said, it's funny in a third-grade sort of humor way, but what
I'd rather see is John Stewart/The Onion/cracked.com intelligent satire.

We can do better than bending over for the NSA and saying 'have at it'

So do better.
