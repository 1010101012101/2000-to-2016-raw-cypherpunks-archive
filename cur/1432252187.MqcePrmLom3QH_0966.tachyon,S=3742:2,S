Yep, it looks like Agent Farr all right--I recognize her fractured, 
incomprehensible style.

What is one to make of: "Conversations of
checks...vid -- and I strongly suspect booby trap talk."?

I wonder if Agent Farr chose one of the groups Bill Cooper was on as 
part of her "research"?

Agent Farr wants "guys doing surreptitious entry" to have "better 
recognition training."

Not surprising, but it ought to convince even the charitable amongst us 
who wanted to give "Aimee Farr" the benefit of the doubt that she/he is 
clearly advising LEOs.
