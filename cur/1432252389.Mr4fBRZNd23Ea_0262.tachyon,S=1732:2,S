Jim has about two years to go, with whatever time off his
exemplary behavior warrants.

The good news is that he has had bountiful time to develop
an invention which he claims will make billions of dollars,
transform science as much as the discovery of the atom,
and, most happily, render governments into gibbering
gangs of synchophants rabid to serve him myrrh.

If the vermin don't steal his intellectual property, which 
he avers is near certain. 

Could be Jim is gestating a chem-bio virus for the
varmints to gobble.
