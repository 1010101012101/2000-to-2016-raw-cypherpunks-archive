Bush is bunkered in Crawford after messing with, softening, the heads 
of MX and CA, and right now there are two unpublicized emergency 
operations underway on the AZ-MX border -- no fly zones. Call it Alamo2 
run by the Carpetbagging reenactors, then right down the PanAm 
highway of death to VE, promulgating and liberating brand new 
United States on the way.

And you thought it was Iran, you dumb Peak Oil shits. The easy
oil is right nearby, closer than AK, with liquified natural gas tankers 
and pipelines and special ops blackfaces ready to launch, or 
already on the move.

Heh, cloak the grab by censuring the commander in chief, pretending
to be agitated by NSA eavesdropping, meanwhile stuffing your
energy portfolio to the max.

By god, the State of Texas, well, hell, call it the Republic of Texas
stretching all to the way to the edges of Latin America, urged on and
blessed by the exploit the natives Money Church now for over 4 
centuries, with the consequence of the crippled old freedom promoting
US, legs shriveled, begging for fuel, or tithing faith healers preaching
how to learn to walk.

Fuck let's get along as we drive along yelling at our cells Americans, 
all the colors of the rainbow, even the drip and dried anus whities 
anxiously waiting for the help to drive the beach buggy.

A century from now people will wonder how did our ancestors ... believe?
