Pardon the rant.  Since Bruce went down his yellow brick road to the
Land Where Full Disclosure Is Bad, I have been wondering about the
usefulness of a crypto guy functioning as the head of a security
company.

"We" computer security experts.

(A) Bruce does crypto, not security.  When he made the cutover, and
rapidly rose to the rank of "expert" is unknown to me.

(B) It's always been said that no one who calls themself an expert in
anything, is.  And chances are the ones who don't, are.

Claims like "full disclosure is bad."  I'd like to see what studies
this ideology is based on.

Pudding, including proof.  Since this is a new style of hijacking,
then clearly this is all we must concentrate on?  I didn't see people
taking down firewalls just because Code Red & Nimda passed right
through and hit web servers.  No, new threats need to be responded to
without neglecting every previous threat.

Bruce seems to think that just because these guys were so clever, that
they'd never resort back to a simple car bomb parked next to an
airport terminal. No, they'd never go low-tech.  Think: Boxcutters.

Unless they were simply planting a bomb in the luggage compartment.
You know, like an airport-employed *baggage*handler* would be able to
do.

Bruce is making far too many assumptions which, instead of bordering
on the fanatical are instead bordering on the blind.

Inspection of what, a hijacker?  Until a hijacking occurs, any
terrorist is merely a potential hijacker.  What are these inspections
for that Bruce supports?  Bombs?  The same ones he thinks are a
non-issue now?

Now bombs *are* an issue again!  This waffling is feeling rather
Clinton-esque!

This much I agree with.

Speaking of snake oil... face recognition!  Is the security expert not
noticing the oil being passed?

Excluding cost-prohibitive systems, many can be easily tricked.

Once someone hacks your "code" (print, retinal scan, etc), how do you
*change* it?  'Splain, Lucy!

For once we see the broad imagination and not the narrow focus we saw
above.

Perhaps Bruce is now in his zone again, instead of thinking within an
area where he doesn't seem to be quite as comfortable.  How Bruce
presents himself as a "security expert" is really beyond me...

Ah yes, log auditing.  A low-level AI with a human overlord.  Nothing
like retroactive "response".


Valor.  Kimble.  Schneier?!
