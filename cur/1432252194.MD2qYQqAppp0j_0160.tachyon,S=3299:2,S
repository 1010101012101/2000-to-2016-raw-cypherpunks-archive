Oh, I _like_ that other choice. Trust me.

When I hear Jesse Jackson saying that unless the Palm Beach voters 
are given the chance to have a new vote there will be a race war, I 
rejoice.

I was just reading in misc.survivalism that some folks in Florida are 
saying that if Al Gore and his Voters of Color succeed in twisting 
the courts into stealing the election, that white folks will start 
killing.

Music to my ears. The fuse is burning on the powder keg.
