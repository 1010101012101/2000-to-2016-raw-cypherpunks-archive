Thanks for the answer.

So the DLOG records (Wikipedia gives 113 bits [1] as of 2010)

break these in libressl/openssl:

$ ./inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
secp112r2 : SECG curve over a 112 bit prime field

And these are in quite gray area?

secp128r1 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field
secp128r2 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field

And what is the computational power of the Bitcoin network
(Allegedly they do 2^80 SHA hashes per week) in terms of
DSA/ECC operations?

AFAIK, for DSA this is just multiplication/squaring modulo
prime for rho.
