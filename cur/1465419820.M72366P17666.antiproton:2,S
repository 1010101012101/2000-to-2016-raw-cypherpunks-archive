	You keep defending tor and making completely retarded excuses
	for it while denying that you are defending it.

	I quoted an 'expert witness' who also happens to be tor's capo
	mafioso clearly saying that tor is fucked and yet you keep
	vomiting nonsense. 

	Seriously, what the fuck is wrng with you. What's your evidence
	and expertise that allows you to 'refute' syverson and co.?

	DUDE! What the fuck are you talkng about. You are a charlatan.

	Are you crazy, utterly stupid, or what. Wait no, you are a
	government agent promoting a system that is clearly flawed, to
	the point that the same scumbags who created admit it.

	And yet you,

	Yes, by the logic of a fucktard like you, who promotes a
	honeypot, I am the fed. 

	And by 'ordinary' and sound logic, you, a promoter of a
	honeypot, are the fed.
