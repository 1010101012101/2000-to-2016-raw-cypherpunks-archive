Outlawing computers is perfect for outlaws, though the public at 
large may be buffaloed into consuming whatever is pushed in
its direction for safety and security in lieu of outlawed freedom 
to choose.

And gray and black markets will supply those public members
who get fed up with crowd-control tools of limited interaction.

Indeed, an anti-patriot might welcome oppressive operating
systems and chips as a boon to increasing the number of people 
who won't accept being told how to interact with their computers.

If MS and buddies are successful in getting a clamp on
what you can do with mass-marketed computers then the
colored market for alternatives will rocket.

To be sure the illegal boxes will have to be kept out of sight,
and here the moonshiners have a wealth of information to
share, along with arms merchants, drug kingpins, money
launderers, rogue nations, guerillas, rebels, anti-royalists,
just about anybody who is not part of the momentarily ruling 
crowd of thieves.

And don't overlook the insiders ever eager to cut a deal
against their vile bosses, to pass along tips on what is being
hidden in the MS/gov-approved boxes, how to get around it,
what will beat it, and so on, in the glorious anarcho tradition,
cooking up new ways of doing business off the grid, mostly
by offering better products than those of available at the
endless-patch mall.

Salespeople overeager to capitalize on an short-term market
with shoddy products are rainmakers for makers of dependable 
tools. Gates is nothing but a salesperson to his best customers,
the TLA national security hustlers.

Sure, you'll have to cut-tongue an anarcho rat become a salesperson
now and then, but that's why box cutting scimitars are blessed by 
the Beezlebub. Metaphorically speaking.
