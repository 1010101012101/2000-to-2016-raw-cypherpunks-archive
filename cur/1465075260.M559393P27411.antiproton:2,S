	applebaum, like the rest of members of the tor mafia is a
	despicable fraud. The guy pretends to be  an 'anarchist' while
	working for the pentagon. 

	Funnily enough, that is not something 'people' give a shit
	about.

	Hell, tor project pentagon's employees are regarded as
	'freedom fighters' 'fighting' for 'free speech' in 'oppressed
	countries' - when they actually are motherfucking scumbags
	whose job is to 'secure' the communications of the americunt
	empire. 

	The really funny thing is that appelbaum is being 'smeared'
	with some sexual bullshit that only retarded puritan monkeys
	(i.e. americunts) care about.  Serves him well though. 

	Oh, and these retards are leaving the US...and going
	to...germany*?? How retarded can people be? 


*germany : fascist shithole like the US, US empire province, and US
military outpost used to drone women and children for fun.
