	Of course. The only propaganda that the US tolerates is 'true'
	propaganda.

	Of course not. It's not propaganda! It's jew-kristian art.

	Right. The US psycho-leaders and all their sheep don't even know
	what 'propaganda' means. They've never seen any, let alone

	That's interesting. So you know exactly what the population of
	afghanistan (let's assume 25 million) knows? 

	How did you manage that one? You must have a high ranking
	position in the americunt 'national security' 'industry' eh.
	And you speak a few varieties of persian I assume?

	And now you sound flatly crazy. The 'world' is supposed to
	provide knowledge? What, you think "world" means "fascist
	public indoctrination system"? 

	At any rate, I'd bet a couple of cents that people in
	afhanistan know about your 9/11 false flag attack.

	So we have a piece of neocunt shit making world domination
	plans in the cpunks mailing list. How cute is that?

	Anyway, enough time wasted.
