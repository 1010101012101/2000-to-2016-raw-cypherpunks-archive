Let's focus on the technical realization first. How to annihilate a 
sizable chunk of matter without leaving even minute traces of it? We 
should keep in mind that contemporary forensic detection/analysis 
technologies are pretty damn sensitive.

We also shouldn't forget that burning the substance releases a 
considerable amount of energy, and takes time - at least several seconds. 
Soaking it with liquid oxygen could dramatically reduce the burning time, 
and lead to total oxidation to CO2/H2O/SO2/NO2/P2O5, but it also bears 
certain risk of explosion, and LOX does not belong between user-friendly 
substances as well.

The method also should not provide any hard evidence about when the 
incinerator was last used, in order to make it difficult to prove the 
exact moment of its deployment. This sharply collides with the requirement 
to dump the waste heat, as the unit will be pretty hot for some time after 
initiation, even if it will be directly connected to the car's heatsink.
