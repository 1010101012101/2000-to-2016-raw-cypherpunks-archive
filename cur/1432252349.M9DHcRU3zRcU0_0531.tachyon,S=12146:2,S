<BR>
Your friends and family may not believe how quickly<BR>
you are earning and growing in the web design business!!<BR>
You are limited only by your imagination.<BR>
<BR>
Our University is the out growth of one of America's fastest<BR>
growing web design companies.  As the studio grew explosively<BR>
over a five-year period, they were faced with where to find<BR>
trained professional web page designers to fill their positions<BR>
due to growth.  When they couldn't find existing training centers<BR>
to draw employees from, they did it the AMERICAN way.......<BR>
They created their own school!!<BR>
<BR>
The University was formed to be a teaching and training<BR>
facility for teaching and training the tools, techniques<BR>
and technology of web designing.  Growing from a<BR>
"one room school house" concept to now a worldwide offering,<BR>
the school's instructional system introduced a revolutionary<BR>
approach to web site creation that turned the industry<BR>
and the creative process on its head!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Our University teaches core concepts so our gr=
aduates<BR>
produce sites in virtual hours instead of days or weeks!</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> <BR>
<BR>
The Center's students receive a package including fully functional,<BR>
all-inclusive software for use in the class, along with essential<BR>
trialware and freeware added to enhance your education experience.<BR>
This package alone has an estimated retail value to the student<BR>
of hundreds of dollars.  This allows our students to learn<BR>
without investing large amounts of cash.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000FF"><B> The School has three primary goals:<BR>
</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> 1.  Teaching methods making learning enjoyable=
 and affordable<BR>
2.  How to effectively create high paying web sites quickly<BR>
3.  Earn-while-you-learn opportunity for students</B></FONT>

<BR>
We point with pride to a few of our graduates<BR>
(ask for more examples from admissions):<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Mark Mentzer says:</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> <BR>
"When I enrolled at The University I had little skills<BR>
in the web process.  Now six months later they are providing<BR>
me with site work where I have earned from $400-$1000<BR>
in a 2-4 day period!  I've built a valuable portfolio that<BR>
I can market to potential clients or employees.  This school<BR>
was a big break."<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Jennifer Den Adel said:</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> <BR>
"The staff at The University has been great.<BR>
In fact, I started out as an intern, and through this<BR>
past year I've found flexible hours, an invaluable<BR>
work experience and the ability to earn a great income.<BR>
The School opened the doors for me!"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Paul Luecke mentioned:</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> <BR>
"With the fantastic program at this school, I was able to<BR>
pay for my training in about two weeks worth of work for<BR>
their clients!  To learn this skill was great....<BR>
but to have a program where the University basically<BR>
paid me to learn was unbelievable!"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Finally, Kingsley Naomi</B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> :<BR>
"The people at The University were the most helpful<BR>
teachers I have ever worked with.  I am pursuing an<BR>
advance degree in computer sciences, but they taught<BR>
me real world skills and survival tactics that have<BR>
proven more important than any other curriculum I<BR>
can compare it to.  I also earned while I learned, I have<BR>
taken my education with me and I am now prepared to<BR>
pursue my masters.  This University was part of that growth."<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"><B> Guaranteed placement assistance is part of the=
 total philosophy. </B></FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> <BR>
Students successfully finishing this intense, hands-on training<BR>
will be guaranteed assistance on THREE levels in finding<BR>
work and employment for which they can be compensated for.<BR>
As in the case of Mark Mentzer, $500 to $600 paydays are not uncommon.<BR>
<BR>
After your graduation you also receive </FONT>

<FONT color=3D"#000000"> at next-to-cost pricing!<BR>
This is a direct profit center for YOU, the web designer,<BR>

If you develop your own clientele and you net just $50 a month from your<B=

alone!  Now you see why, as a Commercial Web Design Specialist...<BR>
