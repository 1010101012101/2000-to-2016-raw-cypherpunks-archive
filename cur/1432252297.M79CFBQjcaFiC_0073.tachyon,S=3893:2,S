Or a snowball, or a baseball.  When I was in college,
you could tell which dorms had lacrosse players in them
by the number of broken windows.

Deploy that widely enough and you'll increase BB-gun sales radically.
Poisoning a whole household by cracking the cyanide window is bad,
but blowing up the whole window with one little pellet could be fun,
if you're into that sort of thing.

Burglar alarms are another good approach - if the glass gets broken,
make sure everybody knows about it real fast.

One of my neighbors in college had somebody break into her
apartment by breaking the back picture window.
They stole her TV and one of her two pot plants;
she had to hide the other one in the car while the 
cops were there.  We presumed they couldn't carry both
pot plants on top of the TV.
