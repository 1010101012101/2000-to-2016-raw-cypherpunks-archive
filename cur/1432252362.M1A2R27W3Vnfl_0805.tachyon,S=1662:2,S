>Terrorists 'use child porn' to exchange information

Wow, this really is the myth that never dies, only the names of the
participants change.  This first cropped up in the mid-90s when it was being
used by unknown foreign agents (today these would automatically be "the
Chinese") to smuggle secrets out of US national labs, and every few years it
crops up again with a few names changed to keep it topical.  I'm surprised it
took this long for it to be Al Qaeda's turn.

Prediction for the future: At some point it'll be the turn of copyright
infringers/file sharers to be the subjects of this myth (if they haven't
already, and I missed it).

Peter.
