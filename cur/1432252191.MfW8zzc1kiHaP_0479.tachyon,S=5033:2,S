Frankly, I don't see how any kind of "short-term tactic for possibly illegal
operations on the street in an environment full of police" could be good 
for anything more than the symbolic. What did these "illegal operations" 
really accomplish apart from getting out a statement? Serious question. I'm 
just not seeing it. 

Making a few gestures pantomiming paramilitary operations is just plain 
suicidal. The bottom line is that in a protest-type situation, you're 
relying on the power of negative PR to keep the police from mowing you down 
any old time they feel like it. It doesn't matter what color you wear or 
how tight you march, you're still as vulnerable as anyone else if you don't 
have some serious, serious gear and training. And is that really the 
direction you're prepared to go? Think about it.

A few acts of vandalism isn't exactly anything I'd call significant. And 
it's kind of sad that you really think anyone with real power and influence 
actually gives a damn about anything that happens at these protests to 
begin with. Sure, it keeps their PR spokesmen spinning, but otherwise it's 
laughed off as a total joke and annoyance. You don't have to like it to 
realize that's the way it is. 

So why not spend your time writing some useful and relevant software or 
books instead, something that really makes an impact. Creativity, not 
destruction.

At any rate, it sure beats facing the prospect of rotting in jail as a 
political prisoner on trumped-up destruction of property charges--sending 
your whole life straight down the toilet for absolutely nothing. 

But it's your lives, do whatever you want. I'm sure you will.
