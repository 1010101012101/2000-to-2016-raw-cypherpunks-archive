Chomsky made some remarkable claims, which I have quoted, for the
existence of some remarkable evidence.

So are you claiming that this alleged evidence seemingly cited by Chomsky
exists, or are you denying that Chomsky claimed the existence of this
evidence?

Choose one story and stick to it.

If you claim the evidence cited by Chomsky exists, where is it?  If
you deny that Chomsky cited this very remarkable evidence, then let us
once again go over his words.

Commit yourself to one excuse or the other excuse.
