What the Heck is OPSEC?
prepared by Zhi Hamby, Executive Director, OPS
http://www.opsec.org/who/who02.htm
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a nutshell, OPSEC is a process that teaches you to examine your day-to-day
activities from an adversary's point of view, to understand what an adversary
can learn about you and/or your organization from these activities
(observables), 

to assess the amount of risk this places on you and/or your organization, and
then to develop and apply countermeasures so that the bad guys don't win. 

Thus, the goal of OPSEC is to control information and observable actions about
your capabilities and intentions in order to keep them from being used by your
adversary.

OPSEC works best when incorporated in the planning stages of any project -
don't try to close the barn door after the cow has followed the bull to the
pasture! To be successful, the integration of OPSEC into plans and projects
should be done by the folks who are the most familiar with the particular plan
or project. Those are the people who can best identify the plan's or project's
critical information (i.e. information that either makes or breaks the project).

OPSEC analysis focuses mainly on open sources information and actions (i.e.
unclassified or uncontrolled). The scary word here is "uncontrolled". The very
fact that the information and activities are open source make the
implementation of a good OPSEC plan much more challenging.

Okay, let's take a look at the OPSEC Process....
