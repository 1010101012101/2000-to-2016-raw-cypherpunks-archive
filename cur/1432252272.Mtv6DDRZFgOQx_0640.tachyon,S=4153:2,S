what kind of platform? are you counting on an internal processor, or are you
just storing a key to be acted on via a second device?  need more info.

Subject: crypto implementation for small footprint devices



Hi,

I am currently looking for crypto implementation that can fit into small
footprint (in the order of 50K or less) devices. Ideally, an SSL type of
protocol meets my requirements but it is almost impossible to implement it
within 50K even with selected cipher suites. So, I am looking for
alternatives (either symmetric key or public key based). I was thinking
about WTLS but looks like its implementation can not be significantly
smaller than that of TLS since it is also based on Public Key cryptography
(I am wondering how it fits into a cellphone). Can any one tell me what is
the approximate size of the client implementation of WTLS. Also, would
anyone send some pointers to me regarding what I am looking for.

Thanks in advance!!

Peter
