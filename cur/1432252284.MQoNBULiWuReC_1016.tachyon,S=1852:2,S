John Young and John Gilmore aren't the only cypherpunks
in the news lately.  J. Alif Terranson was in a BBC article
about getting the company to agree to drop the
hundred or so major spammers who've been using their network.

Some of them are former C&W customers, some are new,
and they've been estimated to be about $2M/month business for Savvis,
so this is a non-trivial step for Savvis.
On the other hand, Savvis risked getting its whole network blacklisted
by the major spam anti-spam groups if it didn't do something.

We'll see if they follow through.
