The problem dates from the early 1930s, when utility companies delivered
their bills by mailbox through their own employees out reading meters. The
Postal Service saw a huge drop in revenue and decided to act. Enforcement
became even more important in 1970, Dalton wrote, when Congress
mandated that the Postal Service be self-sustaining.
