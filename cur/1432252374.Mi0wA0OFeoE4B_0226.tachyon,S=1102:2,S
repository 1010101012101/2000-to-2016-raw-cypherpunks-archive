Dear Erich,

How about buying yourself a two Ro lex watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks

The best news is that in January (2009) you can buy two watches and get an extra 15% off your purchase!

Our Ro lex watches have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Mcmillan
