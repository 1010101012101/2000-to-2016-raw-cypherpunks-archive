TV makers may face mandate on digital receivers
Wed Jul 31, 9:17 AM ET

In an effort to jump-start the languid rollout of digital TV, federal
regulators
next week are expected to require all new TV sets to include digital
receivers by 2006, say people familiar with the matter.

TV makers say the mandate would boost the price
of a TV by about $200, dampening sales.
Broadcasters, who have pushed for such a rule,
dispute the figure.

Lets see... they think they can require crap in TVs, in teleco
equiptment... anyone still doubt they will try a power
grab on the motherboard?
