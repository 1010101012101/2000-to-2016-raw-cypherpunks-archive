* Headers - Add a job name, date, time, and page numbers at the top of a page.
* Footers - Add a job name, date, time, and page numbers at the bottom of a page.
* Watermarks - Center a text description in the background of each page.
* Start & Stop - Elect which page numbers to start and stop headers, footers,
  watermarks, and page numbers on.
* Apply Changes - When you input Headers, Footers, & Watermarks you can press
  the “Apply Changes” button to instantly view how your print job will appear.
