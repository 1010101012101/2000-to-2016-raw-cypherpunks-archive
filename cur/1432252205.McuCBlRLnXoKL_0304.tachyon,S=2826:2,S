 DaimlerChrysler's Chief Has Armored Mercedes Stolen

 Nov. 22 (Bloomberg) -- DaimlerChrysler AG Chief Executive Officer Juergen
Schrempp had his S600 Mercedes-Benz armored limousine stolen while it was
parked on a street in Stuttgart, the German city in which the carmaker is
based.

 The black company car, which is worth about 800,000 euros ($1 million),
disappeared on the night of Oct. 26, police spokesman Klaus-Peter Arand
said in a telephone interview. The limousine, which sports a 12-cylinder
engine and is equipped with a broadcasting device to help retrieve the car,
hasn't yet been found, the police said.

 Schrempp, 60, has been CEO of DaimlerChrysler since 1995. Hartmut Schick,
a spokesman for the world's fifth-largest carmaker, confirmed the theft
without giving details.

 The S600 is the top limousine with the Mercedes brand. The cheapest
version of the car costs 129,398 euros, according to the company's Web
site. The stolen vehicle had bullet-proof windows, ``finger-thick'' steel
plates as part of its chassis as well as tires designed to keep it running
even when flat, Bild-Zeitung reported today.

 The car was probably stolen by the ``Russian mafia,'' the German newspaper
said, citing an unidentified investigator.
