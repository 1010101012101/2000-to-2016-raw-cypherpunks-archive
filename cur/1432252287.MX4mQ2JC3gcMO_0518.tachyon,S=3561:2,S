Professor Bill Allen, a former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter, is teaching
a three-hour course titled "Science Investigative Reporting: Drone
Journalism."

The class is using drones made by the school's engineering department.

lect-news/ 

 

To fly a drone in US National Air Space (NAS), requires FAA licensing, which
includes certification that the drone is safe, and that it is flown by
someone who has a pilot's license.  I do not see U of Missouri on list of
authorized drone licensees which EFF found out from FAA via FOIA.

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/faa-releases-its-list-drone-certificat
es-leaves-many-questions-unanswered

 

They keep adding to the list, so maybe UM is on a list I have not yet seen.
If flying exclusively indoors, drones do not need FAA licensing.

I am sure that as soon as someone is caught flying a drone inside Congress,
White House, a Legislature, Court Building, or other official site, this
loophole will be altered.
