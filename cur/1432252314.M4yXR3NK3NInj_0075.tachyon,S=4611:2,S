Thanks, but I'd go a bit further.  The percentage of humans who would be
capable of such evil has to be vanishingly small.  Unfortunately, that
percentage is not zero so this sort of thing continues to happen.

We have to assume it because it demonstrably exists.  The trick then is, to
make the costs greater or the benefits less.  Easier said then done, but
those are our only alternatives.

I think a much strong argument can be made that those who do not believe in
an afterlife would be more deterred than those who do.

Yeah, but it's that once that counts forever.  In any event, that's the
situation in which we live.  There will always be that tiny minority that
will do evil.  The rest of us are left to monkey with the cost/benefit to
reduce the incidences of such evil.  Life goes on.

And so far, unsupported by the facts.  Time will tell.  In the mean time,
Meyer, I'll bet you, or anyone on this list, a C-note that this is the work
of Bin Laden.  Any takers?
