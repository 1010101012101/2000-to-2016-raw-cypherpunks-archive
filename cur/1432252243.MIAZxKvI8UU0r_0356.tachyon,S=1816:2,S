Number of marijuana plants seized at Sequoia has soared. Officials say
Mexican cartels linked to
Mideast terrorists run the operation.

the
methamphetamine trade in the adjacent Central Valley, drug enforcement

financial ties to Middle Eastern smugglers linked to Hezbollah and other

groups accused of terrorism.
