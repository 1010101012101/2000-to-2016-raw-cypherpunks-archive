Does anyone know more about what Coverity does?  Their web site basically says
"Give is bucketloads of money and we'll talk to you under NDA", but their
"Products" link is broken, and even then it's hard to tell whether they just
run ITS4 and filter the results (OK, it's a spinoff from the MC Checker work
so it's more sophisticated than that, but having to sign an NDA just to find
out what it is they do seems rather counter to the academic origins of the
work).
