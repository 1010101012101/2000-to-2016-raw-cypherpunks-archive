On Choate's point above, it is not FAL (a rifle, but I assume Choate 
must mean the maker of the FAL, Fabrique Nationale, now owned by 
another company, IIRC) who are making a caseless ammo rifle. Rather, 
it is in fact H-K. The G11 has been in development for close to 30 
years now.

(H-K are _also_ owned by another company. Last I heard, a British 
company bought H-K, though the factories and design groups remain in 
Germany.)

Most NATO countries have now adopted some variant of the 5.56 mm 
cartridge, in either M-16-type variants or in bullpup designs like 
the excellent Steyr AUG or the newer HK G36 (with a civilian model, 
the SL8). Neither the caseless ammo of the H-K G11 not the 
flechette-firing prototypes are getting wide acceptance.

And as relates to Choate's "I was right" point, repeated again 
recently, the G3 in use by the German army was most definitely a 7.62 
mm, i.e., a .308 Winchester. It was _not_ the 5.56 mm variant, at 
least not for wide use. (I say this because quibblers like Choate 
like to find examples where _someone_ used a 5.56 mm and then say 
"See, I was RIGHT!")
