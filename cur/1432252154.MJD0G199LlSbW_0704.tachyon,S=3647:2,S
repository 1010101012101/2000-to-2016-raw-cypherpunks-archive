Nah - buying delivered pizza with cash is obviously indicates money laundering
to hide cash from drug transactions...   Especially if the recording of your
call starts out "like, wow, man, we'd like some pizza.  Yeah, pizza!
Oh, wait, what do we want on it?   Shrooms and pepperoni?
and like Everything but the little fishies, man!"

New Jersey's Pizza Connection case a few years ago busted a dozen or so
pizza shops for delivering other products as well as pizza,
primarily heroin.
