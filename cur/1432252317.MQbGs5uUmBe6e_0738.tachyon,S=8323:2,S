The FinFisher guys wrote this paper ages ago:
http://www.remote-exploit.org/research/busting-bluetooth-myth.pdf (now gone)

Here's a mirror:
bluetooth-pentest.narod.ru/doc/busting_bluetooth_myth_sniffer.pdf


The best quote is here:

"Introduction
During the last year, rumours had come to my
attention that apparently it is possible to
transform a standard 30USD Bluetooth.
dongle into a full-blown Bluetooth. sniffer.
Thinking you absolutely need Hardware to be
able to hop 79 channels 1600 times a second I
was rather suspicious about these claims."

Basically, he took a $30 bluetooth device and constructed a sniffer that
works with downloadable software.

Yeah - the fact that FinFisher offers it should cause concern.

What's your threat model? It's impossible to meaningfully answer that
question in the abstract. "It's feasible and likely" if the target
warrants it and "possible" for a kiddie in a cafe.

I'm sure some of the cell phone intercept gear already does this as a
bonus add on feature - probably in shopping malls for tracking movements.

FinFisher sells it and so governments have it. We know the Egyptians had
it, I bet they had the Bluetooth module but I'm not certain.

Jane has patterns - Jane should use a connected headset and Jane will be
better off.

The question is impossible to answer. You'll know for sure if the
attacker tells you, not at all if they don't and they take no other
actions, and you'll just go crazy if bad stuff starts to happen and you
have no idea why. If that really is her weak point, I think she should
use a headset that is wired into the phone.

It's a sad replacement for a wire, eh?

Yeah, I'm not seeing how it's a good idea. The fact of the matter is
simple - Jane is an activist trying to stay safe, Jane should not do
unsafe things if she can help it. Bluetooth is a luxury that given the
weaponized nature of some of the attackers, I think it is best avoided.
Simply having it on will provide a relative tracking beacon - I imagine
that some airplane modes on cell phones don't disable BT or Wifi...

Sure thing. I'm glad you're asking these questions.

All the best,
Jacob
