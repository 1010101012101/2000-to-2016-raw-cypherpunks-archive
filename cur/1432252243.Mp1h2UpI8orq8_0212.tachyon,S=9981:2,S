if u really want to know what i think then u need to know my thought
processies are not like "white" ppl > ideas of ownership are foreign
to me i am native american and most tribes though they lived in areas
didnt consider ownership of them but a co-creative partnership - re:
food > when my people hunted buffalo in the plains they didnt just
indiscriminately kill buffalo they weeded the herd and were mindful to
examine how they could be of help to the herd it was only intelligent
to do so as it kept their source of food and clothing healthy and
vibrant but also it was respectful of life

so there are people that give food away for free right now today > why
would they do that?

well i think ideas are in the air and we build on the shoulders of
giants so production is owed down thru the ages and i think there isnt
really a you basically > your first form i would say is life itself
and you are made mostly of water and some minerals (dirt) and when you
'die' your body dissipates like a cloud - i dont think 'you' die i
think you just transform

so there is no 'you' to have ownership > would you say life owns life
? that would be odd > i think ownership is an illusion i also think
you didnt make yourself so that would be a glitch in your argument > i
mean i think you had a bit to say in the matter but we are very
limited mathematical concoctions (gorgeously made and amazing but
limited) we cant presently manufacture ourselves in order to "own"
ourselves but even then we wouldnt be independent of life itself so
... > maybe in future we will manufacture ourselves but there is
probably going to be a divisive factor in the manufacturing of life
forms (divisive as in schism - not workin so good - should be
interesting but already happening w/ monsanto actually so...)

i think the idea of ownership was made by rulers (seen thru millenia
but look at the magna carta which will be 800 in 2015) i want as
little to do with rulers thought patterns and functioning as possible
