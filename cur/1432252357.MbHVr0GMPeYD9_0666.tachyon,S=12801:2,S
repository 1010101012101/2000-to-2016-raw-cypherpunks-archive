Let me try to explain what is and isn't technically difficult about this  
idea. Feel free to pass it around. I have cc'd the liberationtech list.

Torrent is an open protocol. There are numerous open source torrent  
libraries. Opera can download torrents natively, for Firefox there are  
extensions to do this, and so far as I know every browser has some kind of 
plug-able framework for MIME type (Internet media type) handling. To have a 
browser download and then open a torrent of a page is totally realistic, 
and probably not that much code.

The problem is that this is not the actual technical challenge. The actual 
challenges are these:
1. Name resolution: How do I find the torrent file, and then the P2P cloud 
itself?
2. Updates: How do I share a Web site as a living, updating document?
3. Server backend: Is it realistic to run a modern Web site without a  
client-server relationship?

1. Name resolution comes in two parts: finding the torrent file, and then 
finding the actual P2P cloud. Web sites like The Pirate Bay function as 
name resolution services for finding torrent files, but obviously any 
single such server can be blocked. What I presume we actually desire is a 
name resolution service just like DNS for Web sites: you type in a URL, it 
gets resolved to a torrent file.

URLs have a hostname and a path, e.g.  
"www.hostname.com/path/to/torrent.file". "www.hostname.com" is resolved by 
DNS to a server, and then "/path/to/torrent.file" is resolved by that  
server. So unfortunately, you don't gain any takedown resistance by  
hosting your torrent file at "www.myserver.com/my.torrent", because if  
"www.myserver.com" is taken down, then "/my.torrent" can't be resolved. So 
what you would actually need is for DNS to provide hostname resolution 
directly into torrents. This is a sweet idea, but changing DNS is hard.

Even if you could do that, well, what's in a "torrent file"? A torrent  
file contains information to get you joined into the P2P cloud;  
specifically, it contains the address of a tracker, a central server that 
gates entry into the cloud. If the tracker is down or blocked by some 
technology, you can't enter the cloud. This is primarily a weakness of the 
BitTorrent protocol, and not the idea itself; there are extensions to 
BitTorrent and other P2P protocols that are resilient to this weakness. But 
fundamentally, finding your way into the P2P cloud is an act of name 
resolution to find other peers in the cloud, which is most easily done by a 
name resolution server, in this case the tracker. If we're going about 
making changes to DNS, probably the most technically sane (but politically 
unrealistic) solution would be for DNS itself to provide tracking 
capability for the cloud. Again, that is a sweet idea, but changing DNS is 
hard.

I don't mean to suggest these issues are insurmountable, merely that this 
is the actual Hard Part.

2.  In order to support dynamic content there has to be a cryptographic  
distinction between updates coming from the legitimate publisher of the  
site (Alice), and subterfuge coming from Evil Eve. Cryptographic  
authentication might be authenticated by the data being shared (e.g. this 
data is signed by Alice, and everybody knows her signature) or by the P2P 
network itself (e.g. in addition to sharing the torrent, the servers also 
provide a distributed authentication service that will only accept updates 
signed by Alice). I am by no means an expert on this subject, so I will 
refrain from talking about it extensively, but I bring it up merely because 
cryptography is non-optional for any dynamic scheme, and I'm not aware of 
any update-able, cryptographically-secured P2P torrents. It sounds like 
maybe they should exist? It also sounds Hard, and Google isn't turning 
anything up.

Again, I'm not suggesting these issues are insurmountable; in some sense  
Google Docs does all this. But they do it with a pretty sophisticated  
backend that glues many technologies together (I guarantee Google has a  
killer internal name resolution and authentication service), and I have no 
idea how Hard it would be to make those parts takedown-resistant (in the 
sense that there are no central servers. There are unquestionably central 
servers at Google).

3. The real elephant in the room is that modern Web sites are best thought 
of as programs, not files, and program distribution is infinitely harder 
than file distribution. When you visit a Wordpress blog, what you appear to 
receive is an HTML file: but in actuality that HTML was streamed by a PHP 
script running on the server talking to a MySQL database. The number of 
layers in this onion is arbitrary; it's anything you could run on a 
computer. Arbitrary code, or I could hook MSPaint up to the thing if I 
wanted it enough. Distributing *and executing* arbitrary code like this is 
Quite Possibly Impossible, and if it is possible it is Very Far Away. At 
any rate, BitTorrent can't do this.

The word "arbitrary" is important. In specific cases, you can certainly  
find a case-specific resolution. Diaspora is building something like a  
distributed social network "program", and I do honestly believe that with a 
lot of code and hard thinking, you could distribute a Wordpress blog's 
backend on P2P. It would probably require a total rewrite of Wordpress such 
that it wouldn't even be the same piece of software, and you would have to 
solve the other Hard Problems above, but I think it is technically possible 
at this time. But in the general case, you might have more luck working 
towards a Singularity and then asking the Machine-Gods for an answer.

What seems more realistic to me is taking snapshots of a Web site and  
distributing those as files instead, rather than trying to distribute the 
actual Web site program. That's why we designed Mirror As You Link to work 
that way.

These are all the hard issues I can think of, as a technical person with  
some distributed systems background. There may be others, since in some  
cases we're really exploring uncharted waters here.
