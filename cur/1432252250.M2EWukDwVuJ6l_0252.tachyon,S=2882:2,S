There was more fighting and carnage in Gulf War 1 than this
piddling latest. This was not a war but a training exercise, a
rattling of sabers, gunboat diplomacy.

The military provided more information in Gulf War 1 than all
the embedded and free-lancers in the latest. Almost no gunship
videos and bombs hitting targets compared to GW1, while the
US was smothered with talking heads doing not much different
than they did in the studio.

The videos in Baghdad showed kiddie versions of Iraqi defenses 
lighting up the sky, just boring shots of a few vehicles moving
as if there was nothing much going on. No cowering journalists, 
breaking glass, running for the basement.

If you wanted to kill reporting you could hardly have done better
than putting the mouthpieces in the field far from the bombing,
and mostly away from the diddly shit combat.

The purpose of the war seems to be to scare the bejesus out of
likely targets, a display of power a notch or two above a war game,
but nothing as thrilling as a movie -- which are showing more
warporn and gore than was shown in GW2.

The attack on WTC and the Pentagon was much superior politics,
theater, diplomacy, art, entertainment, grief, shock and awe.

War porn lovers will just have to replay those tapes until a great
blockbuster comes again. A liquified gas tanker in San Diego 
Bay and another off Staten Island. Tens of the highest hazard 
dams (thousands of them still listed and ranked on the Internet). 
Several stadia of sports fans. 5 or 6 suspension bridges. None 
of these need a MOAB to cause more casualties than GWB's GW2.

Welfare mutants are not the targets, dream on racist greedy 
motherfuckers,  your fat GWB predatory life style is. The military
can't protect you from terrorists, nor can the police from mutants
outfucking you every day. Blue-eyed supremacists are chasing
the dodo, guns and bombs ineffectual.
