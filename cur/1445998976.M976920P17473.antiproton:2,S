The U.S. Senate voted 74-21 in favor of CISA, a controversial
cybersecurity bill. All five amendments submitted in an attempt to
bolster privacy failed to pass. From The Guardian's coverage: Try
asking the bill’s sponsors how the bill will prevent cyberattacks or
force companies and governments to improve their defenses. They can’t
answer. They will use buzzwords like “info-sharing” yet will
conveniently ignore the fact that companies and the government can
already share information with each other as is. There were barely any
actual cybersecurity experts who were for the bill. A large group of
respected computer scientists and engineers were against it. So were
cyberlaw professors. Civil liberties groups uniformly opposed (and
were appalled by) the bill. So did consumer groups. So did the vast
majority of giant tech companies. Yet it still sailed through the
Senate, mostly because lawmakers - many of whom can barely operate
their own email - know hardly anything about the technology that
they’re crafting legislation about.

In other words, you're all fucked again... us 10, you ZERO, hahaha!
