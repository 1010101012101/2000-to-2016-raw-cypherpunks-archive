Yeah.  The real problem with all these other uses is that they create
a negative feedback loop:  the more useful the card is, the more
people are motivated to get involved in "fradulent issue," and the
more rationalizations there are for DMV employees to engage in it.  So
we spend more and more to secure the cards, and the only people who
win are the hologram manufacturers.

Unfortunately, the people actually relying on the cards don't realize
this as fast as the users of the system.
