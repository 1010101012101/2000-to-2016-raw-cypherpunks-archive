Russian media reports say that a Japanese militant is part of a group of 
around 100 Muslim fighters who crossed from Georgia into the breakaway 
republic of Chechnya July 29. Two militants captured by Russian forces said 
there were several mercenaries in the group, including a Japanese convert 
to Islam who was trained by instructors of Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, 
ITAR-Tass and the Kommersant daily reported.

Although the existence of the Japanese militant is unconfirmed, it 
potentially could further complicate counterterrorism operations around the 
world. As the number of alleged al Qaeda operatives and other Muslim 
militants coming from places other than the Middle East or South Asia 
rises, a key tool used to identify potential terrorists -- racial profiling 
-- may become even less effective.

Russia has long argued that Chechen separatist fighters are linked to al 
Qaeda, and the presence of a Japanese man among their ranks suggests there 
is a broader ethnic mix from which al Qaeda or related militant groups can 
recruit. From China's ethnic Uighurs to American Taliban fighter John 
Walker Lindh to a British national on trial in Dagestan for alleged 
terrorism, Muslim militants are not limited to Arabs or South Asians. The 
arrest in June of Jose Padilla, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican accused of 
planning to set off a so-called "dirty bomb" in the United States, only 
underscored this reality.

Interestingly, some Japanese militant organizations have a long history of 
ties to Islamic militants. The Japanese Red Army, a leftist group 
responsible for the 1972 attack on Tel Aviv's Lod airport as well as 
several airline hijackings and attacks on foreign embassies, worked closely 
with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Although the 
Japanese Red Army disbanded in 2001 on the 30th anniversary of the Lod 
attack, the precedent for such cooperation still remains.
