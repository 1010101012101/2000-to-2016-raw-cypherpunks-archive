Hello Serious Investors,

On Monday, August 27, 2001  The market posted limited losses on
an uneventful trading session. Volume continued to be anemic on
both of the stock exchanges. The NYSE, for instance, saw its
second lightest day of the year in terms of activity.  Most
market participants are in a waiting mode before deciding which
side to join - bulls or bears.  It is important to note,
however, that all four key investor sentiment readings shifted
towards the bear camp last week.  Consensus Index, which
measures Bullish Opinion, dropped especially sharply from 40%
to 29%. But other sentiment readings (Investor Intelligence,
AAII index, and Market VANE) still do not demonstrate enough
fear to confirm market’s bottom. 


So while the market is deciding which way to go, here is 20
FREE Stock trading lessons to help fine turn your investing
skills.
