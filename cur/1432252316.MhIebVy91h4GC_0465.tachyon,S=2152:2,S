Of course, the act of abolition, using the law itself, is an exercise in
mental masturbation, which is what is really happening in Pennsylvania.

Financial cryptography gives us at least the hope of property -- or control
of property -- without legislation, if not prior legal agreement. David
Friedman's private law without public law.

Corporations, as creatures of this state wouldn't have to exist in such a
world, where limited liability could be done the old fashioned way: with
anonymity. :-)

Cheers,
RAH
