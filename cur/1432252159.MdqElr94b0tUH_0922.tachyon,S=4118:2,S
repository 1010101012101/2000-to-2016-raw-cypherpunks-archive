Subject:        	DEA-Asa misleads the public again

Friends:

You may recall last week the DEA issued a press release reacting to a DC
Court decision on a medical marijuana petition. Asa Hutchison declared
that the decision showed that marijuana was a dangerous drug and was
properly scheduled.

In fact, the Court of Appeals did not rule on the substance of the issue
-- instead it solely ruled on the issue of standing -- whether or not
Jon Gettman and High Times (the petitioners) could bring suit.

In addition, whether marijuana is a dangerous drug or not has nothing to
do with its placement in Schedule I. Both Sch I and Sch II drugs have a
"high potential for abuse." The only difference between the Schedules is
whether there is an "accepted medical use."

Certainly, Mr. Hutchison -- a trained attorney -- understands the
concept of standing and can read a Court of Appeals decision. He
realizes the court did not reach the substance of the issues. So, it
seems like he intentionally misled the media and the public.

One more deception for the drug warrirors. If they have to be dishonest
-- intentionally -- they know they are on weak ground.

Kevin
