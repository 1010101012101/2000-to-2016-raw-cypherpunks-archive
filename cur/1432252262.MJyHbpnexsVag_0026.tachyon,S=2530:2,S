That is incorrect.  AOL owns their network, and they can respond to your
arbitrary communications on their network in any way they see fit.  Maybe
they will deliver your email to your AOL subscribing friend.  Maybe they
will block that email.  Maybe they will translate the email into French
and reverse the word-order and then send it to your friend.  Maybe they
will print it out and mail it back to you for no reason.  All of these
responses are perfectly legitimate, and represent a private entity using
their property in whatever way they see fit, _provided that_ they abide by
any contracts they have entered into with their subscriber (which, in this
case, is not you).

It amazes me how many people on this list only respect private property
when it is convenient for them to do so.  (For reference, see the "Tim May
argues (correctly) that people can't protest in his house" and, more
recently, the "Gilmore thinks airlines can't refuse him travel for any
reason they see fit"  threads)
