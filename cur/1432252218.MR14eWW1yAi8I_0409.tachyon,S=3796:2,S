Perry's last sentence gets to the heart of the matter. If CAs 
included a financial guarantee of whatever it is they are asserting 
when they issue a certificate, then all these problems would go away. 
The CAs would have a strong interest in clarifying the semantics of 
certificates and would choose technology and verification methods 
that optimized the risk vs cost (including difficulty of use) 
tradeoff.

I believe the reason this has not happened yet is that various 
business interests perceive an opportunity to get the government to 
shift all risk to the consumer by snowing legislators with crypto 
mumbo-jumbo.  That is an even cheaper solution from the business 
interests' perspective.
