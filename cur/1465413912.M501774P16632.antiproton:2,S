Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.

But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.

Getting enough TOR users to do real work in the real world to register
themselves as TOR users sounds like a non-starter to me.
