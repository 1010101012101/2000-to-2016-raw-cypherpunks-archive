It was ATF, about some gun-robbers; it seems to be a reply to trollbait
by the Faux news channel or spontaneous dreck.

Are they Terrorist or MilitiaBY GunMuse

 That was the question asked and answered to by Fox News to the ATF in
Michigan Gun
 store robberies. This is a prime example of where we see our gun
organizations failing to
 take action. Those words are not interchangeable. The Clinton
administration tried to
 make it that way while they rewrote the constitution via executive
orders, and gave away
 federal lands and national treasures (Like the liberty bell) to the
United Nations.

 This is a defamation of character to interchange these words.
Militias are required to by
 the constitution to be a citizen protection from government corruption
and abuse of power
 on its own people.  Its the very reason that the military can not be
used to police US
 citizens for any reason.

 More than 300 firearms have been stolen from local dealers in a short
period of time.  The
 thieves were caught on film using a shotgun to blast open the front
door running to the
 back display cases and grabbing as many pistols as they could carry and
were gone in
 less than 1 minute and 15 seconds.  The ATF said they already had
suspects and had
 issued a federal search warrant in the case and then was asked the
question.  Are the
 robbers terrorist or Militia?  Lumping American patriots and believers
in a strong
 constitutional government in the same boat as those who attacked New
York.
