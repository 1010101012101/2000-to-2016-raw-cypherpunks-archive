Barry McCaffrey, former Drug Czar, making an approved leak on how the US
plans to deal with sub-national groups, their friends, and their
supporters.

It's not nice to taunt Happy-Fun-Superpower.

-----

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who was drug czar
during President Clinton's second term, said in an online exchange last
month that those against the United States in its war on terrorism would
"be killed suddenly, in significant numbers and without warning."

...
   
"We are going to disrupt these people through preemptive attack ... we
will deceive them, we will run psyops on them, at selected points and
times they will be killed suddenly, in significant numbers, and without
warning."
   
"Tomahawk missiles, 2000 pound laser guided weapons dropped from B2's or
F22's at very high altitude, remote control, booby traps, blackmail and at
places, small groups of soldiers or SEALs will appear in total darkness,
blow down the doors and kill them at close range with automatic weapons
and hand grenades"

...

A U.S. military official who was shown McCaffrey's comments said they were
the "insights of a very smart guy."
   
Another official said they do not contain any national secrets, but they
do accurately reflect the strategy the United States has adopted.
   
In the words of this official: "It's the plan."
