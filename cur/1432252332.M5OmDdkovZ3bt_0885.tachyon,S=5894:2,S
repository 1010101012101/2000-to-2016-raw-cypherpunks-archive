That should have been Bernie-S, not -X. And Mitnick now runs
a rather profitable security service and lecture series.

About Jim Bell (he can speak for himself but I know best
how to smell and tell a rat):

The IRS secret agent leading Jim's chase, Agent Gordon, lurked
on cypherpunks for a long time, gathering names and addresses
to subpoena for Jim's grand jury probe and (first) trial. Several of us
were subpoenad along with cpunks records from some (John Gilmore
one of those). Some, like me, were summoned both for the grand jury
and the trial held in Tacoma, WA. (Sidebar: youngster Declan
McCullagh covered that and I urged him to report seditiously
enough to be sent to jail to build his rep -- he politely refused
to cellmate Jim.)

Short story (full account in the archive) is that not many supported
Jim all the way when the shit came down, indeed, brazenly ridiculed
his adventure, presumably to cover their ass from Agent Gordon
and co-lurkers always on duty hereabouts.

Who secretly ratted Jim at the grand jury remains unknown but their
behavior and sweat odor has been profiled by god and they will not
be given authentic bitcoins, only fakes with their undercover UID
embedded like Lamo.

Notice upon release from prison that ex-cons are expected to
be on call. Panoptic assured. Moreso for ex-spies.
