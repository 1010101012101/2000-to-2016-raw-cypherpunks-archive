Much the same thing as when governors in the past (and legislatures) 
said that there laws about race-mixing took precedence over Yankee laws 
*requiring* race-mixing.

Namely, the troops were called in to assert the power of the 
Washingtonians over the states.

Ditto for troops enforcing school busing.

And in the New Regime of suspension of detention without trial, sneak 
and peak raids without warrants, torture (proposed by some Zionist 
shysters), and untrained-for-police-work soldiers waving M-16s at the 
proles, expect things to be much, much worse.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
