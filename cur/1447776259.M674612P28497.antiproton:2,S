&lt;&lt;As Paris reels from terrorist attacks that have claimed at least
128 lives, fierce blame for the carnage is being directed toward American
whistleblower Edward Snowden and the spread of strong encryption
catalyzed by his actions. Now the Paris attacks are being used an excuse
to demand back doors&gt;&gt;<br><br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;how can =E2=80=9Cofficials=E2=80=9D and their media stenographers=
 persist in
trying to convince people of such a blatant, easily disproven falsehood:
namely, that Terrorists learned to hide their communications from
Snowden=E2=80=99s revelations? They do it because of how many benefits there
are from swindling people to believe this. To begin with, U.S officials
are eager here to demonize far more than just Snowden<br>
They want to demonize encryption generally as well as any companies that
offer it. Indeed, as these media accounts show, they=E2=80=99ve been trying =
for
two decades to equate the use of encryption =97 anything that keeps them
out of people=E2=80=99s private onlinee communications =97 with aiding and
abetting The Terrorists&gt;&gt;<br><br>
&lt;&lt;Above all, there=E2=80=99s the desperation to prevent people from
asking how and why ISIS was able to spring up seemingly out of nowhere
and be so powerful, able to blow up a Russian passenger plane, a market
in Beirut, and the streets of Paris in a single week. That=E2=80=99s the one
question Western officials are most desperate not to be asked, so
directing people=E2=80=99s ire to Edward Snowden and strong encryption is
beneficial in the extreme&gt;&gt;<br><br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;There=E2=80=99s the related question of how ISIS has become so
well-armed and powerful. There are many causes, but a leading one is the
role played by the U.S. and its =E2=80=9Callies in the region=E2=80=9D=
 (i.e., Gulf
