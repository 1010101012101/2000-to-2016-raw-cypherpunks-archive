That wasn't "someone hidden with a video camera", it was a video recording 
unit in the cop car - and the audio was probably wireless mike(s) going 
back to that same recorder - it's frequently used for traffic or DUI stops, 
to record evidence against the accused. The "VSP" in the lower left corner 
is most likely Virginia State Police, the agency whose officers were 
involved in the interaction.

The video probably got to the website via the defendant, who received it 
through the pretrial discovery process.
