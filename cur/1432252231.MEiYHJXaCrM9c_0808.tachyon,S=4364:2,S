I have a couple older VIA C3 with hardware RNG, bought long ago for just that purpose. 
What kind of motherboard is in there, do you know?

It is unauditable, just as any integrated RNG sources. Which
is not that big of problem, if you mix in enough external entropy
from a trusted source. The trusted source need to be sufficiently
simple to be validated by inspection. You can source RTL-SDRs
from many sources. All you need is to match impedance and output
power from your analog white noise circuit to goldilocks level.

In case anyone is interested,

But there is still no simple kit you could directly plug into your
coax socket. That is a threshold of entry too high for people
who can't tell which part of the soldering iron is the hot one.
