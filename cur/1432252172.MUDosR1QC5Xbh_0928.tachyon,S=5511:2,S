	Right, it doesn't mean one thing, it means *two* different and mutually 
exclusive things. It is vulgarly used to mean 'chaos', and it's used by 
advocates of voluntary interactions to describe a social system based on 
voluntary interactions.

	You know, voluntary interactions : The opposite of cheering the drug laws 
of the american state.

	A government is a criminal organization that violates rights to life 
liberty and property. Those criminal 'functions' of government can't exist 
in  a voluntary society.

	
	If 'people' 'reimplement' what government does, then we are not talking 
about anarchy.

	Not sure what you're getting at...

	I don't see the connection between leaders and their sheep on one hand and 
'chaos' on the other.

	It's quite possible to have 'order' without 'leaders'. It's called 
self-government. Or doing what you like and leaving your neighbor alone.

	Individuals can interact as individuals, voluntary and with no 'chaos' in 
sight. I don't see why it should be 'unstable'.
