For all those speaking favorably of the twentieth century trends 
toward voluntary mandatory (VM) taxes, a la the VM taxes on PCs to 
support recording moguls, the VM taxes on paper to support writers, 
the VM taxes on hamburgers to fund heart disease research, consider 
where ever-increasing taxes take us:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13169.html

"Here's something to think about - while queuing up for petrol this 
afternoon (yes - I confess to being a panic buyer) I worked out that 
OPEC is charging $30 a barrel and our government is taxing us at 
slightly over $150 a barrel - ouch!"

This is from the U.K., where tax policy is ahead of that of the U.S. 
Whilst we are (almost) ready to mcveigh the tax collectors and wipe 
out millions of burrowcrats, the Brits are quite sheeplike in 
accepting taxes which are several times the price of the underlying 
commodity. Germany, France, Sweden, Italy, and essentially all other 
European nations are similarly sheep-like in their acceptance of such 
taxes. This is where the "voluntary mandatory" taxation trend leads 
us. Taxes become an instrument of social policy as well as a way to 
line the pockets of the burrowcrats who go into government service.

Frankly, tens of millions need to be liquidated.

Thank Baal for unbreakable crypto.
