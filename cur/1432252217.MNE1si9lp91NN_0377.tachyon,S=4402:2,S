The list has been under 'attack' for a while. There are multiple parties
and they don't seem to be working in concert.

I base this on the observation, for example, that during the recent
group diatribe over 'filter this ...' at one point I received a mass of
removal notices from a bunch of spam lists. I'd guesstimate a couple dozen
over a two day period (or so).

Secondly, that when this happened the total amount of spam dropped
considerably (based on intentional eye count of sniffer logs). Then over
the last several weeks it has ramped back up to new levels (roughtly 2x
the past peak total to date). This is of course on the unfiltered backbone
and straight feeds like SSZ.

Thirdly, I operate several other lists and by comparing (again roughly)
the amount of bounces they get (because the spam source isn't subscribed)
plus the total that get through should (my axiom) be about equal to what
come into cypherpunks; wich is a harlet of a mailing list.

They ain't close.
