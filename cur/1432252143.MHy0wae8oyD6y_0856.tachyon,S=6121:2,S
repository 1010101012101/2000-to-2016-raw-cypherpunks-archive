More of the usual bullshit, SOP for the quasi-anonymised defenders of
local trvth.

State _workers_ attack property rights; state _workers_ act to aid 'the
rich' in consolidating and concentrating property and property rights
against 'the poor'.  In exchange for a little job security, state
_workers_ have passivly evolved a neat little system which may be
exploited by knowledgeable insiders for their own malign purposes.  

Congratulations to the defenders of Truth, Freedom, and Democracy for in
effect rolling back property rights (to say nothing of human and civil
rights), in effect cancelling the legal advances brought about by the
Magna Carta and succeeding documents.  It is a testament to the success
and current fashion of reality simplification that state agents may
arbitrarily employ the tools of terrorism, appropriation and confiscation,
arbitrary detention, and not insignificantly, micromanage _de facto_
slaves according to their whims, or at least those of their privilaged
benefactors.  This is accomplished by the strategic use of pretexts --
some secret, others validated by tenets of pop culture; none of which may
be assailed by reasonable means -- to lend a veneer of legitimacy to the
acts of violence.  And in this vein I should not need to remind anyone of
the fact that theft, as much as a boot to the head or back of the neck, is
an act of violence; and no matter if it is perpetrated by seeming
officiousness by way in some farcical one-sided and secret legal process,
or by dint of a convenient and contrived necessity.

Uh-huh.  And what of the state of affairs where rights of property, for
example, may be subverted by fraud and the means of legal redress (no
matter how unjust, inefficient and ineffective they may be for practical
purposes) are closed off, one by one, so that the victims of state
violence are allowed NO OPTIONS or RELEIF, perhaps to start again from
scratch, but more likely to whither and die on the vine, ignored except
when it is necessary to reinforce the conditioning to ruin by the
application of a periodic boot to the back of the neck.

And you all may cluck cluck safely in your ivory towers at the sorry state
of others affairs, pontificating (again, safely) at an intellectual remove
from the ground that is in conflict and at issue.  Obvioulsly the best way
to seem comitted to change and a solution to difficult problems without
actually risking engagement with the core matter.


This list is becoming a chore to read.  Would someone find out where Tim
May and Detwellier (for a start) are hiding, and please recommend them
back to Cypherpunks?   When such as they were active, we could be assured
of lively and entertaining debate.  These days, the air is rather too thin
to support vigorous and sincere exchange.


Regards,

Steve
