Just wondering. Is it possible to disguise a PGP'd message as a more weakly 
encrypted message that then decrypts to something other than the true 
message?

OK...perhaps we stego an encrypted message, then encrypt that photo using 
something weaker.

Not like they haven't already thought of that, though. And it seems to me to 
be a difficult task getting ahold of enough photos that would be believably 
worth encrypting.
