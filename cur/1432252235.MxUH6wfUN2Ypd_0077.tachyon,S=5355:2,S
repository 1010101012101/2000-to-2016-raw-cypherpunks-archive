Sure looks like it.

Not that much cash.  It's only $125 for an exploit.  that's not
much in $/hr of effort.

governments have more cash.  the highest bidders could use it as a
way to keep track of who is doing what, since the web site says
people who find exploits are given full credit.  The mafiosi seem
like the least of our problems with this.

If I got paid, I wouldn't want anyone to have the ability to come find me!

Not at that rate of pay.  Might be a good way to find talent tho.

Yes they exist, and most have 3 letter acronyms.  Well, a few have
numbers in there :-)  A lot of government agencies need cash that
their handlers won't give, so they go steal it.  Since their jobs
are breaking laws, nobody notices.

How?  iDEFENSE isn't really breaking any laws, they are just
immoral scum bags.  Maybe the publication of the first person
hunted down and executed by an angry government will slow down
contributors?

thanks for posting this, the net is getting more and more interesting
:-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
