I tried to something like this in the late '80s to allow efficient 
loss-less compression using "conditioned" PRNs which could generate 
suitable auto correlated streams.  Unfortunately, I did not discover a 
similar method of locating the desired sequences. The search during the 
compression phase was to computationally difficult and I abandoned the effort.
