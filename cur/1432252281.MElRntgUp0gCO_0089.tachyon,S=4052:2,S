I don't mean the disk - there are lots of those.
I mean your software.
Also, can your tool use floppies instead of USB keys?
There are problems with KGB-quality attackers recovering overwritten data
which are probably much more serious for disks than flash rom,
but they're nearly universal and good shredders work well on them.

USB key disks look like an obvious target for eavesdropping in general.
(They're also the best medium for re-inventing the floppy-disk virus:-)

You need to use each bit twice - once to encrypt, and once to decrypt.
Destroying them after the first use is a bad idea....
