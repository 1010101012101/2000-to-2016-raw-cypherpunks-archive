I guess it's just that govs see that they're losing power and thus are
scrambling to get themselves involved everywhere. or, on a slightly less
malicious scale, they're equally desperately trying to show that they
*do* have something of consequence to contribute.

maybe DMCA (as much as I hate it) and the breaking of micro$oft (as much
as I love it) both stem from the same emotional source.
