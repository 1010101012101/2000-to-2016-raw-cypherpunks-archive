What is most poignant about this post is the lack of education
of /. authors.  Don't they teach Maxwell any more?  Is Faraday
just the guy who said
"Sir, I do not know what it is good for.
But of one thing I am quite certain--someday you will tax it."

Put your cell phone in a metal tin, and call it.
Wrap your access point or receiver or other radio in Al foil.
Do you think Brin in _Enemy of the State_ was just a potato-chip
fetishist?
