No, liquid metal embrittlement does not require that aluminum, for 
example, be nearly in a liquid state. The mercury amalgam that forms can 
even form at cryogenic temperatures, not to mention at normal ambient 
temperatures.

Google is great, but beware of getting your basic science just from some 
items you find.

Fontana and Greene is a good text on corrosion, and there are even some 
pretty good online descriptions of LME in connection with mercury on 
aluminum.
