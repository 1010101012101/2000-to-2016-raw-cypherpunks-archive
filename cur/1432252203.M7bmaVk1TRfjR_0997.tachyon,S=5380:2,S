Well we all know that having complete control over one's own
computer is far too dangerous.  Obviously, it would be best if
computers, operating systems, and application software had 
proprietary back-doors that would enable the secret police to
arbitrarily monitor the all goes on in the suspicious and dark
recesses of memory and the CPU.

Hell, I trust the secret police to use such capabilities for 
moral and legitimate purposes only, and as we all know the 
people who become secret police are of the best and brightest
stock of humanity and will allways act in the best interests 
of mankind.  Corruption and fraud among such elites will be
impossible, particularly if current standards of law and 
morality continue to be applied with the consistency we are
now accustomed to.

Personally, I have no fear that you, the members of this 
group, who I am barely qualified to address online, and who
represent some of the best people the Internet has to offer,
would not be the ones best suited to control the computing
infrastructure of the Earth's people.  

And in that vein, I offer the following job tip as a token
of my confidence.  In today's Globe and Mail newspaper there
is an advertisment from the CSE (Communications Security
Establishment, for those who are not familiar with the 
lesser known TLA's) in which they relate that they are 
soliciting new team members:

"We are the Communications Security Establishment,
a member agency of Canada's security and intelligence
team.

CSE acquires and provides forign signals intelligence
and provides advice, guidance and services to help
insure the protection of Government of Canada electronic
information.  CSE also provides assistance to federal
law enforcement and security agencies.

We offer a stimulating work environment, state-of-the-
art technology, competative salaries, and an opportunity
to make a difference.

ENGINEERS
 - hardware design
 - wireless
 - computers and network security
 - test and verification
 - project management

ANALYSTS
 - intelligence
 - linguistic (Asian, Middle Eastern and European languages)
 - systems
 - financial
 - human resources
 - policy

COMPUTER SCIENCE SPECIALISTS

 - programmer analysts (C/C++, Java)
 - computer and network security
 - project management

MATHEMATICIANS

 - diverse theoretical and applied areas of mathematics
 - optimization, numerical and computational methods 


Requirements:
-------------

Postions in our organisation will be of interest to those with a
post-secondary education and/or experience in: engineering, 
mathematics, computer science, language studies, political science,
business, economics or accounting.  You must be a Canadian 
citizen and eligable for a top secret security clearance.
positions are located in Ottawa.

CSE is an equal opportunity employer.  We welcome applications from
all qualified individuals, including women, mempers of visible 
minorities, Aboriginal peoples and persons with disabilities.



It sounds so good that I would certainly consider applying myself
if it were not for the fact that I love my current occupation as
slave and chew-toy for the privilaged and beautifle so very much.

For those of you who are not canadian citizens, I can let you in on
a little secret.  CSIS doesn't check all that closely when they do
their security clearance background investigations, and so you can
just tell them you forgot your ID in your other suit when they ask
for it.

By all accounts, the pay is great as are the fringe benefits.  Loot
confiscated as a part of legitimate intelligence excercises and
operations are generally made available on a first-come, first-
serve basis to employees in good standing.  Other benefits include
super-human abilities and powers unavailable to normal human
beings.

All in all, it sounds like a great place to work.  Good luck to any
of you who apply.


Regards,

Steve
