Sunder>>...you have to agree that you also have no problem with capitalism.
And
 >>an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of 
capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and 
by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined 
mainly by competition in a free market <<

I have no problem at all with the operation of capitalism as envisaged by 
our esteemed colleague,james dalton bell.
I have a very real and ongoing problem with anarcho-capitalism and Ill 
republish the hideous birth of that creature.
