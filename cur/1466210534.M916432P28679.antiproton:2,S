There&#39;s a fairly incredible trial going on in London right now. The Lib=
yan Investment Authority is suing Goldman Sachs over some trades that they =
did together. To oversimplify slightly, the LIA handed Goldman a pile of mo=
ney and signed some complicated contracts describing the circumstances in w=
hich Goldman would have to give LIA money back, and how much. And then ever=
yone closed their eyes and counted to 10, and when they opened their eyes, =
poof, the money was gone. It was $1.2 billion. Libya is mad, and suing.<br>
The LIA has various arguments in its lawsuit, but none of them amount to &q=
uot;Goldman owes us money under those contracts.&quot; The contracts specif=
ied a set of functions that took inputs (mostly, the prices of some bank st=
ocks) and produced as outputs a set of dollar amounts that Goldman was supp=
osed to pay Libya. The specifications in the contracts are perfectly clear;=
 there&#39;s no dispute about how to read the contracts, or about how the f=
unctions work. Everyone agrees that the total dollar amount produced by the=
 functions is zero.<br>
Instead, Libya&#39;s arguments take the form of: We didn&#39;t really mean =
what those contracts said. We didn&#39;t understand them. We were bamboozle=
d into signing them, overwhelmed by a &quot;swarm&quot; of Goldman bankers,=
 seduced -- literally -- by the bankers&#39; offerings ofinternships and af=
tershaves and prostitutes. We were unsophisticated, we trusted Goldman to l=
ook out for our best interests, we thought the functions were something oth=
er than what they turned out to be.<br>
Whatever you think about those arguments -- my own views are complicated --=
 they are definitely the kinds of arguments that are, like, allowed in cour=
t. The contracts specifying the functions are important. Ninety-nine-point-=
whatever percent of the time, derivatives contracts just work: I pay you a =
premium for a call option, and you promise to pay me if it ends up in the m=
oney, and if it does, you do, and if it doesn&#39;t, I shrug and walk away.=
 We knew what we were getting into, and we got out of it what we expected. =
But every so often, people don&#39;t know what they&#39;re getting into, or=
 what they get out of it isn&#39;t what either side reasonably expected. An=
d when that happens, they go to court and argue about it. Usually one side =
did well out of the deal, and argues that everything&#39;s fine and everyon=
e got what they expected; the other side did poorly, and argues that someth=
ing fundamentally unfair happened and the deal should be altered.<br>
