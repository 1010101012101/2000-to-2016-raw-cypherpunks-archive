I don't think the original poster intended rot13 to be acceptable.
And this would be caught: plaintext ciphered with the former won't pass the
entropy test.  

I like the idea, suggested by someone else, of checking digital signatures
on the encrypted msgs since this can authenticate the crypto tool also,
assuring that rot13 or DES isn't used. Though its more work for Mr. SMTP
Host than simply measuring entropy.
