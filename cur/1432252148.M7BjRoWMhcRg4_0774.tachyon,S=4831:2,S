Guess again.  All photons on my property are mine to decode and process as
I see fit.  By sending photons onto my property, you agree to these terms.

Well, this post to Cypherpunks is my work.  The conditions I put on it are
that by reading it, anyone named "Anonymous" agrees to serve me until the
end of time, transfer to me all their worldly goods, and permit me to
sacrifice their firstborn to Baal.

Like "Anonymous" here.

Unsolicited free gifts are mine to keep.  I just got some lovely address
labels from a paralyzed baby-killers organization.  I plan to use them on
my mail, and not send them a dime.  Anyone else who wants to send me free
stuff, including photons, is free to do so.  They won't get a cent either.

Copyright should be abolished.  If you don't want your secrets, or
artistic works, copied and shared, you are free to keep them in a vault in
your basement, for your sole enjoyment.
