Any word on whether the drone was Air Force or CIA controlled?

Reports are that the Air Force provides local controllers while the
CIA controls from CIA headquarters. And that the Air Force launches
its own and may assist the CIA contractors which launch its killing
machines.

Yes, when a Customs and Border Patrol UAV gets out of control
will the US or Mexican air forces take it down? Or will a private
contractor send up one of its fighters?

Why is there no way of killing an out of control machine, or is that
possible but limited by lack of knowledge about where the debris
will fall?

There was report that the UAVs travel in pairs to watch one another
and presumbably kill the rogue, if it can be identified from the
friendly.

A smart spy will surely see the out of control rogue as useful as
a rogue spy  or ex-spy contractor to do the dirtiest of deeds, apologia
ready to release.

Would Israel "lose control" of a rogue drone which just happened
to be crashed into the Iranian centrifuge bunker.

How safe are autopilots of commercial airlines and private
aircraft. Any chance of a depressed, bankrupt CEO plowing into
the Treasury Building? Or a CIA birther loosening a rogue
on the White House?

My scooter is acting uppity lately.
