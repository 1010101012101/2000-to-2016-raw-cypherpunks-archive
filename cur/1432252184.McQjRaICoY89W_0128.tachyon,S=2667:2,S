Actually, an RFID can be ridiculously reliable. It will also
depend on how much harassment a traveler will be exposed to,
when travelling. Being barred from entry will definitely prove
sufficient deterrment.

Microwaving it will blow up the chip, and cause a scorched spot.
Severing the antenna would be enough for the chip to become mute.
Violetwanding or treating with a Tesla generator should destroy
all electronics quite reliably -- you always have to check, of
course.

Also, the ID is quite expensive, and a frequent traveller
will wind up with a considerable expense, and hassle.
