"Cluster computing is about resources aggregation in a single 
administrative domain," he (Rajkumar Buyya) explains. "Grid computing in 
about resource sharing and aggregation across multiple domains."
I have no idea what that means,however ..."Having recently completed a 
doctoral thesis outlining the economic paradigm which might underpin such a 
system in the commercial environment, Buyya points to the Grid's scheduling 
capabilities as the most crucial difference between grid and cluster 
computing."
Oh and get your old MMflash off,soon,so I can get in.
