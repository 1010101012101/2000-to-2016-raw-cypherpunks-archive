You could say much the same about the US...

Nothing the world wants to buy?  Forgotten about the oil?

It is sufficient for a country to sell raw materials, it does not have
to process them, or make elaborate things to sell.

The peasants have their labor to sell, and the oil companies will
buy it.

Look in your gas tank.  The contents are Made in Iraq.  Esp. since
Calif. requires low sulphur fuel and Iraq's oil is especially low
sulphur.

Iraqis making widgets makes as much sense as the US making TVs.
Don't bother, others can do it cheaper.

The peasants get work in the oil industry there.  How is this
different than german or jap peasants working in postwar
factories?   (Germany and Japan had manufacturing histories,
unlike Iraq, as you say; but they had no oil to export.  So you
sell what you can sell.)

After WWII, the US realized it had to use ex-Nazis to keep
Germany running.  But it went after the top guys, even 30 years
later.  Why do you think Iraq will be different?

(Modulo perhaps more Iraqi sniping after the US occupation than
was experienced in Germany.  Because of the Palestinian/Osama-mecca
thang)

The US *does* have to deal with Israel/Palestine to calm some
potential snipers.  Since abandoning the region is not an option,
regrettably, the US will have to force this.  The USG probably
knows this is the only way to remove motivation from some fraction of
the
potential Iraqi-occupation-snipers.  (The "get out of Mecca" folks
like Osama will not be satisfied by this, but some Arabs will.
The Osama snipers will not be restricted to Iraq, but operate throughout

the region.  In fact, the other American outposts (Saudi, Kuwait, etc.)
might be softer targets than the Iraq-occupying troops due to
complacency.)

But again, the US can handle mil deaths overseas now.  This isn't
Lebanon or Ethiopia under Clinton, where we exit at the first
sight of blood.  (Alas.)

Don't you think the occupation planners know this?   Don't you
think they'll use psyops and jobs (paychecks by Halliburton)
to calm most who can be calmed?

I think its completely evil to invade another country, but its
also clear Mr. Hussein wasn't terribly popular, for good reason.

How many post-war occupation mil casualties the US can tolerate
is an interesting question, as are US strategies to avoid these
(eg, use lots of Iraqis and lots of UN fodder).  But I think,
and it is an empirical matter which we'll observe in coming
months, that Iraqi occupation will not be abandoned even
if the US continues to take hits.

We'd also look bad in different ways to different third
parties (eg, abandoning to the humanitarians; weak to
the neighboring governments)

Some of the poverty was due to the government control of resources
and how it spent it.  Face it, Iraq has plenty of wealth to pay back
investors and locals.  All you need is enough warships to guarantee
that you *will* recover costs.

And a major oil producer not in OPEC will be a major tool for the USG.

Exactly.  Exactly why the US won't let go.

A good way to get JDAMNED..

Syria is next, scheduled for the Fall TV season.
And what are Turkey or the Saudis going to do about it?

What did you think "if you're not with us, you're against us" meant?

The US will anticipate this.  That is why it publicly insists that the
current
government will go down hard ---to dissuade an underground.
It will use willing native Iraqis as underground-detectors.  It will
(continue to) monitor every phone call.  An underground will not be as
well
funded, redundant, or operationally secure as Hussein's government.
Not when most folks have jobs again and feel safer than they did
under Hussein.

As long as the bombings are on foreign soil, blasting military people,
the US can stomache it for a while.  Just get FOX to re-run the
statue-tipping, stories of torture, or some other US agitprop.

Unscheduled, domestic, schoolyard-demolition jobs are another matter.
But much harder operationally.

Beirut and Nablus are in resource-poor countries.  They won't be able
to affort the dishes that bring them MTV (a subtle form of psyops).

I'd expect "humanitarian aid" handouts for a while, but they will get
the oil flowing ASAP, which will provide jobs.  Young guys with
jobs don't blow themselves up as readily.

The west bank has nothing.  Iraq has oil.  That wealth can be used
to pacify.
