I've been to a few of these, and once spoke at one, circa 1993.

IMO, nearly worthless. Thinking about how little can get covered in an 
hour at a Cypherpunks meeting, imagine what happens in any particular 
one hour of one of these things: just enough time to establish a few 
basic points, hit on some of the current issues, and take some 
questions.

For the actual students, not so bad, as they're getting 15 or so of 
these lectures per semester, and the intent is to provide a survey of 
topics.

(Strangely enough, 15 times "nearly worthless" is OK...for a survey 
class!)

The point is that anyone already familiar with the topic or the issues 
will not learn anything.

Which leaves arguing with the speaker as the only reason for 
going...and arguing with the speaker is not worthwhile, given the 
extreme constraints on time. And given the usual pointlessness of 
arguing with others.
