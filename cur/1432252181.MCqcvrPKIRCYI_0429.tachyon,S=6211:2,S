Not the crowd I mentioned, ironically. This was at the University of 
Wisconsin campus at Madison. Mostly well-off kids, at a rich campus.

This is not true. Most billionaires in the United States did it in a 
single generation. On the Fortune list of billionaires, most made the 
money by starting companies. Only a handful are heirs.

I won't bother citing the usual figures on how heirs tend to spend 
down the inheritance, not increase it, at least not any faster than 
ordinary T-bill rates would predict.

Mostly a cultural thing. It's very common for Asian ancestry persons 
in the U.S. to work extremely hard, to live with other Asians in very 
crowded houses and apartments, to save most of what is earned, to 
loyally support and lend money to their circle of friends and family, 
and then to start some small business. With hard work, they often 
prosper. By contrast, it is very common for African ancestry persons 
in the U.S. to complain that Whitey hasn't given them enough money, 
that they are owed a good job, to smoke crack cocaine, and to father 
many illegitimate children. Hence the statistics of Asians vs. 
Africans on the welfare rolls. These are cultural, not racial, issues.

Sad, but true.

I won't get into comparing our situations, but I believe the key 
ingredient is work, saving, investment, a positive outlook for the 
future, and more work. It worked for me, no thanks to government and 
taxation.

BTW, most of the younger folks I know in software have no college degree.

Nothing wrong with indentured servitude. You can read some pieces I 
wrote about this many years ago, circa '93-94. The archives should 
have them.
