Spying Leak

Dave,

Lest we forget what this is about: George W. Bush illegally ordered
NSA to
spy on US citizens.  This is a felony, for which I (and many other
former
and current NSA employees) hope to see him impeached and jailed.

As as former SIGINT analyst, I -and anyone else ever associated with
NSA-
know that USSID 18 prohibits the spying on United States Persons.
This is
NSA's Prime Directive, Ten Commandments, and Bill of Rights, all
rolled into
one.  It is an unlawful order to direct NSA to eavesdrop on US
citizens. It
is impossible for me to stress strongly enough that from day one, every
human associated with NSA has USSID 18 drilled into him.

With USSID 18, NSA is able to protect and defend our country.
Without USSID
18, NSA can be used to oppress the American populace. It comes as no
surprise to me that, in the face of an unlawful order, someone went
to the
papers with the story.

The exception to the rule of course, is the FISA courts.  President Bush
declined to use these courts despite the ability to get a FISA
warrant three
days after the fact.

It is a shame that with such a massive crime freely admitted by
President
Bush, a smart guy like Hiawatha continues to carry water for this
Administration.

-Bill
