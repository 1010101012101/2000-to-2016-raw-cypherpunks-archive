"Perhaps the American navy can bug
 fibre-optic cables but it's not clear how. A report for the European
 Parliament found in 2000 that b^\optical-fibre cables do not leak radio
 frequency signals and cannot be tapped using inductive loops.
 [Intelligence agencies] have spent a great deal of money on research
 into tapping optical fibres, reportedly with little success.b^]"

This is clear BS as well, and tells me all I need to know about the 
author.  No, they dont leak RF, they leak photons when bent.  And, rumor 
says there are other nifty things you can do.  I have personally tapped a 
fiber optic cable (above sea level) in the lab, just for shits and 
giggles, and its not hard.  This article was either written by someone 
completely clueless, or by a clueful ghost.

What religion, please tell me, tells you as a follower of that religion
to occupy another country and kill its people? Please tell me. Does
Christianity tell its followers to do that? Judaism, for that matter?
Islam, for that matter? What prophet tells you to send 160,000 troops
to another country, kill men, women, and children? You just can't wear
your religion on your sleeve or just go to church. You should be
truthfully religious.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
