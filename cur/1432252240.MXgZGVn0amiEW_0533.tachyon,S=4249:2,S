Slim to none, actually. Just my two cents in response to various bitter
observations to the effect that all women are money-mad golddiggers hell bent on
luring hapless men to their doom in the name of providing for large litters of
genetically superior offspring, who eventually nag them to death in the name of
changing for "a relationship". Or something.

Of course. Since when was a value judgment ever anything else?

>>You invent 'drawn' as something that is not-clingy-need. Semantic nonsense.

Too bad you seemed to have missed the entire point of the passage: if your
relationships are making you bitter and miserable, there's no sense in blaming
the other half of the human race for whatever weaknesses of your own cause you
to keep seeking out the same old archetypically shitty situations. Proclaiming
all "men are x" or "all women are y" as some sort of excuse for why you've
proven yourself unfit for human companionship is nothing more than a cop-out.
So it seems to me, at any rate.
