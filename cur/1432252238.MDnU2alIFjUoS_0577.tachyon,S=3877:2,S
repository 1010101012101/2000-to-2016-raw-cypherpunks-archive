The protests aren't limited to Adobe. In fact, some of the protests
occuring Monday are taking place at DoJ buildings.

On Friday, a cypherpunk and a 2600 member crashed Ashcroft's press 
conference at Versign, and put copies of the EFF's letter to Ashcroft into 
the hands of nearly all of the reporters present. The DoJ is not being 
ignored.

As for the organized mass rallies, Adobe is first on the protest list,
however, since it is clear that they are behind the FBI and DoJ's actions.
And, if Adobe were to withdraw its complaint, it is likely that charges
would be dropped and Dmitry freed.

If Adobe withdraws its complaint and Dmitry is not returned to his family,
we will turn our attention full-force toward the DoJ.

"There is perhaps nothing quite as distressing as the unintended
consequences of well-intentioned government." --Ashcroft.
