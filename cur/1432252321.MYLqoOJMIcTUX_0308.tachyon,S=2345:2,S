I'm not.

If it's the same Denning, I think that she's busy taking advantage 
of the cooler weather to get some good in-line skating in. That name
was mentioned while I was active in an in-line skating club back
east before I moved here to Seattle.

Washington gets very hot during the summer and outdoor sports are 
just about impossible until about now. 

If this is the same persion, I would be suprised to see her any
where near a computer until the rains arrive later in the fall/winter.
