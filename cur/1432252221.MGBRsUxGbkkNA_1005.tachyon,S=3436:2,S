Someone should have given Nancy Pelosi a chunk of BitCoin, or cut the
Wall Street bankers in on it.

The IPO offering/insider trading to Pelosi by VISA worked wonders when
legislation was on the floor to protect consumers. Pelosi happily
blocked the legislation, and the value of her stake in IPO skyrocketed
[1]. I would also argue the Wall Street Bankers would have been happy
to legitmize BitCoin if they got a cut (confer: derivatives).
