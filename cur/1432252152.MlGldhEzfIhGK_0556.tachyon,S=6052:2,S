   Bah -- none of these clueless idiots get it. The Shiites will start doing the
same thing as soon as it becomes clear that they're not going to get any real
election. The dimwit westerners keep talking about civil war, but the Sunnies
and Shiites aren't. They both know full well who's trying to promote that
agenda. 
   That's not to say Iraq shouldn't be broken up, it probably should, just as
the US needs to be broken up.
