Level 9,the pilot ep was on last night and I had it droning away in the 
corner,heres some synop from http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue183/screen3.html

The Level 9 team soon discovers that the person who took Grace is also 
involved with Price's archnemesis CrayZhorse. He is a master hacker who has 
dedicated himself to creating anarchy by leading others in a group called 
"The Great Uprising." CrayZhorse seems to have orchestrated both the 
murders and Grace's kidnapping. Price has gone up against him before and 
lost. But this time Price can't afford to lose, because Level 9 is the 
country's last and only line of defense against those who would seek to do 
the unthinkable.(extract)
