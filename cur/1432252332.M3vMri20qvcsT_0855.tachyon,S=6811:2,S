Yes, as a matter of fact. RTF is an MS format, BTW. They do change it
sometimes, breaking various attempts at interoperability. They don't do
it much; it seems like something they forget to break much of the time.

No, there's no gun to anyone's head. However, as part of negotiating my 
current contract (I'm a partner in a small software development
company), we recieved lots of MS Word/Excel docs. When you're
negotiating new business, saying "erm, I don't do windows. Can you give
me something else" is a bit of a show stopper. By comparison, if you're
selling someone a car, are you going to stop them mid-sale and ask that
they please haggle in Euros? (And in case you're curious, our project 
is entirely open source driven.)

For that matter, one can drive without a license.

I see your distinction, however it is very difficult to do business
without MS software. I'm typing this on a Linux-running laptop, which is
my primary user-level machine, and in order to do business, have to run
Crossover. (And I do own my MS Office license.) All of my proposals are
written in plain text and sometimes, done in Postgres when I need
spreadsheet-like behavior. They have to be rendered in Word format for
client consumption. (Open source spreadsheets still suck, in my
opinion.)

That's a rather fine point to put on it. There isn't much difference
between work and non-work for me. Rather, there is, but nonwork choices
directly impact my work choices.

You seem to offload a lot of your choices onto your company.

Just workin' for the man, eh?

Honestly, this is supposition, entirely unsupported by anything other
than my intuition about how companies I've worked for in the past 
behave. Feel free to ignore. 

I think they'll lap it up. Along with expensive and annoying licensing
terms, companies get no-forward emails and expiring spreadsheets. Think
about what Enron would have done with that. Hell, I suspect MS
probably evaluated what they did wrong in the antitrust trial in order
to avoid similar outcomes in the future. There's a market there.

Um. Who owns the market in "desktop productivity software"?

I use MS software for interoperability testing (much like I use
Quickbooks, some Oracle wares, etc.), and for client communication.
Everything else in my company is open source. Everything we deploy is
open source, unless the client asks for something else. They typically
pay for that choice, not only because I'm frequently not familiar with
the software they choose, but also because it's a bitch to work with
(anyone else ever have to deal with Adobe Distiller under unix?)

It isn't bullshit that to operate as a business entity, one needs MS
software. I can certainly dick around with my personal website and write
my memoirs without it, and 98% of what I do for a living is MS free,
getting business without it (read aloud as "public interfaces")
is nearly impossible. Perhaps you can ignore that, becuase you're just
working for the man, and it isn't your fault that you write MS Word
docs.

DRM is going to be another cost. I'll have to have a real MS box on
hand again, and the problem will be how it worms in to other parts of
the business, diverting me from my favored platform.

You can say you're not forced to use it. You're also not forced to
do anything but swear at other people in public.
