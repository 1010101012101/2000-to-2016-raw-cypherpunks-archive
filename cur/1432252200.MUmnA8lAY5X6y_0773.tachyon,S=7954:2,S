Dear Dr. Farber:


I ran up against the Google monopoly, when I tried to use their
adsense to sell bumper stickers and other schwag at
AnyoneButBushIn2004.com  I signed up and was getting good traffic,
but within a week, my ad was pulled and I was told my money was no
longer good at Google, because I was promoting hate, just because I  
used the
phrase "Anti-Bush Bumper Stickers".  I altered my ad
verbiage and then they reinstated me for about two weeks, then I was
thrown out again.

This was in late 2003 and I felt censored and could not understand  
what the
problem was.  It seemed I was just promoting a point of view.  Two weeks
before the election I received an email from Danny Sullivan about how
egalitarian Google had become and adsense was the way to go.  I wrote  
to the
SearchEngine guru and he followed up for me...within three days of his
inquiries, they were taking my money again...no apologies nothing.

I will never know what a years worth of traffic would have done for  
my bank
account, because I did not get turned back on until a week before  
election
day.  Interestingly, all my inquiries with Democratic politicians in
that year produced no results, but Danny Sullivan got me turned on in
nothing flat.

Hmmmmm????

Google was able to control the message and my market penetration for
almost a whole year, an election year.  Not sure what the answer
is...being a libertarian, but there is a whole lot of power
concentrated in a few hands there at Google and it concerns me.



Thanks for all the good work you do with this list,
