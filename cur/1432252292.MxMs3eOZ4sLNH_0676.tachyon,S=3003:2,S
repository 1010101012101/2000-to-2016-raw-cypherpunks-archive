Anarchist groups among 39 designated by Department of State as "terrorists" 
(english)


Three anarchists groups are among the Department of State's recent list of 
"terrorists": Revolutionary Proletarian Nucleus (Italy), and Anarchist 
Faction for Overthrow, and the Mavro Asteri (Black Star) (Greece)

7 anarchists jailed in US puppet police state of Turkey.

Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad of Malaysia said that the United States 
has been learning from his country how to combat terrorism and that the 
West, which once accused him of trampling on human rights, now is following 
him.
.
"It's no good taking action after the crime," Mr. Mahathir said. "We have 
to act in anticipation, and not in the usual manner, because having to find 
proof of a crime which has not yet been committed is difficult."
