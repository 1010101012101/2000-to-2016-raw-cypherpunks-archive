Someone needs to inject a story about e-voting fraud into the popular
imagination.
Is Tom Clancy available?  Maybe an anonymous, detailed, plausible, (but
secretly fictional)
blog describing  how someone did this in their podunk county... then
"leak" this to a news reporter..
Failure to be *able* to assure that this *didn't* happen in that podunk
county would make
an important point.

 the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."
