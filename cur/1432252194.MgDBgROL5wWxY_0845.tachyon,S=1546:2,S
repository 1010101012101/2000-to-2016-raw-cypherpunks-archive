Tyler D asked about how the NSA could be so far ahead.
Besides their ability to make 2" sq. chips at 10% yield (not
something a commercial entity could get away with)
they can also *thin and glue* those chips into say stacks
of 5 thinned die.

2" sq = 4 x performance
5 thinned die with GHz vias = 20 x performance.

Both are uneconomical but feasible.  Get it?

Any questions?
