They discriminate based on _genetic predispositions_.  Those are not
affected by environment (except in extreme cases).

Perhaps.  But, again, an insurance company won't insure people with
genetic defects unless they are forced to.  Sure, we may have more
insurance companies after deregulation, but who's to say that they
would fill the need for insurance for the genetically disabled?

If you combine a slightly reduced profit for the insurer, and slightly
higher premiums, the costs could be covered.  And I'd be willing to
pay slightly higher premiums, if it paid for people who need medical
care to be able to have it.
