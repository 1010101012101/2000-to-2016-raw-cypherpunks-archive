That's Mizzou-RAH, to you, sir. :-) (BA Philosophy, Class of '84,  
though it shoulda been '81. Minored in Beer-bong, or something-bong,  
anyway, dropped out, transfered credit from UofC a few years later to  
graduate)

Actually, I remember all kinds of verbage (I've been reminded  
about...) from the local oligopoly (political and telecommunications)  
about how I can't resell/transfer/share. Still, mebbe I can weasel  
something, heh, political, to solve that problem.

There's that. Caribbean Cable, mysteriously, throttles bittorent  
packets during daylight hours. Must be the Harsh Caribbean Sun  
blinding the fiber optics, somehow. ;-)

Well, there *is* competition, of a sort, to the extent you can get a  
cablemodem or DSL (Single-Static-IP PPoE lives, at least in the  
Eastern Caribbean) There was even a static WiFi outfit, for a while,  
but Anguilla's a nation about the size of heh, Wasilla AK, more or  
less, so "market" is kind of a loose term. Like Mark Twain said, no  
man's life or property is safe when the legislature is in session --  
and the gov.ai's legislature's in permanent session. A majority of  
four guys can mess up your whole day faster than you can say "Border  
Gateway Protocol"...

Besides, I'm retired. No. Seriously. It says so, right there on my  
passport stamp: "EMPLOYMENT PROHIBITED". Definitely an appeal to my  
Inner Peckerwood Slacker if I ever did see one, Itellyawhot...

Cheers,
RAH
