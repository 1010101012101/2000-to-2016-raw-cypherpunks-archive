   Correct to a point. As businesses, their primary goal is to make a 
   profit. Providing goods/services is a by-product. Please don't assume
   I like insurance companies, especially when they are in between me and
   medical services.  I would be happier self-insuring and paying for the
   spikes in cost along the way. I was merely pointing out that, although
   the insurance providers and others, see the industry as a busines (read
   quarterly/annual timeframes), this is an incorrect way of looking at 
   it. It is incorrect because our lives go past the annual profit and 
   should be viewed over a much longer time span. By comparing my behavior
   today with the behavior of others, you get a distorted picture of
   what is happening. The business is happy with that picture because 
   there is always someone to point a finger at, today.

   This is true to a point, but the facts are a little different. The 
   stats show a spike in deaths at age 50 and 65, which is the basis for
   SS retirement age, and for over 50 folks it's 66 and increasing. The 
   spikes are caused by bad behavior, bad genes and bad luck, but have
   been reliable for a long time.

   Pyramid scheme.

   Again, true to a point. It turns out once the sickly have been weeded
   out (50 & 65), the 80+ people are *generally* in good health when 
   compared to the rest of the population in spite the creation of the 
   living dead segment.

   Keep in mind that young people stress the medical system as well as
   the old. Giving birth is not cheap, for example. Neither is pediatric
   care. If you are going analyze the costs, you need to look at all of
   them, not a just piece at time. Why should I pay for an AIDS patient? 
   Well, why should I pay for women giving birth, except when it's my
   child?
