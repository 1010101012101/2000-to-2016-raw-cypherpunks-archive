Interesting logic here. Someone writes something not-so-nice about somebody 
on a list and now that person is being "cyberstalked" even though they're 
not a subscriber. And now, the stalk-ee is a victim of a crime. And now the 
person who said something "not-so-nice" has committed a crime.

And this guy's a consultant? To whom, I wonder...

Funny enough, I don't rmember seeing any of Prof Rat's posts, and I've never 
even killfiled him.
