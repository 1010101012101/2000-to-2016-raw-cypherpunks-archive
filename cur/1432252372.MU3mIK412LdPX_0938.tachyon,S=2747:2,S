i've always liked Ian Goldberg's nymity slider as a description of
identity and how you disclose/leak/protect it.

http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/thesis.html

if i were in your situation i think a high level overview of identity
and nymity (along the lines of the nymity slider) followed by specific
privacy enhancing technologies would work well.  perhaps covering:
- anonymous email (mixnets) and browsing/sessions (tor/onions)
- pseudonymous communication with aliases. (Off-the-Record?  blogs?)
- security and least privilege?

i'd be curious to know what you put together; this would be a helpful
resource for me and others i'm sure.
