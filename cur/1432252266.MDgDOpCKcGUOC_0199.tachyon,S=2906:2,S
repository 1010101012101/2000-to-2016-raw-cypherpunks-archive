As the article notes, GWB *improved* his showing in NY over the 2000
election.  Are you implying that the US won't be attacked again?

I could follow your ad-hominem attack with one about mincing
homosexuals, but we both know that singlularity of voters on either
side is incorrect, and does nothing to forward the discussion.

Of course it does.  That's what a republic is.  But who's going to
'indict' us?  The UN?  Maybe after we finish the trials for their
self-dealing on the 'Oil for Food' program (as Orwellian a title as
the Patriot Act had).
