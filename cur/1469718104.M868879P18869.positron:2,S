Haven't watched yet so I don't know if it's the same IVAW guy who said
that a few years ago, but it's good to see that MEME going around.

Here's a video I mashed up a while back exhorting soldiers to rise up
and desert their posts.

Stop Thinking Like An American! Start Thinking About Humanity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkTuzFpPi6xg

Footage of VVAW's Congressional steps medal tossing contest (they were
all winners in my book), Tom Morello and Outernational's "Sir NO SIR",
and Asian Dub Foundation's "American Psychosis" gleaned from Adbuster's
CD Live Without Dead Time.

Believe it or not Youtube flagged it for copyright material because of a
particularly crude marching ditty used at the beginning of
Outernational's tune, despite the fact the rights were already paid for
by the artists. Fuck 'em.
