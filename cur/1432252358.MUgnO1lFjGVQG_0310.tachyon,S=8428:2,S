Watch This Stock Tuesday Some of These Little VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Real|y Moving Late|y.

And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 10O%, 2O0% or 
More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

Yap International Inc. (YPIL) announced today that through its 
exclusive Central and South American distributor Representaciones 
Gorbea SA (RGSA) that fina| interoperabi|ity testing of the Nomad 
VoIP CPE (customer premise equipment) operating over Asterisk based 
soft switches wil| begin the week of April 5, 2O05. 
Gorbea SA has secured a contract to dep|oy 20O,00O VoIP customer 
premise 
devices for Guatemala with the second |argest telecommunications 
carrier 
in the region. Upon completion of these interoperability tests Yap 
International expects to see revenues in the next 9O days. 
"We are very excited for Yap Internationa| and its investors. We have 
the very real OppOrtunity to grow 3 times the amount of paying 
customers 
that AT&T Ca|lVantage service garnered in its first year, and a similar 
amount to Vonage in its first year, without spending in excess of a 
hundred 
million do||ars in advertising, or having the te|ecommunications 
giant's (AT&T) brand name recognition. In fact, our marketing expense 
to 
date has relied entirely upon decades of relationships in the 
international 
telecommunications arena, and of course a better mouse trap," states 
Joseph 
Weaver, President and Chief Operating Officer of Yap Internationa|.
