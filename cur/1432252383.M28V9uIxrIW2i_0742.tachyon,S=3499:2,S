I never said I had intent to sue anyone. I only said that I would not, and
don't, intend to give commercial permission for the reproduction of my
words. And I specifically used you as an example. I also asserted that no
such permission is given by participating in the CDR, implicitly or
explicity. Contrary to your assertion.

Having you hop around like a frog on a hot plate is quite entertaining
enough in its own way.

Thank you for the free advertising.
