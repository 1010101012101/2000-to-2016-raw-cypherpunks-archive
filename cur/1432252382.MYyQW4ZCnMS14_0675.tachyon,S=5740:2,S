Eye twinkle doesn't come across in e-mail, I'm afraid. My apologies 
to Tony. This is obviously one of my hot buttons.

I'm not sure those contracts would stand up in court if there were 
massive public losses due to a collapse of the PKI. (Anyway CA CPS's 
stretch to notion of a "mutual agreement" pretty far. I purchase a 
$10 cert and am bound by over 100 pages of gobbldygook that only a 
handful of people on the planet can be expected to fully understand?)

But I am less concerned with CA legal liability then with who is left 
holding the bag when a massive subversion of the banking system is 
perpetrated, and how big that could be.
