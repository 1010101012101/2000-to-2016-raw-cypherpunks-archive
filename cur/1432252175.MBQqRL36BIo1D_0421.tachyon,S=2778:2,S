Recalling his boyhood in London, [Freeman] Dyson recounts
  how during the Blitz he lay in bed rejoicing in the delicious sound
of buildings falling down. To the
  budding physicist and ardent anti-colonialist he then was, the
imminent danger to his own person was
  nothing compared to the joy of hearing the great British Empire
audibly crumbling. In one of the more
  frank commentaries I have read on the attacks anywhere, Dyson tells us
that he can easily imagine the
  state of mind of the young men who so resolutely smashed those planes
into the buildings. Almost I
  could have been one of them myself.
