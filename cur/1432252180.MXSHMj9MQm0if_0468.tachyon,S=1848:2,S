Well, Industry from what I understand is probably too strong a term. These 
seem to be individual females. And no, they ain't wearin' high heels and hot 
pants, so what we're talking about is very, very discrete, and sometimes for 
goods and services as opposed to pure $$$. But it's there, and people in 
general seem to know it's there.
