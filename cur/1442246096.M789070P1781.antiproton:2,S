Agree that 'open source software' may very well be a prerequisite. My point
being that a laptop put together to 'minimize blob use' is not necessarily
the same as one put together to respect privacy. Without some evidence to
the fact it should not be endorsed as such.

Can someone dig up the motherboard design documents, should Librem publish
them & the transparent process by which components were selected to
'respect liberty'?

-Travis

OT aside - If someone were to ask what laptop they should use for 'privacy'
I'd personally direct them to buy a chromebook with cash at a brick and
mortar, wipe & install Qubes (the pixel 2 has some outstanding specs) TAILS
and so on.
