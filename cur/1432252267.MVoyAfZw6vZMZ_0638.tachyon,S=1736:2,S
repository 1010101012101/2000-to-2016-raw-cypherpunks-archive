People working with early versions of the forthcoming Intel-based
MacOS X operating system have discovered that Apple's new kernel
makes use of Intel's Trusted Computing hardware. If this "feature"
appears in a commercial, shipping version of Apple's OS, they'll lose
me as a customer -- I've used Apple computers since 1979 and have a
Mac tattooed on my right bicep, but this is a deal-breaker.
