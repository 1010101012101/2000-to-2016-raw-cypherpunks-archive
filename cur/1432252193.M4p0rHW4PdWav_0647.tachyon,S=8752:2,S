I checked out those links...hilarious! Check this out (remember, this gal is 
running for Senator of Alabama!):

She hadn't even brought cab fare, and was expecting another pot head to show 
up with it!!!

She went to a foriegn country without cab fare or a credit card! And now the 
guy with the money (another pot-smoker) is late, and she's suprised!!!

I'm starting to wonder if this is a hoax.

It IS funny, though.
