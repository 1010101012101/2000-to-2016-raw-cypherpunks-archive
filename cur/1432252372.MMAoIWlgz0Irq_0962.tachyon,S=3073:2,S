But ownership is easily fixed - a few magic words from a lawyer
(ok, with a lot of expensive research into tax and accounting issues first),
and the satellite is owned by a Caribbean corporation owned by Hughes,
so it's no longer physical property subject to Los Angeles property taxes.
That doesn't mean a tax collector can't try to attach one of Hughes's
buildings near LAX, but it becomes a much different problem.
