Let's remember that any regime is only temporary, no matter how 
fundamentalist. The main flaw in the whole "save the world" logic is that it 
assumes that some regime (Islamist, Communist or whatever) would actually be 
able to hold on to everybody in perpetuity, and I think history is now at 
the point where we have a good indication that this ain't the case.

In the case of China, Vietnam and, to some extent, the Islamists, I don't 
get the impression that a hatred of free markets was he underlying reason 
for the adoption of commusim (or whatever). Communism was merely a political 
pole that could be held on to so as to crystallize a movement whereby 
outside influences could be pushed out, and then the internal issues 
resolved. I would argue that the more we proclaim ourselves to be the 
evanglists for free markets throughout the world, and then ram our cocks up 
Abu Ghraib inmates asses, to the same extent what we have to offer looks 
tainted and foul. They need to puish us out so they need to reject free 
markets. They need to reject free markets so a new "pole" is created.

Mr Donald woul think that I argue against free markets, but instead what I 
am arguing against is methodology which retards free markets.
