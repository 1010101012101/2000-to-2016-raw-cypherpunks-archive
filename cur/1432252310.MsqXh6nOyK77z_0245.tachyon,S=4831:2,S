I am not sure that they would as this seems to go against the 22nd
Amendment. While the 22nd doesn't specifically address an appointed acting
president I doubt that the new congress would be inclined to keep Clinton
around nor would they want to create more problems while trying to
straighten out the current mess.

Amendment XXII

(1951) 

Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more
than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted
as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person
was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more
than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the
office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and
shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President,
or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes
operative from holding the office of President or acting as President
during the remainder of such term.
