A friend of mine in Santa Cruz was a classmate (a couple of years 
behind) of algore at St. Alban's in Washington, D.C.

A number of years ago he described in great detail the joyous summer 
evenings spent smoking dope on the "grassy" lawn of Senator Albert 
Gore's house on the Potomac River.

Does algore say he "didn't inhale"?

He preaches piously about "substance abuse" while seeking the title 
of Chief Drug Warrior.

Scum.
