Learn to use a search engine. Search on the obvious terms, like 
"airlines overflight payments."

The first such hit you will find in Google, one of hundreds, is:

"FAA ESTIMATES CUBA OWES US$1 MILLION FOR OVERFLIGHT FEES- 
Information obtained from an inquiry to the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) within the United States Department of 
Transportation by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council shows that 
Republic of Cuba government-operated Cubana Airlines and Republic of 
Cuba government-operated AeroCaribbean Airlines were invoiced 
approximately US$1 million by the FAA for the period May 1997 to 31 
January 1998 for overflight fees."


Is this enough for the "one real world example"?

Or, like many quibblers, do you claim that "one example" is not enough?

Picking from the many items,

"Overflight fees from commercial aircraft flying over Georgia will 
repay the loan."


I think I'll stop with two examples. You can do the rest of the work.
