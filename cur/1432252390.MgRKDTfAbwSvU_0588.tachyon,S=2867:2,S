No, they are not.

A 'right' is a inate character of an individual. It is what one has by
simply existing. Fundamentaly rights stem from the natural desire to stay
alive and the resultant competition for resources toward that goal.

Fundamentaly ALL rights stem from:

-	You've gotta be alive

-	You have a 'right' to defend that life

It isn't any more complicated than that.

Concepts of right and wrong come human psychology, it's why there is no
absolute right and wrong outside of murder, assault, and theft. They
represent clear cases of 'attack' or the requirement to use self-defence
in order to stay alive.

Right and wrong stem from the societal recognition that living a 'catch as
catch can' world is wasteful and decreases the mean time between failure
for individuals.
