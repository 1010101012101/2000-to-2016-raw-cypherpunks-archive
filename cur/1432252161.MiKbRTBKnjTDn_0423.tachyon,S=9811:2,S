Holy Fuck we need some smarter people in this society.

OK, you threw away your trash. I see no inherent reason why someone else 
can't grab it. But INFORMATION about you isn't trash. Then again, you do 
"throw away" the photons that exit through your windows, so I guess cops 
should be able to stare at you through binoculars all the time and haul you 
in based on the photons you've thrown away.

Oh, and to take it further, police should have immediate, un-warranted 
access to the "trashcan" on your computer, at all times. Indeed, there 
should be a registry that constantly monitors what you're throwing away, 
because it's just (digital) trash, right?

As for crystal meth, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but if I want 
to pour something from my chemistry set down my throat that shouldn't be 
anybody's business. The fact that it doesn't accidentally kill me and indeed 
gives me a buzz shouldn't be the sole provence of the pharmaceutical 
companies. After that, if you want to make laws about selling the stuff well 
that's a different matter.
