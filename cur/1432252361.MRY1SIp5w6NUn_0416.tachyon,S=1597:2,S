An associate asked me an interesting question.  He has a colo box and
wants to VPN to it (not tough).  But he wants to tunnel all traffic over
the VPN pipe, such that his client appears to "be" the colo box and is
available to the greater net.  How does one set up the routing and VPN
config to do this?
