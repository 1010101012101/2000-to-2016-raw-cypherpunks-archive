I'm in search for one of your representatives, or National Security.  I =
have been able to read Thommy Thompson III's mind.  I showed up at =
Jaguar Glass, in Eugene, Oregon and let him know about the money that he =
stole from government agencies, including the FBI, which ironically =
protects him.  He thought I was undercover or believed I was a human =
computer; which he still may believe. He witnesses that his computers =
talk to me, as if I were one of them.  I can tell what program his =
computers are on and what they are interlocking with most of the time.  =
He gave me a 400 million dollar check that day, as I sat there reading =
his mind explaining to him what I knew.  At that point he had 8-10 =
billion dollars of government money/funding hidden away.  But after the =
planes went down he stole over a 100 billion. He used Mike's pin#  and =
password to get into National Security.  He helped himself into =
instruments and institutions, and began using them incorrectly and =
illegally. I am offering National Security or any Representative a lot =
of my money to help me put this man away.  It seems he is being =
protected by the forces I need.  He is station #3 of the HAARP Project =
and I'm in search for anyone ready to earn a lot of money; for actually =
representing the United States of America the Right Way.
He's been looking into the minds of his people and brainwashing them, so =
he will not be seen.  I can read his mind faster than any instrument, =
and ironically he seems he has to answer my questions like I was a =
machine. When I listen, I can hear him telling people he's playing God =
and to digest this information; or to Change their mind. Another one he =
uses, line one--, line two--, line three--, Lock and Load, which also =
seems to convince people that he is innocent.  He changes the =
information nightly so he won't be seen, for he is a computer programmer =
as you will soon see.  I've even tried try to get the HAARP to tune into =
me, so they could see me which would see him.=20
This is just the beginning of what I know.  Eugene, Oregon's FBI seem to =
be full of idiots or his "Change Your mind Method" is working pretty =
damn good.  Right now I get denied as they listen to him and not me. But =
COME ON PEOPLE, He wrote me a $400 Million dollar check. (SO, WAKE UP!  =
FBI, because you are obviously, virtually blind),. This Nation seems to =
be lacking people like me.  That can discover people like Thommy =
Thompson III and his black market industry.=20
