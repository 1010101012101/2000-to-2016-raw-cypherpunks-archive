Been examined at lenght, in detail, in the mid-90s.  Remember that things 
have value even if they are not tied to a money system: cpu cycles have a 
value which is relative to each user/cpu.  The idea of "charging" to read 
mail (as an antispam system), by reshifting the costs of delivering spam 
back to the sender through the tying up of the senders CPU cycles 
("stamps") has been exhaustively examined. I would refer you to the 
Archive, but im not certain that any meaningful (pre-2003ish) archives 
still exist that would have all the mail from any 1 CDT, let alone all of 
them...

Don't fixate on coin (money).  A common antispam measure is tarpitting 
(look it up), where known spammers are bogged down by resource depletion: 
unfortunately, theres no way at this point to superimpose stamping across 
the zillions of already installed SMTP systems (computers, printers, 
appliances, etc.).

As you think about this, make sure you look both macroscopically as well 
as microscopically.
