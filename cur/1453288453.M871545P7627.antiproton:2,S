Insecure by design: protocols for encrypted phone calls

    The MIKEY-SAKKE protocol is being promoted by the UK government as a =
better way to secure phone calls. The reality is that MIKEY-SAKKE is desi=
gned to offer minimal security while allowing undetectable mass surveilla=
nce, through the introduction a backdoor based around mandatory key-escro=
w. This weakness has implications which go further than just the security=
 of phone calls.

The current state of security for phone calls leaves a lot to be desired.=
 Land-line calls are almost entirely unencrypted, and cellphone calls are=
 also unencrypted except for the radio link between the handset and the p=
hone network. While the latest cryptography standards for cellphones (3G =
and 4G) are reasonably strong it is possible to force a phone to fall bac=
k to older standards with easy-to-break cryptography, if any. The vast ma=
jority of phones will not reveal to their user whether such an attack is =
under way.

The only reason that eavesdropping on land-line calls is not commonplace =
is that getting access to the closed phone networks is not as easy compar=
ed to the more open Internet, and cellphone cryptography designers relied=
 on the equipment necessary to intercept the radio link being only afford=
able by well-funded government intelligence agencies, and not by criminal=
s or for corporate espionage. That might have been true in the past but i=
t certainly no longer the case with the necessary equipment now available=
 for $1,500. Governments, companies and individuals are increasingly look=
ing for better security.

A second driver for better phone call encryption is the convergence of In=
ternet and phone networks. The LTE (Long-Term Evolution) 4G cellphone sta=
ndard carries voice calls over IP packets, and desktop phones in companie=
s are increasingly carrying voice over IP (VoIP) too. Because voice calls=
 may travel over the Internet, whatever security was offered by the close=
d phone networks is gone and so other security mechanisms are needed.

Like Internet data encryption, voice encryption can broadly be categorise=
d as either link encryption, where each intermediary may encrypt data bef=
ore passing it onto the next, or end-to-end encryption, where communicati=
ons are encrypted such that only the legitimate end-points can have acces=
s to the unencrypted communication. End-to-end encryption is preferable f=
or security because it avoids intermediaries being able to eavesdrop on c=
ommunications and gives the end-points assurance that communications will=
 indeed be encrypted all the way to their other communication partner.

Current cellphone encryption standards are link encryption: the phone enc=
rypts calls between it and the phone network using cryptographic keys sto=
red on the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). Within the phone network, en=
cryption may also be present but the network provider still has access to=
 unencrypted data, so even ignoring the vulnerability to fall-back attack=
s on the radio link, the network providers and their suppliers are weak p=
oints that are tempting for attackers to compromise. Recent examples of s=
uch attacks include the compromise of the phone networks of Vodafone in G=
reece (2004) and Belgacom in Belgium (2012), and the SIM card supplier Ge=
malto in France (2010). The identity of the Vodafone Greece hacker remain=
s unknown (though the NSA is suspected) but the attacks against Belgacom =
and Gemalto were carried out by the UK signals intelligence agency -- GCH=
Q -- and only publicly revealed from the Snowden leaks, so it is quite po=
ssible there are others attacks which remain h
idden.

Email is typically only secured by link encryption, if at all, with HTTPS=
 encrypting access to most webmail and Transport Layer Security (TLS) som=
etimes encrypting other communication protocols that carry email (SMTP, I=
MAP and POP). Again, the fact that intermediaries have access to plaintex=
t creates a vulnerability, as demonstrated by the 2009 hack of Google's G=
mail likely originating from China. End-to-end email encryption is possib=
le using the OpenPGP or S/MIME protocols but their use is not common, pri=
marily due to their poor usability, which in turn is at least partially a=
 result of having to stay compatible with older insecure email standards.=


In contrast, instant messaging applications had more opportunity to start=
 with a clean-slate and so this is where much innovation in terms of end-=
to-end security has taken place. Secure voice communication however has h=
ad less attention than instant messaging so in the remainder of the artic=
le we shall examine what should be expected of a secure voice communicati=
on system, and in particular see how one of the latest and up-coming prot=
ocols, MIKEY-SAKKE, which comes with UK government backing, meets these c=
riteria.

MIKEY-SAKKE and Secure Chorus

MIKEY-SAKKE is the security protocol behind the Secure Chorus voice (and =
also video) encryption standard, commissioned and designed by GCHQ throug=
h their information security arm, CESG. GCHQ have announced that they wil=
l only certify voice encryption products through their Commercial Product=
 Assurance (CPA) security evaluation scheme if the product implements MIK=
EY-SAKKE and Secure Chorus. As a result, MIKEY-SAKKE has a monopoly over =
the vast majority of classified UK government voice communication and so =
companies developing secure voice communication systems must implement it=
 in order to gain access to this market. GCHQ can also set requirements o=
f what products are used in the public sector and as well as for companie=
s operating critical national infrastructure.

=2E............

Conclusions and future work

The design of MIKEY-SAKKE is motivated by the desire to allow undetectabl=
e and unauditable mass surveillance, which may be a requirement in except=
ional scenarios such as within government departments processing classifi=
ed information. However, in the vast majority of cases the properties tha=
t MIKEY-SAKKE offers are actively harmful for security. It creates a vuln=
erable single point of failure, which would require huge effort, skill an=
d cost to secure -- requiring resource beyond the capability of most comp=
anies. Better options for voice encryption exist today, though they are n=
ot perfect either. In particular, more work is needed on providing scalab=
le and usable protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, and protectio=
n of metadata for contact discovery and calls. More broadly, designers of=
 protocols and systems need to appreciate the ethical consequences of the=
ir actions in terms of the political and power structures which naturally=
 follow from their use. MIKEY-SAKKE is the lat
est example to raise questions over the policy of many governments, inclu=
ding the UK, to put intelligence agencies in charge of protecting compani=
es and individuals from spying, given the conflict of interest it creates=
=2E

Update 2016-01-19: Fix broken links to GCHQ website, note that master key=
 must be permanently available though not necessarily directly connected =
to the Internet, and mention suspicions that the NSA were involved in the=
 Vodafone Greece compromise.
