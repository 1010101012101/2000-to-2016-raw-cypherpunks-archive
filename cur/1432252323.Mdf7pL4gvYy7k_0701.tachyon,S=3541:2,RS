As you like to say, "Bullshit!"

I sometimes excerpt articles here. And to avoid the problems with 
HTML and "too much" and "too many headers," I usually have to spend 
time cutting and pasting from my screen to ensure that "What I See Is 
What I Send" (WISIWIS).

I urge _you_ to spend the extra minutes to avoid sending us the 
clutter you think Netscape requires you to send.

Get a clue.

No, HTML is _not_ a good idea in e-mail. People are reading e-mail on 
a variety of platforms, on HP Jornadas, on Palms and Visors, on 
iPAQs, and so on. And HTML in e-mail rarely is used to any 
significant effect.

You, Greg Newby, and Ernest Hua are the main offenders. I urge you 
all to get a clue.

(And then there's Riad Wahby, whose signed messages are unopenable by 
Eudora Pro. He is doing _something_ which makes my very-common mailer 
choke on his messages. Not my problem, as his messages then get 
deleted by me unread. Again, standard ASCII is the lingua franca 
which avoids this problem.)
