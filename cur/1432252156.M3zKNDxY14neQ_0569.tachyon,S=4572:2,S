>Time Magazine, November 26, 2001:

This is a fascinating idea, but problematic. The simplest approach
is easy to spoof. Let's say that you encrypt the data with the GPS coordinates
X. The software takes GPS coordinates from a GPS receiver and tries
to decrypt the data using these coordinates. Only someone at the
right place would be able to figure it out.

Naturally, this could be spoofed by replacing the GPS receiver
with one that spits out the right coordinates.

A better system might rely upon the signals from the satellites
themselves. The signals let the GPS receiver measure the
time the signal took to travel from the satellite to the receiver.
Knowing the distance from three or more satellites makes it
possible to triangulate and come up with the real location.

A more sophisticated system would encrypt the data with
these signals themselves. It might take the data coming from
satellites 1,2 and 3 at one particular instant. Only a person
in the right location would see the right values at that particular instant.

But I think this could be spoofed by time shifting the signals using
a TIVO-like mechanism. If you're not in the right location you
could pretend to be in another.

Maybe they have a more complicated mechanism. Or maybe
this is just FUD.
