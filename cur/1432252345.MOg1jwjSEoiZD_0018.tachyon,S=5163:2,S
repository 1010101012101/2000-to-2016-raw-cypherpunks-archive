>Barr Works to Reform Secret Evidence Laws
>Joins Colleagues in Introducing Bipartisan Legislation to
>Protect Fifth Amendment Rights
>
>         WASHINGTON D.C. -- U.S. Representative Bob Barr (GA-7) joined House
>Minority Whip David Bonior (MI-10) and Rep. Tom Davis (VA-11), Chairman of
>the National Republican Congressional Committee, at a news conference on
>Capitol Hill this morning to introduce bipartisan legislation addressing the
>use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings.
>
>         "The use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings not only
>violates basic principles of fundamental fairness, but it is also blatantly
>unconstitutional," Barr said.  "A cornerstone of our judicial system is the
>right of individuals to view and respond to evidence used against them.
>This legislation reaffirms the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person
>shall be deprived of liberty without due process."
>
>         Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the
>Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to use classified information
>in political asylum and deportation cases.  The evidence is not disclosed to
>the immigrant or their counsel.  Under the proposed legislation, a federal
>district court judge would be presented with the government's classified
>evidence and would then provide an unclassified summary to the immigration
>judge and to the defendant.  No classified information would be revealed and
>the defendant would have access to the same information as the immigration
>judge who would decide the case.
>
>         "This bill is about fairness and freedom for all those living under
>the U.S. Constitution," Barr said.  "I look forward to working with my
>colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure this legislation is signed
>into law."
>
>         During the second presidential debate last year, President Bush
>indicated his support for ending the use of secret evidence.  The
>Bonior-Barr legislation, specifically, is supported by a number of advocacy
>groups from across the political spectrum, including the ACLU, the American
>Bar Association, Americans for Tax Reform, and all major Arab and Muslim
>organizations.
>
>Barr, a former federal prosecutor, represents Georgia's Seventh District.
>He serves on the House Financial Services, Judiciary, and Government Reform
>Committees.
