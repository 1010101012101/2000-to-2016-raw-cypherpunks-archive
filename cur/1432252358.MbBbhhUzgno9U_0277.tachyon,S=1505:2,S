Shortly before 4:30 p.m., Hatfill's car pulled into a parking spot on
the street and Hatfill got out with a camera to take photos of those
trailing him. Hatfill told officers the driver of the green SUV "had
been recording his movements all day when he decided to take a picture
back," according to the police report.

The driver of the green SUV then drove off, striking Hatfill, the
reports said.
