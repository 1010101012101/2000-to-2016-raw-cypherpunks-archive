So you're saying that it is impossible to set up a list (or a 
publisher, same difference) where the rights to a work are 
transferred to (purchased by, whatever) the list or the publisher.

So much for "All works become the sole property of ZYZ Corporation 
upon submission and acceptance."

Property may be transferred. Intellectual property is property. It's 
all in the contract.
