Thatcher was respected rather than liked.  Britain in the 1970s was
a global joke, laid ruin by decades of socialist misrule.  Fixing
that was unlikely to win her many friends.

But she partially succeeded and changed Britain and even her opposition
from extreme socialists to more moderate, but still dangerous, social
democrats.

The work isn't, alas, over and leftist ideas remain as givens
in English society supported by the state ran schools and
television stations.

I think you mean "public".  Actually this is possible if cutting taxes
leads to more tax being collected.  If tax cuts lead to increased
economic activity then a  smaller piece of a larger pie can be larger than
the original piece.

This is the famous "Laffer curve".

If you take "rolling back the state" as a goal than this is an
argument for cutting taxes to zero.

I don't think everyone hated the Tories (Conservative party).  They had
been in power for 18 years and I think people simply thought "give the
other guys a ago".

Since then Labour, although they had swung to the right, have increased
indirect tax and introduced anti-crypto laws in the shape of RIP.

The population is starting to wake up and Labour is looking
increasingly vunerable due to popular protests on the amount of tax on
fuel.

Many conservatives, like John Redwood, have spoken against RIP.
