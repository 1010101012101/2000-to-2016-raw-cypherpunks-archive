Really?

My understanding is that launches are planned so far in advance, and
the events required to do so are so tightly coupled they wouldn't
have had a chance even if they'd *had* that kind of running room.
Just asking, not disputing, here. So, here we go, googling "atlantis
rescue mission columbia" doesn't get any recent hits... Ah. Here's
*one*, in news.google.com, of course :

Which gives the lie to the idea that Columbia was in a higher
*altitude* orbit than the space station, which is what I had thought
I had heard, but was in a higher *inclination* orbit, which was
obvious, of course, by its flight path.


Columbia is the only shuttle not actually capable of docking with the
ISS to begin with, and that's why they freed it up for this mission.
.

They were talking about putting it into mothballs a few years ago
when money was tight.

And, of course, somewhere in my google-walking, I came across the
fact that Reagan issued an Executive Order in 1986 forbidding any
primary shuttle mission to be commercial, which is about when I
pulled the plug on about 7 years of my life, and corresponding
financial resources...

Same shit, etc...

Cheers,
RAH
