Morpheus, KaZaa etc. supports this, although you have to use
the GUI manually to change this.   Perhaps you meant other apps,
or you meant automatic QoS of the voice-before-email type.

Yes.  I just posted a message clarifying this.

Yes

Yep, and its obviously important for 1/R^2 "last mile" techs using RF,
but otherwise
a metric that accounts for how bits actually get around is what matters.

A postcard or a phone call to my neighbor still go far away, then back.
A globally optimized market (aka RAH's geodesics) might require checking
an authoritative (but voluntary) clearinghouse on the other side of the
planet.

PS look up "caida" they do IP & geography for fixed nodes.
