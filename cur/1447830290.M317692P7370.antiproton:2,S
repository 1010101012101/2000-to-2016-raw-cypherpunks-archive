No, just like basic access to the Internet, basic access to darknet
resources is now but a click away. That's a good thing for everyone,
not just criminals or those who need the security. You'd be amazed
at how fast some of the darknet social sites are growing with just
people socializing about art, their dogs, hobbies and whatever.
An uncensorable early version of the net, people are talking and
sharing freely with each other, it's working.
