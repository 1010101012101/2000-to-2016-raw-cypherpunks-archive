SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- KBR, the engineering and construction
subsidiary of Halliburton Co.  (HAL  :
Halliburton Company said Tuesday it has been awarded a contingency
contract from the Department of Homeland Security to supports its
Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in the event of an
emergency. The maximum total value of the contract is $385 million and
consists of a 1-year base period with four 1-year options. KBR held the
previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005. The contract, which is
effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and
processing capabilities to expand existing ICE Detention and Removal
Operations Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of
immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new
programs, KBR said. The contract may also provide migrant detention
support to other government organizations in the event of an immigration
emergency, as well as the development of a plan to react to a national
emergency, such as a natural disaster, the company said.
