    The Persian civilization spawned three major religions:
    Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism (which heavily influenced Saint
    Augustine before he turned to Christianity), and the Bah=C3=A1'=C3=AD=
 Faith.
    They even contributed greatly to Islam. Another religion that arose
    from ancient Iran is Mazdakism, which has been dubbed the first
    communistic ideology.
