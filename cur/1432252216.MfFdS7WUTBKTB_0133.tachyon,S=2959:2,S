Dude. I wasn't being sarcastic. I meant it. Thank you.

I used to say "scientists" in the above schtick, back in the day, and
got a laugh, but "appropriate use" of academic resources went out
with state subsidies of Internic, and scientists aren't as thick on
the ground as they were then. :-). It seems that in an attempt not to
call you a scientist, I called you something worse. :-).


Anyway, I make mistakes. I forget, or ignore, my spell-checker. More
to the point, I forgot most of my latin, and don't remember half of
my economics. And, in general, autodydacticism, and 60's/70's
state-school education, is a bitch. :-).

Thanks for fixing the error. It's kind of like when somebody reminded
me, when I was thirty-something that it's "remuneration", not
"renumeration". :-).

Its and it's still give me fits. See below for details...

Cheers,
RAH
