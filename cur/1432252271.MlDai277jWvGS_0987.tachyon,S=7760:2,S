It's about entrenching good crypto and its benefits *before* govt's can
react without needing to expend extra effort to rip out said entrenchment.

HD was better and opened spectrum, so people didn't rise against buying
new TV's, especially for smaller cheaper LED vs CRT. Health was better
and cars rusty, so people didn't rise against new cars, especially for cheaper
and more fuel economy. Gov't wins when they offer something people want.
The sooner you entrench something they want... crypto protection
from 'the spies'... the sooner gov't will have a very hard time taking it away.
Crypto is like candy to a world of newspawn Snowden babies... hard to pull
once given. So start giving it away...

Take those cowards you know out to the gun range and show them how to fix
their house and cars. Man them up out of irrational fear and into confidence.
People are pumped full of FUD, hard to combat directly, so tricky end
arounds are needed. Anonymously pamphlet your workplace with EFF.

Apparently Zuckerberg, Saverin, Moskovitz, Sandberg and others
of Jewish heritage behind Facebook have forgotten what collecting,
processing and benefiting from data on users can turn into. As ones
who should know, why are they collecting and not out there 'explaining'?

> the NSA.

Again, hard to combat. Make it real for them... everything they do
is collected, stored, watched... convos, pics, mail, a life of their
expressed thoughts... without their consent, forever. Count the
cameras on your ride home from work, the junkmail in your post,
the ads in your browser.

It's also relatively easy to stop by local party offices and ask 'Hey,
what are you guys doing about all this spying stuff?'. Presenting
issues in person is hard to ignore, I've had good experiences with
local official types.
