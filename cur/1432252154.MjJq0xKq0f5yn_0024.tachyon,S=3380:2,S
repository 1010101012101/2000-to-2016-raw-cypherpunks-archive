Seems like the Ghost of Ecash Past claims another victim.  I'm sure Bob 
Hettinga will soon latch on to this one as another reason why a good

As discussed on this list recently there is a keen need for anonymizing 
(a'la Crowds) to be added to a popular P2P service.  Has the Crowds source 
been published/leaked?
