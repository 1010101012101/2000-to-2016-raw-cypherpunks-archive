While I share some of Tim's apparent outrage, I am definitely not
enthusiastic about the prospect of repulsive violent counter-action,
which would actually be counter-productive in my opinion.  It is the
cycle of violence that is the problem, which is exacerbated greatly by
the actions of the US administration.  

Anyway, I haven't been lurking for more that a few weeks, so I'm sorry
if I misjudge any of you.  Is there a web archive for the group?
