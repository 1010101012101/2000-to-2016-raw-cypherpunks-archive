Price discovery, when done by human agents, is expensive.  The stock  
exchange and its traders have a lot of overheads.

One explanation for the failure of Mojo Nation was that people would not  
take the time to do price discovery for micro transactions.

Not that I know why Mojo Nation failed.  I have not seen a post mortem  
from anyone knowledgeable.
