Links to PDFs are not uncommon on this list but I never feel good about  
opening them up.

Is the advice in this 2010 article still relevant? [1]

...How can you protect yourself from their inherent vulnerabilities?  
Hypponen suggests you completely avoid opening PDFs on your local machine,  
instead viewing them through Google Docs. If you're using Chrome, Firefox,  
or Opera, you can install the gPDF plug-in to automate the process for  
web-based PDFs. For your local files, he suggests you "use a PDF reader  
that's as unpopular as possible. The fewer users a product has, the less  
attacks it will attract."...

I usually use an open source reader like muPDF on SumatraPDF in a VM, but  
it's a hassle.

Curious if the advice given above is still relevant and also what other on  
the list recommend for safe viewing of PDFs.
