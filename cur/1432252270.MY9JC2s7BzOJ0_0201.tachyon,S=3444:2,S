I think someone out there makes a USB client-side digital certificate
device.  The only problem is you have to type in your passphrase to
unlock probably.  PDA's would be better.  A PDA with an infrared link
to a USB/serial connector would be ideal.  Preferably with random
voice challenge/response or other biometric.
