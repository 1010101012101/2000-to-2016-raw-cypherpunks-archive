I came across Zooko's triangle in a few recent posts by Dan Kaminsky, of which this one
   http://dankaminsky.com/2011/01/13/spelunk-tri/

In the e-mail you are responding to, I started with the idea of an httpk URL which I found to be a very useful one in helping me frame my thoughts. Its advantages and disadvantages are quite easy to see, and Zooko's triangle makes those clear.

I then showed how if each server published the public keys/ip addresses for each of the servers it had fetched its TLS protected content from, one could have a system that used normal human readable names but could easily be mapped to secure URLS if needed. Or in other words: one could have a system where FreedomBoxes could work with the current DNS  but also be alert to suspicious changes. One could work in both frameworks simultaneously.

  The question one would then have is what would a box do when the keys did not match? Perhaps just reduce the trust it put in information coming from a box, provisionally? It would have to be careful with the response being too strong, as this could lead to a form of attack that Bruce Schneier describes well: attack a system by creating many false alerts until the guards no longer pay attention to the alarm bells. Then attack.

As far as how such a protocol would work, I agree it is way too early for that. The idea of a simple RDFa backed HTML form protocol was there to show that something like that could be built in an afternoon. 

Most of all the point was that we can build a Web based system on TLS and add these layers with time. They don't have to be built in from the start.
