Don't know. But not the problem of those issuing press releases. That 
_some_ people check signatures, whether electronic or inked, and 
_other_ people _don't_ doesn't lessen the significance of signing.

Those who bother to check a putative press release and find the 
attached signature doesn't match what they have seen from Web sites 
(and related "widely witnessed events," including hashes published in 
the company's financial documents, etc.) will have competitive 
advantages over those who don't bother to check and just hit the 
panic button.

Sounds fair to me. Sounds like evolution in action.
