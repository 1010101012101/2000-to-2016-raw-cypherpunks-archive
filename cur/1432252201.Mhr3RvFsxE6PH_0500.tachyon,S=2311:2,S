It would have been quite amusing for JG to wear a "Those who sacrifice
liberty for security.."
button (or T-shirt, rather a lot of text for a button) and get kicked
off.

His button must not have been attached with a standard pin, they could
have disallowed
the pointy pin, on the basis of pointyness, not the message attached to
it.

On the matter of free speech, "Fuck the TSA" would be pretty well
protected by the
"Fuck the Draft" precedent, at least in the (federal-territory) airport,
if not the plane itself.

Of course there are limits in regards to freedom of speech.  They are as

follows:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and
to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Everything else is, of course, allowed.  -Sunder
