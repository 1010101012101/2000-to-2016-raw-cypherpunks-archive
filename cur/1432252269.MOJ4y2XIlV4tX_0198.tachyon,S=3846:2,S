As far as I'm aware, nobody has contacted us, but if they did I may not
know. They aren't really interested in end-user firewalls, they want
infrastructure routers.

We had a discussion on this already a month ago.
http://lists.pfsense.org/pipermail/list/2013-September/004543.html

Our code is all open source. In addition to our own code, code is also
pulled from places such as FreeBSD, OpenSSL, and so on. So while our
code is clean, it might be possible that if something we depend on has a
flaw (perhaps by design in an encryption algorithm...) then it might be
carried over. Nothing intentional on our part, and if such a thing is
discovered and the offending code is fixed, we'd pull it in ASAP.

So it would be more interesting to focus on FreeBSD, OpenSSL, OpenVPN,
racoon, and other similar projects upon which we depend.

Jim
