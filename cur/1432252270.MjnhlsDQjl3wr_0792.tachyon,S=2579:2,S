Activists Take Ducks From Foie Gras Shed

FARMINGTON, Calif.  With only the dim light of a half-moon to guide
them, four self-proclaimed "duck freedom fighters" made their way early
Wednesday across an abandoned field, around dilapidated, foul-smelling
chicken pens, and over a narrow passage through a large manure-filled
pond.

...
Soon, four Peking-Muscovy ducks were free.

Man Claims Role in SUV Firebombings

Communicating via three e-mails and in two telephone interviews over the
last three days, the man provided details of the attack that authorities
said were known only by investigators and those involved in the
incidents. He refused to give his name, say where he lives or agree to
be interviewed in person.

The caller said that he and others vandalized and set fire to Hummers
and other SUVs Aug. 22 to draw attention to pollution caused by the
vehicles.

Law enforcement sources, however, said details of the attacks match
previously unreported evidence. Details obtained from the man in the
telephone interviews include:

 A math formula  Euler's Theorem  was spray painted on one of the
SUVs as a way of distinguishing the participants' work. "We thought it
would be nice to have something a little kooky just in case this
happened," he said, adding that he finds the formula "beautiful."
