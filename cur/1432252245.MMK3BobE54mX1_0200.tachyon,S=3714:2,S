Dear cypherpunks:

The last decade has changed our notions of job security. These days, while you're expected to be 
creative, resourceful, on top of the latest innovations and dedicated to the workplace, you can't even 
count on being employed tomorrow. While your goal may be to improve your job satisfaction and financial 
well-being, you've got to be prepared for cutbacks, downsizings, and mergers -- in other words, the old 
heave-ho.

There are many strategies that can help you get ahead on the job you're at now or help you move on to a 
new position. One of my favorite game plans for hedging your bets is having an ace in the hole -- a very 
small business (or two) that you start on the cheap. For some, it becomes the stepping stone to a new 
career; for others it's a sideline that offers both extra income and welcome tax deductions. Everyone we 
know who's got an ace feels more secure for having it.


This is your ace in the hole!
