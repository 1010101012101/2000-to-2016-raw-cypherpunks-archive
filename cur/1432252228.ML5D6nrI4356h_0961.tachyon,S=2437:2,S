It seems like there would have to have been someone to take over in a fairly clean way, or we'd have wound up setting off a civil war.   Note that in the Kurdish parts of Iraq, there was someone to take over, and those parts are generally not a problem for us.  (Once it's not our people getting shot at, we probably don't care that much if it's a pain for someone else to police.)   But I think the parts of Iraq that Saddam was still ruling had few high-profile leaders with forces that could have taken over quickly--he wasn't especially fond of potential rivals.  Maybe we could have cut a deal with some local strongmen and gotten something stable together with minimal US involvement  if we'd done it early, I'm not sure.
