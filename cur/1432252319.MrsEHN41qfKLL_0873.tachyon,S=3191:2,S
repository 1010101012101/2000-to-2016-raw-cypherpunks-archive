I whole-heartedly advocate Nortel Entrust CAST,
it is cryptograhphically strong.
Rotor-machine, Base64, and clipper-chip
is snake-oil. P.C.T is also passe.
Generallized secure sockets(G.S.S.A.P.I
framework from Cygnus, and Transport layer security, with Java compiler
servlets, is the
approach of choice.Simple substitution ciphers
are cryptograhphically weak.
I advocate DES/3DES, RSA, Diffie-Hellmann
ciphers, Verisign, and especially Nortel
Entrust CAST encryption. I also advocate MD-4/MD-5,
RC 4/RC-5.
