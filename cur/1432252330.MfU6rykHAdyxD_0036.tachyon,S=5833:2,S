The first visit scenario is definitely an issue. that brings it to the other question - why cannot CA's issue certificates to sites say like 10 years or 20 years and get the corresponding money for that. Most certificates issued by CA's usually have 2-3 years validity. Incase of a significant mathematical breakthrough the CA should provide an alternate secure certifying mechanism if the breakthrough occurred within the service period (10/20 years). The question is why do popular https sites not go for certificates that expire in 10/20 years if it helps security?



Another question, this one is specific to gmail - which the entire session is on https.

when i click a pdf in my gmail to be opened with google docs, the certificate is signed by google(used a third part browser plugin to check this). that is fine, however my browser never alerts me as a potential untrusted certificate and if want to add it as an exception. does that mean google is an intermediate CA or what does that mean?


Thank you,
