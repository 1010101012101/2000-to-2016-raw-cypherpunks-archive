This assumes that you want it to be possible to buy and sell 
reputation capital, and that people will accept bought reputation
as valid, propositions that I think are contrary to fact.
	That is, if (purely hypothetically) I believed "Wei Dai" was the
most intelligent, informed, and creative poster I had ever seen,
and I learned that "Wei Dai" had sold his name to some unknown
third party,  I would consider any impressions I had about
"Wei Dai" to be instantly invalidated (since there's no particular
reason to believe they'd apply to the new nym owner), and the
name would become worthless (in my eyes) regardless of how 
much the new owner paid for it.
	I'll take that a step further: the possibility that nyms might
me surreptitiously bought and sold is a critical weakness of any 
sort of nym reputation system, and a system designed to
facilitate this kind of fraud is system in which only a fool
would put any confidence in any reputation.

I don't think anyone claims that the whole idea is nonsense,
just that it's a mistake to view it as a singel real number.
Maybe a 3x3 matrix would be better?
