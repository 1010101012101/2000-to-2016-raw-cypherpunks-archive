Cryptography pioneer Marty Hellman calls for compassion in personal, cyber,
and international threats

https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/27/cryptography-pioneer-marty-hellman-on-using-compassion-in-personal-cyber-and-international-threats/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29

        Hellman no longer does crypto research, though he retains a
        position at Stanford; instead, he has been advocating for
        changes in policy that acknowledge the new, more
        interconnected global community.  "I see cyberweapons as very
        similar to nuclear weapons," he said. "Early on we had a
        monopoly on nuclear weapons so we thought they were the
        greatest thing going. But unlike a nuclear weapon, a
        cyberweapon doesn't destroy itself, so like with Stuxnet, our
        adversaries were able to take it apart and figure out how it
        works. We need to start thinking this through more carefully."
