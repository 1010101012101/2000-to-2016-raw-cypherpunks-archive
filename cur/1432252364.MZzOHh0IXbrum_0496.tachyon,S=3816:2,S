>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) - Microsoft Corp. plans to delay the launch of a new
>version of Flight Simulator, its popular computer game that allows players
>to fly airplanes over New York City and other metropolitan areas, because
>of last week's terrorist attacks.
>
>``It's just an inappropriate time to release the product,'' Microsoft
>spokesman Matt Pilla said Monday from the company's Redmond headquarters.
>
>No new launch date has been set for Flight Simulator 2002, which was
>originally due out in October.
>
>In existing versions of Flight Simulator, players can pilot aircraft
>ranging from gliders to jetliners over much of the world, with detailed
>scenery of airports and cities, including New York and the World Trade
>Center towers. Should an aircraft strike a building or other structure,
>the program shows the plane has crashed, but the buildings do not blow up.
>
>Microsoft announced Friday it would remove depictions of the World Trade
>Center's twin towers from the new version.
>
>The company also will put out a software patch that allows people to
>remove the towers from existing versions of the game (...)
