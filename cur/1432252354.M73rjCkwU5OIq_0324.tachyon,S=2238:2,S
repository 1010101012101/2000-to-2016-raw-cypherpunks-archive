Too bad, as he should have seen the shitstorm which would materialize 
as soon as this actually reached the public radar screen. Now that's 
gone public and been deep-sixed less than 24 hours later, it will 
likely be the end of this particular thing.

An official, above-board version is likely to be ipso facto illegal for 
the same reason office baseball pools are illegal: illegal gambling. If 
the Pentagon can run a betting pool for its employees on when some 
event will happen, office workers can bet on the outcome of the World 
Series, and anyone can bet on the numbers revealed by the Mob.
