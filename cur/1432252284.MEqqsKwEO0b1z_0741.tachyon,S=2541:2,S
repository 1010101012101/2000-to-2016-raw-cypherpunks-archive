Only certain guns are legal for the socialists to the North, basically 
hunting bolt actions and shotguns.  Incidentally such guns are usually many more 
times more powerful than most pistols.  Ohio and Florida are the main source of 
illegal guns in Canada, so me being a gun owner from Ohio with a house in 
Florida, I got extra scrutiny.  Quite a testament to their databases.

One of the women customs agents spoke of their distaste for pistols, so in 
reply I mentioned that just last week I shot a Para-Ordinance .45 belonging to a 
buddy.  Para-Ordinace is a gun manufactor from Ontario.  While in Toronto I 
read that some employees from Para were caught selling gun parts to whoever 
wanted them-  It appears that gun control doesn't work for them either.

You can travel to Canada with a rifle, you just have to declare it along with 
the serial number which they record and where you're going to hunt or camp or 
whatnot.
