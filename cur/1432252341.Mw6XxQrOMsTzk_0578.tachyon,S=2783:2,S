I think the disdain with which many of hold the Federal Baby Incinerators is
(a) based on sad experience and (b) no greater now than usual.  In fact, I
think that now is EXACTLY the right time to call these accountants-with-guns

demonstrate that this unconstitutional police force ain't gonna stop the
next 911 any more than they stopped the last one?
