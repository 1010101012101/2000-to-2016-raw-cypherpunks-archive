PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD---BEGINNING OF THE END FOR ISRAEL

Don Feder writes that in the past Bush has cautioned that statehood can only 
come after the slaughter ceases and democratic reform — the first ever in the 
Arab world — takes place. Still, Secretary of State Colin Powell and others are

Palestinian state. ... http://www.insightmag.com/news/256965.html

WHY ARAFAT WANTS IT ALL

Mona Charen tells us that there was a time when most Palestinians truly wanted a

Security, but also upped the ante by throwing everything into the pot but the 
kitchen sink.
