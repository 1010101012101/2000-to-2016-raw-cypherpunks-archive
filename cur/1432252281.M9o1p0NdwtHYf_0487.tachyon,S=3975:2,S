Whatever. The modus operandi is for someone to create His Own List 
and then issue the rules and tell people he doesn't want politics 
talked about. Unless, of course, he is the one talking politics, or 
unless he likes what others are saying.

Fine that people want such closed lists, whether Perrypunks, 
Lewispunks, Declanpunks, Hettingapunks, whatever. Just don't 
crosspost from their closed lists to our open list, is all I ask.


(Every time I write a message pointing this out, I can count on 
getting a snippygram from one of them saying that I am perfectly free 
to become a member of their lists and thus be able to post. No 
thanks, on general grounds. Plus, I am not interesting in writing an 
essay and then having my submission blocked by Perry or Lewis or 
whomever. I accept their propertarian right to do such blockage, of 
course. Doesn't make it what I want, or what I think the community 
benefits from.)
