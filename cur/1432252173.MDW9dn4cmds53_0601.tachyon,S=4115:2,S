IIRC, PGPfone (http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgpfone/) did something 
similar, with a "verbal handshake" protocol that relied on you being 
able to recognise the remote party's voice over the phone while speaking 
a list of words.... always seemed both unreliable and odd in something 
with "PGP" in the name, but....

Raw data streams would be fine over a point to point modem link - but I 
can see an advantage to compartmentalization - you can break your secure 
phone problem down into two distinct subproblems
a) establishing a secure IP VPN between two nodes
b) optimizing VoIP for low bandwidth links

I would add a third - a modem protocol based on something like CSMA/CD 
to allow conference calls to be used as carrier media for secure 
conversations, but that is too hairy for me :)

Something like OpenVPN (http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/) seems ideal for 
the secure VPN part of the problem, but requires an underlying IP 
network.... the VoIP part of the problem has a embarrassment of riches; 
H323 used to come as standard with windows, in the form of Netmeeting 
(complete with videoconferencing and whiteboarding) and SIP is now part 
of Windows XP (a not-particuarly-well-documented) "feature" of windows 
messager. There are many, many more, and Asterix (sadly not particularly 
well known, and unix only) is a complete, open source PBX which is 
conventional telephony, SIP and H323 aware.
OpenVPN is of course built on SSL, and can use either X509 certificates 
or a preshared key for authentication. Sadly, there is no convenient way 
to use DNS-SEC key records for OpenVPN.
