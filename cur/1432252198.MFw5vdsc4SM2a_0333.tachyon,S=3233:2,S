   Yup, for sure, but community gardens are a nice answer for city dwellers. We
own property in the city, but the house takes up 90% of the land, no room for
any real garden other than shrubs and flowers. We have no lawn to mow.
We also have 40 acres, half fields/half woods, in MN, but can't live there right
now.

   Yes, that's what we've done this year.

    Hmm, I've never seen that sort of a problem with community gardens
anywhere. The vast majority of the people work pretty hard on their plots. And
also there's no reason for tax dollars going into it, especially most places
where they don't plow, etc. In fact, it should be fee-generating. Each plot
costs $20 @ year here to rent. 
    Why would community money be handed out to the gardeners?
