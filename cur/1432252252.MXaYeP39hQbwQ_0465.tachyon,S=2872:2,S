In Switzerland DNA tests to replace fingerprinting                
Vienna, Nov 9, IRNA -- Traditional fingerprinting of criminals is to  
be replaced by DNA tests within four years in Switzerland, Swiss Radio
International reported Thursday.                                      
    The cabinet approved the move on Thursday, saying DNA was a much  
more reliable method of identifying suspects.                         
    Under the new system, a database of DNA profiles is to be set up  
to assist police in tracking down suspects.                           
    The database will contain genetic information about convicted     
criminals, enabling police to establish whether a particular person   
was present at the scene of a crime.                                  
    Announcing the decision, the justice ministry said the system had 
been operating on an experimental basis since July 1.                 
    It added that traditional fingerprinting techniques would continue
to be used alongside the DNA database until 2004, when fingerprinting 
would be dropped.
