Demime eats application/pgp-signature.
Configuring it not to is non-trivial, but it's on my list
of stuff to do (right after "get a life", so it might
be a while...).  

Until then, or I give up on demime and throw it out, the
old-style PGP sigs still work, as you showed.
Only the lne CDR uses demime.
