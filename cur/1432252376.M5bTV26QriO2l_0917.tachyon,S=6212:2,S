INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!

A new issue of Insight on the News is now online

http://www.insightmag.com

...............................................

Folks, don’t miss Tim Maier’s cover story on the sad tale of Scott Speicher, and 
why he may be the last POW of the Gulf War 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/253599.html . And you’ll just gasp as Ken 
Timmerman reveals the extent of Democratic efforts to smear President Bush over 
the pre Sept. 11 intelligence breakdown 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/253605.html  . Meanwhile, from the Bunker, I 
remain your newsman in Washington.

...............................................

WHAT HE DIDN’T KNOW AND WHEN HE DIDN’T KNOW IT

Ken Timmerman writes that despite the hue and cry from partisan Democrats and 
the media, the Bush team did not act irresponsibly before the attacks on New 
York City and Washington.

...............................................

CLINTON UNDEAD HAUNTING THE PENTAGON

Michael Waller reports that antimilitary holdovers and entrenched bureaucrats 
are using Pentagon-funded platforms to undermine national-defense policies of 
President George W. Bush.

http://www.insightmag.com/news/253607.html

...............................................

FORGOTTEN MIA OF THE GULF WAR

Tim Maier tells us that U.S. Navy pilot Michael Scott Speicher was shot down 
during the Persian Gulf War and classified as 'killed in action' despite reports 
that he survived. Did he ultimately die because of Pentagon inaction, or could 
he still be alive in an Iraqi prison more than a decade later?

PUT THE BRAKES ON PHOTO RADAR?

Sheila Cherry writes that authorities claim surveillance cameras are slowing 
traffic, but opponents say these high-tech speed traps are more about raising 
revenue than increasing safety.
