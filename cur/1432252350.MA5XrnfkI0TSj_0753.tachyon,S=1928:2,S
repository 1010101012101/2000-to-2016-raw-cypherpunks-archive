That was a direct quote from Howie Goodell's reply to me.  I found it
interesting that while the left continues to rail against everything
Bush does, they use many (if not all) of the same tactics.  Yet they
are blind to that fact (willfully so).

Neither side is willing to agree or concede on *any* point.  While not
a definition of 'un-american' in itself, is sure is a symptom.
