94th Cong. 1st Sess.
H.R. 1603
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
January 17, 1975

Mr. Drinan introduced the following bill; which was referred the Committee
on the Judiciary.

A BILL
To amend certain sections (authorizing wiretapping and electronic
surveillance) of title 18 of the United States Code.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

That the Congress finds and declares that--

(1)	Widespread wiretapping and electronic surveillance, both by private
persons and Government agents, both under color of law, and without pretense
of legal excuse or justification, has seriously undermined personal security
and often violated fundamental constitutional rights, including the rights
to free speech, press, and association, the rights to due process and equal
protection, and the right to privacy.
(2)	Complexities and defects in current Federal law have aided those who
engage in wiretapping and electronic surveillance, and current Federal law
has not provided adequate safeguards against corrupt abuses of
communications technology.
(3)	No person, in any branch of the Federal Government, in however high an
office, or in any other governmental or private position should be
authorized either explicitly or implicitly to violate the constitutional
rights of persons by eavesdropping on private conversations through
wiretapping and electronic surveillance.
(4)	The end of prosecuting those who violate the law does not justify
wrongdoing on the part of the Government.
(5)	The peculiar susceptibility of wiretapping and electronic surveillance
to misuse in the furtherance of partisan political goals renders wiretapping
and electronic surveillance a particularly dangerous temptation to
Government officials, and the chance of its misuse outweighs any potential
benefits which might otherwise be found in it.
(6)	SEC. 2. Title 18 of the United States Code is amended
(1)	by striking out section 2511(1) Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this chapter any person who and inserting in lieu thereof
Whoever
(2)	by inserting immediately after subparagraph (d) of section 2511(1), but
before shall be fined the following new subparagraph: (e) willfully
intercepts or records any wire or oral communication without the consent of
all the parties to such communication;
(3)	by striking out or at the end of section 2511(1)(d), and by inserting
or at the end of section 2511(1)(d);
(4)	by striking out sections 2511(2)(a)(ii), (b), (c), and (d);
(5)	by striking out section 2511 (3);
(6)	by striking out section 2512(1) Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any person who willfully and inserting in lieu thereof Whoever
(7)	by striking out section 2512(2); and
(8)	by striking out sections 2516, 2517, 2518, 2519, 2510 (9).

"Freedom From Surveillance Act of 1975,"
Kastenmeier

The gist:

"(a) Except as provided in subjections (b) of this section or otherwise
required by statute, whoever being a civil officer of the United States
willfully conducts investigations into, maintains surveillance over, or
maintains records regarding the beliefs, associations, political activities,
or private affairs of any citizen of the United States, or regarding the
beliefs, membership, or political activities of any group or organization of
such citizens, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more
than one year, or both."
"(b) Nothing contained in the provisions of this section shall be deemed
either to limit or to enlarge such legal authority of the United States as
may exist to:
"(1) collect, receive, or maintain information relevant to an individual who
has committed or is suspected on reasonable grounds to have committed a
felony;"
[...]

of any individual.
