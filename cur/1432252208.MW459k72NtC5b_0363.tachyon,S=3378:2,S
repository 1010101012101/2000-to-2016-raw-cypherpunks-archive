Attn: Financial DepartmentBy this email we would like to pay your attention to the recent amendments in the FDIC insurance coverage for transaction accounts.During the period from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012 all funds in a "noninterest-bearing transaction account" are insured in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Please note, that this arrangement is temporary and in addition to the FDIC's basic  deposit insurance rules.The term "noninterest-bearing transaction account" implies a conventional checking account or demand deposit account on which no interest is paid by the insured depository institution. To get more details of temporary FDIC insurance coverage of transaction accounts, please refer to link.Yours truly,Les Tolbert.Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2012
