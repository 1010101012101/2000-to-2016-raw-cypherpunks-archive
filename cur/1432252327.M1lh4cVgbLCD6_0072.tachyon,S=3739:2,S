Internet deployment happened at a near-doubling every year starting around 
1993, coincident with the deployment of the web.

Most computers in 1986 weren't up to it. Many of us were using Apple II 
computers with something like 278x192 resolution (in single hi res mode). 
Imagine such a beast doing networking. Ick.
