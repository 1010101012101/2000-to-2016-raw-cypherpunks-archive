My senators are Clinton and Schumer. Makes me damn proud to be an
American, I tell you. Neither's office has responded to any of my
letters, probably because I didn't include money with my missives. I
guess there's no point to further letters to my senators, unless I can
get my hands on some anthrax.

(Note to hypothetical snoop: that was a joke. Get a life, idiot girl.)
