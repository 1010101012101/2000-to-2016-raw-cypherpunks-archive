Dear Sirs

I would like to offer the paper"Physical reason of Oklahoma-City =
catastrophe".

Many facts tell us about catastrophes in cities, which are similar to =
Oklahoma-City tragedy. But their reason are natural forces not human =
deeds. The knowledge of the true reason of the Oklahoma-City catastrophe =
is important for prevention such tragedies in the future. The proof of =
physical reason of Oklahoma-City catastrophe will free Timothy J. =
McVeigh from an accusation. This version has little chances. But it is =
last chance for rescue Timothy J. McVeigh. American storch should not =
answer for actions of natural forces. Probably, this version has one =
chance from one million. But the life of the man costs to check up the =
most improbable version.

I want to send this note to Timothy J. McVeigh, his attorneys and Benton =
K. Partin. What E-mail Timothy J. McVeigh, his attorneys and Benton K. =
Partin?

Thank You for attention to my letter.

Yours sincerely

Alexander P. Trofimenko=20

Physical reason of Oklahoma-City catastrophe=20

Alexander P. Trofimenko

Timothy J. McVeigh is scheduled to die by lethal injection May 16, 2001, =
in the first execution by the federal government in 37 years. The Gulf =
War veteran was convicted of murder 168 people, making it the deadliest =
act of terrorism on American soil.=20

Whether becomes this event the triumph of fairness and legality? Or this =
event becomes the apogee of tragical error? The American justice is =
known to be the most perfect in the world. All was provided for the fair =
justice. But the jurisprudence, unfortunately, does not take into =
account recent scientific discoveries.

Many facts tell us about catastrophes in cities, which are similar to =
Oklahoma-City tragedy. But their reason are natural forces not human =
deeds. The knowledge of the true reason of the Oklahoma-City catastrophe =
is important for prevention such tragedies in the future.

In the morning of April 19, 1995 the terrible explosion has shaken an =
office building in the tranquil Oklahoma-City. The 9-storeyed building =
collapsed. As a result of the catastrophe a three-meter depth and six =
meters width crater has been formed. One thousand kg of an explosive are =
necessary for such powerful explosion. 168 persons perished under =
debrises.=20

29-year's farmer Timothy J. McVeigh was arrested by policemen in 75 =
minutes after the explosion. He was detained for speeding in 130 =
kilometers from Oklahoma - City. He was the participant of the operation =
"Desert Storm". Subsequently he became the main accused on criminal =
cases about the terrorist act.

The FBI agents have found a small detail of the automobile among tens =
tons of fragments, which were on a place of explosion. According to the =
formal version, the part found was that of the car, where ton of =
explosive was put in. The inspectors establish, that the found detail =
belongs to the automobile, which was rented by McVeigh. The small part =
has led the police to creator of the "infernal machine".

Nobody witnessed how McVeigh had exploded 9-storeyed building. Only some =
indirect proofs have appeared at the disposal of accusation. The former =
colleague and friend of McVeigh became the main witness of accusation. =
He informed that McVeigh was going to raise a general revolt (?!) in =
America. The terror act in Oklahoma-City should become an impulse to =
rebellion in the richest and safe country.=20

The accusation was able to convince the jury. The exemplary soldier and =
the hero of victorious war was hating its government. This has induced =
McVeigh to effect the explosion of an office building in Oklahoma - =
City. Four day was required to the members of jury to ascertain =
McVeigh's guilt in this crime.

The reason of the Oklahoma-City tragedy: human deeds or natural forces? =
The unexpected catastrophes in different cities of planet can be more =
powerful, than the dramatic collapse of the building in Oklahoma-City.

At the night of April 12, 1991 the enormous explosion has occurred in =
townlet Sasovo of the Ryazan Region(Russia). The power of explosion was =
estimated to be about 25 tons of trotyl. A huge crater (28 meters in a =
diameter and 4 meters by depth) has remained on a place of event. The =
crater was surprisingly round with a large (3 meters in a diameter) =
knoll in the middle.

To provide such a powerful blast dozens of autotruck with explosive =
would be necessary. The same is valid with the blast in Oklahoma-City. =
The version about the explosion of vacuum bomb appeared firstly at once =
affirmed by the statement that the bomb was thrown accidentally from the =
warplane. But it has not been acknowledged. The riddle of event in =
Sasovo has excited scientific circles, but it was impossible to find a =
traditional scientific explanation.

A dozen cases of strange "explosions" of buildings occur annually in =
various places. The similarity of unexpected destructions of buildings =
in various areas of the Earth reveals the universal natural factor of =
such catastrophes.

The science has made recently one discovery: the gravitational force of =
black holes (otons) causes these catastrophes. Black holes were =
predicted within the framework of the modern theory of gravitation - the =
general theory of relativity. The creator of this theory is famous =
Albert Einstein.

The creators of atomic bombs were the founders of the otonic science. In =
1939 R. Oppenheimer with his collegues have made the inference about an =
opportunity of formation during star evolution of objects, which have =
termed later as black holes. Later Oppenheimer has become "father" of =
the American atomic bomb.

Physicist J. =E1. Wheeler has defined the term "black hole" in 1967. He =
was the scientific consultant of the President on american nuclear =
program. The world-wide interest to black holes sharply increased after =
papers by Wheeler and his colleagues have been published.

J. B. Zel'dovich was one of the creators of the Soviet atomic bomb. The =
scientist created the scientific school on black holes in Moscow. "Black =
holes are everywhere, where the contrary had not been proved". This =
jocoserious phrase had been told by Zel'dovich at a gravitational =
conference in Minsk. The severe sense of this remark is clear to =
everyone, who knows the concept of gravitational vacuum.=20

A. D. Sacharov was the known advocate of human rights, the Nobel =
prizewinner and "father" of the Soviet hydrogen bomb. He was interested =
in black holes too. This interest was connected with development of the =
theory of Great Unification of fundamental forces. This theory must =
unite all known interactions and particles, become a theory of =
everything. The source of particles of the highest energies in the =
Universe is necessary for verification of the theory. Academician =
Sacharov has offered to use explosible micro-black holes as such energy =
source.

In 1964 I.D. Novikov, and then in 1965 Y. Ne'eman have stated idea of =
the so-called "retarded cores" - splinters of the Big Bang. In 1967 J.B. =
Zel'dovich and I.D. Novikov, and then in 1971 S. Hawking have suggested =
the second variant of origin of black holes, which are formed of =
inhomogeneities of substance at the early stages of the Metagalaxy =
expansion.=20

Such otons have received the name of relict (primordial) black holes. =
The relict black holes are splinters of the Big Bang, splinters of =
superdense substance. These black holes could have any possible masses =
and there are a lot of them in the Earth.

Terrestrial black holes are microscopic objects (gravitational " points" =
) with masses starting from thousand tons up to billion of billions =
tons. Their sizes are comparable to that of atoms and fundamental =
particles.=20

The terrestrial black holes can differ in mass in many billions times. =
And it is not only quantitative distinctions. The properties of black =
holes of various masses can be so different, that it is possible to =
speak about qualitatively various objects. The terrestrial black holes =
are the diversified objects. A variety of otonic manifestations hugely =
increase due to diversity of the types of their interaction with matter =
and black holes combinations in otonic systems. They can cause as =
practically imperceptible phenomena, so planetary =
cataclysms(earthquakes, volcanoes explosions, etc).=20

The force of gravitation of atomic size black hole (mass about 1020g) at =
a distance of one kilometer is equal to the force of the Earth gravity, =
and surpasses the force of the Earth gravity in million times at one =
meter distance. Such black hole moves with the cosmic speed and is =
capable to destroy buildings. The black hole, having destroyed a =
building for shares of second, moves on other end of the Planet during =
half-an-hour. The determination of movement trajectory of such black =
hole is a real task.

The solution of this problem is a finding of trajectory of a =
gravitational point in the gravity field of the Earth. This problem is =
constantly solved for Earth satellites and space ships. The knowledge of =
an otonic trajectory helps to determine the further wanderings of the =
"black hole - terrorist". It means an opportunity of definition of =
places, in which collision with black holes are possible, and time, when =
these collisions can occur.

The black hole, which was the cause of the Oklahoma-City tragedy, else =
will appear near terrestrial surface, bringing destructions and death. =
The place and the time of these events can be predicted. It will free =
Timothy J. McVeigh from an accusation.

The proof of physical reason of Oklahoma-City catastrophe will free =
Timothy J. McVeigh from an accusation. Black holes can destroy =
buildings. This version has little chances. But it is last chance for =
rescue Timothy J. McVeigh. American storch should not answer for actions =
of natural forces. Probably, this version has one chance from one =
million. But the life of the man costs to check up the most improbable =
version.

What consolation can be at victims and relatives of victims of the =
Oklahoma-City disaster? 250 people want to view Oklahoma bomber's =
execution. The author wants to show the real Oklahoma bomber - black =
hole. This will be a show of destroying action of the black hole, which =
was the cause of the Oklahoma-City disaster. This will be able to see =
many and on TV all. It is possible to predict and prevent such the =
tragedies. This should become a consolation for all.
