Wouldn't it be provocative to imagine that HMG and USG 
were exchanging monitoring of high courts under a "you 
watch mine, I'll watch yours" UKUSA pact.

For example, this DNS entry:

Host, master (HM-ORG-ARIN)              hostmaster@USCOURTS.GOV
       Nortel Plc F.A.O. Andrew MacphersonLondon
       HarlowEssex
       GB

       (202) 273-2640
       Fax- (202) 273-2651

Does a US network service administer the HMG high courts?

Perhaps both nations distrustful of employees of native 
administrators, or perhaps both systems run by each
other's intel agencies, either openly or under cover
of companies.

URLs of US courts restricted networks referred to in recent 
monitoring flaps as "DCN":
