I have glanced at the documentation of the remarkable work of
Zooko O'Whielacronx and the Tahoe team:

  http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs

And ZRTP:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP

may help us to produce a system of encrypted
file-transfer/email/general-over-the-Net-communication which
meets my standard constraint:

  Two people who have Net connected computers behind
  NAT/fire/proxy walls can spend ten minutes on the phone and set
  up the link; only one of the two need have heard of the link
  software before the telephone call.

oo--JS.
