The RCMP couldn't find a hidden terrorist message even if someone shoved
half of it up the ass of Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli, and the other
half up the ass of Deputy Commissioner Paul Gauvin, and then sent them a
map with clear directions written on it leading directly to the location
of both assholes.

No, I don't like them at all.

Steve
