It's easy. The whistleblower says: if you want more info, post your questions
encrypted with this PGP key I just generated to alt.test.messages with a
subject that contains "Fluffy Bunnies", and I will reply to you. Of course
they'll want to trash that key pretty quickly afterward, since it's "proof"
that they where the whistleblower. Obviously that is more technical that many
journalists could handle, but nothing saying it can't be largely automated with
a web frontend stuck on it.

And don't most/all remailers support responder blocks?
