Hmm.  This made me think of something blatantly obvious that I had 
overlooked before.  Copyrights are authorized in the main body of the 
Constitution, but the first ammendment clearly overrides that, so all 
laws implementing copyright are just as unconstitutional as laws 
implementing prohibition, and have been for significantly longer.  Beer 
and Bootlegs!
