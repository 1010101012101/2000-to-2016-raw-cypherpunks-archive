As opposed to more conventional encryption, where you're protecting nothing at
any point along the chain, because 99.99% of the user base can't/won't use it.
In any case most email is point-to-point, which means you are protecting the
entire chain (that is, if I send you mail it may go through a few internal
machines here or there, but once it hits the WAN it's straight from my gateway
to yours).
