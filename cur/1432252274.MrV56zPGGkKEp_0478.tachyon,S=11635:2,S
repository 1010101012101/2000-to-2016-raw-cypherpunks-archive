So... don't give your account info to organized crime, and don't use Outlook,
and your risk is reduced by, what, 90%? And doing online banking from a Net
cafe... I mean really.

At least some of these numbers seem wrong. If "nearly 2 million" people got
ripped off last year, and "at least 1.8 million" people fell for phishing
attacks, then why would keyloggers/viruses cause "up to half" of the account
compromises? Did nearly a million people fall for phishing attacks and yet were
too stupid to even get their account details correct?
