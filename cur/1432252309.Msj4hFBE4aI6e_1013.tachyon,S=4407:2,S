In Jacob's keynote (~29:50), he encourages participants to attend the  
whistleblower panel later in the day.

29th Chaos Communication Congress (Berlin: Dec 27-30, 2012) - "Enemies of 
the State: What happens when telling the truth about secret US government 
power becomes a crime" by Jesselyn Radack, Thomas Drake, and William 
Binney:

Radack, Drake, and Binney take thirty minutes each to present their  
respective stories - powerful stuff.  Kevin Gosztola's write up gives a  
sense:

Within the first minute of his talk (~1:28:36), William Binney describes  
the legal and intellectual property guidance he received when retiring  
from the NSA to set the scene for an announcement that he has created a  
"commercial product" which describes a software architecture akin to

The Library of Congress defied my search queries.  I didn't find mention  
on the CCC website, wiki, Twitter feeds, etc.  Is this document(?) in  
digital form yet?  Seems like it might be rather interesting.
