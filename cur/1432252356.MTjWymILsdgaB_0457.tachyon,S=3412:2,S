You're missing the point. Several people set their systems to provide 
their _entire_ messages as attachments. Riad Wahby acknowledged this, 
and fixed it. Others did not, so I started filtering them out.

Eudora Pro handles MIME just fine. If someone provides a message as 
an attachment, whether of type JPEG or type MW, then clicking on that 
attachment icon launches a JPEG viewer or Microsoft Word or whatever.

My point is that I don't see the point of expecting readers of a 
mailing list to open a message in MW or whatever.

In-lining usually solves this problem. Signatures, if they exist, can 
either be verified with another program or with plug-ins to speed up 
the process.
