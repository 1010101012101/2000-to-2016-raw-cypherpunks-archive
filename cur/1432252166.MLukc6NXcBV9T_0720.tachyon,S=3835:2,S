That seems a little extreme, though you are well known for your cure-all:
``eat the useless eaters''.  Are you sure such persons shouldn't instead be
put in a re-education camp so they might learn something of the virtue of
integrity?  Contemplating four tall and largely featureless concrete walls
over a span of years would teach many things.

``In this connexion perhaps I may be allowed to utter a mild protest against
one of the more recent of modern fashions.  In days which are not so very
remote, the most respectful criticisms of orthodox theology used to be
dismissed with the retort that all unbelief is sin.  Now, it seems to me, the
boot is on the other leg.  The whole of religion and many of our moral beliefs
are apt to be dismissed on the ground that they are the product of complexes
into the nature of which it would, before the present era, have been
considered indelicate to inquire.''
