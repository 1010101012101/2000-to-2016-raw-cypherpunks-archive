                       Guilty to Hacking 

                       SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A man who officials said once
                       was a confidential FBI (news - web sites) source on computer
                       criminals has pleaded guilty to breaking into government
                       computers, the U.S. Attorneys office said on Monday.

                       In a plea agreement, Max Ray Butler, 27, also known as Max
                       Vision, admitted to one felony charge of unauthorized access to
                       protected computers, recklessly causing damage. Butler, who is
                       free on bail, will be sentenced Jan. 22 and faces a maximum
                       penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

                       Butler was indicted by a federal grand jury in March and
                       charged with 15 counts of breaking into and damaging hundreds
                       of computers as well as possessing with intent to defraud the
                       passwords of 477 customers of California Internet service
