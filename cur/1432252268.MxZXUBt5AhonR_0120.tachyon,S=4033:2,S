I've been running an anonymous remailer since DefCon, when a certain
speaker motivated me to set one up. I get on average 1 threat of bodily
harm and 3 threats of lawsuits per day because of this.

To attempt to answer the question "why do you run a remailer", I put up
the page http://www.melontraffickers.com/remailer.html.

This seems to have the effect of further annoying those who would have
anonymous remailers outlawed.

I don't enjoy the fact that some people are being harassed through my
remailer. But I cannot prevent that without limiting the effectiveness of
the remailer. 

Have there been any court rulings that define the level of liability for
remops whose remailers are used to facilitate criminal actions?

Is someone like myself, running a public remailer, considered an ISP? (I'm
thinking of the Prodigy ruling, where Prodigy was deemed not responsible
for content posted on its BBS system.)
