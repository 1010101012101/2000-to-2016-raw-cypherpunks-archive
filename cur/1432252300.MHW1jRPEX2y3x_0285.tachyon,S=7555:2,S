The word you're looking for is "fascist". The Nazis were one particular 
expression and culture of fascist, by no means the only one and 
certainly not the last.

I happen to disagree with the supposed primacy of Godwin's Law because 
the Nazis are a cultural touchstone on the horrors of fascism in 
practice, a thing we should all remain vigilant upon. A friend pointed 
out to me that more people have died of fascism than gun crime, and that 
(until recently) civil gun ownership was a good preventative measure 
against fascism.

I was never against small arms ownership per se, but it put the argument 
for civil ownership of rifles in perspective for me. With Drones 
everywhere these days, I don't think rifles matter anymore, though; so 
it's moot as far as I'm concerned.

Not being a violent person by nature, I'd like to think that our future 
solutions against fascism are social and network-based, but there's room 
to discuss whether civil access to drones and other automated weapons 
will play a role against fascist uprisings; if the Rifle was the 
standard of anti-fascism in the past, is the drone the standard now? Or 
is it the ubiquitous camera? I'd rather think the latter, but cameras 
don't seem to stop militarised "police" from assaulting civilians, they 
just cover their badges and storm-trooper onwards*.

In the ideal case, we find a way to undermine this violence. But, when 
the fascists come to round up their subject of persecution du jour, I do 
believe those people should be entitled to self defence.

Just some evening thoughts, sorry.

*It was only when observing the behaviour of US/UK police towards 
civilians, particularly the former, that I realised how lucky we are in 
Ireland to have an unarmed police force whose title "Garda Siochána" 
literally means "Guardians of the Peace". They're prone to ego trips, 
sure, but unarmed citizens don't get 10-round clips emptied into them, ever.
