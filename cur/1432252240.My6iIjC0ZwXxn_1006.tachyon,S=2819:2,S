Hi,

I noticed your well done ad in classifieds. As a PPL
associate I'd like to introduce myself and maybe 
compare notes.

If you'd like to do so please email me at 

info@free-law-central.com 

Meanwhile check out my site that I and many other 
associates are using to gain a large volume of names 
due to the SEM system and popup windows that follow 
the visitor as he navigates the normal PPL site.  Here's
some URLs to check out...

Home page w/popup
http://www.free-law-central.com

Associate recruiting page
http://www.free-law-central.com/associate_lead.htm

Focus advertising page
http://www.free-law-central.com/free_will.htm

Our associate's support site

To your success
