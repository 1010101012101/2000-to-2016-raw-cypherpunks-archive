Historically BIST has been more attractive for crypto hardware because=20
you can also use it for assurance testing prior to use.  Invoking it can =
be
hard coded into device initialization.

If JTAG is present, you don't have to have internal scan.  If you have in=
ternal=20
scan  you could have a zeroize on entering test mode.  This prevents scan=
=20chains
from being capable of being used to save as well as restore state. =20

If and when is it a problem?  If you were to examine FIPS PUB 140-2, 4.5 =
'Physical
Security', 'Table 2 Summary of physical security requirements'  and secti=
on:

4.5.1 General Physical Security Requirements

=20...

SECURITY LEVEL 1
The following requirements shall apply to all cryptographic modules for=20
Security Level 1.
* The cryptographic module shall consist of production-grade components=20
that shall include standard passivation techniques (e.g., a conformal coa=
ting=20
or a sealing coat applied over the module's circuitry to protect against =

environmental or other physical damage).
* When performing physical maintenance, all plaintext secret and private =

keys and other unprotected CSPs contained in the cryptographic module=20
shall be zeroized. Zeroization shall either be performed procedurally by =

the operator or automatically by the cryptographic module.
=20
---
Meaning for a cryptographic module boundary at the chip level, the
keys should have been zeroized before physical access.

----
=20...

SECURITY LEVEL 3
In addition to the general requirements for Security Levels 1 and 2, the
=20following requirements shall apply to all cryptographic modules for=20
Security Level 3.
* If the cryptographic module contains any doors or removable covers=20
or if a maintenance access interface is defined, then the module shall=20
contain tamper response and zeroization circuitry. The tamper response=20
and zeroization circuitry shall immediately zeroize all plaintext secret =
and=20
private keys and CSPs when a door is opened, a cover is removed, or=20
when the maintenance access interface is accessed. The tamper response=20
and zeroization circuitry shall remain operational when plaintext secret =
and=20
private cryptographic keys or CSPs are contained within the cryptographic=

module.

---
Meaning that physical access will cause zeroization.  This would imply
zeroization on test mode activation on a JTAG interface on a single
chip cryptographic module.   You start getting real security at levels
3 and 4, the  certification criteria comes from the Commercial  COMSEC=20
Evaluation Program (CCEP).

Am I worried someone is producing chips that aren't protected?  No.
I'm more concerned that implementations (systems) aren't properly
designed, tested and certified.  "They got AES, we got AES" is just
a form of snake oil.
