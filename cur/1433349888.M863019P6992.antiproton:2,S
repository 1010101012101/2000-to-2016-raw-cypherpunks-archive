Irony, but not an unrealistic future. Note that you /are/ a child. There's
always others responsible for you, they will take their responsibility.
And, you are also a liability to others. In a competitive enough world you
are a liability when you are not productive. I believe inflation is part
effective because it demands greater productivity.

I believe this was just foolish. Society is a common madness, not something
that is for a reason. All it takes is evolutionary feasibility - which I
would say Society is for; continuing it's own existence, regardless of
anything.
