It depends on the specific phrasings used. And whether he was under 
oath (for a "perjury" charge). If the FBI was present, a so-called 
"1001" violation could have occurred, though it is difficult to prove 
such lies.

Unlikely, though he may well lose his next election.

Clinton lied repeatedly before a grand jury and he skated.

If Clinton, er, Condit,  killed the slut and dumped her body, he may 
skate as well. Most bodies buried deep in the woods are never found. 
I'll bet Clinton now wishes he'd done to Monica what he probably did 
to a bunch of his other enemies.
