[Note from Matthew Gaylor: I recently received my copy of this 
slickly produced kit.  The Feds must have spent a fortune developing 
it.  It includes a CD-Rom with a textbook quality notebook with all 
sorts of useful information on how to deal with the media and what 
makes effective advertising for children, families and adults.  It 
even includes camera ready artwork and ads.  I plan to use the 
resources offered in my reverse engineering program.  How useful to 
fight the war on drugs using material developed to fight the war on 
drugs.  I recommend that everyone who reads this order their free, 
postage paid copy.  Remember it is better that the Feds waste their 
money on us rather then spending it to help some prohibitionist 
somewhere.]
