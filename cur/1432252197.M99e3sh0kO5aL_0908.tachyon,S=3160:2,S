The evil of DRM, like the evils of guns, depends on who has the
gun and who has not.

If only certain privileged people have guns, and the rest of us
are disarmed, then guns are evil indeed.

ring -1 access to my computer, and I do not, and those certain
special people are people I do not trust ...
