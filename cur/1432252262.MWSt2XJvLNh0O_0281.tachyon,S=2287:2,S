   [1]fragmer writes "New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested a
   plan on Wednesday that would establish a DNA or fingerprint database
   to [2]track and verify all legal U.S. workers. The mayor said DNA and
   fingerprint technology could be used to create a worker ID database
   that will 'uniquely identify the person' applying for a job, ensuring
   that cards are not illegally transferred or forged. Bloomberg compared
   his proposed federal identification database to the Social Security
   card, insisting that such a system would not violate citizens' privacy
   and was not a civil liberties issue."
