Many coderpunks probably already know the details; anyway, here's the story.
Phillip Rogaway's description of the weaknesses found in NSA's Dual Counter
Mode are at the bottom.

Enjoy,

Subject: Dual Counter Mode (DCM)

On behalf of Brian Snow, Technical Director, Information Assurance, NSA,

the following message is forwarded to the AES Team at NIST:

     NSA believes that a license-free high-speed integrity-preserving
mode
of operation is needed for the Advanced Encryption Standard, and was
pleased to submit the "Dual Counter Mode" (DCM) as a participant in the
series of AES Modes Workshops sponsored by NIST.

     Recently Virgil Gligor and Pompiliu Donescu of the University of
Maryland, Phillip Rogaway of the UC Davis and Chiang Mai University,
David Wagner of Berkeley, and possibly others, have produced results
concerning the secrecy and integrity claims made for DCM. We commend
them for their work

     We withdraw the Dual Counter Mode for consideration as a mode of
operation for AES at this time, while we consider the observations and
their
ramifications. We believe a license-free high-speed integrity-preserving
mode
of operation is still needed for AES, and will continue to work on this
problem
as well as encourage others to do so.

1. DEFINITION OF DCM

The definition of DCM isn't real clear, but this is what I understand.
Let

           P = P_1 P_2 ... P_j

be the plaintext to encrypt, where one assumes each |P_i|=n and j>0.
Let Key = (K, x_0) be the DCM key, where K keys an n-bit block cipher E
(I refuse to use "W" for the block length!) and x_0 is a n-bit string.
For concreteness, say n = 128.  Let N be an n-bit nonce.
(The authors specify N = SEQ | SPI | padding, but I shall ignore this,
it being, to me,  an inappropriate mixing of an application of a mode
and the definition of that mode.)  The authors map (N, x_0) into a
sequence of offsets (they call them "fills")

         y_0 y_1 y_2 ... y_j y_{j+1}
by
         y_0 = x_0 + N      // addition mod 2^n, for example

and, for i>0, y_i = multx(y_{i-1}), where, say,

                / (a << 1)                      if msb(a)=0
    multx(a) = |
                \ (a << 1) xor 0^{120}10000111  if msb(a)=1


That is, y_i = (x_0 + N) * x^i, where the multiplication is
in GF(2^n).   Now define DCM_Key (N, P) as

           C = C_1 C_2 ... C_j C_{j+1}
where

        C_i  = E_K( P_i xor y_i) xor y_i       for i in [1..j]
    checksum = P_1 xor ... xor P_j xor N
     C_{j+1} = E_K(checksum xor y_{j+1}) xor y_0


2. COMPARISON WITH IAPM

DCM is identical to IAPM except

  (a) IAPM omits the nonce N from the checksum (why these
      authors include the nonce I do not know); and
  (b) IAPM suggested different (and smarter) ways to make
      the offsets.


3. THE CHANGES DON'T WORK

The changes to IAPM break it; one can see rather easily that
DCM does not achieve the usual definitions for privacy or
authenticity.


3.1 NO SEMANTIC SECURITY   (the customary privacy definition)

For simplicity, assume lsb(x_0)=0.
(This happens half the time so there is no
problem making this assumption.)  First observe that nonces with
related values map to offsets with related values.  In particular,
nonces N and (N xor 1) (in a context like this "1" means 0^{n-1}1)
map to offsets the first few of which are:

       N       |-->   y_0,       y_1,       y_2
       N xor 1 |-->   y_0 xor 1, y_1 xor 2, y_2 xor 4

Let the adversary ask a query DCM_Key(0, 0), obtaining a ciphertext
that starts with first block C_1; now note that first block of
DCM_Key(1, 2) will be C_1 xor 2.   This violates privacy.
(For example, you can easily tell apart the sequence of
messages 0, 0  and 0, 2  when they are DCM-encrypted using
nonces 0 and then 1.)  [Reminder: my notation is
ciphertext = DCM_Key(nonce, plaintext)]


3.2. NO AUTHENTICITY OF CIPHERTEXTS (the customary
                                 authenticity definition)

For convenience of description, assume that the first two bits
and the last two bits of x_0 are 00 (which happens 1/16 of
the time, anyway). Let the adversary ask queries:

   DCM_Key(0, 0)   -->  getting C_1  C_2.
   DCM_Key(1, 0 2) -->  getting C_1' C_2' C_3'

Note: C_2   = E_K(x_0 << 2) xor x_0      and
      C_2'  = E_K((x_0 + 1 << 2) xor 2) xor (x_0 + 1) << 2
            = E_K(x_0 << 2) xor (x_0 << 2) xor 2

So    C_2 xor x_0   =  C_2' xor (x_0<<2) xor 2
and thus
          x_0 xor (x_0 <<2) = C_2 xor C_2' xor 2

Solve for x_0 (easy by our assumption that x_0 ends in 00).
With x_0 now known, one can compute the y_0, y_1, y_2 values
associated to any nonce.  Forging a ciphertext becomes easy.


4. AND WHAT IF THE NONCE HAD BEEN SEQ | SPI | padding?

I think it wouldn't have mattered.  With a choice of N = N' | comp(N'),
say, where N' is a 64-bit nonce, N' and (N' xor 1) would still map
to y_1 and y_1 xor 2, respectively, so you could play the same sorts
of games.


5. WHAT'S THE STORY HERE?

The entire discussion of out-of-order-packets in the DCM note
makes no real sense, as best as I can tell.  The authors "solution"
amounts to throwing in a nonce -- which is of course present in all
of the authenticated-encryption proposals already.  The introductory
statements about the overhead of IAPM (and other proposals) seems to
reflect a non-understanding of that mode.  And then the mode itself,
which was so easily attacked.  All rather odd.
