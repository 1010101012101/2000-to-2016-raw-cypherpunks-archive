Well, according to <http://scifi.squawk.com/demime.html>,  he says that
demime is /designed/ to break and remove attachments.  So if you modify it,
you'll need to maintain it -- he won't accept patches for it.  Which is
unfortunate.  The very fact that he refuses to accept patches for this, and
doesn't give you the option of not removing it, makes me think you should
use a different MIME cleanser (AlterMIME? Anomy Sanitizer? procmail?).

If you stick some code in at the top that checks for $head{'content-type',0}
containing application/pgp (see around line 1820 for details on matching),
and exit if that condition matches, then you should be able to work around
it.
