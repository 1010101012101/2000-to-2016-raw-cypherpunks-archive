Beginner anarchist alert. Wanting to get a better understanding of
possible outcomes.

How would we handle road-building rent-seekers (i.e. those who would
collect tax/ rent for travel) - i.e. at the moment in Australia banks
give loans to private companies to build roads, which by illegal
(unconstitutional) contracts, massive rents/ taxes over many decades,
are collected from the population?

How would the idea of "all have a right to travel anonymously and
absolutely freely (free from tax, free from arbitrary punishment)" be
manifested in a political anarchy country?

How do we manifest a community wide idea of free travel (implying a
majority interest in infrastructure built and provided at cost) with
the freedom of "rent seekers" and "land owners/ infrastructure
builders" to "freely engage in construction and contract with
travelers upon the roads"?

Is this a prisoner's dilemma?

Although all our roads in Australia were free from "all evil tolls"
for much of a century, the rent seekers corrupted our politicians with
much greese, and now road tolls pop up all over the country. How would
political anarchism not "degrade" to the power of financial corruption
in a similar way as our demoncratic governments?

---
In Australia, our "democratic powers/ goverment" have facilitated
illegal contracts and multi decade rent seekers to tax the population
on roads already paid for by the government.

Notwithstanding that the jetsons era may make the question of roads
per se less relevant over time, this question in my mind arises
regarding political anarchism and what is termed 'natural monopolies',
in this specific thread, roads.

The Great Charter, or Magna Carta/ Charter, proscribes that there
shall "be no evil tolls" - which means no travel checkpoints requiring
fee payment, i.e. tax collection at point of passing, commonly today
called "road tolls" (at least in Australia). This was to protect
merchants against the taxing intention, and it is a given that this
also includes those not engaging in commerce but still traveling.

Here in Australia not only do we have the present day continuation of
the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights (and many other
Imperial Statutes) active within the jurisdictions of our states
(although most people are not aware of this, the courts and
legislation are aware of it) we also have Section 92 of our federal
constitution which states "trade commerce and intercourse [travel]
amongst the states, shall be absolutely free", which interpretation is
open to some debate in political circles despite how it reads to the
common man.

In Australia the Imperial Statutes are firmly entrenched thanks to:
- The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (our federal
constitution) which invokes the Crown;
- The Imperial Acts Application Act (respectively, in each state, such
as New South Wales, Victoria, etc);
- The Australia High Court (our highest court) rulings of Mabo and in
particular Mabo 2 (I think 1999).

Despite what ought be protection, our demoncratic parliaments have
sold our roads to the highest bidder, which in our case is nearly
always Macquarie Bank.
