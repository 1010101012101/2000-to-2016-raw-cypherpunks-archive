You sure as hell are.

This is the source of the power of the State: popular demand for its
services.

AP all the politicians and bureaucrats, and it would be those like
yourself who assert entitlement to government benefits who would be
stumbling over each other to erect new politicians and bureaucrats in
order to provide those services.

AP all the self-righteous claimants to entitlements, like yourself,
and the State would dry up and blow away.
