Hi, 
I would like to share a genuine, NO RISK opportunity 
with you. Skeptical already? Good! 
Unlike other internet opportunities that you might 
have seen, what I have to share with you invites close 
scrutiny - even with a skeptical eye. It is first and 
foremost a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY. 
It also offers you the ability to have a share of a new 
Internet Mall to buy at wholesale for yourself or to 
send others to and make commissions on their 
purchases. 
Besides this, it also offers a unique and innovative 
networking program using a principle we call 
"REFERNET" Marketing. No hyped "pie in the sky" 
program or "get rich quick" scheme, but rather a 
credible and realistic way to save money and gradually 
develop what can become a large, recurring residual 
income. 
The best thing about this opportunity? You can "try it 
before you buy it". That's right. You 
can join for FREE with no risk or obligation. As a Club 
Member, you will be able to shop at The Club Outlet 
Center, where shipping is always included in the price 
of the merchandise. You will also be able to shop at 
The Stores, located in the Mall, where you will receive 
rebates on your purchases as per our affinity 
agreements. 
You will also be able be entered into Postlaunch and 
receive a FREE position in the Club's network. Watch 
as others join your downline and see how our 
innovative network building program works. 
To obtain your FREE ID number with which you can 
immediately browse through the many bargains and 
benefits of membership, simply click this link:( 
http://www.peyros.com/teamsucces2k/Index.html) for 
more information. That's it! We'll handle the rest and 
send you your FREE ID Number. 
Remember, you have nothing to lose 
and potentially a lot to gain!
