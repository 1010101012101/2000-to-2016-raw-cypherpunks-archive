If you actually read and reassemble all the references in the
article (which I won't do herein), they all refer to a 'cryptanalytic'
breakthrough over modern crypto, further assisted with compute
power, and deployed. That is obviously not just academic powers
of two yielding moot partial solutions over limited rounds.

And not sabotage, exploits, etc. Of course those are widespread,
but they are not part of the 'cryptanalytic breakthrough' subthread
of the article.

Maths and crackpots love a nice quiet life with everything taken
care of so they can spend decades working their hard problems
and crazy angles. The NSA provides that, and protects it and its
results as their crown jewels. Do not underestimate it.

This begins to matter when basic research yields a point where
a secret investment of say $100B or less pays off.

Leaks can occur until time forgotten.
Math occurs randomly.

Snowden did not have access to the crypto compartments.
No leaker seems to have had relavent access to post-WWII
modern crypto.

Those subject to the dark must speculate, those with knowledge
of it can execute.

Wagering against physics is one thing, against the
human mind... that may not be a wise investment.


"...the ability to crack current public encryption."

Some investigative journalist should be all over following up the
crypto part of Bamford's piece as the scoop of a lifetime. For
that matter, where is Bamford's own followup?

Details of such a breakthrough are likely to serve and advance public
knowledge and application by providing solution to some long desirable
hard problem or going off somewhere new that we've never gone before.

Keeping those kind of secrets for yourself is an affront to Humankind.
Till then, everyone, including the keepers, rots in the Dark Ages.
