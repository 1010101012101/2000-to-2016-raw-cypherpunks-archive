	I know the left/right classification can be pretty meaningless
	and most of the time it is. On the other hand  mainstream
	liberals and mainstream conservatives, which are supposed to be
	left and right are hopeless I'm afraid (I do realize that some
	of them can become more politically sophisticated given
	the 'right' incentives)

	Ah, my mistake. I didn't get your point at first.

	I mostly remain skeptical though. I mean, the only thing you
	can be sure about politicians is that they won't keep their
	'promises'. And yet the democratic charade doesn't seem to be
	losing strength.
