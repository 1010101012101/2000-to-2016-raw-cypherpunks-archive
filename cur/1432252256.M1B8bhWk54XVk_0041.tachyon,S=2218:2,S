Prosecutors, U.S. Attorneys and Attorneys General who seek to throw people
in prison for half a century for the "crime" of producing a porn movie with
the "wrong" type of storyline all need to be gang-raped to the theme of
_The O'Reilly Factor_ by large-penised men, before having themselves, their
families and their children doused with jet fuel and burned alive, September
11th style.

"'Shall make no law' means _NO LAW_. Got it, bitch?"

If not, perhaps somebody should take a Sharpie, use it to write out the
relevant text of the First Amendment on a piece of plain white paper, affix
it to a baseball bat with tape or another suitable adhesive, and then smash
aforementioned baseball bat over the heads of these U.S. Attorneys and high-
ranking "Justice" Department officials until they either get the idea, or
get their skulls crushed to such a degree that bloodied brain tissue ends up
splattered all over the walls of their offices.

Robert Zicari and Janet Romano should seriously consider putting out contracts
on the heads of some Feds.
