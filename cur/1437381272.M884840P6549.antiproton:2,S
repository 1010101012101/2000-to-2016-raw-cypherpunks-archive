I happen to know someone personally who went to one of the largest 
social networks out there, and just asked if he could have full backend 
access to play around and go data mining. They didn't bat an eyelid and 
gave him access to the kind of data you don't get even from the paid API.

This guy happens to be exceptionally convincing, but he wasn't being 
disingenuous; he literally just promised to fish around and see if he 
could find and visualise any cool stuff, and they opened up.

So, no. Your data isn't remotely safe, not even a little bit.
