Something occurred to me...it probably occurred to others already but I am a 
stoopid Cypherpunk, don't forget.

Anyone think it a TINY bit odd that someone with a fairly mundane complaint 
about bad  computer gear would know to come in on an anonymous remailer?

My first thought was that they had gotten burned by a Steve Thompson (maybe 
the same, maybe not) did a google search and came across Cypherpunks and 
then tossed in a couple of stinky posts.

But it seems a little farfetched to me that such a person would also have 
bothered (by accident) reading about the anonymous remailers and then use 
one.

So...the complainer must have already been aware of remailers and Mr 
Thompson's contribution to Cypherpunks.

Kind of interesting.
