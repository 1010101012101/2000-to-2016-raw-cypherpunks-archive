Yes.

Or punch him in the nose :-)

It's there.  And you have lots of choices of algorithms too.  Maybe too
many choices...

It's there.  Check out "smart cards".  One chip does the job quite nicely.
Way too many choices there too.

Do a web search for "secure cryptographic hardware".  Have lots of time to
read :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
