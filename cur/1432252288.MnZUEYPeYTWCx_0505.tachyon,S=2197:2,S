Hardly, it demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the current approach; the
confusion of the model with that being modeled. The funny part is that it
goes back to Newton.

The impact should have some significant long term changes with regard to
theories that rely on 'when/where' sorts of arguments. Such things as
'action at a distance' are involved (eg photon entanglement).

Hardly 'purely philosophical', remote to any given individuals mundane
world view perhaps but not with out some significant impact in the long term.
