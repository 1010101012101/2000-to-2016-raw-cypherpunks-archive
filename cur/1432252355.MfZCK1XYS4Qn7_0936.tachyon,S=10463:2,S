On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent

is a patent-pending solution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any cellular or |andline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partially or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products will comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team,

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH
