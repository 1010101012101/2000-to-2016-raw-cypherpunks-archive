There's 2 sides to that move - by forcing Israel to join the no WMD
group they'd have to eliminate their nukes.  No way Israelies will
go for that, so the US loses face again.  This helps all the Osama's
even more (plus it gives Iran a good reason to go to Pakistan for the
last bit of help they need to complete their weapons.)

So the US better conquer the whole area pretty quickly or it'll be dealing
with nuclear powers instead of chemcial ones.

Patience, persistence, truth,
