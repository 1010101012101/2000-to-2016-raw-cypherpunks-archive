	Could you elaborate on this please? I'm trying it right now, and 
I'm not understand how to make it any quieter than just letting go.

	As to the initial squeeze, it's actually so quiet as to be 
unnoticeable beyond arms length.

	I disagree, it gets cocked when it gets picked up. The finger 
doesn't get to the trigger until the sites are lined up.

	One more point about the barrel--it sits a lot lower in the frame 
than most pistols, modifying the recoil to more of a push than a 
flip--this leads to a quicker followup shots.

	However, do not get oil in the gas-tube. This will lead to problems.

	While I won't disagree, I will note that if you live in a cold 
climate, and use a very close to the body carry (IWB etc) the steel 
against your skin can get a little cold, while some of the polymer 
pistols won't have this problem (any metal bodied pistol will).

> Like I said, I don't bother with anything else anymore.

	Hell, they're all fun to shoot.
