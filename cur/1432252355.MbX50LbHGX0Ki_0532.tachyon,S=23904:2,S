PRIMARY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT PETITION FORM
primaryfundamentalright.org

PRESS RELEASE


MONDAY, 10TH SEPTEMBER, 2001
Sydney, Australia.=20
THE DRUG WARS: THE NEW WORLD WAR.
THE US GOVERNMENT VS THE FREE WORLD.=20
THE 13th AMENDMENT: THE KEY TO COMMONSENSE.


A Sydney man claims that the 13th Amendment of the American Constitution =
could overturn all drug-related and victimless crime convictions in the =
USA and bring to a halt the destructive American financed 'World War on =
Drugs'.

    Bernard W. Palmer, a 57-year-old photocopier repairman and father of =
five girls, reveals the reasons on his 'petition against the drug wars' =
web site located at: http://www.primaryfundamentalright.org/=20

"The 13th Amendment forbids slavery, or the owning of someone else's =
body. So, if it's your body, it's your business what you do to it. =
Therefore, anyone prosecuted for a drug offence, illicit consensual sex, =
not wearing a seat belt or many of the other victimless crimes, have =
been prosecuted illegally."  He continued, "the 13th Amendment proclaims =
that;

'Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for =
crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist =
within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." =20

He believes we are all born with certain rights and the first one must =
be that we are all born free. Therefore, only we can decide what can be =
put into or removed from our bodies (or our real parents if still a =
child), and that no laws should exist that hinder this right. "The 9th =
Amendment allows for the existence of such a right as the 'Primary =
Fundamental Right'," he said.=20

IX - Rule of construction of Constitution. The enumeration in the =
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or =
disparage others retained by the people.=20

"Because people have signed this petition and they retain the ideal of a =
'Primary Fundamental Right', it's existence has now become obvious. The =
PFR lives in all of us, it is the first of the 'self-evident truths'.

James Madison, the main architect of the American Constitution and the =
first ten amendments of the Bill of Rights appears to have failed to see =
that the biggest attack on individual freedoms would come from =
restrictive laws on what you can do to your own body. But, had he put =
forward an amendment stating that "we are all born free and own our own =
bodies" it would have undoubtedly failed because many States wanted =
slavery. Because of that he possibly deliberately overlooked a PFR type =
amendment. He did go on to compose the 9th Amendment apparently so that =
something like the PFR could be introduced in freer times. It also =
appears he guessed correctly how freedom would again meet its =
opposition. He said that the greatest threat to freedom would be from =
the "majority against the minority". "The majority of people become =
accustomed to poor circumstances, no matter how bad they are, and any =
major changes even for the better often scares them."  Palmer =
speculated, "and the time has probably passed when American politicians =
could have changed into statesmen and stopped America turning back into =
a police like state as it was in 1775." He continued, "once more the =
prospect arises that those who want real freedom will have to fight for =
it, not only for themselves but for everyone else, whether the people =
want it or not. Thomas Jefferson, the architect of the Declaration of =
Independence, wrote of these men and despotic rule, " it is their right, =
it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards =
for their future security."=20

Under the 13th Amendment convicts have virtually no rights and can be =
treated as slaves by their jailers. Fortunately, the United States, as =
part of the General Assembly of the United Nations, has adopted and =
proclaimed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', which bans all =
forms of slavery, worldwide. "Both declarations shouldn't exist at the =
same time. I believe precedent has it that usually an international =
treaty or obligation would invalidate a conflicting national law."

It is because of the 13th Amendment that convicts are used as cheap =
labor in many jails across America. This could also be one of the =
reasons for the harsh anti-drug laws. Jail shares have been an excellent =
investment because for a long time they have been guaranteed a good =
supply of convicts even though crime rates have been dropping for the =
last 8 years. The politicians made sure they kept the prisoners coming =
by using 'cruel and unusual punishments' such as mandatory sentences and =
3 strikes. Even these laws are illegal according to the 8th Amendment;=20

VIII - Excessive bail, cruel punishment.
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor =
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.=20

 He speculates that if the prison population drops too far the =
politicians will be forced to introduce even harsher prison terms simply =
because there are too many rural votes and political donations at stake. =
He added, "I would guess, just like the Holocaust victims, someday =
reparations will have to be paid to these modern day slaves. When that =
time comes the politicians who voted 'yes' and the jail and factory =
owners should also be made to pay up from their own pockets. They're the =
one's who gained the most by ignoring basic human rights and prospering =
from the misery of others." He concluded, "the truth is slavery never =
left America, it's been hiding behind the 13th Amendment all this time. =
America is still the home of the slave." =20

His web site is primarily designed for descendants of the English gene =
pool. "I've specifically aimed at America, Australia, Britain, Canada =
and New Zealand," he said. "I believe these nations have done more to =
limit personal freedoms than many others, even though they all think =
they're the most free. For example, America, land of the free, has more =
people in prison per head of population than anywhere else in the world. =
Australia probably has more private prisons per head of population and =
they too have also brought in 'mandatory sentences' and 'truth in =
sentencing' laws to keep the prisoners in jail longer. In both countries =
these policies have kept the jails so full that more and more prisons =
have had to be built. Already over 2 million Americans are in jail and =
as many as 1.5 million of them, or almost three quarters, are =
incarcerated for drug related crimes, crimes that would not exist in a =
really free society. Too many crimes equals too many laws, not too many =
criminals."

He himself is not interested in drugs; "I don't even drink caffeinated =
drinks or eat chocolate". When asked why he built the petition he said, =
"I am horrified by the jails. The jails themselves are the real crime. =
They destroy lives and families, much more than any drugs could ever do. =
Ultimately, society will have to have safer drugs. Alcohol and nicotine =
kill and maim too many people. They are just not cost effective, they =
need competition. Governments must look at getting their taxes from a =
larger range of recreational drugs and also from cost cutting by doing =
away with drug and other PFR prosecutions and imprisonment's. Forfeiture =
laws, which turn police into self-funding tax collectors and thieves, =
sully any good public image they may have. These laws must be removed. =
The savings made by these reforms could be so huge that governments =
could routinely return much of the personal income tax they collect from =
their taxpayers. Jailing the drug users and dealers and other PFR's =
really has to stop, we can't afford it, financially, ethically and =
simply because it breaks up families. Families are the foundation of any =
society, break them up and you break up everything." He continued "they =
say that truth is always the first casualty of war and the 'Drug Wars' =
are a good example because all drugs are safe when used in moderation =
and with proper quality controls. There are no dangerous drugs, just =
dangerous practices."

 Primary Fundamental Right. My body. My business.
