Ouch, whimsical. Let's just say that keeping the character in mind tempers
my comments. Believe it or not.

Be nice if it actually said what it was about, rather than eliciting
projections and interpretations  on the part of the reader. But, as you
say, ho hum. Presumably it is to give "scientific backing" to whatever
position Congress wants to take on upcoming issues and legislation, and to
couch various, no doubt conflicting,  agendas in scientific
doublespeak. Excuse my cynicism, but that's the way it looks to me.

No doubt everyone is tired of it, then. No problem.

Or blocking anything else in particular. I concur.

Mainly I was wondering if others were as dubious as I am at moment
about the apparent level of integrity of the NAS. I should research this
matter more myself, I admit. If I'm not giving Herb proper credit,
even if I remain skeptical of the institution, I'll be the first to say so.

Point taken. Thanks for the response.
