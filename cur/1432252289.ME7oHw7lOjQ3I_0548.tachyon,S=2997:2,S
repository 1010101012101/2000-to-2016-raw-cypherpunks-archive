Well, Duh...no "Alpha Cat" of course. But if you're able to reverse-scam 
someone or get some Qwality 'tang, then I won't cock-block you if you 
declare yourself Cypherpunk leader to an outside party, so long as you have 
zero expectations that the idea of a Cypherpunk 'leader' will have any 
practical effect on my actions.

Well, shit Variola. Here's where I can tell you haven't gotten laid in a 
while. The 'release' was basically a gag...couched in Amerikan Rhetoric it 
was actually stating precisely this (eg..."even terrorist cells operating 
inside the DC Beltway..."). Done properly, the idea would be to have it go 
down the sheeple's throat nice-n-smooth like, see, until they get to the end 
and experience some dim glimmer of recognition as they realize who the real 
terrorists are. And by then it's too late...the sheeple has swallowed a 
'poison pill' gaurunteed (Officially, by Cypherpunks, or your money back) to 
convert them one day into a little, tiny sleeper cell.

>Forget turbans, real terrorists wear neckties.

And don't forget those little American Flag lapel pins...the "mark of the 
beast"?
