Did you know that NetCurrents, which bills itself as "the Internet's 
Premiere Intelligence Agency", conducts real-time monitoring of message 
boards, chatrooms, and IRC channels, logging and producing reports on all 
occurences of particluar keywords for their clients?

Echelon for the private sector, pure and simple. 

They even developed a kind of AI to assign a score to messages based on 
whether they are positive, neutral, or negative, even scoring emoticons. 
For example, if I were to write something on a message board unfriendly to 
any given product or company, (say, for example, NetCurrents and their 
bullshit privacy-invading Big Brother monitoring services D:< ), it would 
likely assign my message a very low score indeed and log it in its 
entirety, along with my e-mail address, into one of their databases to be 
reviewed by some marketing hack (or ???) at a later date. It might be 
interesting to find out who's using this, wouldn't it.
