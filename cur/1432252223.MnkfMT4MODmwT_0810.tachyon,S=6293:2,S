</color>The problem is this: there's no way that you can set this up

so that random users can find gnutella servers and LEOs can't.

No way,  impossible,  give up.

</color>Right.  Napster is an entity, Gnutella is a protocol.

</color>No.  The scan version would make it a little harder for everyone to

find the first gnutella server to connect to,  and that's all it would do.


The only way a scan version would make any sense would be if

it somehow became illegal to post a list of gnutella servers while

it remained legal to actually run a gnutella server, a situation so

bizzare I don't think it merits discussion.

</color>Atwood's numbers are based on estimates as to how many people

want to use scanners,  and the fact that they're pretty likely to

hit the same set of addresses.  If you're the only one using a scanner,  it 
won't be much of a burden on anyone.


It really wouldn't be difficult to write one.

Here's the URL of the protocol spec

http://www.gnutelladev.com/protocol/gdnp.html

basically,  all you have to do is send it a UDP packet saying

<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Courier New</param>'GDNP CONNECT/0.10\n\n'<FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>

</color><FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>and see if you get back

<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Courier New</param>'GDNP OK\n\n'<FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param><bigger>

it may be worth your while just to see if you can get it to

work as an excercise.  If you're running your own server

and just look at your own IP address (use 127.0.0.1 if you

don't know it) you can play with it without affecting the outside world.
