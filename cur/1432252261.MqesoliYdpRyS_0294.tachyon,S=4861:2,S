<sigh>

His lists are closed. This means that somebody on his list is forwarding
the emails or else they've hacked the security at Yahoo. There are NO
*@yahoogroups.com or *@yahoo.com subscriptions through SSZ currently.
There should be no subscription of *@ssz.com to any *@yahoo.com address
either (and my logs show no evidence of receipt of traffic either way).

I've explained to this guy he is being spoofed and he just don't get it.
