Feds link boy, 16, and plot to 'take
              down Internet'

              Agents seize youth's computer equipment; family says it's
              all a misunderstanding

              Thursday, January 11, 2001

              By SCOTT SUNDE
              SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER

              To the FBI, a Snohomish County teenager is a suspected
              cyberterrorist who planned to join others in unleashing a
              program that could "take down the Internet."

              Agents swooped in days before the program was to be
              tested, seizing computer equipment at the 16-year-old
              boy's home north of Lynnwood on Dec. 22.

              To the boy and his family, it's all a big
misunderstanding.
              The FBI is making far too much of a little computer
              noodling and adolescent boasting, they say.

              "They got it totally wrong," the boy complained
              yesterday.

              An FBI spokesman said yesterday the agency is working
              closely with prosecutors and can say little about the
              international case.

              The FBI has made no arrests so far in the United States,
              said Matt McLaughlin, a spokesman at the bureau's Los
              Angeles office.

              The investigation began in October, according to
              documents used to obtain a warrant to search the youth's
              Alderwood Manor home.

              DALNet, a San Diego company that provides Internet
              chat networks, contacted the FBI and complained that
              several computer users had begun attacks on it. The
              hackers caused computers to become disabled and denied
              other users access to DALNet, according to an affidavit
              by John Pi, a computer expert and FBI agent in Los
              Angeles.

              Investigators traced the user names of the alleged
              hackers, leading them to the 16-year-old and computer
              users in California, Michigan and Israel.

              In an interview yesterday, the boy said he used DALNet
              but didn't attack it.

              When an administrator there accused him of attacks, he
              said he "flooded her with messages. That's not illegal."

              A DALNet systems operator told the FBI last fall that a
              person using the user name "Booterror" had created a
              program that could "take down the Internet on New
              Year's Eve," Pi wrote in the affidavit.

              Booterror planned to send test versions of the program
              to other computer users by Dec. 25, with the intent of
              then spreading it world-wide, according to Pi.

              "That's totally invalid," the 16-year-old said yesterday.

              The teen acknowledged that his computer nickname is
              Booterror but said it is pronounced "Boot-Error."

              "Boot" is a common computer term used when a system
              comes online.

              The FBI agents raiding his home made it sound more
              sinister -- pronouncing it "Boo-Terror," he said.

              He said he tried to create a "Trojan," a program that can
              be sent out and used to control someone's computer. But
              he folded the project two months ago, he said.

              "I was just playing around and learning something. I was
              just going to make a small Trojan, and I just got caught
              up in this."

              He started working with computers and surfing the
              Internet two years ago, he said. He built his own
              computers.

              The youth had been attending a community college to
              earn the equivalent of a high school diploma. But he
              hasn't shown much interest in that or much of anything
              else since the FBI paid a call, the boyfriend of the boy's

              mother said.

              He said the boy is guilty only of getting a little
"mouthy"
              over the Internet. "He's just 16 years old. That's all it
was
              -- bragging. He had no intention of doing all that crap."

              But federal authorities and DALNet are serious about
              the investigation.

              The company's Web page provided a link this week to
              news reports from Israel, where police arrested four
              17-year-old hackers suspected of planning an attack on
              U.S. computer systems on New Year's Eve.

              DALNet said in a prepared statement that it is
              cooperating with the FBI and law enforcement outside
              the U.S. and "will continue to pursue all individuals
              responsible for attacks upon our systems."
