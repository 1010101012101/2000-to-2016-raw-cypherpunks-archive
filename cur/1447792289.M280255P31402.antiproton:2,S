Exactly. Governments have had at least 15 years to strap those boots,
and certainly have some good ones. These days it's probably just
as interesting as USA vs. USSR in that regard... plots, schemes,
double and triple agents... the spy game.

It's interesting what other perhaps complementary and/or parallel
forms of intel and boots have sprung up. Though best examples
are surely not seen, wrapped in closeness to government agencies
or other allegiences, and these links cover only one small theatre
among the list of things any agents, actors and mafioso have always
had an interest in... yet one can begin to get the idea... just how
deep does this sort of online game go...

Like volunteering for missionary, cash and a blessing at sendoff
is still a very hard problem to crack. Unless you become confidant
of both Padre and Church itself, or simply become them...

Regardless, if any of this affects your area you should definitely
have your talking points and counter solutions lined up, because
the exposure and fields of play are growing and it's not going away.
Welcome to the connected world.
