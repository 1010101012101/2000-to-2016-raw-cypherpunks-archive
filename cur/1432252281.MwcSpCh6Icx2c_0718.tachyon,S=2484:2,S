Hi,

I'd like to share my crystal ball.

The jurisdictions which pass spam control laws that require 'permission'
will actually foster spam.

The new format for spam will be:

May I send you correspondences?

Blahblahblahblah

To stop future correspondence please send an unsubscription request to:

f00@bar.dingbat

What these laws will actually do is require more effort on the part of
consumers.

Further, the 'valid address' requirements would be fulfilled by a simple
-single- subscription to a free mail service. This mailbox of course would
never actually be read. What this will do is increase the load on the
'free' services, causing many of them to cease to exist. It in effect
increases the lower bounds on resources needed to participate in this
great democratic-technocratic experiment we call the Internet.

These laws are 'bad' things.
