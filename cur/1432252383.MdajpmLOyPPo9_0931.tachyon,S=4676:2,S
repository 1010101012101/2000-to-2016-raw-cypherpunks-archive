Some of us were talking at our camp in the Sierras last weekend about 
the efforts to silence William Cooper, culminating in his death in a 
shootout with LEOs dressed as street punks. One of Bill's early 
interests, after his retirement from the armed services, was in how 
"Liquid Metal Embrittlement" (LME) compounds had been developed to 
weaken aircraft structures as a means of sabotage. LME works by 
weakening aluminum, notably, along grain lines.

An LME solution smeared along wing or panel sections could cause 
catastrophic failure during high stress flight phases, e.g., takeoffs 
and, to a lesser extent, landings. We ran a few scenarios about how easy 
it would be bring down an airliner, further spreading fear.

So what happened on Monday morning? From the reports I'm reading, it 
looks like the tail section broke off shortly after takeoff, during 
relatively high-g banking manouvers. CNN is saying this is an 
"unprecedented" failure mechanism for the A300.

Bill Cooper may well have been terminated with extreme prejudice, as the 
saying goes, because he was getting too close to the truth about the NWO 
and ZOG using such US-developed sabotage weapons to further the 
expansion of the terror state.

The U.S. has pressured the major U.S. news outlets not to show Bin 
Laden's tapes...now we are hearing from _transcripts_ that Bin Laden has 
"come close" to taking credit for 911...but it would help to actually 
_see_ the tapes. Ah, but that would not be consistent with the New World 
Order approach to justice:

* strong arm the press into not showing video tapes, except of the NWO 
side

* suspend habeus corpus, hold 1000 detainees indefinitely (9 weeks and 
counting...)

-- secret trials, secret evidence, secret witnesses...so much for the 
open courts, confrontation of witnesses, jury of peers, due process

-- bugging of attorney-client communications (would not surprise me that 
other secret orders require attorneys to implicate their clients, even 
with manufactured evidence)

-- ZOG lovers like Dershowitz are calling for torturing suspects until 
they confess

(One of our fun ideas in the Sierras was that someone should kidnap 
Dershowitz, torture him for 5 days, release the tape of his various 
"confessions," and then dump his body in front of the Supreme Court.)

Fuck America. Fuck it dead.
