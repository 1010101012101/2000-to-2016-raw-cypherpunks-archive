Maybe once average people become fully comfortable with the idea of online
banking and bill-paying services, they'll be more receptive. I think it
might just be a question of widespread digital cash being few years ahead of
its time.

Also, I wouldn't rule out the "intelligence divide" as a factor here: if half
the population has an IQ under 100, what are you doing to make your product
accessible to people of average intelligence, and below? AOL is so popular
for a reason: ease of use while providing services average people really
care about (all that family, community and chat garbage, etc).
 
So maybe it's worth putting a little effort into thinking of ways to
AOLize (for lack of a better term) digital cash: a mass market reqires
mass appeal. Something that's all-too-easy to forget, especially if you're
the kind of person who got all excited over learning how to program BASIC in
elementary school, the way most of us probably did.
