Based on my experience at a DOE lab that let me to coin the term
'Legislative Trojan', I proposed a process called 'trusted open 
source', in which things like the core bios (http://coreboot.org)
would be maintained by multiple different government standards
agencies. 

Say NIST in the US, Germany, China, Japan, and Taiwan, as well
as independent organizations like Wikipedia, the free software
foundation, and the Debian project.

So when you have VHDL, I'm very interested in looking at it, and
calling up some of the people I used to work with in the Supercomputing
community. They are very concerned about the integrity of open and public
scientific computing, and may even be motivated to fund such a thing.

The Cryptocoin community (should) also be extremely interested as
well, and http://efabless.com would love to actually make the thing.

Then you just randomly sample and X-ray the chips. The intelligence
agencies that want to subvert this process will still have plenty of
physical/humint/social engineering attacks so they will be happy.

When do we start? Please upload some VHDL/verilog ASAP.
