The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the deve|opment of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as well 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are deve|oping rapidly. Emerson will 
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| f|ow it wil| be able to build a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing al| possible 
0ppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wi|| have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, which 
wi|| a|ways encourage the participation of financial partners."

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wi|l sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
