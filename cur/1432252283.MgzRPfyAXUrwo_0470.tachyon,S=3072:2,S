Oh, nonsense.  Sometimes you've got business to do.
Sometimes your family is sick.  Sometimes you're sick.

Oregon's vote-by-mail thing was interesting, if a bit slow,
though as with the Internet, it offers a range of choices
for voting early and often that differ from the go-to-the-polls ones.

BTW, did you leave out a "don't" in that second sentence?
Or did you mean people really *do* give government the (dis)respect
it deserves.
				Thanks!
