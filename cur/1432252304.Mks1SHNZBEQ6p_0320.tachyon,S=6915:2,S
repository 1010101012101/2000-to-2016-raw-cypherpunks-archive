Perfect, just want to add that this isn't the US all alone, it happens
worldwide.
At the very end everyone is tricked, the white, gray and black hats as well as
the creators, the maintenace staff and watchdogs of the security system. Only
fools believe that not everthing is saved and stored for later use. Doctrine
and Dogma like in religion. There're 3 ways to go: Don't care about it,
educate yourself on possibilities to secure your privacy for a while (that's
the reason for 'strong crypto') or avoid the net forever.
