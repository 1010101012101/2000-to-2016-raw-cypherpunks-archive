So they've been logging connection info for 3+ months already,
and now there's censorship (currently implemented via DNS, but this
will change, of course), logging of the blocked connections, and
all kind of ominous language and promises to extend the censorship 
list (secret, of course, and you'll get your house searched and
your computers confiscated even if you link upon a link upon a link
to the leaked list) to all kinds of things, and cooperation with
IP owners.
