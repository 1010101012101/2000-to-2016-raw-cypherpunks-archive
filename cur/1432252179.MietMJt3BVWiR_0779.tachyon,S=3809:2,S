I'll second this - the early 40 bit SSL cracks, and the RSA Symmetric
challenges,
operated to force acknowledgement that 40 and 56 bit keylengths were simply
inadequate. I was particularly steamed by some Clinton appointee claiming 
with a straight face that a DES cracker could not be built because "it would

melt down". The success of the challenges created 'facts on the ground'
which could not be hand-waved away by government officials, and meant
that customers started to insist on something better. 

BTW, the distributed.net folks are still cranking at 64 bit RC5. They
have now searched 54% of the keyspace in 1,386 days. 

One thing I'd like to see done with these huge distributed computers
is to factor moduli, such as those in the RSA Factoring Challenges
(the prizes are substantial), A major bottleneck at this point is the
matrix reduction step. If a method could be found to run this in parallel,
then distributed factoring would be greatly eased.
