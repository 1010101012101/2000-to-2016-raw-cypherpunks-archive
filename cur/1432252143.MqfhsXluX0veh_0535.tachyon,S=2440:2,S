So do something clearly artificial but complex,
like taking all the spam from your spambait account and
probing the IPs it came from and websites it references
to collect some statistics and also check for relay and proxy status
and maybe display some samples of spam collections on the "some lame 
archive" website.

Me?  I wasn't browsing Thoughtcrime - that was just my spam harasser.
