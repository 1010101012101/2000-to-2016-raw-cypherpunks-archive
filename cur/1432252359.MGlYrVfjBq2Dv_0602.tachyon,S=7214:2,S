                                                   National Security Agency Offers Veiled Tour of Top-Secret Operations 

                                                   From Reuters


                                                        FORT MEADE, Md.--The super-secret National Security Agency, which
                                                   eavesdrops on communication worldwide as part of U.S. spying operations,
                                                   opened its doors Saturday to offer outsiders a rare glimpse of facilities that test
                                                   antennas and print nuclear code books. 
                                                        About 16,500 employees and their families were expected at the first "family
                                                   day" since 1996 held at NSA headquarters, about 25 miles outside Washington, as
                                                   the spy agency makes a greater effort to inform Americans about its mission. 
                                                        "American people need an image of this agency so its identity is not a
                                                   vacuum," NSA Director Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden told reporters. 
                                                        There was the "anechoic chamber," which looked like a science-fiction movie
                                                   set, with blue foam spikes of different sizes poking out of the floor, walls and
                                                   ceiling of the 42-foot-high room. 
                                                        It is echo-free and one of five rooms at NSA for testing antennas used to
                                                   collect information. The antenna revolves on a high pedestal at one end, while
                                                   information is transmitted from the other end of the room. 
                                                        The Air Force has a similar room big enough to test an entire airplane, an NSA
                                                   official said. 
                                                        "Each cone is sized to absorb a different frequency," said the official, who
                                                   spoke on condition of anonymity. 
                                                        Areas opened to visitors were sanitized to ensure no classified material was
                                                   lying around. 
                                                        A 66,000-square-foot printing plant produces code books--160 million pages a
                                                   year--used in U.S. military operations. 
                                                        Nuclear code books for use in the event the United States orders a nuclear
                                                   strike are produced about four times a month, compared with nearly every day
                                                   during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
                                                        The book is in a sealed plastic pouch that has a unique pattern of pink
                                                   splotches and is puffy because of air inside. 
                                                        If there is any change in the package, such as the amount of air inside or the
                                                   design of the splotches, which is videotaped before being sent out, the codes are
                                                   considered compromised. 
                                                        "Well go back and see if the splatter diagram is the same. Weve got a video
                                                   of the package," said Dan Shirko, chief of publishing. 
                                                        The nuclear code books are in the hands of nearly 1,000 people, mostly
                                                   military officers, such as pilots and sailors on submarines and battleships. 
                                                        Also displayed was security equipment that identifies a user by the iris, face,
                                                   fingerprint and voice. NSA produced the equipment with private industry partners.

                                                        Once the computer recognizes the user by one of those methods, it allows
                                                   access. 
                                                        "The face system actually distinguishes between twins," said Dave Murley,
                                                   technical director of identification and authentication research. 
                                                        The iris recognition, which scans the front of the eyeball, was the most
                                                   accurate of the four methods and voice recognition the least accurate, he said. 
                                                        Reminders of the need for security were all around. In the cafeteria, one sign
                                                   read, "Dont spill the beans pardner, the steaks are too high. No classified talk."
