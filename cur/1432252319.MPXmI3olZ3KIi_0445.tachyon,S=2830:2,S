Although I (naturally biased) prefer to use Cypto Kng, I recently needed to 
use pgp, so I decided to upgrade.

I went to PGP.com.  Their freeware PGP is fourteen megabytes of mystery code.


Something that big and mysterious does not make me feel secure.  My current 
pgp.exe is 250K, for which I have source code, source code that I have 
looked at.  The program performs functions that I understand, in ways that 
I understand.

What is the recommended PGP?
