Subject: Inferno: John Brady Kiesling speaking engagement

from the NOWAR list:

On Tuesday, April 29, from 7:00-9:00 pm, John Brady Kiesling will speak on
American Moral Capital and the Misprojection of U.S. Power
Kiesling, formerly Foreign Service Officer at the US embassy in Athens,
resigned from the State Department in February 2003 to protest the conduct
of the Administration's foreign policy and the looming war in Iraq. His
letter of resignation to Secretary of State, Colin Powell, was reproduced
by the New York Times and rapidly circulated around the globe as a cry for
preserving America's endangered international legitimacy. He has just
returned to the U.S. from Athens, and will discuss the reasons for his
protest and offer insights into the future of American foreign policy. Mr.
Kiesling was a diplomat for 20 years, serving in Greece, Armenia, Morocco
and Israel. He holds a Masters degree in Ancient History and Mediterranean
Archeology from UC Berkeley.
Location: UT Campus, Painter Hall 3.02 (on 24th St. between Guadalupe &
Speedway)
