I was surprised that among their lists for first this and that
they didn't list the first use of a .com, .net, or .edu address on Usenet.

There were lots of @-style addresses even in the first few months
(viz. the TCP-IP-Digest article), but they were pre-DNS person@machine formats,
where the machine names were relative to the sender's hosts [.txt] file
and were therefore not in theory globally unique names, though in practice
they usually were.
