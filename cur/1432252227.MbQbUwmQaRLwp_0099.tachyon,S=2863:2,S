I would request the irony-impaired actually look up the lyrics of this paen
to endogenous ero-endorphins, written by a drug-hating San Francisco
"acid-kindergarten" refugee.

In the meantime, I'm all for the legalization of meth -- as long as I get
to sharpen my Recon Tonto and personally slit the bag of any of the bastids
as they  cross my windowsill looking for something to steal.


Kinda like opening the borders without killing the welfare state first.
Okay, maybe our porous borders *will* kill the welfare state, of course,
Reagan used unrestrained soviet-killing budget deficits to "kill" the
welfare state en passant. He didn't? I mean, Clinton *did* say "...big
government is over.", right? Right??? <looks offstage> This thing on?


Cheers,
RAH
The only to "legalize" anything is when progress makes the law superfluous.
