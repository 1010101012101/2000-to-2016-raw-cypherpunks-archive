#    A spam cop goes AWOL

#    The ORBS blacklist, a controversial tool for stopping unsolicited 
#    e-mail, is suddenly inaccessible.

#    By Damien Cave
#    
#    June 8, 2001 | Spam fighters all over the world have lost a 
#    controversial weapon in the battle against unsolicited e-mail. 
#    Since June 1, the Web site for ORBS -- the Open Relay Behavior 
#    Modification System -- has been gutted. Visitors to the site 
#    now find nothing more than a gray blank page and a simple message: 
#    "Due to circumstances beyond our control, the ORBS website is 
#    no longer available."
#    
#    ORBS's main service was a blacklist of Internet mail servers 
#    -- computers capable of routing mail across the Net -- that the 
#    ORBS administrator, Alan Brown, had identified as potentially 
#    capable of forwarding spam. Now that blacklist is no longer 
#    available to network administrators, and they want to know why. 
#    One popular theory mooted on the Net is that Brown closed down 
#    the site rather than comply with a New Zealand court order 
#    demanding that he remove two specific ISPs from the blacklist. 
#    But Brown, who lives in New Zealand, is keeping silent. "I am 
#    unable to answer any of your questions," he writes in an e-mail. 
#    "Sorry."
#    
#    Even without an explanation, the demise of ORBS is significant, 
#    stirring up, once again, an ongoing worldwide debate over how 
#    best to administer the Internet and mediate the Net's intersection 
#    of humanity and technology. Questions about ORBS's behavior always 
#    centered on the problem of how to handle e-mail abuse. But more 
#    generally, ORBS symbolized the ongoing struggle between the Net's 
#    tendency to encourage individual freedom and the necessity of 
#    combating anarchy.
#    
#    Ever since the Net moved beyond its roots as a small, open, 
#    academic community, users have attempted to balance opposing 
#    forces. Most favor the right to speak out, along with the right 
#    to privacy; they rail against censorship, but at the same time 
#    desperately seek the ability to censor unsolicited e-mail by 
#    limiting spammers' access to their networks.
#    
#    ORBS supporters say the blacklist was a fully justified form 
#    of preventive medicine. Brown saw his mission as identifying 
#    every mail server on the Net that allowed "open relays" -- in 
#    essence, that permitted the forwarding of mail from one point 
#    on the Net to another without any restriction. Spammers love 
#    open relays; they employ them to hide their identities and funnel 
#    out massive amounts of e-mail for free. But at the same time 
#    the open relays bog down the system for other customers.
#    
#    Brown used simple software agents and diagnostic probes to comb 
#    the Internet, looking for mail servers configured for open 
#    relaying. Whenever he found one, Brown would post the Internet 
#    protocol (IP) address on his list -- even if the address had 
#    never been used by a spammer. ISPs, systems administrators and 
#    everyday citizens who configured their computers to block 
#    addresses listed on ORBS could then close off a spammer's favorite 
#    distribution tool even before the spammer knew it existed.
#    
#    More controversial, Brown also placed on his list servers that 
#    blocked his probes, whether or not he could ascertain if they 
#    had open relays. ORBS supporters say such a policy was the only 
#    way to keep a flood of open-relay-capable servers from pumping 
#    spam across the Net. The end, they argue, justified the means.
#    
#    The immediate impact of the ORBS shutdown could mean more spam, 
#    says Michael LeFevre, a London technology company executive. 
#    "I've received four spams since ORBS went down last week," he 
#    says. "I only received two or three previous to that this year."
#    
#    But not everyone is sorry to see the site go. ORBS has plenty 
#    of critics. ORBS wasn't just a useful technology, they say; it 
#    was also a tool used by a specific person, Alan Brown, an 
#    overzealous spam fighter who went too far. ORBS's own ISP pulled 
#    the plug on Brown in 1998 after receiving complaints about the 
#    way that Brown used probes to test servers for open relays. 
#    Although another ISP agreed to host ORBS soon afterward, Brown's 
#    detractors say that he never learned his lesson: He repeatedly 
#    insisted that he had the right to test servers as often as he 
#    wanted.
#    
#    "Alan Brown created some nice technology -- nobody faults him 
#    on that point," says Tom Geller, founder of Suespammers.org, 
#    a nonprofit group that lobbies for strict spam legislation. "But 
#    he used it in an irresponsible way, invading others' private 
#    networks and using others' resources against their stated wishes." 
#    He became a living contradiction -- a man who, says Geller, "used 
#    others' network resources to prove that it's wrong to use others' 
#    network resources."
#    
#    Before the scourge of spam, the Net was a less contentious place. 
#    Until the early '90s, open relays were not uncommon. In fact, 
#    they were the norm.
#    
#    "I remember when you'd get funny looks for running a mail server 
#    that wasn't an open relay," says "Der Mouse," a Canadian 
#    spam-fighting veteran who refused to give his off-line name. 
#    "I remember when there was a machine on the Net that was 
#    advertised as having no password on its administrative log-in. 
#    Want a guest log-in? Log in and create yourself one. I remember 
#    when the Net was a friendly and civilized place."
#    
#    "Today it is more of an armed camp, suspicious of everyone," 
#    he continues in an e-mail. "The Net I knew and loved is dead, 
#    killed by uncivilized greedy incompetents who came barging in, 
#    without caring that when you barge into a foreign culture it 
#    behooves you to learn how they do things. This would not have 
#    been a problem, except that they arrived in sufficient numbers 
#    to overload the mechanisms that normally would have either brought 
#    newcomers up to speed on the culture or rejected them; as a result 
#    they killed off the culture we had, the only culture I've ever 
#    seen work based on mutual friendship and helpfulness on a large 
#    scale."
#    
#    Spam signified the death of the original Net culture, Der Mouse 
#    and others argue. By the mid-'90s, systems administrators started 
#    fighting it by closing off open relays. Shutting the pipes made 
#    it harder for, say, employees of a company to log on to their 
#    corporate network from home, but by limiting who could use the 
#    network, closed relays also kept spammers out. This, in turn, 
#    saved companies and individuals money, since open relays 
#    essentially let anyone borrow servers and bandwidth without having 
#    to pay for them.
#    
#    But some network administrators moved slower than others. So 
#    ORBS appeared, with a mission to move them along. At first, most 
#    people on the Net welcomed the service. Open relays were sometimes 
#    hard to find, and ORBS worked more quickly than other 
#    spam-fighting lists. The Mail Abuse Prevention System's Realtime 
#    Blackhole List, for example, acts like an after-the-fact plug. 
#    Its main list contains domain names that spam has already been 
#    sent from, and MAPS only adds servers to its list after the system 
#    administrator of the offending mail server has been given a chance 
#    to close the hole but hasn't done it.
#    
#    ORBS, on the other hand, "tested relays and listed them 
#    immediately," says William James, a computer consultant in 
#    Mississippi. "No negotiation, no notice. It was fast. Someone 
#    running an open relay ran the risk of losing a substantial amount 
#    of traffic without any notice."
#    
#    Over time, however, Brown's pace and intensity started alienating 
#    the very people who sympathized with his cause. John Oliver, 
#    a systems administrator in San Diego, remembers butting heads 
#    with Brown in early 1999. ORBS probes invaded his servers and 
#    tested them for 45 minutes, over and over again. The probes 
#    returned and retested a few days or weeks later, "as often and 
#    as frequently as they saw fit," Oliver says.
#    
#    Each day that the tests ran, Oliver's server logs lengthened. 
#    He received pages and pages of server activity that directly 
#    resulted from Brown's tests. "It was annoying because since I 
#    wasn't running an open relay, it was wasting my time," he says. 
#    "And, of course, I didn't appreciate the implicit accusation 
#    that I was an irresponsible admin."
#    
#    Brown regularly tested servers without any evidence of wrongdoing, 
#    says Der Mouse. "Let me be precise: He repeatedly 'tested' my 
#    home mail server, and if he had any reason to think it had ever 
#    relayed spam, he steadfastly refused to produce it," he says. 
#    "He also repeatedly did so after I explicitly denied him 
#    permission to do so."
#    
#    MAPS also had a run-in with ORBS. In 1999, MAPS listed ORBS on 
#    its Realtime Blackhole List, in response to several complaints 
#    about the way that ORBS was supposedly abusing networks. The 
#    group removed ORBS and stopped blocking it from its own servers 
#    three months later, but not before ORBS threw MAPS into its own 
#    black hole. Even Suespammers.org found itself blocked over a 
#    dispute with ORBS. Until the day the list died, spam fighters 
#    who used Brown's list couldn't access the Suespammers site, a 
#    major resource that might have helped them in their war on 
#    unsolicited e-mail.
#    
#    "Alan's problem is that he was so convinced that testing was 
#    necessary that he felt that anyone who didn't want him testing 
#    their systems, as often as he wanted to, was somehow just as 
#    bad as an actual open relay," says Peter Seebach, a systems 
#    administrator who subscribes to several spam-fighting mailing 
#    lists. "This is where I drew the line; without any spam coming 
#    through a system, and with the admin's request that he not test 
#    it, he had no business hitting systems over and over again. I 
#    don't see a meaningful distinction between what he did and what 
#    script kiddies do with root scripts" that attempt to break into 
#    a system.
#    
#    Is what ORBS did really so bad? In essence, ORBS was nothing 
#    more than a list of servers that Brown checked and decided to 
#    block from connecting with his network -- which is one suggested 
#    recipe for spam fighting. Doesn't Brown have the right to protect 
#    his network by blocking whomever he wants to? Doesn't he have 
#    the right to publish a list of whom he's blocking?
#    
#    People who rail against Brown are ignoring the implications of 
#    their argument, says "Afterburner," manager of the e-mail abuse 
#    department for a large ISP. ORBS may have been run "in a 
#    particularly unethical way," he says, but that doesn't mean that 
#    Brown should be silenced.
#    
#    Rather, everyone should have "the unfettered right to publish" 
#    a blacklist, regardless of how it is organized, he says. Probes 
#    don't damage a network, and "nobody is required to use your list 
#    if they don't want to," he says. "The situation is somewhat 
#    analogous to the idealized free market: If you put out a list 
#    that's worth using, people will use it. If you put out a list 
#    that is not worth using, people will not use it."
#    
#    But ORBS doesn't quite fit Afterburner's paraphrase of the 
#    libertarian ideal. The list was worth using; blocking the servers 
#    ORBS listed cut down on spam. Yet those who used the list as 
#    a tool against unwanted e-mail didn't necessarily have to pay 
#    the costs, which came in the form of ORBS's probes. In other 
#    words, Brown's approach looks a lot like a spammer's: He invaded 
#    others' networks without consent, offering benefits without costs.
#    
#    Even worse, critics argue, Brown went one step further, blocking 
#    servers that didn't have open relays, and adding them to a list 
#    that he knew would keep traffic from them. There is, for example, 
#    the Xtra Mail lawsuit in New Zealand, which Brown's critics say 
#    was a direct result of Brown's unethical practices.
#    
#    Essentially, Brown added Actrix and Xtra Mail's servers to his 
#    blacklist after they blocked his probes. He reportedly had no 
#    evidence that they used open relays. Actrix and Xtra Mail sued, 
#    and on May 24 they won. The New Zealand High Court ordered Brown 
#    to remove Xtra Mail's servers from the ORBS database.
#    
#    Brown then said that he would comply, but he remained unrepentant. 
#    "ORBS policy is that if you threaten ORBS you'll be manually 
#    listed," he said, according to a story in IDG New Zealand. 
#    "Telecom [Actrix and Xtra Mail's parent company] threatened me 
#    with legal action for two years."
#    
#    Those who have tangled with Brown aren't surprised at his stance. 
#    And they don't have a problem with his philosophy, or with his 
#    argument that he has a right to form a policy and block whomever 
#    he wants. They argue, however, that the policy has to be carried 
#    out with honesty.
#    
#    "The list wasn't what it was purported to be," says Oliver, of 
#    San Diego. "If you employ a list called the Open Relay Behavior 
#    Modification System to protect your server from spam, you expect 
#    that list to block open relays and nothing else. But that isn't 
#    what you got with ORBS. You got open relays blocked as well as 
#    anyone who had attracted the personal enmity of Mr. Brown."
#    
#    Ultimately, Oliver says, the Net should be glad to see ORBS go 
#    because it lacked the basic values of the old Internet -- truth, 
#    respect and freedom. "It's extremely dangerous to support the 
#    use of a tool when the cost for its use includes the loss of 
#    a liberty," he says.
#    
#    Still, many of Brown's critics argue that ORBS's technology 
#    shouldn't go to waste. The list is already mirrored on at least 
#    one site, and some predict that another administrator -- someone 
#    with a bit more restraint -- will clean it up and maintain it. 
#    If he or she does, perhaps that individual, and other 
#    technologists, will learn from Brown's mistakes, says Geller 
#    at Suespammers.org.
#    
#    "Any technical endeavor that ignores social aspects is doomed 
#    to failure," he says. "It's like making soup without liquid."
