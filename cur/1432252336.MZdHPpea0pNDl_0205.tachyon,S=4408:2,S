Nonetheless, they are separate and separable.  Outlawing the act does not
require outlawing the speech.

Actually, it is just as reasonable to think that the MORE kiddy porn there
is out there, the LESS acting out there will be (think cathartic release).
Also, by letting what already exists circulate, REDUCES the incentive to
produce more and, thus, abusing more kids.

Of course it does.  What part of "Congress shall make no law...abridging the
freedom of speech..." doesn't "Mr. Constitutional absolutist" understand?
:'D

"Mr. Constitutional absolutist" should have another look at the Ninth.

No, but speech about sex between consenting adults is porn.  Look it up,
"pornography" literally means, "writings about prostitutes," but has been
extended to encompass all writings (and other speech) about sexual conduct.
By the way, "porn" is not illegal, per se.  It's "obscenity" that's the
legal bugaboo.  Of course, "Mr. Constitutional absolutist" INAL (and never
could be).
