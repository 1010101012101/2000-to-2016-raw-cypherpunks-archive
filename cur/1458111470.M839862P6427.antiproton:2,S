Governments always absolve and immunize themselves (and
their partners), particularly at the highest levels. Torture, Murder,
Surveillance, Drone Kills, Cops Killing, Political Lies, Too Big To
Fail, Generally Fucking Shit Up, etc... all typical.
The only time they're stopped, indicted, prosecuted, and jailed
is when they're failed / overthrown, invaded, or both. In the meantime
till people wake up... they've come up with this cool thing called elections
to make you forget and think the guard has changed... it hasn't...
the same old game. Don't believe it? Ask History.

Some history and deja vu...
