   Duh! You don't know much about biology, eh? CO2 makes plants grow. Plants and
animals interact that way -- they exhale oxygen for us and we exhale CO2 for
them.

   I could care less what any report says, I get an immediate sick feeling from
breathing tobacco smoke. And a great many other people do as well.

  No, actually, banning cars in cities is a great idea. And, as a matter of
fact, since I ride a bicycle a lot, I often *do* get a sick feeling from
breathing car exhaust, at least from some that are apparantly burning
"reformutlated gasoline".

   Not for me it wouldn't. I'm overjoyed at the prospect of all the airlines
going tits up. At least if the USG would let them instead of pumping more
subsidies into them. I took my last commercial flight about four years ago --
never again.

   Toxins? Particulates, yes, but not many toxins. And you're right, Mother
Nature will always win in the end.

   "don't stand downwind" -- that's a pretty simplistic answer. Impossible to do
when you're moving down the street. The bottom line is this: No one has the
right to do something in their space that adversely affects my space, whether
it's smoking in public or the farmer next door who sprays pesticides which drift
over to my land, or puts chemicals on his land which get into my well.

   Sure, I guess I could just walk around with a pellet gun and zap anyone
whose smoke bothered me, right? Why not? After all, I'm not really seriously
harming them, just more like a temporary annoyance.
