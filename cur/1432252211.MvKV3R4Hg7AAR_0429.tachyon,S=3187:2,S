I think underlying the electoral question is a more fundamental 
issue- as you said in later in your message, if the race isn't close, 
it doesn't matter.  The question then is "in a fairly close race is 
it better for the president to be the person who represents the most 
people or the person who represents the most territory". The 
electoral college is designed choose the president based on 
territorial representation.
