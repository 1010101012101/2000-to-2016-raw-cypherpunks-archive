The past is its own problem. We in the present are not responsible 
for the accumulated detritus from dead and defunct sites.

Wake up and get a clue.

Are you dumb, or just ignorant? That someone set up a "Cypherpunks 
home page" several years ago means nothing. That no one has done it 
since means much more...it means those since who read the list 
understand the churlishness of presuming to set up a "home page.

A point lost on you, "Asymmetric," the same "Asymmetric" who says 
that anyone wishing to read the list should do so under his or her 
true name.

Did you notice the _real_ list I copied? Check the above block.

I copied the list the untermenschen hang out on just to make sure you'd see it.
