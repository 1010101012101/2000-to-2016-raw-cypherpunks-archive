not really, see below.

hardware monies buy things like FPGA driven filters, and these
hardware sniffers can in turn easily talk to banks of DDR.

there was a paper at USENIX or somewhere that showed Xilinx FPGA's
programmed with up to 700+ snort filter rules that could monitor a
10GigE stream in real time (yes, 10GigE) and scaled linear; just the
kind of mechanism well funded adversaries like to brute force. [i
can't find this paper anymore, does someone else have a link / copy?]

nallatech makes some nice FPGA hardware systems that would apply:
http://www.nallatech.com/?node_id=1.2.1&id=1

sure, this doesn't capture everything, but i suspect these filters are
tuned more for what they want to discard (p2p movie and warez traffic,
that'd eliminate quite a chunk, right?) than for what they want to
inspect.  (that is, what they want to inspect is everything they don't
consider useless and filter out)

on a side note, the recent interference in the Sourcefire and Check
Point merger makes you wonder, doesn't it?  what kind of
classification systems is the government using from Sourcefire that is
so sensitive it must be US owned?

they don't get to play on the equipment.  they only get to splice a fiber to it.

you can buy these kinds of high capacity hardware filtering /
classifying systems but they are insanely expensive.  like
http://www.cloudshield.com/ for example.
