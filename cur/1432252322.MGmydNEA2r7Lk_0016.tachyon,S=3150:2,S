A timely piece given the lock down in Chicago to host the NATO summit,  
where discussion will cover the Alliance Ground Surveillance project's  
acquisition of five Global Hawk UAVs to perform persistent surveillance  
(via link in article).

Nice one:

/But beyond being of dubious legitimacy under international law, the use  
of [drone] technologies may be counter-productive. In Pakistan, Somalia,  
and Yemen, unmanned planes are being flown by the CIA -- an organization  
that clearly lacks the military's culture and training in international  
humanitarian law.
