Sounds like the same DNA computing that Adleman was doing several years 
ago.

Also sounds like the same Ehud Shapiro who used to do some good work in 
Flat Concurrent Prolog (FCP), a model for much of the work in Joule and 
E.

A good thing the Department of Hype was brought in to co-author the 
scientific press releases.
