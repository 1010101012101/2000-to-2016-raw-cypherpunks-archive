I actually think there's lots of oppurtunity here, with many online
services actually... to win by doing things better in a way that
serves the users, not primarily the company. There's money in that.

re CL: Afaik there's no patent or trademark on classifieds or 'community'
moderation. You could win simply by doing that, not pissing off your
users by ghosting (aka stating why your rejection happened), and
say umm not silently dropping in/out bound mail, and not trying to play
nanny mail relay. Non agnostic or faulty delivery liability anyone?

By the way, did you know CL has and does archive every post (and
quite probably every image and email) since inception in MongoDB?
Want to know their reason? Supposed regulatory compliance and
'Oh, our users might want to repost an ad'. Really? From a month
ago, a year ago, ten years ago? Bullshit. They're needless data
whores acting against you.

Anyway, that's off Tor topic. But I will restate my request for
blocking policy/implementation info, rationale, and discussion,
for any internet service really, whether on or off list.
