I proposed some very simple additions to X.509 which would allow you to use the
certs in the same way as PGP keys a year or two back.  Unfortunately the PKIX
WG chair is about as open to PGP-style additions to X.509 as some PGP people
are towards S/MIME.

(You can also do PGP using X.509 certs, I've been doing that for awhile just
 out of sheer bloody-mindedness :-).
