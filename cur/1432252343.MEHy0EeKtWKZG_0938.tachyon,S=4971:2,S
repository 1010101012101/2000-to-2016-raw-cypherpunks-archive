Ah, yes, traffic analysis, context analysis.  Good stuff.  There are
ways around this problem.  Solving the traffic analysis involves
having a lot of mixmasters out there.  Sad that there aren't more.

It also depends on how circumstantial versus how hard said evidence
is.  Sure, if you're reccomending your favorite dope dealer to
someone else, it doesn't matter how they found out that you are the
infamous B34r "McVeigh" Phr3@k4z01d, they can get you on a possession
rap.

Been there, done that. See Medusa's Tentacles from ye ol'e Detweiler
wars:

(Just got it back from google.  Search for other medusa1b.zip if that
link is 404.)

Feel free to take my code and update it to something more useful than
the brainfart that it was. :)
