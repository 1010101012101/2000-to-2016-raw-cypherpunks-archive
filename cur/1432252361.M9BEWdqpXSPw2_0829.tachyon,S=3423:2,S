Interfaces matter.  You need mathematical bones; engineering muscle;

wires, code, gummint velveeta is free.  Will is expensive. Gutenburg.  
Smith.  Ford.  Moore.  Postel. Steam engines were neat.  Steam engines 
pulling trains were amazing. Computers were neat.  Computers networked 
were amazing. Warning grunts are useful. The ability of a charistmatic 
speaker to fuck with your head is disastrous.
