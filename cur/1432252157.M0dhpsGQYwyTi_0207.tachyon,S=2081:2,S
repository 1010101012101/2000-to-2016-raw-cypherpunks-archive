THz EM radiation only has a (relatively shallow) penetration depth for
clothes, plastic, wood, sand and soil.

It might do to detect a ceramics knife on a person through clothes, or for
(say, skin cancer) diagnostics, but it will only pick up an explosive spectrum
if
it's wrapped in paper/cardboard/plastic foil, or not wrapped at all.

Looking for nitrogen doesn't cover all explosives, but most of them.
