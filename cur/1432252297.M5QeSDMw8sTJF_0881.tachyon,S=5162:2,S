Spies like us: NSA to build huge facility in Utah

Civilian jobs ; The facility could offer more than 1,000 high-tech jobs for
the state.

Hoping to protect its top-secret operations by decentralizing its massive
computer hubs, the National Security Agency will build a
1-million-square-foot data center at Utah's Camp Williams.

The years-in-the-making project, which may cost billions over time, got a
$181 million start last week when President Obama signed a war spending bill
in which Congress agreed to pay for primary construction, power access and
security infrastructure. The enormous building, which will have a footprint
about three times the size of the Utah State Capitol building, will be
constructed on a 200-acre site near the Utah National Guard facility's
runway.

Congressional records show that initial construction -- which may begin this
year -- will include tens of millions in electrical work and utility
construction, a $9.3 million vehicle inspection facility, and $6.8 million in
perimeter security fencing. The budget also allots $6.5 million for the
relocation of an existing access road, communications building and training
area.

Officials familiar with the project say it may bring as many as 1,200
high-tech jobs to Camp Williams, which borders Salt Lake, Utah and Tooele
counties.

It will also require at least 65 megawatts of power -- about the same amount
used by every home in Salt Lake City combined. A separate power substation
will have to be built at Camp Williams to sustain that demand, said Col.
Scott Olson, the Utah National Guard's legislative liaison.  Advertisement He
noted that there were two significant power corridors that ran though Camp
Williams -- a chief factor in the NSA's desire to build there.

The NSA bills itself as the home of America's codemakers and codebreakers,
but the Department of Defense agency is perhaps better known for its signals
intelligence program, which is reported to have the capacity to tap into a
significant amount of the world's communications. The agency also has been
the subject of significant criticism by civil libertarians, who have accused
it of unwarranted monitoring of the communications of U.S. citizens.

The NSA's heavily automated computerized operations have for years been based
at Fort Meade, Maryland, but the agency began looking to decentralize its
efforts following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Propelling that desire was the insatiable energy appetite of the agency's
computers. In 2006, the Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA -- Baltimore Gas
& Electric's biggest customer -- had maxed out the local grid and could not
bring online several supercomputers it needed to expand its operations.

About the same time, NSA officials, who have a long-standing relationship
with Utah based on the state Guard's unique linguist units, approached state
officials about finding land in the state on which to build an additional
data center.

Olson said NSA officials also seemed drawn to Utah's increasing reputation as
a center of technical industry and the area's more traditional role as a
transportation hub.

"They were looking at secure sites, where there could be a natural nexus
between organizations and where space was available," he said. "The stars
just kind of came into alignment. We could provide them everything they
need."

The agency is building a similar center in San Antonio at the site of a
former Sony microchip plant.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving member of the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, refused to answer questions about the project. Officials
from Hatch's office said they were not at liberty to discuss a classified
matter, though it is referenced in several public documents and has been
spoken about openly by state officials for the past week.

NSA officials also declined to comment immediately on the project, but
pledged to answer questions later this week.
