FORMER INS GUARD AT FEDERAL DETENTION FACILITY
PLEADS GUILTY TO SEXUAL ACT WITH FEMALE DETAINEE MIAMI, FL. --
The Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department announced today that 
Clarence Parker, a former guard at the Krome Service Processing Center 
(Krome) in Miami, Florida, pled guilty today to knowingly engaging in, and 
attempting to engage in a sexual act with a female detainee at Krome in 
October 2000.  "As soon as we learned of the possible actions of this 
individual, we immediately removed him from Krome," said INS Acting 
District Director John M. Bulger. "The investigation went forward with our 
full support.  Our commitment to removing and prosecuting anyone who 
commits these types of acts is stronger than ever." For the past three 
years, Parker was a contract employee with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service at Krome.  Parker was assigned to the attorney 
visiting area where he monitored the detainees who were waiting to visit 
with their attorneys.  As a result of the investigation, Parker was 
suspended in June 2001. Parker's plea was accepted by the Honorable 
Federico A. Moreno, United States District Judge for the Southern District 
of Florida.  His sentencing for the conviction is scheduled for
December 20, 2001.  This matter is being handled by Trial Attorney Scott 
Dahl of the Public Integrity Section.  The investigation is being conducted 
by Department's Office of Inspector General in Ft. Lauderdale and by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation's Miami Office.  ### 01-551
