Just because they're wrong and you're right doesn't benefit you at all
when you are in jail for contempt, losing your ass-cherry.  The belief
to the contrary is what M. Unicorn would call a "classic Cypherpunk
fallacy".  M. Unicorn is absolutely right here.  Trusts are a great
thing which, in this case, allow you to completely achieve what you're
trying to achieve, while complying all of the court's instructions.
Use them!  Why waste time being an outlaw?
