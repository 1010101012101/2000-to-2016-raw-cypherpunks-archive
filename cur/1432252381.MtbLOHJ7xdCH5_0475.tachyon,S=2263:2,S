Hey

The project has been moved to the other team. This means that this one
is put on hold
to avoid potential litigations. This has several implications with one
of them being that
this version of the driver is no longer developed in public. The other
is that the documentation
is being written for atheros hardware and the other teams is
developing the new version of
the driver so you have to be a bit patient right now.

kind regards,
Mateusz
