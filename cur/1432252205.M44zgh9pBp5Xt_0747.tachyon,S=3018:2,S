There are two separate things going on there -
half of that money is for fixing New York;
the other half is for getting revenge on Bush's Enemies List
and letting the Military-Industrial Complex go kill people
so that the Americans believe Bush Is Not A Wimp.

Bush has been somewhat milder than the more rabid Congresscritters,
but some of that's just the basic Bell Curve plus media behavior -
with 500+ of them, you'd expect the more extreme to sound
fairly extremist, and you'd expect the media to cover the extremists.
