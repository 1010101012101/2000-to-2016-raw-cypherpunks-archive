"Then what are
you doing here?  This list is for discussing and implementing cypherpunk
concepts.  If you deny them, you should go elsewhere to pursue your goals."

Tsk tsk...this sounds like Orthodoxy to me. Part of the benefit of an 
anarchy is to support otherwise-suppressed forms of existence and states of 
mind. If Variola can't at least suggest these ideas here, then Cypherpunks 
has become Cypherfacist.

While I personally still believe that Crypto and other technologies will be 
enough ("The meek shall inherit the earth"), that's by no means obvious yet. 
Variola and May and others are the little nagging voices that force one to 
consider whether physical measures will be necessary and/or called for.
