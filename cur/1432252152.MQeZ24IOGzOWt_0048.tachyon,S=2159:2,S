Twitter is accessible via Tor; they have done nothing to block it. Or am
I misunderstanding your question?

Unless you plan to follow protected accounts, you don't need to actually
sign up for a Twitter account to keep up with anyone. Each Twitter
account has an RSS feed for that account, which does not need
authentication with a Twitter account to access.

Interesting note: not that long ago, Twitter actually used your
authentication info against you and obstructed attempts to read single
tweets from accounts that had you blocked, and for a while even the
entire feed of accounts blocking you. They have since given up their
pathetic attempt to imitate Facebook's (dangerously overpowered, IMO)
block function.
