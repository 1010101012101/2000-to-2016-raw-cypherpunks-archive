   Never tried it with USB, but use autofs a lot -- look at your
/etc/auto.master and /etc/auto.misc files. I use

 "crypt        -fstype=reiserfs :/dev/loop0" 

in /etc/auto.misc to automount an encrypted loop device. The user that owns that
filesystem can just cd to it and it mounts automagically, to others it's not
even there. That is, there's nothing in the /misc/ dir until I cd into
/misc/crypt and it self unmounts if you aren't in it for so long, however long
you set the timeout for. You have to have already run the losetup for the loop
device, of course, and all that. 
   Autofs works fine for automounting floppys and pccards as well, don't know
why it wouldn't work for USB drives. Getting it to run a shell script when
mounted shouldn't be that hard.
