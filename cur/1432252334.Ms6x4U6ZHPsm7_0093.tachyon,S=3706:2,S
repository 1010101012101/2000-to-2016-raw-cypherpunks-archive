a kinder, gentler, black unicorn?
fuck that.

i have been on this list some six years. with some very rare exceptions 
unicorn's posts have been basically spot on every time i have seen 
them. and unless you are totally humor braindead they manage to combine 
good info with laugh out loud commentary. if it is at someones expense 
it is only so in a classy way. and they were pretty certain to be 
asking for it out loud anyway. wise up. it is the same 8 people 
constantly trying to derail the best content in this place with nothing 
but bullshit smoke and mirrors. it is the same 8 people constantly 
providing quality content in this place that they can actually back up 
with facts. we are lucky to have unicorn, broiles, farr, may, etc here. 
its assholes like jim choate that drive out only decent contributers 
and flood the list with 20+ useless url posts a day. ever wonder why 
people like eric hughes and john gilmore never seem to post much 
anymore?

black gelding?
i want that about as much as i want mister rogers defending me against 
a charge on one of these issues.

here are some alphabet blocks. why dont you go turn barney back on now 
so the adults can get back to business.
