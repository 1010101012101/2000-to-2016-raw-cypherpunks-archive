Public Meeting Announcing a Workshop for the Analysis of Modes of
Operation for Symmetric Key Block Cipher Algorithms

AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce.

ACTION: Notice of public workshop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
announces a workshop on modes of operation for securing data using
symmetric key block cipher algorithms, such as the algorithm specified
in the draft Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Interested parties may
suggest ideas or submit papers for discussion at the workshop,
including proposals of modes of operation, to the address below.

DATES: The Second Modes of Operation Workshop will be held on August
24, 2001, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

ADDRESSES: The workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn Santa Barbara,
5650 Calle Real, Goleta, California. Details regarding workshop
registration will be available at the modes home page: http://
csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/modes/. Suggestions, questions, comments
or submissions should be sent to Modes of Operation Workshop, Attn:
Elaine Barker, NIST, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8930, Gaithersburg, MD
20899-8930, or to EncryptionModes@nist.gov.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, contact
EncryptionModes@nist.gov or one of the following: Elaine Barker, NIST,
100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8930, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8930; telephone
301-975-2911; fax 301-948-1233 or via e-mail at Elaine.barker@nist.gov;
or Morris Dworkin 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 8930, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-
8930; telephone 301-975-2354; fax 301-948-1233; or via e-mail at
morris.dworkin@nist.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Block ciphers can be used as building blocks
for encryption modes and for other modes for securing data. For
example, block ciphers can be used in the construction of message
authentication codes, hash algorithms, and random bit generators. With
the advent of new block ciphers, such as the AES, there is an
opportunity to update such modes of operation for current and future
applications and technology.
     The purpose of this Federal Register notice is to announce a
workshop on modes of operation for securing data using symmetric key
block cipher algorithms, such as the algorithm specified in the draft
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Prior to the workshop, suggestions
and submissions from the public to aid NIST in planning an appropriate
workshop and facilitate the comparison and analysis of block cipher
modes of operation are welcome. The workshop will aid NIST in
developing a standard or guideline that is secure and responsive to the
needs of government, industry, and the public. NIST will consider for
discussion at the workshop, at a minimum, the modes that were proposed
at the October 20, 2000 public workshop on this topic. These are
available at the modes home page, and NIST encourages public analysis
of these modes.
     The workshop may also consider other existing modes or their
generalizations, or other modes that are proposed in comments and
papers. It will be helpful to receive analysis and proposals for
variations of counter mode, arising from alternative methods for
prescribing the generation of counters. All suggestions received will
be publicly available at the modes home page.
     In order to encourage a common framework for comparison, a workshop
approach to evaluate and analysis is available on the modes home page.
NIST believes that participants in the upcoming workshop would be
interested in comments that include statements regarding the
intellectual property and/or licensing requirements of any proposed
modes. Test vectors will also be useful, to provide analyzers of the
modes a means to check the validity of their implementations. Fuller
descriptions are available at the modes web site.
     The results of the workshop will aid NIST's efforts to develop a
complete ``suite'' of modes of operation from which individual modes
can be selected to fit the needs of a wide range of applications and
environments. The recommended modes are expected to support the
eventual Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other block ciphers.
     Submissions for discussion at the workshop should be made early
enough to provide time to prepare the meeting agenda. Papers proposing
new modes of operation are requested as soon as possible, to provide
time for the analysis of the new proposals.

     Authority: NIST's activities to develop computer security
standards to protect sensitive (unclassified) systems are undertaken
pursuant to specific responsibilities assigned to NIST in section
