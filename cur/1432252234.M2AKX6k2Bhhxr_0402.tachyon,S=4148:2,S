The archives, or a search engine, will turn up many past discussions 
we've had of face recognition and biometrics.

One of the interesting things is that _ear shape_ is one of the best 
correlation features.

Of course, to measure ear shape the camera has to have a good view, 
unobscured and at close enough range to get a decent number of 
pixels.  (This makes sense, that ear shape would be a good metric. 
I've been noticing the variations in ear shapes since I heard about 
this scheme. Also, I can imagine the various conformal 
transformations--different angles of view, for example--preserve 
certain relationships well.)

I can believe some kind of automated face recognition is being done 
with points of entry, such as international airport arrival points, 
but I find it hard to swallow that "crowd shots" from overhead 
cameras can do anything meaningful.

The Tampa action may be mostly social engineering: "We're watching you!"
