Cypherpunks often think of Crypto as the state-killing technology which
will free us all from the clutches of inculcation in the collectivist
mentality.

It should be noted, however, that advances in complexity theory or quantum
computing that would render cryptography useless, would also have a
detrimental effect on the state apparatus.

So I pose a question.  You have two boxes.  In the first is crypto so
powerful that it will keep peoples data safe for 1000 years, against all
advances in mathematics, with perfect forward secrecy.

In box number two is technology that will break any crypto designed by
mankind in the next 1000 years.

You are allowed to take the contents of one of the boxes, and publish it
on the Internet.  You wish to do maximum damage to the state, free the
Sheeple, enable Tim's libertopian vision of the future, crush totalitarian
centralized government, and make the world safe for flowers and other
living things.

Which box do you pick?  And why?
