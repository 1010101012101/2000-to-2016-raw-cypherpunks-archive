I'm not sure your question is meaningful.  It's sort of like, "can God make
a rock so heavy he can't lift it?"

Well, contrary to the Subject, Choate's, assertions, the common law PRECEDED
the Constitution and was implicitly incorporated therein (as shown by the
Subject, Choate's, own recitation of the appropriate Constitutional
clauses).  So, in a sense, I guess you would be right in saying that the
Constitution is a part of the common law.
