Assasination politics was originally proposed for saddam,wasnt it?
After several months of hard work and 1 arrest/computor confiscation(no 
charges)
Operation soft drill just received what I believe was genuine pledge,this 
occured just prior to doomsday.
The pledge was for the retirement of richard armitage,btw.
Now its hung for shagging a sheep as a lamb time. Big time.
I pledge 1$ for the closest prediction of the permanent retirement from 
politics of the honourable osama bin laden.
The SS know where I live,so Im your canary in this coal mine.
How about a little anon(of course)backup.I know your not all not plastic 
anarchists.
And the US is a paper tiger.
