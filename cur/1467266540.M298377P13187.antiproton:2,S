Yes, far more papers than implementations. Once you have something that
works well enough, or that people are at least so convinced, new ideas
don't attract much interest. But maybe that's changing now.

Why did Tor go with circuit switching? Was it mostly about efficiency?
We have a very different Internet now. Also, is it easier to bury packet
switching in chaff?

Which ones, in particular?

With global active adversaries, which can observe and modify packets on
every public network, it's hard to imagine how substantive [anonymity |
unlinkability | deniability | privacy] is possible. Sure, every node
might send traffic that's not provably nonrandom to every other node at
constant rate. But it's still obvious that you're up to something. And
once they tweak your traffic, they can look at what other nodes start
behaving differently. So I come back to the need for covert channels.

Maybe so. But many of them tend to keep to themselves ;)
