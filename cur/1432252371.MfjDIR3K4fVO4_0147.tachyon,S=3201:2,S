"WASHINGTON (Routers News Service) Because of false alarms involving the 
confectioner's sugar on powdered donuts, sale of so-called "assault 
donuts" will henceforth be restricted to law enforcement officers. "Cops 
have always been the largest consumers of donuts, this just makes them 
the _only_ legal purchaser of this particular kind of donut," said 
Department of Donuts spokesman Ring Annulus."
