I'm not sure he gets the sarcasm :-)

Speaking of power grabs, I just sent a 4 page letter to my senator on the
Judiciary committee on S.2048 - the bill to make A/D converters test for
copyright notice.  We can't stop power grabs, but we can at least educate
clueless politicians.  Probably won't change anything, but at least we can
try!

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
