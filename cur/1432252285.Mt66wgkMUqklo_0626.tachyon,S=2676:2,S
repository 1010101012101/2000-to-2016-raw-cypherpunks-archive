The "cannot even make" is patently offensive; why do nitration when what
you
need is around?  And how many Americans could wire a Casio or Nokia
to a det cap on their own?

Obviously the US mil industrial machine is not the weak link.

Say 10 years from now, the dead marine count is in the high 5 figures,
(perhaps they are drafted), there's more snuff-videos than porn on the
web, the US *will* give up and leave, and the Jihad LLC will have won.

10 years, 20 years, whatever.   Persistance works.  And the martyrs
enjoy
the virgins, at best the infidels play harps and fly around the clouds,
yawn.

I'll see your IED and raise you Brittney's belly-button.
