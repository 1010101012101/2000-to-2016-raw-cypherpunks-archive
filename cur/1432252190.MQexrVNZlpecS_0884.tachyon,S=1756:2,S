How much do the "spread spectrum clock" feature on the modern motherboards 
help here?

Not necessarily. There are other ways of heat transfer. A good way could 
be water cooling for transport of the heat from the CPU and other parts to 
a massive metal heatsink that's the part of the case, with an optional fan 
on its outside. Voila, water cooling is not only for case mod freakz 
anymore.

solve this?
