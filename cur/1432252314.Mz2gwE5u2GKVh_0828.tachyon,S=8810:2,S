I don't run a mixmaster because:
  - its not been easy to get running
  - it uses SMTP ports which are filtered on my AT&T cable system.  The 
remailer reference lists need to include port number references so users on 
these "restricted" ISPs can participate.  Since the traffic is encrypted it 
might make sense for operators to choose port numbers used by P2P 
applications which currently encrypt traffic (I believe Morpheus does).
  - it didn't run under Windows (until the other day)

There needs to be an automated way to anonymously and securely determine if 
your messages have gotten stuck at a particular remailer.

I won't run an exit remailer because of the obvious risks  Does Ian G's 
Hotmail exit code still work?  Is this practical?

The only client I frequently used was Geoff Keating's Java applet.  It was 
excellent and simple.  Has anyone looked into freshening it up?
