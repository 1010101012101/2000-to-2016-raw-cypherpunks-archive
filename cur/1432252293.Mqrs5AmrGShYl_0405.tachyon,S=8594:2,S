I could see this as being a good strategy if you didn't declare it, but by
eliminating vowels you reduce the search space.

It's only a good tactic if people actually switching from using dictionary
words to using something with higher entropy. More likely though, you'll
start to see things like 'bbbddq' or 'cmplt sntnce,' and the users will
still be susceptible to dictionary attacks.

It's important to remember that a good dictionary attack has a dictionary
that is much larger than a list of words in different languages, it also
has common patterns. This sort of restraint probably reduces the usage of
dictionary words but increases the usage of other common patterns.

I don't like it.

Subject: [Dailydave] Don&#39;t use vowels in passwords!<br>
<br>
According to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), you shouldn=
&#39;t use vowels in your password!<br>
<br>
The DFAS web site <a href=3D"http://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil" target=3D"_blan=
k">myinvoice.csd.disa.mil</a> is instituting new password requirements star=
ting tomorrow. The details can be found at the site (if you&#39;re willing =
to read a PDF hosted by DOD that is).<br>

<br>
DFAS brings us two significant improvements to password/PIN security by for=
bidding the use of vowels, and requiring that password/PINs be EXACTLY 15 c=
haracters long (no more, no less). I&#39;d guess that the first requirement=
 is to prevent people from using dictionary words. The second requirement i=
s probably due to some obscure issue with their use of an Oracle Java front=
-end.<br>

<br>
This is from a web site that until recently ( and I believe still does) req=
uired the use of IE and Java 6. Logging in use to require clicking through =
no less than 3-4 security warning pop-ups.<br>
