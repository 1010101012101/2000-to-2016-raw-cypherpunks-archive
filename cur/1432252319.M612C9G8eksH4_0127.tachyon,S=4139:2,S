* Kiwi Cops Pay To Access Encrypted Phone Calls

Police in New Zealand will pay Vodafone NZ$1.1 million to be
allowed access to encrypted cell phone calls.

According to Stuff.co.nz, the Crimes Act in New Zealand already
allows the police to intercept phone calls, but they can't
decipher the encrypted calls made on the Vodafone network.

Paul Swain, the communications minister, said that the money had
been allocated for the deal, which was expected to be completed
in a few weeks.

Meanwhile, the New Zealand police forces are outraged that they
have to foot the bill. The president of the Police Association,
Greg O'Connor, complained that in the US and Australia the
responsibility lies with the service provider to give the police
access to calls.

"In New Zealand it doesn't happen. In New Zealand the
telecommunications companies are creaming it off police," he
said.

COMMENT: Why should the telecommunications companies foot the
bill?  They are not in the business of providing freebies to the
State.  Government agencies should pay for special services just
like anyone else.

The New Zealand law is much more fair than corresponding
legislation in the US and Australia.
