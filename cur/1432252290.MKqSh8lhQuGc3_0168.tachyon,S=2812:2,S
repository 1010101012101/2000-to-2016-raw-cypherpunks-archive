I see a small sign, with 3 lines of text. The middle row reads "DNS" pretty
clearly. The bottom appears to be "ROOT" . The top row is 4  characters.
I think the last three are "ASD" or "ASE". I think it may say BASE or CASE

So, one interpretation is 

BASE
DNS
ROOT

but I'm far from certain about the first word. To bad the guy 
didn't get closer.
