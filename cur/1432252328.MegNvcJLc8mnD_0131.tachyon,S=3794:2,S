>From reading the docs at EPIC, it is not clear that the FBI actually
got data from the planted device. The USA application dated June 8 
asks for a supplemental order of extension of time in order to break 
in and remove the device. This need was caused by Scarfo's unexpected
removal of the equipment.

We have not been presented with the initial USA application and the
initial order, at least not that I've seen.

Interesting possibilities are:

1. The FBI is bluffing that it got incriminating data and is using the
applications and orders as window dressing or camouflage to
hide their failure. Or to hide that they got evidence some other
way.

2. The FBI captured some stuff but is faking the rest.

3. Scarfo discovered the device, or suspected it, and removed the 
equipment in order to sanitize it, or even planted his own device 
aimed at the feds. Say he rigged a program to endlessly type "fuck you,"
Or played Bin Laden's taunts. He's a fair comp whiz so all sorts of
good stuff may have happened.

4. If Scarfo got the device, by now defenses against it have been
deployed, maybe even generated a tidy black market for those who
want to snoop and/or snarl the feds by redirecting their own devices.
