This is not strictly correct.  The payer can reveal the blinding
factor, making the payment traceable.  I believe Chaum deliberately
chose for one-way untraceability (untraceable by the payee but not by
the payer) in order to address concerns such as blackmailing,
extortion, etc.  The protocol can be modified to make it fully
untraceable, but that's not how it is designed.

Apart from the transferability issue, I think there are some systems
that do not rely on an issuer at all (in effect any payee is an
issuer).  Manasse's Millicent comes to mind, but I confess that I
don't fully remember the details.
