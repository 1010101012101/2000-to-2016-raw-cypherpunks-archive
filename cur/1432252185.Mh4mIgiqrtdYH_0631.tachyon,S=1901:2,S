You're mixing up assassinating a president with
treason performed for revenge and crude political gain.

It's only impeachable if Bush knew and couldn't justify
his lack of response as executive privilege.
I'd assume his handlers have a standing agreement of
plausible deniability for that sort of thing.

As far as prosecutable goes, it'd sure be fun to watch,
unless of course there's another runaway bride
or dead puppy or somebody burns a flag on July 4th
or the comet blows up real good
or whatever else it takes to distract the public for 15 minutes.
