It sounds like a slam-dunk violation of the Eighth, as a life prison
sentence for civil disobedience is definitely a "cruel and unusual"
punishment.

As for punishing the legislators; since the constitution applies only
to government entities, I propose that those who introduced, sponsored
and voted for this bill be tortured and killed by private citizens.

After that's done, we can get started on slaughtering the Portland pigs
who steal people's cars.
