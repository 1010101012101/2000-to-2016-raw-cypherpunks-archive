Without the ability to (untraceably, unlinkably, of course) verify that  
this vote is "in the vote total," and that no votes other than those  
who actually voted, are in the vote total, this is all meaningless.

I could rig a simple hack where a voter submits his ballot, which drops  
into a shredder even as a little printer is printing out his "proof"  
that he voted and that his vote was "accepted."

It's blather to satisfy the sheeple.

Besides, I expect what will happen is that an electronic voting system  
will be deployed and will be shut down by someone claiming a patent was  
issued to them "for the idea of electronic voting."

Until Diebold pays off the Patent Office and the earlier idea is  
reviewed and found lacking.

Face it, we are about to become an electronic kleptocracy.

(There will also be some good hacks to scare the inner city welfare  
mutants into thinking the electronic machines will either track their  
votes, making them more likely to vote for the Establishment, or will  
steal their souls. I sense great possibilities here for  
disinformation.)
