In all of the Snowden docs that have been released so far, has anybody seen
any mention of any NSA programs designed to subvert compilers?

Compilers seems like an extremely prime target for manipulation, but as far
as I am aware there hasn't been anything mentioned about this yet. Has
anybody here heard anything that I haven't?
