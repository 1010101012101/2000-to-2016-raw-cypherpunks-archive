Metadata wise this is a real problem with the system as currently 
envisaged, but would frankly apply to any hosted-ciphertext platform.

This is correct; Peerio uses MiniLock under the hood for crypto, and 
private keys for minilock are generated deterministically; when you "log 
out" the key is not stored permanently (although JS can't wipe RAM so a 
closer-to-metal client would be nice).

They're in free beta, my understanding is they'll charge for storage. 
There's not much that can be done to wind back the crypto as it's all 
client-side, and if their server were shut down, as I've mentioned 
before, the server behaviour is all documented on Github.

One useful way to look at this: GPG is what most recommend for crypto, 
but it's metadata rich and requires usually closed platforms to 
distribute ciphertexts (you may not use Yahooglesoft but your recipients 
will usually). In recent discussions on this list, the use of a 
centralised key distribution *company*, keybase, has also been accepted 
to some extent (though I'm not too happy..).

miniLock is designed as a spiritual descendent of PGP with many use-case 
improvements and a much simpler threat model. You can use miniLock 
instead of GPG across email, and it will leak less metadata than GPG by 
virtue of using ephemeral keys that don't directly link a message to its 
sender or recipients.

Peerio is like Gmail plus Keybase for miniLock; it serves exactly those 
purposes. We would all (me emphatically included) rather if it ran on a 
store/forward PGP mixnet, provided it retained good UX to appeal to the 
masses, but right now, it's a centralised service that hides the content 
and format of communications while unavoidably having total access to 
the metadata of from who, to whom, and when.

So yea, centralised and closed ain't good. They are the warts I'd like 
to see fixed with a federated and/or mixed backend. But the frontend is 
just as open as GPG is, and we already generally endorse the use of open 
front-ends to work around closed back-ends.

I may be motivated soon to re-implement miniLock in Go as a learning 
excercise (still a Golang noob here), in which case it could be a short 
hop from there to a server/client implementation for Peerio, too. But, 
I'm not committed to that yet and have written not an `iota` of code 
yet, so by all means beat me to it.
