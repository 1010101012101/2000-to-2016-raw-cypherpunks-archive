Bait and switch is probably not the right term.  Let me think
of a better term.  How about fraud.  Promising voters special
favors if he is elected.  But thats the Hatch Act violation and
I digress.

I would say, 'case law be damned'.  A guy who doesn't exist
can't take office.  If he doesn't take office, he can't
be replaced.  You are assuming that the bulk of the people
who voted for Carnahan actually voted for anyone who is
a Democrat -- and that might well be so. But I doubt the
Federal Election Commision will think much of a ballot
where 'you vote Democratic -- we'll fill in the blank'
is a legitimate vote.

I would say the same for any 'candidate', but they Republican,
Democrat, Libertarian or Dead.
