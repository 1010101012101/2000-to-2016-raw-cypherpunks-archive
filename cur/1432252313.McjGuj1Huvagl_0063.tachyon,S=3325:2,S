It is important that Felton win his case. What I wonder is even if he
does will the courts create only a very narrow exception for
credentialed scientists working at recognized institutions? As far as
I'm concerned anyone who is curious, learns something and wants to
publish should have the same rights as a prof at any university. So even
if he wins the battle is far from over.
