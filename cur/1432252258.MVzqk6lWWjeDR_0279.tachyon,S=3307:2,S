So the moral of the story is...

If you want to destroy the potential barrel you'll need to:

-	Have replacement barrels purchased in a non-traceable manner.

-	Have some mechanism to brush or scratch the inside of the barrel,

-	Apply a corrosive and allow it to thin the barrel significantly.

-	Then twist barrel and heat until red hot.

-	Then handle with non-metallic tools only until discarded.
