Theory-wise, a Turing-complete system can emulate any other turing complete system unless the emulatee has an ace up its sleeve; something unique to the hardware that canot be simulated without breaking authenticity.

This is probably only *theoretically* possible with quantum computation, but it's *practically* possible with tamperproof hardware: TCMs used for good instead of evil, maybe?
