Yes, so again this will be described in more detail in the white
paperI am working on, but the general idea is that each sender
maintains alist of all messages they have sent, which has a version
numberassociated with it in the Rhizome Manifest file.  If a
recipientalready has that version of the file, then it doesn't refetch
it.Else, it refetches the file.  We have a mechanism we have planned
butnot yet implemented where only the new part of the file gets
fetched,and also that expires the old part of the file that contains
alreadydelivered messages, together working to minimise network
traffic.

So what happens here (or rather is planned, and being implementednow),
is that the recipients phone may issue a receipt that spreads inthe
same way as the original message. When the sender gets thereceipt,
they know the message was delivered, which also means thatthey can
advance the beginning point in their message log to excludethe
received message (assuming there are no others before it that arestill
pending).  That goes out in the form of an updated manifest fromthe
sender.  When the recipient sees this new manifest that doesn'tinclude
the original message, it can deduce that the message receiptwas
acknowledged, and it can advance it's starting point in itsmessage
file in the same way.  All this means that after a message isreceived,
it will phase out from being carried by devices on the mesh.
We are also planning various scope limiting features to stop
messagesflooding too far or for too long.
Paul.
