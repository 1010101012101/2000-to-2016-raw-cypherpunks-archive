From: mattd <mattd@useoz.com> AT FIRST FAUSTINE WASN'T SURE ABOUT THIS HUGE 
DILDO BUT SHE ONLY NEEDED A
LITTLE BIT OF CONVINCING. WE LUBED IT UP WITH HER WET PUSSY AND SHE
WAS BEGGING FOR IT IN HER TIGHT LITTLE ASSHOLE... WE COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
DEEP SHE TOOK IT!
BUT SHE LOVED EVERY INCH AND THEN WANTED MORE!
DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE GIRLS LIKE  FAUSTINE?<<

Looks like you got all the puritans and we got all the criminals eh! (you 
are a septic tank,I take it.)

If you go back a little further you'll see that I attempted to engage with 
agent faustine on her pet subjects.
Subject non resposive,seems to have a "hard on" for Timmy boy.

So I was experimenting with different ways to tickle her fancy? So What? 
Different strokes.Thanks for prolonging the subject line.All Punks should 
know what a Hoe McCato head is.
