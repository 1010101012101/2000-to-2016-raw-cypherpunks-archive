I just checked the Florida site, 
http://www.absenteeballot.net/Florida.htm, and found no mention 
whatsoever of requirements that someone witness the process, etc.

However, I _did_ find this interesting language:

"Marked ballots must be mailed or delivered in person reaching the 
supervisor of elections' office not later than 7 p.m. on the day of 
the election."

So, what's with this business about the absentee ballots coming in 
until Friday, November 17th?
