I have never programmed in VB, though I have written machine code.
Nowadays I do my work in Perl with some C and am quite happy. 

That said, I suspect you can craft some useful programs in VB, and if it
speeds development time without greatly influencing running time, why not
do it? I'm too cranky to get religious about these things any more.
