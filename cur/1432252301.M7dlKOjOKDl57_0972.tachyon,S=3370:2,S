Most of these things are SOCs based on standard 32-bit CPU's with
specialized peripherals for CCD, LCD, pixel processing. Often they're
using conventional RTOSes like VxWorks, pSOS, Nucleus. Most of them
include some mechanism for updating the application SW in FLASH. That's
where you might start disassembly. If the camera of interest is using an
SOC that is not proprietary you can probably get data sheets from the Si
manufacturer. They're definitely hackable. The BIG PROBLEM as with
everything else is how to find the time to do the fun stuff?

I think it would be cool to have a high quality CCD front end that could
be used as an add-on to an iPAQ. Use a microdrive for storage, store
everything in Bayer format(fast), do the post pocessing later or in the
background. An iPAQ could handle the control of a front end and you
could do whatever you want with the files.
