That the Internet is a gigantic spying machine has been known since
its invention, the security industry has made billions pretending to
protect against its surveillance.

Schneier has also written recently that security does not work,
cannot work, that attackers are always going to excell over defenders,
due to the economic incentives to attack being greater than those
to defend.

Long a top expert selling security services, what is Schneier up to
with gloom and doom that is usually associated with selling
snake oil -- his favorite target. Has his amply promoted 24x7 services
been defeated by attackers? Is he keeping that quiet? Is he about to
be doxed, has been hit with a blackmail demand, or worse, his
defenses compromised? Who else among the experts are colluding
with this initiative to admit Internet deception from the git go?

Recall that beloved Peter Neumann and others advocate chucking
the current Internet and starting over with better security and privacy
basic requirements. Uh huh, and what will take its place, will it be
better or more snake oil? And what to do with all that stored data
of the world's greatest spying machine promoted with the complicity
of Internet advocates and the security industry?

Pardon, monsieur, foxes in the hen house, comes to mind.

Schneier says in his security-is-doomed-to-fail piece a public discussion
is needed on what to do, the experts don't have answers. That's a good
start after years of experts promising to do better next time, meanwhile
trust open source, trust us.

Where does snake oil end and "something better" begin?
Is something better ever not snake oil? Is a public discussion
of an issue never not rigged in favor of the organizers? Is
tumultous public discussion never not preamble to a coup
justified as needed to control the mob who has gotten out
of hand, who voted the wrong way, who attacked the
leaders? Who hacked the experts?

Coups are always justified as needed for security, and who
Machiavelli's the coup masters other than security and
propaganda experts yearning to maintain privilege and
reputation.

Coups are not always obvious, the most effective are hardly
noticed.
