Not that much, if all you need to do is send a spliced copy over to your own 
undersea Optical Fiber Amplification node or undersea DWDM OADM.

As for the cable landings, likewise I've never heard anyone mention that 
they saw any government equipment at the landings, so I suspect it's 
relatively minimal. A the least, it's a splice over to the FDF (THAT they've 
seen). At the most, they have a card in the carrier's transport gear where 
they've dropped-and-continued some of the traffic.

I guess the question arises as to whether the FBI, for instance, shares it's 
network with the NSA.
