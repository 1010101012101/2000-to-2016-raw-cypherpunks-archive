I feel like cross posting , making a connection between those two lists

http://groups.google.com/group/global-survival
http://groups.google.com/group/building-a-distributed-decentralized-internet

sharing Poor Richard's post as context :

https://groups.google.com/d/topic/building-a-distributed-decentralized-internet/0VkN7ETmuIc/discussion

including comments on

and recent updates in relation to Netention prototypes :

Subject: Introducing Poor Richard to the list, and his vision for
"distributed database using semantic linked-data structure"
To: Poor Richard , global-survival@googlegroups.com


Hi Poor Richard,

I wish to introduce you to people on the global survival list ,
so that they can perhaps react and complete the approach currently taken.

You can find more on http://automenta.com  , including
http://automenta.com/netention
( netention - did Seth coin it ? - stands for a combination of "Network"
and "Attention" - code in development , released in a open / libre approach
by Seth and other coders on this list , with some various Prototypes shared
on http://blog.automenta.com/  )

And I wish to share with the list your following Facebook post and comments
:

 *I hope no one will mind if I indulge in a little visioneering here. I am
imagining an information system of P2P practice and research. The P2P
collaborative economy, free culture, and new commons movements are creating
a lot of digital content. Most is in discursive and narrative form that is
time consuming to read. Among this volume of content are case studies in a
variety of formats (many very informal), business plans, proposals, and
presumably many legal documents (charters, agreements, etc.).

I am imagining a semantic ontology according to which the key ideas and
data of this content could be parsed and tagged to form a distributed
database using semantic linked-data structures. This would help transition
the collective knowledge base of the research, activist, and social
entrepreneurial communities into a machine-readable, semantically linked,
searchable form.

The P2P Foundation Wiki is an excellent searchable resource, and perhaps
the semantic wiki extensions for the wiki engine could eventually be
applied. "A semantic wiki is a wiki that has an underlying model of the
knowledge described in its pages. Regular, or syntactic, wikis have
structured text and untyped hyperlinks. Semantic wikis, on the other hand,
provide the ability to capture or identify information about the data
within pages, and the relationships between pages, in ways that can be
queried or exported like a database."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Semantic_wiki<http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSemantic_wiki&h=jAQF0nKEbAQHQy7Ini6tbTKyUUQSzj5ViF1q4zsVBxLBuIQ&s=1>

A fringe benefit of creating such data structures for existing content
would be to provide common templates for future content creation and data
collection.*
 *Semantic wiki - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*
en.wikipedia.org
Asemantic wikiis awikithat has an underlyingmodel of the knowledgedescribed
in its pages. Regular, or syntactic, wikis have structured text and
untypedhyperlinks.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki>

"You should be able to easily select a view where all that information is
included."

"farther towards creating open linked-data structures"

"I am focused on the ontology design first, but perhaps there are tools
that cover both bases that I'm not aware of yet."

"Poor Richard <https://www.facebook.com/po.richard> Another part of the
"research information system" I am visioneering is pattern detection and
recognition. An ontology gives us set of semantically charged patterns.
Then what we need is a pattern language with which to parse existing
content and match it with our ontology. I am thinking of something like the
"regular expressions" used in the old unix text editors or in the Pearl and
Awk programming languages I once used.
http://encyclopedia.tfd.com/Regular+expressions "

to which I replied :

 this is a vision we share. Programming work has been on its way. I invite
you to have a look athttp://automenta.com/netention, and to join this list
https://groups.google.com/group/global-survival

I wish to share the following

A phrase from Seth I wish to share in this context :

*"I've explained to people that Netention is not just a product - but that
it refers to the evolution of human language into new semantic and
syntactical domains of higher expressiveness and effectiveness in
programming reality itself, not just software.  so anything that can help
this goal ought to be part of the project, as long as it doesn't complexify
it."*
