That was the initial perception. The NY Times had a report
yesterday about a pilot of one of the police choppers who 
described his futile rescue attempt -- he was on the scene
within ten minutes of the crash. The pilot said the smoke 
was blowing away from Tower 1 (the first hit) so there was a 
fair sized refuge for people to stand in any had accessed the 
roof. 

A thicket of antennas would have prevented landing but the pilot 
said there was a hoist onboard with a 200 foot cable capable of 
picking up people. A colleague was ready to descend to the roof 
to assist. Nobody came to the roof.

Another chopper hovered nearby to do the same. Other choppers
were on their way from Long Island but flights were cancelled
when it was reported nobody was on the roof.

The pilot said it was possible that at least a dozen or so
people could have been rescued before the collapse.

The pilot said at the 1993 bombing a cop was lowered to
cut away a wad of antennas so roof pickups could be made,
but that was too risky on 911.

The Times report said that only Los Angeles allows chopper
rescue from high rise buildings. Most fire departments believe
chopper rescue is too high risk and that exit by stairway is far 
safer. But in the light of WTC collapse fire departments are 
reviewing that prohibition.

The NY Fire Department, like many FDs, has no choppers,
and sees police choppers as scenewhores. Not as bad
as Sir Rudy and the Fire Commish but close.
