My point maybe didn't come across as clearly as it could (hey, even 
typing fast, it's a lot of work to make all points come out clearly, and 
the more I write, the more chance for unclear sections).

The core technologies for "P.E.T." are basically what we've talking 
about, coding, and using for close to the past 10 years. Little is 
coming out of corporations. Even less from academia.

More I started to write on this, but have deleted. If people want to 
hear the German academics talk about privacy technology, fine. Frankly, 
having been at my share of all-day Cypherpunks meetings, I doubt a 
1.5-day workshop on what are essentially Cypherpunks tools is going to 
accomplish much.

(What might? Putting several of the main architects of competing systems 
like Freedom, Mojo, Morpheus, Mixmaster, etc. together in a room with 
plenty of blackboards, a lot of beer, and some folks like Lucky, Wei 
Dai, Hal Finney, and others to hash out some of the tough issues and 
maybe catalyze some breakthroughs. Looking at the topics, I see the 
likely paper contributors will be academics and corporate 
ladder-climbers.)

This point you raise fits in closely with the names on the program list.

As with Financial Cryptography and Information-Hiding, the field has 
become sort of "respectable." So now we have the Dutch Data Protection 
Authority and the Independent Centre for Privacy Protection and some 
universities represented so well.

(It's actually just part of the sham of these conferences. These are not 
conferences where innovative _research_ is discussed. These are places 
where somebody's particular twist on other ideas, ideas which would 
barely rate a thread here on these mailing lists, is puffed out into an 
academic-looking paper.)

Look, people not already involved in this area won't spend $$$ going 
early to SF and paying for this workshop. You'll likely get some drones 
from Motorola and Intel who convince their bosses that this sounds 
important, and you'll get some Feds and other spooks who go to get up to 
speed on what to look for.

If you think this is "outreach" for Cypherpunks, where are the 
Cypherpunks on the program committee. I count one, maybe 1.5 if Lance is 
still doing this stuff (last I heard, he wasn't, and he hasn't posted 
here in a very, very long time). The rest are academics and staid 
corporate types. I'll bet they'll quash any papers dealing with using 
crypto to undermine governments.

It sounds pretty creepy to me. No doubt a lot of journalists will cover 
it. Most of them comped, no doubt.
