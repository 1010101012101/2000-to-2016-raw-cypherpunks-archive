By the way, Americans and those in the American Empire (Iraq, Britain, 
Kuwait, Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, Liberia, Transylvania, etc.) 
should be very careful about discussing alarm techniques. In this 
post-Bill of Rights era, such talk can get you a year in a federal 
penitentiary, or if one is a Little Brother in one of the Affiliated 
Nations, an indefinite stay in our newest concentration camp, Camp 
X-Ray.

Just as it is illegal to fortify doors against midnight raids (the 
African Central Republic of the District of Columbia has laws outlawing 
the hardening of doors...I'm not kidding), helping perps deploy alarm 
systems which make "sneak and peak" and pre-dawn SWAT raids harder is 
criminal conspiracy.

Americans need to watch what they say. Talk about drugs, face a bust 
under paraphernalia and proselytizing laws. Talk about explosives, get 
a year in the pen. Talk about medicine, have the AMA goons call in the 
cops. Talk about the law, have lawyers claim that only Bar Association 
members may give legal advice. Talk about Hollywood, have Jack Valenti 
file charges.

I hear it's still legal to give an opinion about "The Brady  Bunch," 
though Valenti says that loophole will soon be closed by Congress.

America died in 1861. Another political entity stole its domain name.
