I want to apologize to everyone else for having to put up with me taking
up the troll-bait and having a nice shit-wrestle.

The experience (experiment?) did, however, confirm my personal conviction
that privacy and anonymity are expensive, and we as a society generally 
have to pay that cost for others, and the cost continues to spiral out of
control as surveillance capabilities spiral out of control.

See subject {}coin for what I hope might be part of a solution.
