These are the same materials used on the Lincoln Memorial, and
most monuments: the surface is one thing, the under layers quite
different. That's the truth of monuments, not to say news
reporting, underlayed with advertising -- which most often is
more accurate than the journo-school-stylized reporting.

Fiction, advertising, was invented to gloss "non-fiction" until it was 
found more successful to reverse the osmosis. Headlines, bylines, 
lead syntactic paragraphs, reliable sources, eyewitneses, the artful 
couture of dissimulation, padding, shaping the substance to fit the 
consumer, at the executive level, National Intelligence.

The NYT, for one, heavily loads its 3rd page with lingerie ads 
when the front page is grimmest. Brits, more civilized, lead with 
tits and ass, with news positioned later where it belongs among
the mongrelized detritus.

If you want to see if a monument, a news forum, is authentic  strip 
away its surface, its credentialism. A good one has no surface, 
demands no upfront credulity, it's all solid same-throughout substance,
earned case by case, not powdered and rouged with a perdurable
masthead, plagiarized battle flags aflutter.

Embeddeds couldn't be happier camp followers, catching and pitching
initimacies of the censored battlefield. No real gore, not at all, you
have to go overseas to gander that porn.

Check the front page of the WSJ today about the Cunt encouraging
young Marines to do talk therapy for news-squeaky-clean agony of 
watermeloning Iraqis defending their homeland. As if Lon Horuchi
was consulting on patriotic head shots, faking remorse, doing a
job, staying alive, weeping about it, chickenshits.
