It's happened.

I remember seeing a 60' (minutes) show where a small town (Tennessee or
Georgia ?) was being terrorized by a bully. The police couldn't do much (He
had good lawyer).

Finally, the citizens have had enough. He goes to down to get drunk at a bar
and several townspeople are already there.

There's a scuffle. He gets killed (shot).

The police interview all involved, but they all answer, "I didn't see
anything". The weapon is never found. State police, FBI get involved. No
luck.

Since the police can't find a witness to come forward, They can't arrest
anybody.

I believe the mystery hasn't been solved to this day.

Sorry, I don't have specifics, but I'm sure someone here knows about it.
