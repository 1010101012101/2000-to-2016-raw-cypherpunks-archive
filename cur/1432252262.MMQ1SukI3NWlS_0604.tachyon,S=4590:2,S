Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
full-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annua|ly for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi||i0n for a
project this size.

About the EC Baltic Renewable Energy Centre

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimulate the
deve|opment of renewable energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant po|icies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fill the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
