No, this is important. If this isn't Cypherpunks material these days then 
nothing is.

As for the Wikipedia folks, I can't imagine having a more intelligent batch 
of people disagree. There's is a very practical matter: Reducing the 
hassles, particularly when said hassles in general deteriorate the 
content/bullshit ratio they see.

On the other hand, they seem to clearly "get" the value of Tor, and have 
practically extended an invitation for a solution that will truly make 
things better while not significantly increasing their hassles.

That the Wikipedia reaction to TorSpam is perhaps regrettable is obvious, 
but given their goals (not particularly Cypherpunkly) it really does make 
sense: No one's paid at Wikipedia and no one's going to do all the work of 
cleaning up the slung feces. In other words, their clipping off one of the 
side-lobes but increasing the remaining signal-to-noise. Just brute force 
logic. Sorry.

But the door is open for solutions and they do seem to understand the 
issues. Not bad, and the long-term solution may be very interesting...
