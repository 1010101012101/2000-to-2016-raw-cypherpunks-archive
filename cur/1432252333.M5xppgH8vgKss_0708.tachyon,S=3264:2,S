Because the Constitution prohibits certain govt actions, not private.
You can't post a sign on my property without my permission,
but if the state allows signposting somewhere then they can't censor
content.

Its perfectly acceptable to agree with Santorum.  It is unacceptable
to initiate force to impose your tastes on others.  Santorum speaks
as one who can steer the State to initiate force.

Mere voters don't.   They get to pick which vermin to send to
Congress, but these vermin are constrained by the Constitution,
xor treasonous.

Who gives a whit if they don't like fudgepackers personally?
That's a private affair.  If they don't hire or associate with
folks they don't like, reasonably or not, that's what liberty is about.

"Hate speech", hate thought, private discrimination is not a crime.
Its a difference of taste amongst free peoples
interacting mutually consensually.  Ergo no legal state interest.

Unconstitutional actions by state actors is treason.
