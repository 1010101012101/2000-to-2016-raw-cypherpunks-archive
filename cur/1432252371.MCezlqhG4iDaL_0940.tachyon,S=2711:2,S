New York City health officials will test Newsweek's photo department and 
mailrooms for anthrax today, and parts of the newsweekly's 15th floor 
offices were sealed in midtown Manhattan, after an unidentified photo 
staffer reported flu-like symptoms, a Newsweek spokesman said.

Newsweek execs contacted city officials Monday night after being 
notified by the employee, who weeks ago opened a suspicious package.

A spokesman for nearby Time Inc., publisher of Time and People, said no 
suspicious illnesses have been reported at the Time & Life Building.
