For the sake of us audiophiles, please don't.  MP3 is tinny and flat 
at best; it ticks me off that most folks seem to hear it as "good 
enough", because if most folks hear it as "good enough" it means we're 
not going to get a better sound format widely used.  You're talking 
about making the audio channels a bit (more or less) thinner, but 
they're too thin already.
