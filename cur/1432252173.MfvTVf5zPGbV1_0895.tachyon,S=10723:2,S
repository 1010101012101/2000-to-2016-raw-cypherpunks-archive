"JAG" Fans Worldwide Gather To 
Celebrate The Hit TV Series

Florence, AZ, August 19, 2001 - On October 12th through the 15th at the 
Four Points Sheraton LAX in Los Angeles join die-hard JAGnik fans from 
the United States, Australia, Denmark, England, Italy and elsewhere to 
meet the stars and celebrate their enthusiasm for the hit TV series, 
"JAG," the story of the United States Navy's Judge Advocate General's 
program, at the JAGnik Invasion 2001.

For six years and running, JAG, the overwhelmingly popular CBS 
television military drama has riveted millions of diehard viewers to 
their seats with outstanding programming. Terrorism, rape, murder, 
UFO's, women's rights, the Gulf War - JAG tackles them all like no 
other TV series has ever done. Now meet the stars, directors, writers, 
get autographs, and find out how they do it. If you are JAG fan, you 
can't miss this! 

The JAGnik 2001 convention - the 2nd one of its kind -- will host 
panel discussions with the cast and crew of JAG, as well as autograph 
sessions, a charity auction, and a "Charity Brunch" with the stars of 
one of the most popular programs ever produced. 

JAG's "Top Gun" stars are expected to be there. Heartthrobs David 
James Elliot as Lt. Cmdr Harmon Rabb, Jr. and Catherine Bell as Lt. 
Colonel Sarah "Mac" MacKenzie, who portray military legal eagles 
who investigate, prosecute, and defend Navy and Marine personnel 
around the world. 

Together with Patrick Labyorteaux (Lt. Bud Roberts, Jr.), John M. 
Jackson (Admiral, former Navy SEAL, Chegwidden), Karri Turner (Lt. jg 
Harriet Sims), Randy Vasquez (Gunny Victor Valendiz), Chuck Carrington 
(PO3 Tiner), and Trevor Goddard (Mic Brumbly) the lawyers explore 
issues facing today's military personnel. Schedules permitting, many 
of them plan to be there for you to meet. 

Meet people behind the cameras - writers, production staff - along 
with recurring stars and occasional guests too. Participate in panel 
discussions. Let them tell you how JAG develops from an idea into a 
one-hour action packed finished product. The autograph sessions, 
auction, and brunch will give the fans a chance to get to know and 
talk with the stars who portray their favorite characters. Go to on 
site locations where it really happens.

Jagnik Invasion 2001 will be held October 12 - 15 at the Four Points 
Sheraton LAX in Los Angeles, CA. Information about the convention can 
be found at our website, www.JAGnik.com or by calling Barbara Badeaux 
at (520) 868-1994, or writing JAGnik Association, PO Box 2000, 
Florence, Arizona 85232-2000.
