=A0 The current population of United States Federal prisons is approximatel=

re are only about 3,500 Federal criminal jury trials in America each year.=
=A0 The reason for the apparent difference is that in the vast majority of =
such cases, the defendant or defendants accept a plea agreement, which the =
news media wrongly refers to as a 'plea bargain':=A0 In reality, it's not a=
 'bargain' for the criminal defendant, and it certainly isn't a 'bargain' f=

y a financial disaster of the first magnitude, one which the majority of th=
e American population doesn't know about, and certainly doesn't understand.=
=A0 But the reason the defendants are motivated to accept those deals is
 simple:=A0 The Feds threaten them with time far greater than what they'll =
get if they deal.=A0 So, the very large majority of them deal.=A0 And so, a=
ll of us are poorer as a consequence.=A0 The average sentence, we can calcu=

=A0=A0 It costs approximately $35,000 to keep a prisoner in Federal prison =

 of about $7.7 billion dollars.=A0 If that population could be brought down=
 to the level it was in 1980, or 20,000 prisoners, about $7 billion dollars=

=A0 I was almost as energized, and as enthusiastic, as I was in early 1995,=
 when I got the idea that I later turned into my "Assassination Politics" e=

refuse to deal, to refuse to accept the deal that's usuallyoffered.=A0 The =
figure of$5,000 popped into my head.=A0 What if every Federal felony crimin=
al defendant were offered money, let's say $5,000, if they would plead not-=
guilty (which is their Constitutional right) and to demand a jury trial (wh=
ich is also their Constitutional right).=A0 The current system has trouble =
putting on 3,500 Federal felony criminal jury trials per year.=A0 How would=
 that system increase that number significantly?=A0 The number of Federal c=
ourtrooms is somewhat fixed, the
 number of U.S. Attorneys is rather limited as well.=A0 And, Federal court =
time has to be shared with civil cases, too.=A0 So, it would be hard to ima=
gine a great increase in the number of Federal criminal jury trials held.=
=A0 If the number of persons convicted could be dropped from 70,000 per yea=

 cost?=A0 Well, assuming a cost-per-offer of $5,000, and perhaps 4,000 tria=

that's a lot of money.=A0 But for an entire country, that's peanuts. =A0 Ye=
t, it would save the nation $7 billion.=A0 In other words, for every dollar=

=A0 $7 billion/$20 million =3D $350. =0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 These estimates are no=

d tend to allocate its resources, the limited number of courtroom-days avai=
lable, and would probably select only the most serious cases for prosecutio=
n.=A0 So, while it's possible that some residual amount of plea-bargaining =
would remain, this same pressure would tend to force officials to accept th=
at defendants serve smaller average sentences than they've been getting, wh=
ich of course are already much lower than they'd probably like to get.=A0 E=
ven if the resulting average sentence rose to 4 years, the overall populati=
on of Federal prisons would drop from 220,000 to about 16,000.=A0 (4 years =
x 4,000 trials/year).=A0 This would be a great improvement.=A0 =0A=0A=0A=A0=
 =A0 =A0=A0 The big question is, "Who would pay for this?". =A0"Therein lie=
s the rub", to quote Hamlet.=A0 Don't expect bigtime drug-dealers to donate=
:=A0 Their ability to make money would be thwarted if their products were r=
endered de-facto legal.=A0=A0 However, illegal-drug users would be greatly =
benefited.=A0 The price of their favorite pastime might very well drop by a=
 factor of 5-10, if the likelihood of getting arrested and charged with pro=
viding it was drastically lowered.=A0 That would surely occur if this syste=
m was expanded to include state jurisdiction, which is about 10x larger tha=
n the Federal system, and thus a cost 10x higher:=A0 $200 million per year.=
.=A0 Another group of people who would benefit would be tax-evaders.=A0 The=
 Wikipedia article on "Tax Evasion in the United States" indicates that the=
 approximate money 'lost' (and thereby gained by non-payers) is $305 billio=
n in 2010.=A0 If only 1/100 of a penny foreach dollar thus saved was paid i=
nto a
 fund, that would be $30.5 million, which would be plenty to make sure that=
 Federal tax evasion would be extremely difficult to prosecute.=A0 As well =
as every other Federal crime.=A0 Most accountants would see that as a good =
investment, and should advise their clients accordingly.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=
