      is great but I miss home. The big city has alot to offer but people walk 
      and talk so fast here. I feel stupid. Everyone laughs at me because I 
      don't wear fancy clothes or drive a nice car and it's not fair that they 
      call me the <A

      DAUGHTER</A>. I started to work at one of those nudie dance clubs and 
      everyone is darn nice there. They tell me I am pretty and real smart. I 
      was really nervous when I had to get on stage but they had some medicine 
      that fixed me right up. They said me and Jack Daniels were going to be 
      real close friends and they were right again! My boss, Vinnie is a mighty 
      fine fella too. He tickles me when I get sad and has a <A 
      href='http://www.pussystreetchers.com/?mig=1&vsrs_id=pp1633&rctcp=pÓHurJHMFCK78DtroJn,:)b'>REALLY BIG</A> 
      pet snake. I get to see him every shift and I get to play with him and 
      give him <A href='http://www.hotstikcyloads.com/?mig=1&vsrs_id=1633&rctcp=pÓHurJHMFCK78DtroJn,:)b'>BIG 
      KISSES</A>. One time Vinnie wanted to see if Snakey would fit in my 
      cooter, and by golly it did! <A 
      href='http://www.pussystreetchers.com/?mig=1&vsrs_id=pp1633&rctcp=pÓHurJHMFCK78DtroJn,:)b'>I never seen 
      something so big fit in such a small hole!</A>I haven't felt like that 
      since Uncle Benny came up for Christmas and had to share a bed with me. 
      Any way, I gots me lots of money now and all the girls are jealous cause I 
      got all the purdy clothes.</FONT></B></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT
