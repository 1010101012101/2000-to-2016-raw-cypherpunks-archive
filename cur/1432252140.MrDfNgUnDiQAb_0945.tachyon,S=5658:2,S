Language of Flowers
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_flowers

"The language of flowers, sometimes called floriography, is a means of
cryptological communication through the use or arrangement of flowers.
Meaning has been attributed to flowers for thousands of years, and
some form of floriography has been practiced in traditional cultures
throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Plants and flowers are
used as symbols in the Hebrew Bible—particularly of love and lovers in
the Song of Songs,[1] as an emblem for the Israelite people[2] and for
the coming Messiah[3]—and of Jesus Christ in the New Testament.[4] In
Western Culture, William Shakespeare ascribed emblematic meanings to
flowers, especially in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark."
