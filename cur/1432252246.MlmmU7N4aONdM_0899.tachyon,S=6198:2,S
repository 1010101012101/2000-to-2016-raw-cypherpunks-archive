... yet they clearly and directly invite you to ask them about it.
I quit believing Craigslist was honorable a long time ago.
They are some kind of odd idealogues whose kind obviously
doesn't include you.

Will they ignore those of you who live in the Bay Area?
Craigslist 1381 9th Ave / 222 Sutter St SF, CA, US
As their user (perhaps even paying user), you certainly
have customary ground to engage them in conversation.
I wonder how they treat their paying customers?
And what their fee structure is like?

Or you could just deploy a better list/meme, steal their eyeballs
and run them out of business. They suck pretty hard so there's
lots of oppurtunity there.

ps. They archive every single post, and likely every single
image, email, and phone number... from inception... in perpetuity.
Don't take my word, it's in their videos... a fucking privacy shame.
In fact, at this very moment, they're probably fapping to your gerbil
sex ad that you 'deleted' ten years ago.

[Rant aside, people have a right to be forgotten, and those, like CL,
who willfully disregard that right, without verbosely or obviously
saying so in context (ie: mailing lists obviously have self-run, even
public, archives... that you cannot 'delete'), ... need to be exposed.]
