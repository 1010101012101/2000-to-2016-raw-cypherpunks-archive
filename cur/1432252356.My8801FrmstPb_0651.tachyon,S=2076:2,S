Basically just a test of the Al-Qaeda node.

Anyone been reading the recent books on Cypherpunks? I haven't read Julian's
yet, though interestingly it's not available directly though Amazon.
Greenberg's book is good and plenty of unsurprising coverage of both Young and
May.

Through both tribs I suspect there will be an influx of young, hot tail. Too
bad no one's around to work 'em over a bit.
