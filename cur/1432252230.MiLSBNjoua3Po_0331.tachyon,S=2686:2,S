If this is inappropriate for this list, I hope all participants will accept 
my apologies in advance, and let me know, and I will not post this 
sort of thing here again.

If any here are in opposition to the nomination of John Ashcroft to 
Attorney General, the following website allows citizens to sign a 
petition stating this: 

http://www.opposeashcroft.com

I'm not trying to get people into any arguments here.. I thought this 
might be appropriate since people here are concerned with civil 
rights. 

If this is inappropriate, again, my apologies.
