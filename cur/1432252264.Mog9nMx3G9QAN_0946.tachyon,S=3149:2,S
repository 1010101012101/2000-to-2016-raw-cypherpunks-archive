Watching some of the news coverage of the search (from the aptly named 
Palestine, Texas), it's clear that no search warrants are being gotten 
for the debris searchers to enter farms, yards, backyards, corporation 
lands, ranches, etc. The cameras show them simply vaulting fences and 
looking for anything they can find.

When was the Fourth Amendment and "a man's home is his castle" 
suspended?

If a property owner defends his borders with a shotgun, is he shipped 
to Camp X-Ray?

Fuck this country. Fuck it dead. Osama, we beseech you!!
