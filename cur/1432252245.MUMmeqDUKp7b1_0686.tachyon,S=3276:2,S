I would have predicted that on the evening of Sep. 11. I've documented
Freeh's calls in the past for just this. I was concerned enough about
this prospect years ago that I convinced some nonprofit groups to
include "protect Net anonymity" in their annual handbooks that go to
congresscritters. But it hasn't happened in Congress yet, and now's a
pretty good time to get this stuff through.

That's the good news. The bad news is that the Senate is preparing to
vote as early as Thurs morning on their USA Act (text at
leahy.senate.gov), and the amendments being proposed by Feingold are
decent but pretty weak. I'll probably put up the text at
wartimeliberty.com soonish.
