You don't have to sign it. You only have to agree to it verbally, or in
this case email.

A verbal agreement between two parties that dictate how they will relate
to each other is a contract.

If you don't want to abide by that 'informal' agreement then I'll gladly
remove you from the SSZ CDR feed. It's your call.
