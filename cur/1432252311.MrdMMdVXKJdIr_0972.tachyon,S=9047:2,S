Hmm.

> Although it depends on jurisdiction,

Here, then. Why would it necessarily depend on jurisdiction?  Isn't
the jurisdiction primarily something that really is something that one
imagines and then imposes?  Or is the imagination and imposition
something that occurs simultaneously?  Past, present, future,
"necessarily" chosen perceptions in order to prevent one's mind from
popping before the realization that it is not the spoon that bends, it
is you. :-)  In any event, are our notions of "jurisdiction"
regardless of how they are implemented or put into practice in what we
consider to be "real world," practical and reasonable, or are they
merely part of a mental prison which we routinely impose upon
ourselves?

Too many words, though.

Wrapping up:

The Gateless Gate  (1228)  by Mumon, translated by Nyogen
Koan number 29 out of 49 in this work (published 1228, translated 1934)

Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: "The flag is moving."

The other said: "The wind is moving."

The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: "Not the
wind, not the flag; mind is moving."

    Mumonâ€™s comment: The sixth patriarch said: "The wind is not
moving, the flag is not moving. Mind is moving." What did he mean? If
you understand this intimately, you will see the two monks there
trying to buy iron and gaining gold. The sixth patriarch could not
bear to see those two dull heads, so he made such a bargain.

        Wind, flag, mind moves,
        The same understanding.
        When the mouth opens
        All are wrong.


Then, here.
