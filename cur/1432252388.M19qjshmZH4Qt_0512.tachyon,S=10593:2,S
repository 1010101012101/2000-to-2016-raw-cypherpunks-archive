The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to

milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap International Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed calls from any telephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||u|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a globa| scale. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
