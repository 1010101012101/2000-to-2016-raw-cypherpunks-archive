"So, get a clue.  When your battery runs out, you
get *zero* benefit from the mesh.  Or even your local
device *sans network*."

Well, as usual I don't think I'm understanding you here. In my example I'm 
imagining I'm a livery cab driver or something. In that case, instantaneous 
micro-traffic-conditions can be very valuable in NYC.
In that environment, a cabbie will quickly understand that the network will 
collapse if all of the wireless nodes act to conserve power by not 
re-transmitting information. So even though it costs you something to route 
a packet you yourself will not use, if you're even reasonably smart you'll 
pass some on until you're nearing your batteries exhaustion, then perhaps go 
into a listening mode.

(And of course, it may easily be possible to form spontaneous VLANs that 
deal only with traffic, and then only route those packets...but that doesn't 
change my argument any.)
