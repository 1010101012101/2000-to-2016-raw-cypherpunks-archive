	For those on this list in the Boston area there is a hearing
scheduled on the Mass Bill at 10 Am in Room 222 of the Mass State House
in Boston.

	It was introduced in Mass by a Rep Stephen Tobin of Boston and listed
on the state website as "legislation to establish a crime of illegal
internet and broadband access"
