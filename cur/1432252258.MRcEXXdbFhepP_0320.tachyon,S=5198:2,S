Subject: Re: Linux-style kernel PRNGs and the FIPS140-2 test

There was an error in the bounds for the runs test specified by NIST; last 
october they updated FIPS 140-2 to specify new bounds. An updated version 
of my code can be found at http://people.qualcomm.com/ggr/QC/ (our old web 
pages are stale, and I'm still trying to have them taken down by our ex-ISP).

Here's an excerpt from the comment in the new code:
  * Version 1.3 -- Bill Chauncey and his colleages pointed out to NIST that
  * the bounds in the runs test were incorrect.
  * They issued an update 2001-oct-10.

If the new one still shows an anomalous number of runs test failures, there 
is a real problem.

regards,
Greg.
