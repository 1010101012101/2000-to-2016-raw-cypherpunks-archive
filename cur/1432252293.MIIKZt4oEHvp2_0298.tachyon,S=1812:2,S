Spam is the least of the problems for remailers when it comes to
abuse.  You should be more concerned about possible liability for
illegal messages.

In a way, spam has actually made the remailer operator's life easier
as people today are used to receiving annoying and obscene email.
Ten years ago, when I ran a remailer, people were genuinely shocked
to receive unsolicited pornography.  Yes, it's hard to believe today,
but in those quaint times, when the Internet was in black and white,
most users got only a few email messages a day and they were all from
their friends, family and co-workers.

As far as spam, next-generation remailers should incorporate hashcash,
www.hashcash.org, to make sending an anonymous message relatively costly.
Let it take a minute or more to generate the "stamp" necessary for a
message to enter the remailer system and spam will not be a problem,
while legitimate users will have no barrier.
