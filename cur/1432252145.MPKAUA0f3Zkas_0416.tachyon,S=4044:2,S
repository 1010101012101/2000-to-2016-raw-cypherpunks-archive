is obvious they did not beat him enough. Let us hope they do it again, and 
the next time do a proper job of it. For example he still has his eyes. If

Fisk is one of those rare beasts,a truthful journalist.Declan could learn 
from the fisks,pilgers,hunter s thomsons and danny casoleros of this world 
when he's not greasing up to the cato crowd.Maybe if we removed declans 
eyes with the old soft drill.
Jamesd meet jamesk,on this day...1953 -- Veteran James Kutcher, who lost 
both his legs
in WWII, informed his disability was being cut of due
to his membership in the Socialist Workers Party.
Happy now?
