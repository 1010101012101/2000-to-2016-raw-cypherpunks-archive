I believe the last couple of days with two lawyers and a couple of wanna
be's clearly demonstrate the primary problem of todays judicial system.

The courts are not concerned with The Law, they are concerned with their
continued existance. This is exemplified by lawyers making reference to
'precedence' instead of 'the law' (ie a codified set of laws that are
applicable to all).

It's supposed to be 'equal protection under the law', not 'equal
protection by the courts'.

A court <> the law.

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
