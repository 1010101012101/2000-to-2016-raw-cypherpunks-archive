I would support this as well.

The craziest aspect of "absentee ballots" is that some people move 
away from their original registration places and then vote absentee 
for years, even decades. My father and mother, for example, voted 
absentee with a California ballot for 15 years of living in Virginia, 
France, and Maryland. Only when our family lived in France for a year 
could they have justifiably claimed to be "absentee residents."

And this is not rare. Absentee ballots are a lot more than being 
about people who are temporarily away from their homes.
