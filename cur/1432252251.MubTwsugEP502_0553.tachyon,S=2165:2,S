FWIW Recall that a few 'copters have been taken down with AK fire,
though the birds/round
is likely low.  And copters are more delicate than a multi-engined fixed
wing.

Hitting the cabin would be pretty effective though.  And certain parts
of big planes
are vital, perhaps moreso on fly by wire Airbus planes.

A homemade mortar through the roof of your van (IRA style) onto a
stationary, taxiing plane would be
pretty spectacular, sitting ducks... lots of cameras... easy getaway or
repeat fire..

Of course the BMG crap is all about eroding rights, not reality.
