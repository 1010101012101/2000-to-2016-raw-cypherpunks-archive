Of course, if you're a hardcore libertarian ("abolish all
unconstitutional federal agencies, and that's most of 'em! let's
revert back to the firearms laws we had 150 years ago!"), then you

Having more "pro freedom policy analysts" in Washington won't
accomplish much until other things change too.
