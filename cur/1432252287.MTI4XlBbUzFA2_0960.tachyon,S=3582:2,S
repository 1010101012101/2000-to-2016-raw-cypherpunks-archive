I guess I should have said "no *previously* shared secret".

Well... I assume an active MITM (like my ISP). He's able to intercept my
public key request and change it. Plus, I now realize I should have put an
even harder condition - no previously shared *information*, even if it's
public. I need to know if two complete strangers can communicate securely
over an insecure network, even if they communicate through an untrusted
party. Wasn't there a protocol for two prisoners communicating through an
untrusted guard?

Thanks,
Mark
