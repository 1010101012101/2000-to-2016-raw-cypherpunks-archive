Juan, I love you, but you are very 'mal cogido' and need chocolate
desperately, hunfs!  You know I don't respect men with more premenstrual
tension than me, ugh!  :P

Please, after eating carbohydrates, think a bit and remember I am not a
feminazi.  If I was a feminazi, I would pretend being a victim right now,
making lots of drama, writing fake statements about how much you, bad bad
Juan, make me feel horrible because I am a poor and fragile little girl and
I need the group's protection, oooh...  Poor me!  Someone, please, help
me!  When it is convenient, I am not able of doing anything by mylself, in
special without spread all the drama and hate in a twitter timeline or
stupid Facebook posts!  :'(

I am a feminist, not a feminazi, Juan.  Same rights, dear.  It's more fun
and interesting being a girl and, as said before, I can do the same things
than you, but using make-up, dress and high heels.  And lots of pearls,
oink oink!  :D

Do you remember when those "victims" wrote that some women were using their
sexuality to attack other women?  Ah!  When they are supposedly raped, Jake
is guilty.  When I am raped and tell publicly what means being a real
victim, I am using my sexuality against other women.  Do you understand the
difference?  I do not.

The people who signed this petition believe in Justice, in never using
sexism in witches hunter without proofs, without due process.

Take care and eat chocolate, dear!  :*
