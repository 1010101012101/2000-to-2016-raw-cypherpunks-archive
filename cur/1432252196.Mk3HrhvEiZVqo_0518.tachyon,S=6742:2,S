the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B of 
the SEC Act of 1934. Statements that involve discussions with respect to 
projections of future events are not statements of historical fact. Don't 
rely on them. This company is not a reporting issuer. Past performance is never

This company has: no revenue in its most recent quarter, nominal cash,an accumulated 
deficit and a reliance on loans from officers, directors and/or affiliates. It is not 
a revenue producing company. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to 
continue as a going concern. A failure to finance could cause the company to go out of 
business. This is high risk security. This report shall not be construed as any kind of
