A rather elliptic demonstration of your wiles.


BTW, the crank paper was already withdrawn "by the author" at the LANL 
site by the time I went to look at less than an hour ago.

This is a good example of where a simple reputation rating graph would 
work well...not just "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" or "12 of 37 readers 
found this review useful" (a la Amazon's method), but a system where it 
matters that Andrew Wiles found the paper uninteresting but does not 
matter (to most) that Ludwig Plutonium was enthralled by it.

(Actually, safest for all to have only positive comments, or lack of 
them, rather than invite the lawyer vultures to the party by having 
some sensitive soul feel "libeled" by a negative rating.)
