mi|estones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any telephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 200,00O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the
