    As to be expected, the European left-wing liberal
    countries and their leaders are already back-sliding and
    urging the U.S. not to massively retaliate --eg: let the
    Islamists get away with their terror act.

    Well, we can always count on the French to hope we fall
    on our face, and the Germans have neither patriotism nor
    spine.

    The time to retaliate was in the first few hours while
    everyone was in shock and looking for blood; now
    Europe's pansy liberals have gone back to their usual
    condescending head-in-the-sand attitudes.

    For France to say the U.S. had it coming, maybe France
    should be one of the targets?

    The only way to stop terrorism is to make the people of
    the countries who succor and harbor the terrorists
    really feel the pain. Blow away a country or two --then
    ask "Next?" --after you have everyone's attention.

    THAT is how you stop terrorism, George....
