"Judge Finds German Woman Guilty of Raping Eight Pakistani Muslim Men
April 22, 2013
"In the City of Wassenberg in Western Germany a woman has been found
guilty of seducing and raping eight men in the first case of its kind
in Europe. Maria Heidelsohn aged 18 alleges that on the afternoon of
August 23rd she was pulled away by eight men from the porch she was
sun bathing on and carried into a small shed in which she was brutally
and repeatedly gang raped. Heidelsohn alleges that she cried for help
repeatedly until she was bound and gagged, she then claims that she
was beaten severely and both of her arms and one leg were broken.

Wassenbeg Police Chief Abdullah Al Hussein contends that there is no
evidence Heidelsohn did not injure herself or ask a friend to injure
her in order to attempt to frame up her alleged attackers. The Police
Chief noted that no male adult Muslim men saw the attack occur to
corroborate her story despite the area being largely Muslim. In the
large German town new legislation passed overwhelmingly last year
stipulates that four adult male Muslim witnesses are necessary in
order to corroborate any charges made by a woman in accordance with
traditional Islamic jurisprudence. "

"A little 7 year old girl was brutally raped by a Muslim migrant from
North Africa.
The girl was with her mother in the park in Chemnitz, Germany, when a
Muslim man dragged her into the bush, held her mouth shut and brutally
raped the little girl.
After he finished the rape, he let the girl go and left the crime
scene running. It happened quick that the mother did not even notice
anything. She first realized it when the seven year old girl came
crying to her."

"Not so very many years ago, Oslo was virtually a rape-free city,
inhabited by people who had been brought up on civilized notions of
mutual respect and tolerance. No longer. Over the years, the incidence
of rape has risen steadily. A wildly disproportionate number of the
perpetrators are "rejected asylum seekers” – which may sound puzzling
unless you are aware of the perverse state of affairs whereby even
persons officially rejected for asylum in Norway are still allowed to
stay. And the increasing temerity of the rapists – who know very well
that they will probably not be caught, and, if caught, will not be
severely punished – is reflected in the fact that the most recent rape
(in which two men assaulted a 21-year-old woman) took place virtually
in the backyard of the Royal Palace."

https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/sweden-77-6-percent-of-all-rapes-in-the-country-committed-by-muslim-males-making-up-2-percent-of-population/
"The total Muslim population in Sweden is estimated at 4.4% (2013
figures). Out of that 4.4% and in deducting the women and children, we
can roughly guesstimate that around 2% are male. The foreign rape
figures at 77.6% Muslim has been anonymously confirmed by Swedish
polish in a phone conversation. The actual figure could be higher.
These percentages do not include Muslims with Swedish citizenship
contained within rapes in the figures categorized under “Swedish
nationals”."

https://majorityrights.com/weblog/comments/muslim_rape_wave_in_sweden/
"According to a new study from the Crime Prevention Council, Brå, it
is four times more likely that a known rapist is born abroad, compared
to persons born in Sweden. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya,
Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects. According to
these statistics, almost half of all perpetrators are immigrants. In
Norway and Denmark, we know that non-Western immigrants, which
frequently means Muslims, are grossly overrepresented on rape
statistics. In Oslo, Norway, immigrants were involved in two out of
three rape charges in 2001. The numbers in Denmark were the same, and
even higher in the city of Copenhagen with three out of four rape
charges. Sweden has a larger immigrant, including Muslim, population
than any other country in northern Europe."

German Schools Order Girls Not to Wear Short Skirts to Avoid Offending
Muslim Migrants
Parents warned revealing clothes could lead to "attacks"
Schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear mini-skirts
or shorts so as to prevent attacks from Muslim migrants who may be
offended by such attire.

A school located in Pocking, Bavaria sent a letter to parents advising
them of new “security measures” after a migrant shelter was opened at
the school’s nearby gym.
