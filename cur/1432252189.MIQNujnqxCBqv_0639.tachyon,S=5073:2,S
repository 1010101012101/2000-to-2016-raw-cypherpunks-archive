the bulk of 2012 was consume user hardware.  the endpoint is a totally
solved problem (read: trivial to exploit in many ways, all day, every
day, per the docs)

only server Ivy Bridge: Xeon E3 in mid-2012.

the cores pushed in the SDN initiatives above came out not so many months ago...

high capacity crypto aggregation points like this are an ideal target,
with backdoor keying of VPN/SSL the ideal (passive) attack with their
view of target's long haul fiber.

but not released, and "enabling" means tied into X-KEYSCORE,
TRAFFICTHIEF, whatever else gets draped off UPSTREAM...

the backdoors for all the other vendor hardware happened in years
prior.  HSMs and crypto accelerator gear is not exactly a vibrant or
competitive market.  in fact, these companies never seem to die, just
carry on with decent margins riding on incremental design upgrades
until they're bought out by a larger/growing competitor. ;)


of course, this could be because companies like Sun charge $9,999 for
an HSM/accelerator that is at best a reasonable cost at $1,499...
