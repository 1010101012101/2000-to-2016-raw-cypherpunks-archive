I [don't] hate to be the Bringer of Reality (tm) to you, but:

	- Amelia Earhart is a still un-caused crash. They only recently 
found the island she crashed (and apparently lived on for some time prior 
to dying on it), and work to raise the parts of her plane which have been 
found and excavate the island itself have not yet, AFAIK,  begun (lack of 
financing I believe).

	- Kara Hultgreen died because she was a crappy pilot who was rated 
*despite* having 4 disqualifiers because she was the first and the 
"service" needed the positive PR of having  First Female Combat Pilot (in 
an ironic twist, she also gave them their much needed First Female Combat 
Pilot Death In Action).  She fucked up her carrier landing by stalling an 
engine (in a manner that EVRYONE had been warned about) on her failed 
landing attempt, resulting in an unstable aircraft[1] that had a 
previously known design flaw[2] becoming almost-but-not-quite-unflyable.
Then she finished herself off by trying to use her afterburner to do a 
go-round.  Her #2 ejected them when he realized she was trying to kill 
them, but his ejection and hers were not simultaneous: he got out still 
pointing over the hosrizon - unfortunately, she was pointed at the water 
when her ejection started .4sec after her #2, and she hit the water pretty 
hard. Probably *not* an open Casket for "Revlon" ;-) Hultgreen should 
*never* have been allowed to get a combat endorsement to her Crappy Pilots 
Association Air-Worthiness License. She killed *herself*
