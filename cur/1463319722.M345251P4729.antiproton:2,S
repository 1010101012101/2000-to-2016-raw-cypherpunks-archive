Risk is a fresh take on the renegades, the cypherpunks, the risk takers.

First Look Media announced today that Laura 
Poitras' new feature film Risk will have its 
world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival's 48th 
Directors' Fortnight (Quinzaine des 
Réalisateurs). This dramatic documentary with a 
cypherpunk spirit reveals the stakes and 
opportunities of truth-telling and finds Poitras 
embedded with Julian Assange over the past five 
years. Risk is her highly anticipated follow-up 
to Citizenfour, Academy Award® winner for Best 
Documentary. Risk is produced by Praxis Films in 
association with First Look Media and Field of 
Vision. World sales will be handled by Josh Braun of Submarine.

First Look Media is a new-model media company 
devoted to supporting independent voices across 
all platforms, from investigative journalism and 
documentary filmmaking to smart, provocative 
entertainment. eBay founder and philanthropist 
Pierre Omidyar launched First Look in 2013 with

vital to a vibrant culture and thriving 
democracy. First Look operates as both a studio and digital media company.
