No, Tim. That isn't. If a store, who takes it on concession, has not sold
it by the time it's display date expires the cover is torn off. The book
is entered into the accounting system as 'destroyed' and it goes on from
there. The key point being, at least to this conversation, is that no
royalty on the book was ever paid. It was legally bound for the trash
heap.

So, possession is in effect possession of stolen property.
