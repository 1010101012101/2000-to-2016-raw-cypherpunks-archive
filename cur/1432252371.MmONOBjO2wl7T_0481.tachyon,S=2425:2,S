But the IV is repeated, every time you encrypt new data for that sector.  You
need to either store a random IV for each sector (usually infeasible) or make
two passes over the data (details vary), using the output from pass 1 to
affect pass 2 (slow).

Customised, not custom.  Think of it as a Chinese-menu type setup, it's a one-
size-fits-all BIOS with appropriate modules compiled in for handling the CPU
and chipset features.  Now motherboard vendors can plug in their own feature
modules, but it's a somewhat nontrivial option usually used only for highly
marketable features (overclocking options, ability to re-flash from Windows,
etc etc).
