That might be current contemporary US usage, but it is not how the word
started. Originally it was used (In French I suspect) for states
terrorising the people they ruled, like the Russian pogroms. Later it
was widened to include non-governmental groups. In WW2 bombing of
residential cities was widely called "terror bombing" (even by Churchill
in private).

But it is a distinction without a difference. Who would you think had
the most capacity to wage war, a small state such as Nauru or St Lucia,
or an armed non-state like ETA or some of the Colombian gangs? Calling
this attack "war" or "terrorism" is a matter of emotional colour.
