>Should Anarchists Take State Money?
>
>by Robert Murphy
>
>A discussion on a private email list brought up a familiar topic: When is
>it permissible for self-described anarchists (let's restrict ourselves here
>to anarcho-capitalists) to take government money? This is a tricky
>question, and I have yet to see someone offer a satisfactory list of
>necessary and sufficient conditions. Usually when an-caps argue about this,
>they end up shooting more and more refined analogies back and forth.
>
>For example, to me it's not enough to say that any money spent in the
>private sector is legitimate (vis-a-vis one's anarchism). I personally
>would not feel justified in working for a Halliburton. However, what about
>the guy who opens a Dunkin Donuts near a police station? Is he accepting
>"government money"? Does it matter if he's in a podunk town with a sheriff
>and a deputy, versus if he lives in LA and knows for a fact that several of
>his customers beat the #$#)($* out of suspects?
>
>A big problem in this area is education: Can anarcho-capitalist economists
>take teaching posts at State schools? After all, the State intervenes
>heavily in education, which is a perfectly laudable market institution. But
>surely there are more teaching posts because of the State than there
>otherwise would be. Does the an-cap professor have to estimate whether his
>or her post would actually exist in the absence of State intervention, or
>is that irrelevant?
>
>Personally, I have decided that I will never work for an official State
>school. If I really mean it when I refer (in LRC articles, for example) to
>the State as "a gang of killers and thieves," then how can I possibly
>associate with such people? Yes yes, there are millions of analogies and
>counterarguments, but for me there is a definite line to be drawn at
>actually being on the payroll. (I also wouldn't take welfare, for example,
>even though in previous years I have put in a lot to the tax system.)
>
>Before closing, I should say that in no way am I taking a holier than thou
>stance. For example, I applied for the Stafford (unsubsidized!) loan in
>grad school, even though the State technically coerced those lending
>institutions into offering me such low rates. And I know a guy who is so
>hard core about starving the beast, that he felt like a sellout when he
>took a job on the books and had some of his paycheck withheld. (I.e. when
>he worked under the table, then at least his money wasn't funding the
>State's wars etc.)
>
>But as far as State schools, I think there are a few other things that
>people often leave out of the discussion. First, why would I want to throw
>my talents into a State school? I would much rather work on the side of the
>underdog, and every time I publish a paper or give a talk, I want a private
>school to get the credit. (This also applies to whatever influence I have
>on students; I don't want to enhance a State school's reputation by
>churning out better-than-otherwise students, so long as I could do the same
>at a private school.)
>
>A second issue is a bit more subtle: When moderate Americans hear of an-cap
>professors berating the existence of the State, while they work for the
>State, I think two things happen. (A) They think, "What a hypocrite! These
>ivory tower academics need to get in the real world before redesigning
>society!" And (B), they think, "Our government is so open and tolerant! It
>even employs academics who call for its abolition! I'm so glad I live here
>and not under the Taliban."
>
>(Again, this is not meant as a criticism of those who choose to work at
>State schools. I'm just explaining my position.)
