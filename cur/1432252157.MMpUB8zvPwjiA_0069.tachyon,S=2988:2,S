It was effectively killed (or put into hiatus) when Roger Dingledine
hired Nick Mathewson to work full time for him on tor a couple years
ago.  Mixminion was effectively Nick and Roger's baby.  Roger jumped
first to pursue Tor full time and then brought Nick over later.  Since
then nobody had picked up the torch.

I spoke with Roger about this a couple years ago at Defcon and his take
was basically he could do more good (and arguably has) with Tor than he
ever could with Mixminion given the steep entry curve for normal users
to Mixminion, the indifference of the layperson to anonymous email given
the growing Web 2.0 post-email web forums and blogs, and a greater need
for anonymous surfing, posting, and tcp streams than email.

I have cc'ed Roger on this if he wants to add further information; I
don't have Nicks email.
