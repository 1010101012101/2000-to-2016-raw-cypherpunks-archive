Much like the "strict" law limiting what SS cards could be used for:

"For Social Security and tax purposes only. Not for identification."

(Or very similar to this. It's printed on my 1969 SS card, which I still 
have.)

I've had government agencies demand my SS number. One time I showed the 
clerk my card, with my SS number covered by my thumb. She just gave me 
her government employee blank look and said she would not be able to 
complete my paperwork without my SS number.

Such will it be with Larry Ellison's Oraclecard. I just hope that, being 
Jewish, he gets picked up for extermination early on.

It's often the fucking Jews--Feinstein, Feingold, Lieberman, 
Ellison--who slavishly imitate the Nazis. How ironic to see Larry 
Ellison pushing the "Papers, please, macht schnell!" Orwellian nightmare.

And it will be "voluntary" only for the first couple of years (when the 
focus is on the schwarzes). Every store will use it (those which don't, 
like political bookstores and gun stores, will be classified as s.1510 
terrorist-facilitating businesses).
