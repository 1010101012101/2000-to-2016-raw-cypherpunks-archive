Observe that rich people around the world are hiding their 
money in America, despite the fact that progressive taxes, 
speculative lawsuits and money laundering laws show the 
American government is no friend of the rich.  Still less is 
any other government a friend of the rich, or even the 
moderately well off, any more than a wolf is the friend of the 
deer.

As governments were created to smash property rights, they are 
always everywhere necessarily the enemy of those with property, 
and the greatest enemy of those with the most property.

For thousands indeed - but not for millions - which is why only 
massive state confiscation of property can create a society 
where landowners number in the mere thousands.

The old west, and australian squatters, show that fairly large
estates, texan size, can exist even in the face of active
hostility from a state that refuses to recognize those property
rights, and actively seeks to destroy them.
