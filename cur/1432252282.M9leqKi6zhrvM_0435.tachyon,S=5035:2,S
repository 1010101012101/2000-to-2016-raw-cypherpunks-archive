Do you guys follow Matthew Green? Great stuff:

http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html
http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/a-note-on-nsa-future-and-fixing-mistakes.html

I think he does a good job of breaking down what's in these recent reports.
It's a good thing to send to people who read the NY Times report and think
that all crypto is now broken (like a friend of mine asked me at NWC
yesterday).

And then there was this:

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/10/nsa-matthew-green-takedown-blog-post-johns-hopkins

One more question: any of y'all used libTomCrypt? We have an experimental
implementation of it in SQLCipher. Open-source alternatives to OpenSSL
could use some love. DJB's NaCl is neat, too. Curious if you guys are leery
of relying so heavily on OpenSSL, given the above.

Cheers,
Billy
