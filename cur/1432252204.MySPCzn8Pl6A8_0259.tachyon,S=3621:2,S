RAND Privacy and Emerging Technologies Conference
http://www.rand.org/hot/privconf/index.html

"How do emerging technologies such as biotechnology, computer monitoring, 
and overhead imaging impact privacy and corresponding policy? 

As emerging technologies improve the private and public sectors' ability to 
gather individual information, policymakers must call into question: 

*The balance between security and privacy 

*The difference between perceived and legitimate privacy threats 

*The inter-linkages among emerging technologies and the impact on privacy 

*The roles of government and industry in regulating privacy

Join RAND analysts, legal scholars, policymakers, executive and legislative 
branch officials and business leaders in examining these issues on July 23, 
2001, at RAND's Washington Office. 

RAND's Privacy and Emerging Technologies Conference is sponsored by the 
Arroyo Center."


Unfortunately, it was yesterday, but there are still lots of excellent 
online .pdf documents linked in the "related publications" page:
