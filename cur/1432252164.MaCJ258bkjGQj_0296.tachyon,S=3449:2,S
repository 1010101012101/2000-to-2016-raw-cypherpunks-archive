Do you really think that DRM systems could eliminate cypherpunk
applications?  Have you thought this through in detail?  Please expand
on it.

How many kinds of software would have to be eliminated for this to
be true?  What constitute "cypherpunk applications"?  In how many forms
could they be written and distributed?

What kind of world would be necessary for DRM systems to actually be in
use for the purpose of eliminating cypherpunk applications?
