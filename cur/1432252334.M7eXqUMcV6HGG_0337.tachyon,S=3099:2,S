How can we offer him procedural guarantees enjoyed by U.S. residents
when we won't be the ones conducting procedure at his trial?  He's going
to be tried in the ICC or by Iraqis in Iraqi courts.  We have no good
evidence that he's committed crimes against Americans, and unless we
find some, I don't think that anyone would want him anywhere near a
Federal courtroom.

McRumsfeld and co. should be held accountable if they violate the Geneva
Convention with respect to Saddam or any other prisoner.  But the
procedural guarantees you talk about are attached to U.S. trials, which
Saddam will not enjoy (or dread, depending...).
