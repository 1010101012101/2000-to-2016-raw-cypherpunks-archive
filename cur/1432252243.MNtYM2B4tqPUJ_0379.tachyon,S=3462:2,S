Yep, "citizenQ" is one of the simp-wimps.He hides behind his Hushmail 
and Ziplip accounts, possibly using remailers fed into them, but then 
calls for regulating crypto and privacy.

Not all those calling for key escrow and the other accouterments of 
repression are simp-wimps: some are hopeful sellers of key escrow 
schemes. "Chefron," our Dutch fascist, is one of these hopeful sellers 
of key escrow systems.

The guy who sent out letters to Dorothy Denning, Baker, and others is 
another.

But the arms dealers of repression need the simp-wimp fellow travellers 
to give them moral cover.
