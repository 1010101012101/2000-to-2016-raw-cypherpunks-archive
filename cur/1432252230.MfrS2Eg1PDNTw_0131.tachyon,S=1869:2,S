You may like one side of the coin more than the other one, but they still 
belong to the same flat, dirty, formerly shiny and now dull and mildly 
corroded disc of an alloy of not so noble metals.

Sometimes you get access by telnet. Sometimes by a voice call. Hack the 
mainframe. Hack the secretary. What's better? (Okay, I agree, you can't 
sleep with the mainframe.)

There are many ways to the hilltop. Some travelers argue what one is 
better. Others quarrel if the hilltop is more important than the pathway 
or the other way. Some don't care and march forward.

I feel zen today.
