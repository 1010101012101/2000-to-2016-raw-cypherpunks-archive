I reflected upon that after I had already run my mouth about it.  It didn't 
seem to be presented as a quote, or a "look at this BS I found!" post.  As 
I said, I'd basically ignored it until others began commenting about who 
was/was not on the list.

Looking at it the other way: which set might include people like coderman, 
Jim Bell, Brian Carroll... mk @ desu = libertÃ©.  Nadim K?

If this is someone else's list, it makes no sense to me that coderman would 
be on it (if it were indeed a list of "crackpots and cranks.")  He files a 
lot of FOIA requests, and that probably irks a fair number of people with 
an interest in keeping the info hidden.

Jim: he needs no further explanation.  A glorious thorn in the side of a 
bunch of people would couldn't deserve it more.

And, so on...

It could be some kind of tactic to attempt to squelch voices of 
dissent/advocates of crypto, sure.  They've been doing such things long 
before Snowden found out about it.  Perhaps if I ask nicely, coderman will 
enlighten us as to whether this filter is a list of his own or a random 
pastebin he happened upon?
