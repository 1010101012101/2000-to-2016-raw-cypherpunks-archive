Remember that age verification service which got busted a few years back
when the feds managed to convince a jury that the owners were the "madams
of a child porn bordello," based on two overseas sites which featured
illegal material?

http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.2001.08.06-2001.08.12/msg00433.html

Well, after managing to entrap a few hundred US citizens into ordering KP
from the feds, the feds are now grepping the list of 250,000 customers by
country, and shipping the data off to other nations so that they may
attempt to lure their own citizens as well.

In the UK, this is of course the currently being reported on "Operation
Ore" which is nailing pervy brits right and left, including Who musician
Pete Townshend.

In the US, the distortion continues full speed, with the age verification
service still being referred to as "The World's Largest Child Porn Ring",
with "250,000 child porn customers" paying millions for "pay per view"
access to "over 6000" sites featuring pictures of "babies being raped,"
which is a small part of the "insatiable demand" for the" child sexual
abuse pictures" featured on "over 100,000 web sites", or so Connie Chung
tells us.

Well, at least it makes being in the age verification business exciting.

In the midst of all this frivolity, the Village Voice has written a very
intelligent article on the current charges against Paul Reubens, aka Pee
Wee Herman, which apparently stem from an occasional minor featured in his
vintage collection of 1960's muscle magazines, and a few grainy possible
underage males in his now meticulously combed through collection of
antique 8mm gay porn.

All this, and a dead Echols too.  It's been quite a week. :)
