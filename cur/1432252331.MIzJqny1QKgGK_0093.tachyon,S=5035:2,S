Here's the question Tyler Durden has for you.

Which is more important...annhiliation of the state, or getting a bunch of 
list subscribers to agree that annhiation of the state is a good thing?

You yourself have claimed to be something of a "techno determinist". In 
other words, you've made a good case that Strong crypto will eventually lead 
to collapse of the state...people's BELIEF about the implications of strong 
crypto are largely irrelevant.

"Eurotrash", "New York Collectivists" and so on should be given nice, big 
fat pat on the backs, so long as this will encourage proliferation of strong 
crypto. Who gives a crap what people BELIEVE?

In fact, I'd argue that, if your beliefs prove to be correct, then "making 
people see the implications of strong crypto" is ultimately probably a bad 
thing...not everyone wants to wreck the state. Some people WANT to be able 
to boss others around (or at least want someone else to be doing this). 
Hell, probably most human beings in 2003 are in this category.

Me? I like the Protestant reformation analogy: I'm not convinced strong 
crypto will necessarily lead to destruction of the state, just like the 
reformation didn't lead to destruction of the Catholic church. However, in 
the long run, whatever emerges has got to be better than what we've got 
today.
