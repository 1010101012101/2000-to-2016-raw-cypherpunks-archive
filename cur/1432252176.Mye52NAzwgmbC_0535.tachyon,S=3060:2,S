Hi folks! Here is your regularly scheduled incomplete, cryptic notes
from the Weekly Dev Chat!

in attendance: Zooko, Daira, Andrew, Brian, Amber, Samuel

All tickets were either moved out of the 1.10 Milestone or assigned to
someone. They are all in the state of reviewing and fixing -- no new
code needs to be written.

Brian will cut an RC1 release of v1.10.0 within a week.

Next week's meeting will be a Nuts And Bolts meeting, but it will be
*post-1.10* Nuts and *post-1.10* Bolts! That will be fun!

proposed theme for 1.11 cycle: New automation to lower the friction of
the release process, so we can have more frequent releases. Buildbot
is chugging along, but needs oiling, new robot arms.

LeastAuthority.com submitted a second DARPA proposal. We'll find out
in about two weeks if it got accepted.

Regards,

Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn

Founder, CEO, and Customer Support Rep
