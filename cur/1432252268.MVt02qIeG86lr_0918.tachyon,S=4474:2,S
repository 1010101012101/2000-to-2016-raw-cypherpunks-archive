It's not, really.  Maybe some kind of cover traffic for an underlying
hidden data stream?

Or maybe you will create a client which mimics a human person, and
sends information by choosing what to click on?  Sounds like a pretty
low-bandwidth channel.

These two don't make much sense together: someone is going to sit
there, interacting with a server for hours, clicking every second?
That sounds more like a job than something people would do voluntarily.
You're either going to need to accept a much lower click rate, or else
a much shorter connection time.

Okay, maybe one of the online fantasy games services like EverQuest?
I hear people get addicted to those and spend hours on them, but I
think they do a lot of typing rather than mouse clicks.  Or one of the
shoot-em-ups?  Those probably use the mouse a lot more.  They aren't
really "web applications" though.  Does it really have to be a web app?

Most of those won't satisfy your click rate and connect time goals.

Maybe you could give some more clues...
