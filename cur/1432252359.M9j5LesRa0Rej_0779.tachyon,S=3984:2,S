  White House refuses to talk about Al Gore's plan to Wiretap every
  electronic device in the world

  20th January 2006

  >From today's WhiteHouse press Briefing:
  quote:
  Q Scott, I have a two-part question. Apparently, no one in the White House
  will challenge Al Gore with now public information that he led the Clinton
  administration's Clipper Chip Project back in the 1990s to effectively tap
  every phone, fax machine and computer in the country. And my question:
  Isn't that worth pointing out to the American people, after he accused
  President Bush of breaking the law and violating the Constitution by -

  MR. McCLELLAN: I think you just did. This is an administration that is
  forward-looking, Les. We're focused on the priorities of the American
  people.

  Q Well, how about Gore? You mean you're going to say nothing about Gore and
  the clipper chip project?

  MR. McCLELLAN: I think you already have. No, I'm not going to get into that.
