Apparently, James did not understand the thrust of Aimee's post at all.  The
important thing to understand about legal precedents is that they may show a
TREND in the law.  The common law evolves over time.  To say that no
precedent DIRECTLY ON POINT exists means that you can operate "in perfect
comfort" is asinine.  The question is, what will a court say NEXT?
