Don't forget the no-bid invisible black helicopter contract they also let
to Halliburton. And the one for mind-beams. Don't forget the mind-beams.

My understanding is that this contract is for the detention of illegal
aliens as part of the end of the Border Patrol's "catch-and-release"
program, which has served us so well since Kennedy's Immigration Reform Act
of 1965.

Of course, a "detention facility" is a "detention facility", and can be
used to detain anyone for any reason the government sees fit so to do.

I, for one, *welcome* our new statist overlords. Oh. That's right. They're
not so new, are they?

Cheers,
RAH
