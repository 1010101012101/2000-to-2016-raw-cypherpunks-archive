Ecash is not supposed to be like credit cards.

Had the coins been cashlike, joe pornographer could have sold them under 
the table to the flying nun, who would then cash them in her very 
respectable account, and pay Joe pornographer under the table.

Payee traceability made it possible for the vendor to control who used his 
ecash.  With truly untraceable cash, the vendor can no more control who 
uses his coins than can an issuer of physical coins.
