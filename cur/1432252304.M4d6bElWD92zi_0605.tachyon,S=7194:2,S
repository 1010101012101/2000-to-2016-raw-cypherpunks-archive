[One quibble: I got a russospam sent to an address that I've never used.
So it's not always sent to a "real address." --Declan]

I'd rather have the email than the postal mail.

1) I can more easily quote it in email. If you are for the candiate or
against, this is a good thing.

2) I can save it and search it. Nothing helps keep a politican honest than
their old promises.

3) It is more cheaply stored.

4) Of course, there's always Sanford Wallace's old 'save trees' benefit.

I don't really know what the problem is with political email.  This isn't
truly unsolicited in the sense of broadcast to bogus addresses, which is a
bane to ISPs. Rather, it is broadcast to a list of real addresses.  I
think the anti-spam radicals must be succeeding in getting people
conditioned against getting email.  This is a good segue into noting that
in January, 56% of the bulk emailers fully complied with CAN-SPAM, and
90something percent partially complied.  I haven't seen more recent
statistics, but there have also been some suits against real commerical
operators who haven't complied with CAN-SPAM. So why is almost none of the
spam compliant in my email box?  Could it be that someone is just sending
abuse in the hopes that it will annoy people? (I think the answer is yes)

But, I read a book recently on "Crypto-virology", which presented the
premise that by sending a lot of email from one infected host to another
and encrypting or encoding it at each hop, it was possible to create an
anonymous communication system that the author called a "mix-net". It went
on to describe the utility of mix-nets in extortion and information theft
via virus infection.  Whether this non-commercial junk mail represents a
mix-net or not I think is a testable hypotheses.  One just needs to go
back through the viruses that have been released or captured sending junk
mail, and see if they resend messages after some encyption steps. If they
do, then a mix-net is possible. If they don't, then this is just so much
hypothesizing.

But assuming that this 'mix-net' theory is true, then it certainly means
that we need to have much more attention from law enforcement on viruses
and virus operators.  Not only will this halt extortion and information
theft, but it will halt the deluge of junk email that isn't a real
commercial offer.  My expectation has been that these non-commerical
messages coming from viruses are just anti-spammers trying to annoy people
into banning spam.  Many of these messages appear at first glance to be
commercial, and appear unlikely to be coded.  But some messages contain
random words and character strings. It had been supposed that this is to
confuse Bayesian anti-spam filters, though I doubt it, because bayesian
filters shouldn't be confused--they are trying to distinguish wanted from
unwanted, not spam from non-spam.  But there is some increasing portion of
spam that could be suspected as containing coded messages in the random
words and characters.

But this is somewhat academic, though interesting.  In either case, it is
imperative to have more law enforcement attention on viruses and virus
operators. There really isn't any question of that. And that is the road
to spam solutions.  Just ignore what the anti-spammers tell you.
