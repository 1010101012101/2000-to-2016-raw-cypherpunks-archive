Romania: Mystery of a missing journalist. A newspaper in western Romania 
has appealed for international help find a reporter who went missing two 
months ago. Investigative journalist Iosif Costinas, 62, was last seen by a 
neighbor near a market in his hometown of Timisoara on June 10, said 
Laurian Ieremeiov, deputy editor of the daily Timisoara on August 12.
Thr Romanian rights group Freeex,org, citing Associated Press, reported 
that police had launched an extensive search in the rivers and woods near 
the city, and an adviser to President Ion Iliescu has pledged to support 
local authorities resolve the case, Ieremeiov said. So far these efforts 
have been unsuccessful.
On Sunday, the newspaper sent messages to Reporters Without Borders and to 
Amnesty International, asking for public support in trying to find the 
reporter. Costinas has publishes articles about sensitive subjects, such as 
the unsolved killings during the December 1989 anti-communist revolt and 
the continued presence in high positions of Securitate communist secret 
police officers.
He was just completing a book about the shady business underworld in the 
city located near the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders. "We believe it very 
probable that his disappearance is connected to what he wrote and his 
actions as a member of civil groups trying to find out the truth of the 
revolution," Ieremeiov told AP.
