   It's fairly straightforward to uncover someone's financial and public 
ties to various organizations by looking through public records.  But 
mentioning this possibility among peers is a bit of a conversation 
killer.  No one wants to risk invading the privacy of someone who 
doesn't deserve it (which is virtually everyone with NIST or IETF).

   Incidentally, when I mentioned this to a researcher who grew up in a 
horribly oppressive society, his response was "Why would you not do this 
kind of research?"  So then I was in the awkward position of explaining 
that A) most people care about their careers, B) people don't want to 
invade others' privacy, C) the risk of false-positives is non-zero.

   Do I think that people with suspicious financial ties should be outed? 
  Sure.  But no one wants to do that.  No one wants to be the messenger.

TL;DR: people love handrwringing, hate even mild risk.

best,
Griffin

ps: nah, I don't think that the legitimacy of the WebCrypto API is in 
doubt
