I invented something that I consider quite valuable.

It is an idea for a mathematical method.

It already works as intended, in a business process.

I am not interested in patenting this shit, however, I want to make sure that
I get the credit for this invention when (if ever) it becomes publicly known.

So I would like some kind of real timestamping service. I would prefer
something meatspace based, like a notary or US mail based or whatever.

Any suggestions will be appreciated.
