THIS BOOK IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND!!!

THE FIX, by David R. Myrland

Every politically aware or politically active American should have this =
collection of initiatives, written by an analyst and researcher with =
remarkable insight and talent. For legal professionals and laypersons =
alike - a peaceful way to take the law into your own hands.

Dozens of provisions proposed to solve the things about government we =
like the least.

Initiatives to address the most intrusive encroachments on civil =
liberties, the excessive tactics of law enforcement, discrimination under =
licensing requirements - all in one book.

A responsible and firm hedge against the "homeland security" measures =
that unreasonably infringe on our most treasured liberties.

Decriminalize marijuana, limit pepper spray use, protect SS numbers, =
citizens' review panel, end state income taxes, limitations on the use of =
technology against the innocent, make gov't more friendly - who's the =
boss here anyway?!?! Fairness is lacking in so many instances involving =
gov't that somebody's got to do something.

Complaining aside, let's look at some answers, dozens of them!!!
