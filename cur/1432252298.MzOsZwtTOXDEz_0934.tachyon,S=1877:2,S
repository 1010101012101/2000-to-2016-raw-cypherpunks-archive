I've been installing a Draytek Vigor 2900 router at work lately, and found a
line of models which do VoIP (router with analog phone jacks on them). They
also support VPN router-router, and come with DynDNS clients. I thought I've
seen VoIP over VPN being mentioned, but I can't find it right now.

They're reasonably priced, and have pretty good online support:

I've also been looking at them from vulnerabilities angle, but couldn't find
much. Not even which embedded OS they run on. No glaring remote exploit holes
yet reported.

Everyone has seen http://www.skype.com/download_pda.html
right?
