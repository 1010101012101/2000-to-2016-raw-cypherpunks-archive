Dear *

I am sending you a call for papers for a workshop on free software, free
culture, and open access.
 
We are planning to have a whole track of our program dedicated for Aaron
Swartz, called 'Academia Livre' (Free University).
We are accepting suggestions of activists who can talk about Free
Software tools for scientific research.
Send your contributions and suggestions to us in case you are interested!

all the best,
Luis Felipe.

International Free Software Workshop 2013
-----------------------------------------

>From the pioneer software sharing communities created around UNIX to the
community of Emacs hackers and beyond, Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) development has been growing exponentially, following the
popularization and widespread usage of personal computers and the
Internet. Not only have FOSS communities expanded globally, but also its
body of literature, becoming relevant for computer scientists and
engineers, as well as for researchers in the humanities and social
sciences. In the past decade, FOSS research was consolidated around
questions such as individual motivation, collaborative practices, issues
of scale, governance, and coordination of development efforts, as well
as problems of political economy, involving the study of economic
models, and forms of political mobilization around Free Software.

Our main goal in this workshop is to evaluate the state-of-the-art in
interdisciplinary research, exploring technical, legal, socioeconomic,
and cultural aspects of FOSS. We will focus on the aforementioned
research topics by discussing new contributions to the literature. We
invite paper submissions from any academic discipline on the following
and related topics:

- FOSS licensing and related legal aspects, copyright disputes, software
patents, GPL compliance, collective and individual ownership of code;

- FOSS engineering, development methodologies, source code metrics, and
software quality assessment;

- Social, cultural, and economic studies of FOSS, involving qualitative
and quantitative studies of development and activist communities;

- FOSS case studies: in-depth analysis of cases of implementation,
migration, success, or failure of FOSS projects worldwide;

- FOSS expansion and ongoing transformation: beyond software development
and towards Free Culture, Open Hardware, Open Access, online independent
journalism, and collaborative Internet-based projects.

 
About FISL and WSL
------------------

The International Free Software Workshop (WSL) is a scientific event
which takes place within the International Free Software Forum (FISL).
Since 2000, FISL is organized by Free Software activists in Porto
Alegre, Brazil, and represents one of the biggest and most important
FOSS conferences in the world.

WSL welcomes papers from different disciplinary traditions, offering the
opportunity for professors, researchers, students, and other
professionals to present and discuss original research developed at
research centers, companies, or universities which develop, use,
disseminate, and/or reflect critically upon FOSS in its technical,
legal, socioeconomic, and cultural aspects. This call for papers can be
found translated in other languages at: http://softwarelivre.org/wsl


Information for Authors
-----------------------

   - Papers should be written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish
   - Papers should have a maximum length of 20 printed pages, including
abstract, figures and references
   - Submissions must be in PDF (following the SBC template at
http://tux.gseis.ucla.edu/template_SBC/)
   - Papers should be sent my email to luisfelipe/*/at/*/ucla.edu

Papers will be evaluated by academic reviewers with experience in FOSS
research, considering technical content and relevance for the workshop.
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and
will be available in the open repository of the WSL community page
(http://softwarelivre.org/wsl) under a Creative Commons license:
Attribution 3.0 unported (CC-BY-3.0).

In addition to the conference proceedings, the organizers are planning
to publish a book -- probably in digital format -- with the best
articles submitted to WSL.

For co-authored papers, the authors must define one presenter for
WSL2013. The presenter will receive a promotional code to register free
of charge for FISL. Accommodation and transportation expenses are not
funded by FISL or by the WSL.
