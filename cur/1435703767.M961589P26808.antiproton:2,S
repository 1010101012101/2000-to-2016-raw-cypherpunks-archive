Brin snagged my real attention when he opened with a quote from
John Brunner's 'The Shockwave Rider.'  But I only skimmed the
relevant text on his website because it was all so familiar.  I'm
surprised I never ran into this aspect of his writing before.

A freelance Wizard follows more or less where patronage is
available; if his work product is any good it is, in and of
itself, morally neutral and will tend to enable good faith actors,
if any, to make better decisions.

That said, I personally won't work for "defense" contractors
because I do have a personal problem with mass murder and such,
and in today's political climate there's no denying that all roads
lead to coercive force in the commercial interest.
