	How are you going to make sure that people do the things that 
make them healthy?

	If their health care is paid for by the state (or rather by 
the collective labor of society), then they can engage in any sort of 
behavior they wish and still get covered, so why bother with that 
boring stuff like exercise and leafy green vegetables when you can 
sit back, suck up a six pack, eat some brauts and watch the game on 
the telly?

	Believe it or not, not all people in this world are 
hardworking. Not all people in this world are willing to put forth 
much effort at all, especially for long term issues like health.

	So how are you going to make sure that people do the things 
they need to do to keep them healthy? Pass laws?

	Use force?
