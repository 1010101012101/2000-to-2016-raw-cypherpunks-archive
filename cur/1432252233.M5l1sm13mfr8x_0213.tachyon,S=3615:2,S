Not that it isn't a good direction to head but I wonder what your
time-scale is for the conversion of a society that cannot survive
without an influx of inexpensive resources from foreign sources into
something less colonial? It has to be decades at a minimum.

In the meantime how do we deal with the Islamic Fundamentalist nutters?
Or our own Christian Fundamentalist nutters for that matter. I don't
want to hear about good and evil, Christian vs. Muslim, True faiths vs.
ersatz faiths or right vs. wrong. The crew that did the WTC is
dangerous. Those who are sending anthrax through the mails are
dangerous. Near-term solutions are called for. I would like to see
solutions that don't involve further trashing of our civil rights but I
have no compassion for the terrorists or freedom fighters or whatever
the hell you want to call them.

Mike
