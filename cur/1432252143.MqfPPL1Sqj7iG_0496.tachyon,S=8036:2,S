I suppose "attitude" can be ambiguous, but it's hardly relevant! Being 
obnoxious, unpleasant, etc. has absolutely nothing to do with whether or 
not you know enough about a subject to be worth listening to. Not to name 
names, but I've met several brilliant people who literally make me want to 
run whenever I see them coming--but whom I nevertheless respect to the 
bottom of my shoes for their sheer brainpower. (And in case you haven't 
noticed, I'm definitely not a respectful sort in general, so it means 
something.)Thoroughly looking forward to hearing what a person has to say 
and actively, intensely disliking them is not contradictory in the 
slightest...

Good point. I'm an atheist, but I think Aquinas can worth reading. Marcel 
(the Mystery of Being), Bataille (Inner Experience), Unamuno(Tragic Sense 
of Life), Kierkegaard (Either/Or), Heidegger (Sein und Zeit) Schopenhauer 
(complete works!) also come instantly to mind. I usually have no patience 
for anything mystical, but these authors have been very valuable to me. 
Several orders of magnitude above the usual religious mush.

Right--never let anyone do your thinking for you.

More on this in future posts.

Hm, okay. Nevertheless, I think the point remains.

True. But an overwhelmingly large percentage of concepts floating around 
your head and populating your mental landscape (so to speak) came from 
somewhere else: if you're creative and original, you make new ones out of 
the building blocks of the old. But they didn't just pop out of thin air.

Singular viewpoint?? How so! Talk about different mental contexts... 

And then, there's always the even less noble-minded egocentric motivation 
for recommending books: "read as I read, so you may come to think as I do". 
Discourse as narcissistic propaganda: probably a more common motivation 
that anyone would like to admit.

I think most works that are complex and rich inspire that.. like the ones I 
mentioned above.

Couldn't agree more.

I'm not disagreeing with that at all; I think the real sticking point here 
gets back to the assumptions which led you to bring up the idea 
of "singular viewpoint" and the relative meaning(s) of subjective value 
judgements. I bet a lot would be made clearer to me if you could just back 
up a little and go into that.
