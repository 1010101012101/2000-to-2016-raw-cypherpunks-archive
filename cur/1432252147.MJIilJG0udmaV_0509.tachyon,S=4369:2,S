 >>Your corrections notwithstanding, do you really find it rational to 
expect the
fate of a few citizens to change national policy? Why should it.<<

Read AP you trizzy little bitch...and tremble.

 >>>It is and always has been the policy of the Zionist Entity to regard its
 >>civilians as expendable for propaganda purposes in any hostage situation.<<

  >>So? Only the weak-minded would sit around fretting and crying over what 
happens
to a few people who are likely going to be killed anyway. If I--or anyone I
ever cared about--were hostages, it wouldn't change my mind on this in the
least. The terrorists are the ones responsible for rendering me "expendable",
not whomever they're trying to pressure.  Absolutely despicable, get a spine.<<

Get a dick up your tight little arsehole girlfriend.plug it for a bit.

 >>Fuck negotiation, fuck capitulation. Give in once and you're setting 
yourself
up for more of the same for eternity. Someone says they're going to slaughter
my family unless I do what they want? Go right ahead and see what it gets 
you.<<

They never gave you a credit for "the fifth element" and all those chuck 
Bronson movies,did they? Oh and "the usual suspects" of course.We all ready 
got a Keyser Sose here lady.Why dont you just pull a train and leeeve.

 >>The sentimental don't have a snowball's chance in hell against the 
ruthless:<<

I must remember to have that carved onto your buttcheeks,Pucker up,snowball.

 >>wallowing in the finer points of conscience is a luxury those on the 
wrong side
of a gun just can't afford<<

Wallowing in Tims fetid hot tub is expensive for your street cred you ugly 
fat hoe bitch.

 >>Initiating force and responding to it in kind are
two entirely different issues: just because the Palestinians have a legitimate
cause for complaint doesn't mean they (or Israel, or the US) should get a free
pass. Nobody gets a free pass. ~Faustine.<<

Thinnest books of the world now include the wit and wisdom of 
Justine/Faust.The mephisto waltz just spun *her*out.
