Hi List,

I am a newbie in cryptography. What I have learnt till
now is that in assymeric cryptography scenario we have
a private key and we generate the public key
corresponding to it and then we send it to the central
agency.
Suppose after sometime I have a private key and the
public key. Is there some software tool which can tell
me whether the public key is the same corresponding to
the private key I am having. Also is there some tool
which can tell me whether the keys have been curropted
or not
