some have suggested a rule #5: don't distribute updates automatically
to your users and don't implement security critical functions in code
that is delivered to the client via the server.

i have yet to see a definitive case of a US company forced to include
a backdoor in their software or forced to use their software update
channel to deliver a CALEA/intercept friendly version of code to the
targeted customer.  to date all of these requests appear to be off the
record rather than enforced via judicial motion.

this is a shame, since out of date software itself poses significant
risk, and is best resolved via automatic updates from the vendor.

i'll avoid repeating my "email is for public communication" rant ;)

my reading of this sequence of motions is that at least five different
keys were requested, which seems to imply _all_ SSL/TLS keys,
including those for HTTPS sessions.

e.g. they can request "pen register" information for web traffic!
 (we're a long way from just the dialed digits days...)
