I believe that there's no law or regulation preventing anyone from
writing open source implementations of GSM in the US.

However there definitely are regulations preventing the sale or
operation of unlicensed intentional emitters, and the FCC definitely
cares about the GSM bands.  Getting a license for an open source
implementation of GSM would likely be a large expense, which AFAIK no
open source implementor has even started to try to undertake.

There is also federal law prohibiting the sale of equipment which can
intercept wireless telephony communications.  Many scanners have
filters or programming/configuration jumpers which prevent reception of
the specific frequencies covered by the law.  Depending on the reading
and the zealousness of the prosecutor, such a law might be seen to be
relevant to an open source GSM platform.
