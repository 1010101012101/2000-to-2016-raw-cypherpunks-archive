I don't think anyone would say "don't read the classics." I'd venture
that they're necessary but not sufficient to achieve True Cypherpunkishness.*

More seriously, there are some concepts that lie behind what the recent
threads calls an agora, and some books help clarify them in more detail
than a mailing list discussion can. I know I've benefited from these
recommendations.
