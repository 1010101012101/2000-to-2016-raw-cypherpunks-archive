Though my knowledge of various technologies that are sometimes called
"HAARP" type weapons or technologies associated thereto due to
technological similarities is vast, some recent events should be thoroughly
examined and publicised in order to prevent large-scale mass-destruction
issues or stimulators of global conflict.

Let us start with an examination of fact:

Pull up NOAA Weather maps for the weeks around the 1st of August, 2002.

Notice a large "Tropical storm" in the northern Gulf Coast (South-eastern
USA), one that does not move for over a week.

Notice, in this storm development, that regardless of strong jetstream,
altitude winds to the east/etc in significant force for cloud motion in all
other regions in parallel fashion, this storm cluster did NOT move or
change physical arrangement for almost a whole week.

Note, in the storm layout, 3 distinct clusters of high-energy storms,
static in their position and relation to each other.

Facts:

During this time period, *Vatican* arrives in New Orleans with full
enterage, after a trip through Mexico, and has both ground teams and
"highly relevant people" blanketing the city. So extensive were their
operations, that on numerous occasions in my wanderings through the
Quarter, was I almost hit by a speeding Vatican security transport vehicle.

Vatican had, at the least, 4 *Large* ships, and a number of "support"
vessels, off the coast of New Orleans and Biloxi (MS).

In addition, 4 independant religious groups had additional large vessels
within the same region, some "restocking" for missionary operations
southward, others with unknown relevance. (Not even including the typical
few hundred industrial and transport vessels.)

---

More Facts:

Historicly, the city of New Orleans has a number of significant social,
business, and mainly religious purposes.

New Orleans is founded as the Catholic and Protest churches of europe
engage large-scale war and whatnot, as a haven and secure location for the
storage of both the individuals of high religious significance and their
genetic lines, as well as a LARGE ammount of physical items "stolen" from
the religious facilities and placed away in safe keeping.

These facts of the city's history are public knowledge; charged with the
protectorate thereof, are a LARGE number of social organizations and
related business operations, of global scale, typically considered
"undesirable" entities for cover, many engagued in the global drug empires
and Stateside illicit operations {MOB/Mafia - type operations, covert
intel, counter-intel groups within the FBI, CIA, DEA/DOJ, etc
(Counter-FEDERAL), and a plethra of others. A large majority of corporate
research divisions and related high-industry are also logisticly controlled
from social central groups from/of this city. No less the Media industry.)


The religious implications, are that by definition in a LARGE number of
religious texts, ranging from the Bible through Far-East prophecies, and
all in between, the primary trigger to indicate the "End of the World" is
the *flooding* of a major city designed and charged with the protection and
safety of these various above things.


New Orleans, intentionally, is built below sea level, has a massive vault
and storage structure extending hundreds of feet below the old city, and
remains home to the majority of counter-intel operatives while not on
active duty, no less being a primary port of transport for narcotics
distribution into a majority of the US under federal operations (top level
pre-cut distribution).

I shall let you connect the logic here, but I suggest you review the
*latest* year's worth of mass-media content, most specificly, the Music and
Music Video industries.

Music Videos: the most effective distribution mechanism of concepts and
whatnot immediately into the core of the social population of the US/etc.

Let us check, for example, "Creed" "My Sacrifice" and related videos, their
website has the video available, if you don't see it elsewhere.

The theater, is "State Pallace Theater" (which in reality, currently has no
sign in front), the rest of the buildings there, are all Canal Street of
New Orleans, LA, USA.

Profetic? Not unless someone floods the city.

The relevance extends to approximately 80% of the current mass-media
releases, beit explicit video references such as this, or in
word-interpretation of the vocal tracks.

---

Now lets just say, with the culmination of a LOT of issues that week, would
it not be effective for such entities as christianity's largest church,
coupled with the current dictatorship of the USA, to effectively flood out
a religious-based city in order to start a massive religious war?

War is good for churchs. The current Nazi regime seems to be failing in
starting large-scale religious-motivated wars. ("Islam did it!")

Why not try to flood out a city of known significance? (Im concerned with
the numerous physical devices left both upstream and on the backwater by
the Vatican and their affiliates under religious guise, which most likely
include LARGE explosive charges.)

---

Now go back to your weather maps...

How, do tell, could 3 storms exist in exactly the same location and layout
for over a week naturally?

Now, if per chance, you stuck a stick vertically into a stream, would there
not be "trailing" ripples from doing such?

What if this "stick" is an artificial cloud generating apparatus or
resulting physical ramifications thereof?

Do you see windward trailing ripples in the satilite and weather imagry?

---

Now, granted I publicly started referencing these issues that week, and
directly to some of the priest-type people (Im not gonna say covert, but
they sure as hell weren't serving as tourists...) wandering around that
week...

I'll leave out the rest of the more pertinant issues, and allow you to
ponder the above.

Ponder this publicly.
