The evidence is now overwhelming that the anthrax attacks are
connected to the 9/11 attack, and the current events in
Afghanistan.  However the Fibbies are still determinedly
pushing the position that these attacks come from internal
right wing terrorists.

If the anthrax attack is connected to the 9/11 attack, then
the fibbies get to play errand boy for the CIA and military
intelligence.  If the anthrax attack is internal, then they
are in charge and they get to spy on all us right wing
extremist hate groups.

Let us hope that when they finally admit the anthrax attack
was middle eastern, Aimee gets sent back to pretending to be
a thirteen year old girl in chat rooms.
