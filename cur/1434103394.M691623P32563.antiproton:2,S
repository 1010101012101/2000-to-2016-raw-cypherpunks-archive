Sorry, I'm thinking about it differently - like a physical layer.

Let's name it differently: H2H - HUG node to HUG node, which might be
overlayed over existing ISP/ centralized net, or might be your own PHY
layer (e.g. local street-level wireless).

So, treat this is a PHY layer, where everyone is expected to connect,
relatively speaking, to their neighbours.

A F2F (by terminology/meaning) would overlay on top of that.


> Just stick with I2P or similar traffic anonymization networks and run your

The key that I2P (and Tor for that matter) are missing is fill packets
- i.e., the nodes you talk to, promise to backfill their link to you
(likewise you to them) any empty packet slots, so that the link
maintains a continuous throughput (to hide all real traffic within) -
the only thing a state-level adversary (or ISP-level for that matter)
can do to analyse things is kill the link entirely (shock testing),
which can correlate your traffic with "exit node" traffic, but is much
harder to see anything when you are only operating within the dark
net.

This is now a very important feature which our anonymizing network
software needs in order to provide any meaningful protection.

Local PHY is now also very very useful to increasing network access
anonymity. This urgently needs some research study/papers to analyse/
determine the best ways (within eg onion routing context) to maximise
advantage of off-net (private PHY layers).

> traffic on top of that. Oneswarm (now abandoned, IIRC), RetroShare, or

"Just use..." is very problematic! Please do not be so cavalier with
your languaging as those without understanding might mistake your
absolutist languaging for relevant fact (as opposed to intuitive sense
or reasonable avenue for consideration depending on various factors
.... etc etc)!

There are many models.

I am confident that local off-net PHY connections can go a long way to
increasing anonymity provided by anonymizing P2P networks - it's an
avenue unfortunately untapped, and even more so, not yet studied
academically.

This is one small, yet important, piece of the longer term puzzle.

Great. Looking forward to your thoughts. Please don't portend that
there are easy conclusive "solutions". There are not!

Sounds like you've indeed done some thinking. Thank you very much for
sharing your thoughts.

We evidently have a long way to go, as a community.
