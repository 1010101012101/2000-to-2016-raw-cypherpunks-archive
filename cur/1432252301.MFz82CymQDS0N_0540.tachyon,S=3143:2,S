Somehow letting someone who has lived 15 years with a significant brain 
injury live out the rest of their normal life span just doesn't provoke 
people the same way dehydrating and starving them does.

I don't believe in the existence of a supernatural, but I certainly 
wouldn't take water and food away from any human with a functioning brain 
stem, particularly when there are people to whom that person's life has 
meaning, and who are willing to provide them with care.

The interesting political lesson here is that one stubborn judge, and his 
pals who band together to support him, can defy the will of the President 
of the United States, the Governor of the State of Florida, and a majority 
of both houses of Congress.

Of the three equal branches of government, the unelected branch is more 
equal than the other two.  Of course, we've known that since Marbury vs 
Madison.
