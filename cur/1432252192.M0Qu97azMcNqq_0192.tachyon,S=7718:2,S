Firefox asked me about sharing Geo info today.  I don't often use Firefox
but I had this thread in mind and noted it.  I said no.

<br>
Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which<br>
generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card.<br>
Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .<br>
<br>
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby<br>
wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against<br>
the data collected by google during street view surveys.<br>
<br>
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the<br>
authorities with the closest street address to where you are using<br>
Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that<br>
address. =C2=A0Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being<b=
