The spammers are doing that and more.  For example, recent traffic on 
the NANOG list suggests that they are using false BGP advertisements on 
stolen address blocks to shoot and run.  (There is a proposal to stop 
that via cryptographic authentication of BGP advertisements, but SBGP 
hasn't gotten any traction with most of the operator community yet.  
Just why is a subject for a separate thread.)
