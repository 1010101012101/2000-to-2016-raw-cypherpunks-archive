You need to enable hot-pluggable devices in your kernel configuration
(along with USB storage stuff as well of course). Then, when you insert
the flash, kernel will automagically load all necessary drivers and
call /sbin/hotplug (path set in /proc), which can be a shell script.

are quite cool, I'm using them to distribute configuration, keys and
software upgrades on my security gateways etc., so feel free to ask if
you have any problems.
