The idea of using wifi access points as entry points to the remailer network has been raised before. It seems like a useful service that anyone with an internet connection and a wireless card could offer. It provides cover for the operator's own remailer use, with much lower entry requirements than running a remailer node.

What's the best way to set this up? Some possibilities:

1: Run Mixmaster on the wifi interface. This seems unnecessarily complicated, since users would have to fetch the node keys, and would have to specify the correct remailer as the first hop in the chain.

2: Run a SMTP server on the wifi interface, configured to relay messages to known remailer nodes and refuse all other destinations. Users would have to configure their remailer client to use the server as a SMTP relay.

3: Run a NAT firewall on the wifi interface, configured to allow TCP port 25 connections to known remailers, and block everything else.  Users would have to run their own mail transfer agent.

Option 3 seems to provide the simplest interface for clients running on Unix, since they will probably already have a functioning SMTP agent.  But what about Windows clients?  Do Windows remailer users typically run their own SMTP servers, or do they send via relays?
