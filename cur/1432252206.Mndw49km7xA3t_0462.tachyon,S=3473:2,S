Most DDOS attacks forge their source address, changing between
large numbers of forged addresses, so the site under attack can't
defend itself by blocking the addresses that attack it.
If a Bad Guy has thousands of slave machines, they can still
launch a big attack, but if they need to use their own addresses,
the target can block the attackers (still not easy for large numbers,
but at least it's possible.)
