There is the additional use of evidence raised publicly in LA a few years
back - that LEO routinely passed information collected during wiretapping
to other officers that could be used to collect legal grounds for
admissible search against people not directly related to the initial
wiretapping.  In the LA case, this was sometimes as simple as "be at X at Y
time", where the tipped off LEO could observe an incident "accidentally"
without having to reveal their source.

I'd imagine this would depend on the nature of the investigation.  If the
feds can make a case that unsealing the warrant could compromise a
"critical contact" (even if they are in fact a worthless paid informant
used as a warrant justification factory) or a "critical technical means"
(i.e. Radio Shack directional microphone), its likely this would never be
unsealed.  There are also cases where "national security" is raised by
SS/CIA/NSA/EPA(sic), and the public will never see any of the paperwork
shreds.
