Let's thank Dr Strangelove for his message.

Perhaps the real reason France is jumping in with Russia? (make
America think twice before doing something really stupid like, IDK,
starting a proxy war with Russia - I think Russia has announced that
it recently put its military on nuclear alert, and readiness training
of their nuclear crews, just in case.)

readiness drill on Tuesday"

The Pentagon Goes Nuclear on Russia

"
Putin knows extremely well how dangerous is this posturing. That’s why
he emphasized that the US unilateral withdrawal from the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty – which established that neither
the US nor the USSR would try to neutralize each other’s nuclear
deterrence by building an anti-missile shield – is pushing the world
towards a new Cold War; “This in fact pushes us to a new round of the
arms race, because it changes the global security system.”

And plenty more...
