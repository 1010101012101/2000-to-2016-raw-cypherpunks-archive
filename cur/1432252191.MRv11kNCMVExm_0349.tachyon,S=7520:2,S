Most researchers ultimately work for or at pleasure of
"The Man" through R&E funding, grants, taxes, etc, so
what do you expect? It's the same reason Tor Project gets
endless amounts of shit piled on them for choosing to
accept government funds. It's a fine line. At the same time
you can't deny the benefits the research, usually attacking
your network of choice... someone will do it anyways, or
patching your net more resistant. So you have to take it as
the free for all it is. It doesn't help that politic and media
representing such systems as inhabited nearly entirely by
FHOTI (and where good uses remain unseen by nature), and
whatever bits of morality regarding human subjects may
get used as cannon fodder.

Very few work truly independantly for the fame of building
resistant / resistance systems, let alone anonymously,
sustainably, and at a level that results in a usable product
that is used at scale. Just another reason anon-capable virtual
currencies are feared by governments. They can support
such models. Though as a user, due diligence is still required.

In a connected digital world, that has and is developing faster
than evolution's capacity to deal with it, everything is human
subjects, and that's something everyone involved must consider...
the outcome when your work is inevitably turned towards you
or someone or something you care about... is that the work
you want to be doing?
