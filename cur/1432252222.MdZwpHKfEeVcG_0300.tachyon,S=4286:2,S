My understanding of the attacks this past spring is that:
	a) they were indeed on the backbone BGP peers
	b) that those peers had avoided setting up
	   preshared keys or getting mutually-authenticatable
	   certificates because of the configuration overhead
	   (small on a per-pair basis, but may be large
	   in aggregate)

While inspired by this issue, there may be other solutions (e.g., IMO 
IPsec) which are more appropriate for BGP peers.

Except that certs need to be signed by authorities that are trusted.

I wouldn't think that the encryption need be opportunistic; in the BGP 
backbone world, as you noted, peers are known a-priori, and should have 
certs that could be signed by well-known, trusted CAs.
