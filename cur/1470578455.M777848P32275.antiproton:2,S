If the following were not true, we'd be incredulous that someone would
propose such an unbelievable and lame movie plot.

Sadly, this is what North America and NATO stand for.




I Thought NATO “Liberated” Libya in 2011?
http://journal-neo.org/2016/08/04/i-thought-nato-liberated-libya-in-2011/

“Operation Unified Protector is one of the most successful in NATO’s
history… We have done this together for the people of Libya, so they can
take their future firmly and safely into their own hands. Libyans have
now liberated their country. And they have transformed the region. This
is their victory” - Former NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh
Rasmussen, speaking in October, 2011.
http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_80052.htm

“In Libya, the death of Muammar al-Qaddafi showed that our role in
protecting the Libyan people, and helping them break free from a tyrant,
was the right thing to do” – US President, Barack Obama, speakingin
October, 2011.
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-obama-foreignpolicy-idUSTRE79L0MH20111023

“I am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Tripoli and on behalf of
the American people I congratulate Libya. This is Libya’s moment, this
is Libya’s victory, the future belongs to you” – Former US Secretary of
State and Democratic Nominee for President, Hillary Clinton, speaking in
October, 2011.

On August the 1st, US warplanes bombed Islamic State (IS/ISIS/ISIL)
targets in the Libyan city of Sirte, almost exactly five years after
Western imperialists declared NATO’s 2011 war in Libya a complete
success.
http://journal-neo.org/2015/10/17/nato-s-humanitarian-intervention-in-libya-exacerbated-humanitarian-suffering/

These strikes are not the first conducted by the US in Libya this year,
in a broader campaign that is officially aimed at defeating an enemy
that the US had a major hand in creating in the first place (I’m sure
the military-industrial complex isn’t complaining however).

Peter Cook, the Pentagon’s Press Secretary, said in a statement released
on the 1st of August in relation to the strikes that:
http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/881794/statement-by-pentagon-press-secretary-peter-cook-on-us-air-strike-in-libya
“Today, at the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord
(GNA), the United States military conducted precision air strikes [which
is Orwellian/Pentagon-speak for dropping bombs (not uncommonly on
civilians)] against ISIL targets in Sirte, Libya, to support
GNA-affiliated forces seeking to defeat ISIL in its primary stronghold
in Libya… The U.S. stands with the international community in supporting
the GNA as it strives to restore stability and security to Libya.”

Wait a minute though, have I missed something? I thought Libya was
“liberated” in 2011 and the country is now a beacon of ‘freedom and
democracy’ for the Middle East and North Africa? Are the Libyan people
not enjoying being “free from a tyrant;” similar to the liberty the
Syrian people will experience if Assad the ‘tyrant’ is overthrown and
the country is handed over to al-Qaeda?

Since the future belonged to the Libyan people in 2011, is the country
not a vibrant and prosperous democracy today? Is Libya not one of the
major hubs of the Mediterranean, with trade booming and flocks of
tourists travelling from across the world to sample the delights of the
country – from the fascinating culture of the indigenous people to the
stunning (I must admit) Roman ruins?

I thought the standard of living for the average Libyan was much higher
than it was before the tyrant was deposed? Is Libya not helping to build
the African continent up to try and alleviate the millions of people who
live in poverty?

I thought the “most successful” campaign in NATO’s history meant that
terrorism could not gain a foothold in the country, considering the
Western alliance spends the majority of its time (after antagonising
Russia that is) talking about fighting terrorism? I thought NATO’s
love-bombs only hit the baddies, and never killed or maimed any
civilians?

Are the Libyan people not enjoying the fruits of another Western foreign
policy success story? Are the Libyan people not enjoying the stability
that always follows a Western war of aggression? I thought the Libyan
“kinetic military action” was yet another triumphant imperial endeavour,
just like Afghanistan, Iraq and the numerous other countries that were
lucky to be the targets of Western ‘humanitarian’ forces?
