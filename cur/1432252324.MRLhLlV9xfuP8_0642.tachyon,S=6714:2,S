Code breakers believe Poe puzzle solved after 150 years




*	Text of Poe's messages


By JEFF DONN, Associated Press

WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (November 30, 2000 3:51 p.m. EST
http://www.nandotimes.com) - Edgar Allan Poe, master of the mysterious and
the macabre, may have uttered his last words from beyond the grave.

A coded message published by Poe in 1841 in a magazine where he worked as
editor has been deciphered with the help of modern computing and the
intuition of a young puzzle solver, 151 years after Poe's death.

As it turns out, the translated passage wasn't Poe's message for readers
yet unborn or a key to comprehending his enigmatic stories. In fact, the
passage is so inept and sentimental he probably didn't write it all. But
the mystery of whether he selected and encoded the passage remains.

It was one of two encoded texts that Poe presented as the work of a "Mr.
W.B. Tyler," challenging readers to break their codes.

No one did -- maybe no one cared to -- until scholars, in recent years,
began embracing the theory that Poe himself came up with the messages and
devised the codes.

The theory holds that Poe, obsessed with death and premature burial in "The
Tell-tale Heart" and other stories, would have encrypted his own words in
nearly impenetrable code meant to be pried open only long after his death.

In 1992, Duke University doctoral student Terence Whalen, while
procrastinating on his dissertation, finally decoded the first message. It
was a passage from the 1713 play "Cato" by English writer Joseph Addison.

But it took computer power and more time to fathom the second.

"I can't really say if I cared what it would say, one way or the other. But
I was curious to see what it would yield," said Gil Broza, a 27-year-old
computer programmer from Toronto who cracked the code.

For his solution, he was awarded $2,500 in October by Williams College, in
Williamstown. Shawn Rosenheim, a Poe scholar there who had pondered the
problem for years, established the contest in 1996.

The two texts were much like complex versions of today's newspaper
cryptograms. In Poe's time, they were often called "ciphers."

The first cipher put the original message backward. But its solution took
just a few days, because each letter in the original message matches just
one other letter in the code.

The second cipher is far more complex. Each letter in the original has
multiple variants. The letter "e," for example, has 14. The code freely
mixes upper and lower case and turns some characters upside down.

It is also maddeningly brief -- fewer than 150 words -- and so a discovered
letter may provide clues to few words. It is also littered with what appear
to be typographical errors.

Rosenheim and many others tried to solve it and failed. The breakthrough
came when Broza decided, in traditional deciphering technique, to assume
that each three-letter code word could represent "the," "and," or "not" and
to play with the possibilities. With a computer program of his own design,
he scanned lists of phrases showing the same patterns of letters.

He finally identified four letters in one word and conjectured correctly,
like a contestant on "Wheel of Fortune," that it was "afternoon." That gave
him yet more letters to decode more words and ultimately the whole text,
within two months of work.

The deciphered message is a treacly passage wholly unlike Poe's work, with
references to sultry breezes, amorous zephyrs and delicious languor.

"I can't imagine Poe would have taken the trouble to construct an elaborate
cryptogram to disguise something this banal," said J. Gerald Kennedy, a Poe
expert at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

On the other hand, Poe was a prankster who used to write anonymous reviews
of his own work, accusing himself of plagiarism. Some believe Poe chose the
name Tyler to tweak President John Tyler, whose administration had passed
over the chronically broke Poe for a job.

In the end, the solved texts do touch on themes that preoccupied Poe, like
immortality and enclosure, but neither appears to be the coveted message to
posterity. They don't even indicate definitively if Poe encoded them.

"I spent years of my life on this," Rosenheim said this week. "But I might
be wrong."

"You can make an argument one way or another," said Whalen, now at the
University of Illinois in Chicago.

"That's just like Poe -- and just like life," he added. "There's always
another question."
