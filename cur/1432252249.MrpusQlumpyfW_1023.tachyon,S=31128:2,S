Fox News' Audience Is Literally Dying: Is Roger Ailes' Grand Experiment in Propaganda Doomed?
There are certain demographic realities that can't be ignored.
April 17, 2013  |


The following article first appeared on the Nation. For more great content, sign up for their newsletter here.

In the annals of Fox News, October 2012 will likely stand out as a shining 
moment. Buoyed by a wave of Republican optimism about Mitt Romney's 
presidential campaign, the network seemed tantalizingly close to realizing 
one of its key ideological goals: ousting President Obama from the White 
House. Renewed enthusiasm among conservatives was, in turn, triggering 
record-high ratings for much of the network's programming and helping it to 
beat not just rival news competitors MSNBC and CNN during prime time, but 
every other TV channel on the cable dial. What's more, the prospect of an 
ascendant GOP come January meant Fox News might soon return to the era of 
access and prestige it enjoyed in Washington during the presidency of 
George W. Bush. The future looked so bright that News Corporation CEO 
Rupert Murdoch signed Fox News president Roger Ailes to a lucrative 
four-year contract extension, even though the 72-year-old Ailes's existing 
contract wasn't due to expire until 2013.

Then November arrived, and with it reality.

Fox News's shellshocked election night coverage, punctuated by Karl Rove's 
surreal meltdown upon hearing of Obama's victory in Ohio and, thus, the 
election, capped off a historic day of reckoning for the network and 
conservatives alike. Chastened by defeat, Republican politicians and 
right-wing pundits have subsequently been grappling with the repercussions 
of the caustic tone and incendiary rhetoric their movement has adopted. 
This ongoing debate about whether broadening conservatism's appeal  
requires new messages or just new messaging has ignored the 800-pound 
gorilla in the room, however. Noticeably absent from all the right wing's 
public self-criticism is any interest in confronting the potent role played 
by the Republican Party's single most important messenger, Fox News.

Standing at the epicenter of the networkband any new Republican Party 
groundswellbis Ailes. A former political operative of President Richard 
Nixon, Ailes has inextricably intertwined his professional and political 
pursuits since founding Fox News in 1996. Indeed, the network chief 
functions as a kind of proxy kingmaker within the party, frequently meeting 
with Republican politicians to offer strategic advice. He is a regular 
confidant of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, and at various times, 
he (or a network emissary of his) has counseled 2008 GOP vice presidential 
candidate Sarah Palin, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Gen. David 
Petraeus on their potential future. "Ailes," says former Reagan White House 
economic adviser Bruce Bartlett, "is quite open about offering his free 
advice to Republicans.... If you visit New York City, you go see Roger 
Ailes and kiss his ring. It's like visiting the Vatican. My guess is that 
there's a lot of back-and-forth between Ailes and whoever is at the 
pinnacle of power in the Republican Party."

To keep relying on a shrinking number of elderly, white and male subsets of 
the public, whether to win elections or win ratings, has become a strategy 
of diminishing returns, however. "I think that you can't separate the 
problem at Fox [News] from the problem that the Republicans are going 
through," Bartlett says. He can speak firsthand to this incestuous 
relationship, as his 2006 book, Impostorbwhich broke with party orthodoxy 
over the Bush administration's deficit spendingbquickly made him persona  
non grata at Fox News, he says. (Fox News did not respond to questions 
about his comment.) "The Republicans are trying to retool to win. That's 
all they care about, and they're trying to decide, 'How can we be more 
pragmatic? How can we shave off the rough edges? How can we get rid of the 
whack jobs who are embarrassing us, costing us Senate seats? But at the 
same time, we can't do this in such a way that it alienates our base.'" Fox 
News faces a similar dilemma, Bartlett contends: "It's 'How do we  
modernize? How do we attract new audiences without losing the old audience? 
How do we remain relevant without abandoning our traditions?'"

These are fundamental questions, and lately Fox News's 
b(fundamentalsbaudience, ratings and public trustbhave faltered. A 2010  
study by Steve Sternberg found the network's viewership to be the oldest 
(with an average age of 65) among an already elderly cable news audience. 
(CNN's was 63 and MSNBC's was 59.) By comparison, lifestyle cable channels 
Oxygen, Bravo and TLC were among the youngest, with an average viewer age 
of 42. And with MSNBC's recent decision to plug 34-year-old rising star 
Chris Hayes into the coveted b(8 pm slot, the average age of that network's 
prime-time hosts will now be 45, while Fox News's rotation, anchored by 
63-year-old Bill O'Reilly, has an average age of 57.

Having cable news's oldest average age for both prime-time hosts and 
audiences represents something of a double-edged sword for Fox in the 
cutthroat world of cable TV. One advantage is that older audiences are 
traditionally more loyal, which is why several industry experts say that 
Fox News is unlikely to be dislodged from its perch atop overall cable TV 
news ratings anytime soon. This age-loyalty effect redounds to the benefit 
of Fox News's best-known prime-time hosts, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, 
as roughly two-thirds of their viewers are age 50 or older, according to a 
recent Pew State of the News Media survey.

But at the same time, there is an undeniable actuarial reality at workbor 
as Bartlett bluntly puts it, "Their viewership is quite literally dying." 
The most lucrative advertising dollars flow to TV shows that attract 
viewers "in the demo," short for "demographic"bindustry parlance for people 
ages 25 to 54. By contrast, Fox News's prime-time commercial breaks are 
blanketed with pitches for cheap medical devices and insurance companies 
aimed at retirees and the elderly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the network's 
advertising rates have grown at a much more modest pace in recent years, 
according to the Pew survey. Similarly, the growth of its ad revenues has 
diminished every year since 2008.

Because of the relatively older age and smaller size of the cable news 
audience, viewership tends to be relatively stable, says Columbia 
University Journalism School professor and former NBC News president 
Richard Wald. "Its [ratings] move in very small increments." To understand 
why viewers come and go, he compares a TV network's audience to a target 
with concentric rings. The core audiencebthose who are loyal to your 
channel and watch frequently (and, for partisan media outlets, those who 
are most ideologically compatible)bis the bull's-eye. Each concentric ring 
outward represents a segment of the audience that is less likely to watch 
because of diminished interest or less enthusiastic partisan sympathies. 
Dramatic ratings shifts can occur, but they tend to be driven by external 
events, like elections, rather than programming and thus affect all of the 
networks simultaneously. Most ratings fluctuations are statistical noise, 
Wald says, resulting from people in the outermost rings tuning in or out 
based on varying interest. "I would guess that [Fox News's] numbers could 
change by 5, 6, 7, 8 percent and not reflect a change in the loyalty of the 
audience."

But here, too, the news does not bode well. Though the network did retain 
its status as the top-rated cable news network in 2012bits eleventh 
consecutive year at number onebthe steep drop in ratings that its shows 
have experienced since Election Day has raised eyebrows, precisely because 
corresponding shows on MSNBC and CNN have not experienced the same 
precipitous decline.

Just how much of a drop are we talking about? According to Nielsen data, 
Fox News's prime-time monthly audience fell to its lowest level in twelve 
years in January among the 25-to-54 demographic. Daytime Fox News 
programming likewise saw its lowest monthly ratings in this age cohort 
since June 2008. Even the network's two biggest stars, O'Reilly and 
Hannity, have not been immune from viewer desertion: Hannity lost close to 
50 percent of his pre-election audience in the final weeks of 2012, and  
O'Reilly more than a quarter. The slide hasn't stopped in 2013, either. 
Compared with a year ago, O'Reilly's February prime-time ratings dropped 
b(26 percent in the coveted 25-to-54 demographic, his worst performance 
since July 2008. Hannity's sank even further, to the lowest point in his 
show's history.

As Wald points out, short-term ratings snapshots can be deceptive. But in 
the weeks following Obama's 2009 inauguration, Fox News's viewership 
actually surged, averaging 539,000 prime-time demo viewers versus 388,000 
and 357,000 for CNN and MSNBC, respectively. This past January, however, 
Fox could only muster 267,000 average nightly viewersba 50 percent drop 
from that 2009 level, and not much more than MSNBC's 235,000 or CNN's 
200,000.

So why are all these Fox News viewers tuning out? Some of the decline may 
be due to a broader cultural trend of people deciding to avoid cable TV 
news altogether. However, a recent Public Policy Polling survey of news 
media trustworthiness suggests there's more going on than public apathy. In 
February, PPP found a marked drop in Fox News's credibility. A 
record-highb(46 percent of Americans say they put no trust in the network, a 
nine-point increase over 2010. What's more, 39 percent name Fox News as 
their least-trusted news source, dwarfing all other news channels. (MSNBC 
came in second, at 14 percent.)

As might be expected, Fox News's credibility barely budged among liberals 
and moderates (roughly three-quarters of whom still distrust the network) 
and very conservative viewers (three-quarters of whom still trust it). 
However, among those who identified themselves as "somewhat conservative," 
the level of trust fell by an eye-opening 27 percentage points during the 
previous twelve months (from a net plusb47 percent  "trust" rating in 2012 
to plusb20 percent now). Only a bare majority of center-right  
conservatives surveyed by PPP say that Fox News is trustworthy.

"The people who are among the moderate-rights are actually the ones tuning 
out most," says Dan Cassino, a political science professor at Fairleigh 
Dickinson University who specializes in studying partisan psychology. Last 
May, Cassino conducted a survey that found Fox News's viewers were less 
informed about current political issues than those who watched no news at 
all. In response, the network's public relations team mocked FDU's college 
ranking in Forbes and belittled its student body as "ill-informed." This 
kind of ad hominem attack symbolizes the over-the-top, pugilistic messaging 
style of Ailes, whose no-holds-barred political instincts have dictated the 
network's direction since day one.

Ailes's foundational idea for Fox News, explains Washington Post media 
critic Erik Wemple, was to package this bias under the guise of "fair and 
balanced" news. "It is indeed the artifice of neutrality that makes so much 
of what they do objectionable, or not just objectionable but noteworthy," 
Wemple says. And it is effective, he adds: at a recent Value Voters 
conference, rock-ribbed conservatives almost involuntarily spouted the 
network's motto back at him when he asked them about Fox's coverage. It's a 
maddeningly clever bit of misdirectionbthe network whose branding is most 
identified with objectivity and accuracy is, in fact, anything but.

"Fox viewers are the most misled...especially in areas of political 
controversy," Chris Mooney writes in The Republican Brain, his 2012 book 
about the psychology of right-wing myths. The network's singularly 
corrosive impact on its viewers' understanding of reality, confirmed by 
numerous studies Mooney highlights in his book, is amplified by this "fair 
and balanced" motto, he says. It delegitimizes all other news media to 
create a vicious feedback loop within the right wing.

Thanks to its loyal conservative audience and its cozy relationship with 
the GOP leadership, Fox News has long been insulated from the consequences 
of its serial misinforming. "If your job is to say the most outrageous 
thing you possibly can and be rewarded for it, why shouldn't you?" Cassino 
points out. "As long as you get ratings, you're going to keep on doing it." 
But the recent erosion in ratings and cracks in the network's reputation, 
Cassino says, have created external pressure to make changes inside the 
network. (Neither Ailes nor anyone else at Fox News would comment when 
contacted for this story.)

Most notable among these post-election changes involved Fox News ridding 
itself of contributors Sarah Palin and Dick Morris and replacing them with 
former Congressman and left-wing gadfly Dennis Kucinich, former GOP Senator 
Scott Brown of Massachusetts, and RedState.com editor in chief Erick 
Erickson. To some, this personnel turnover confirmed that Fox News was 
embracing a more intellectually honest, ideologically diverse worldview.

But there's less here than meets the eye. First of all, the impact an 
individual contributor can have on the network's overall nature is minimal; 
permanent hosts like O'Reilly and Hannity drive its day-to-day brand. And 
in the midst of the 2012 campaign, Ailes locked up O'Reilly and Hannity as 
well as news host Bret Baierbthe Fox News lineup from 7 through 10 pmball 
the way to 2016. What's more, one shouldn't read too much into the 
cashiering of Palin and Morris, since, by all accounts, they were terrible 
at their jobs: the former was criticized internally for being uncooperative 
with programming suggestions and personally disloyal to Ailes, while the 
latter was guilty of humiliating the network with his ridiculous election 
predictions (as well as auctioning off an unauthorized personal tour of Fox 
News' studios at a GOP fund-b(raiser). "They were only interested in  
promoting themselves or perhaps promoting an ideology that may not win," 
says Bartlett, who singles out Palin's lack of substance for his harshest 
criticism. "Totally and professionally, she's the Lindsay Lohan of cable 
news."

Indeed, Ailes's new hires are little more than new faces plugged into a 
well-worn programming strategy. Kucinich fills the slot of house liberal 
formerly occupied by Alan Colmes, serving as a handy foil for conservatives 
to shout at or over. The telegenic Brown, a blue-state Republican, endorses 
textbook anti-woman Republican policies, but does so without giving off an 
overtly extremist vibe. And die-hard conservative Erickson is there to 
reassure the Tea Partiers and the netrootsbsome of whom inexplicably 
believe that Fox News is drifting leftbthat they still have a voice on the 
network.

Erickson is an interesting case. In February, not long after being hired by 
Fox, he posted a refreshingly frank essay complaining that the conservative 
media functions like an "echo chamber" that "peddle[s] daily outrage." 
Erickson, however, was careful not to include his new employer by name. Of 
course, selective indignation is something of a running theme for him. 
After accusing Supreme Court Justice David Souter of bestiality and 
pederasty in 2009, it took him almost a year to apologizebwaiting until 
after he took a prominent pundit gig at CNN. "Erick Erickson is obviously a 
whack job by the standards of a normal person," says Bartlett. "But within 
the ranks of the right-wing wacko universe, he is far closer to the center 
than, say, Sarah Palin, because at the bottom, he wants to win, see, where 
people like Sarah Palin don't give a fuck about winning."

Winning, famously, is what drives Ailes, and Rove as well. In the aftermath 
of the election, Fox instructed Rove to lie low for several weeks. But this 
benching didn't last long, and by mid-b(January the network had signed him 
to a new multi-year contract. Coincidentally, Rove launched a new project 
geared toward finding more electable candidates for 2014 just a few weeks 
later. But if the past is prologue, many of these future candidates won't 
be acceptable to fellow Fox commentator Erickson. "This is perfect grist 
for the sort of stuff Fox loves to do: 'Let's have a debate between 
somebody on the right and somebody on the far right,'" Bartlett explains. 
"That suits their agenda just fine."

In other words, the best interests of Fox News and those of the Republican 
Party, though inexorably connected, aren't always aligned. The currency of 
the former is ratings and of the latter, votes. "There's always a tension 
between the two," says Jonathan Ladd, political science professor at 
Georgetown University and author of the 2012 book Why Americans Hate the 
Media and How It Matters. But because the GOP relies so heavily on Fox News 
to reach its constituents and spread its message, the network exerts its 
own gravitational pull on the party. "If the Republican Party wants to make 
an ideological shift, if they want to modify their vision on immigration, 
say, it matters a lot if Fox commentators and management are willing to go 
along with that," Ladd points out.

Fox News clearly jumped out in front of the party on the immigration issue. 
Only two days after Obama's re-election, Hannity, a hardline opponent of 
undocumented immigrants, came out on his radio program (which is not 
affiliated with Fox News) in favor of a pathway to citizenship for them. To 
gun-shy Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio, who had spent 2012 opposing 
just such a proposal, Hannity was sending an unmistakable signal: they 
would now have some political cover on the network if they similarly  
changed their public views, which Rubio quickly did. In a February article 
in The New Republic, Ailes, too, made a point of striking a more moderate 
tone toward Hispanics and said he dislikes the term "illegal immigrant," 
which the Fox News Latino network no longer uses. These changes of heart, 
it should be noted, involve only as much courage as it takes to agree with 
the owner of the company. One day after Obama's re-election and one day 
before Hannity's epiphany, Rupert Murdoch had tweeted: "Must have sweeping, 
generous immigration reform, make existing law-abiding Hispanics welcome."

Whether these recent, road-to-Damascus conversions are genuine or 
artificial may not matter much at this point, though. Hannity and many of 
his Fox News colleagues have invested so much time inciting animosity 
toward "illegals" and excoriating legislative attempts at "amnesty" that 
the network has acquired a reputation of harboring anti-Hispanic 
tendencies. In the aforementioned PPP poll on media trustworthiness, 
Hispanics ranked Fox News as their least credible news source, with a net 
four-point negative rating. (Broadcast news networks all enjoyed 
double-digit positive ratings.) Likewise, a National Hispanic Media 
Coalition survey from last fall found that Fox News hosts were more likely 
than those from any other network to negatively stereotype Latinos. It also 
noted that the network's audience had the highest percentage of viewers 
with negative feelings about Hispanics and undocumented immigrants.

Jim Gilmore, the former Republican governor of Virginia and current head of 
the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank, warned against 
just this type of demographic alienation in a January interview with 
National Review. "Shrillness and extreme language are driving away the 
voters who could help us build a majority," Gilmore said. When contacted 
for this story, Gilmore made a point of saying that the network is "vital" 
to the conservative movement and added that his critique was not an  
implicit indictment of Fox News: "All I can say is that if they are doing 
anything like that and polling is reflecting it, they ought to stop it, 
because that would reflect badly on the Republican Party."

That Gilmore's willingness to confront the party's mistakes hasn't yet 
caught up to understanding what's causing them is symbolic of the broad 
dilemma confronting the conservative movement right now. The unquestioning 
faith in Fox gives the network little incentive to undertake real change, 
since it allows Ailes to feel confident those prodigal conservative viewers 
will eventually return to the fold. While Fox still enjoys ratings 
victories, albeit narrower ones, conservatives have suffered significant 
losses at the ballot box in three of the past four national elections. And 
they face the prospect of even more defeats if they don't lead their 
movement out of the wilderness of serial misinformation and forgo the 
temptation of perpetual outrage.

Arresting this descent into grand conspiracy theories and self-destructive 
rancor won't be easy, though. "It makes it very difficult for guests who 
are being asked about Benghazi and Solyndra to talk about concrete policy 
issues," Cassino notes. Gilmore, at least, acknowledges as much. "It is our 
burden to go on Fox News and give the right message," he says. "If for some 
reasonbratings or whatever the reason isbthe commentators try to drag you 
to a place where you ought not to be, you have to resist going there."

John Stuart Mill, in his famous treatise On Liberty, understood that a 
"healthy state of political life" must necessarily include "a party of 
order or stability, and a party of progress or reform." So where exactly 
the conservative movement goes from here becomes a critical issue, since 
the Republican Party isn't about to spiral into electoral irrelevance 
anytime soon. Therefore, the degree to which it is grounded in reality and 
willing to collaborate reasonably in governance should matter a great deal 
to liberals, specifically, and to our democracy in general.

The devil's bargain that Ailes struck between his network and his politics 
seventeen years ago, however, looks unlikely to change within the 
foreseeable future. Fox News remains an all-too-comfortable gilded cage for 
Republicansbone that showcases the party but also shelters it from the 
slings and arrows of honest intellectual debate. One can rigidly confine an 
ideology for only so long, however, before its beliefs begin to ossify and 
its policies atrophy. It's an ironic twist: the more the network enables 
conservative ideas to stray from the mainstream, the less appealing the 
network's conservative coverage becomes. And after years of deeming their 
codependent relationship an unalloyed good, it's time Fox News and the 
Republican Party face cold reality. For both to enjoy long-term future 
success, each must recognize that the other isn't its salvation; instead, 
they're both part of the problem.
