So your claim is that when the FBI, BATF, etc. moved into that building
not a single one of them actualy executed on the required threat plan? And
during the execution of that plan nobody noticed the child care center or
considered the impact of an attack on them?

Not bloody likely.

It might be interesting to look at the results, doubt you can get them
from FOIA.
