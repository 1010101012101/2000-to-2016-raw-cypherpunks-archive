Create a loopback device.  "-k" means encrypt - cipher is blowfish,
there's no way to change it.  After vnconfig, /dev/svnd0 becomes a block
device; use newfs and mount as with any partition.

Here's the man page:

The performance hit is acceptable, it's much faster than CFS.  OpenBSD's
encrypted swap uses the same mechanism.

Agreed.
