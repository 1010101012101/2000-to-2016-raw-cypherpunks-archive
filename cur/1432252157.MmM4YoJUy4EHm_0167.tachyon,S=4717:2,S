it is INDIVIDUAL encryption. want to spam 100,000 people? gotta encrypt
your spam 100,000 times to 100,000 different keys. if you have a fast
machine that takes only a second to do so, it'll cost you just over a
day...

this process is exactly as complicated as you sending me a PGP-encrypted
message. remailer or not doesn't make a difference.

don't you get it? all we do is couple remailers with PGP encryption,
enforcing the second by a simple test in the first.

it's my remailer, and I can do to it whatever I like. you are, of
course, free to not use it.

several have been discussed here over the past week or so. none are
perfect, but most are good enough to distinguish between spam (which has
a describeable structure) and encrypted stuff (which, too, has a
describeable structure).

there is no additional complication. to prove that, I'm in the process
of setting up just such a remailer. this takes some time since I have no
experience in remailer operation, but it'll be done. if anyone wants to
help me, send me a mail

I can see whether or not a text is greek or russian without
understanding it. likewise, I bet you that anyone on this list can
identify an ASCII-armoured PGP message with a single glance. shouldn't
be too tough to teach that to a machine, should it?

please take a look at the simple script I posted here recently. tell me
how you want to get it to accept any of the standard spam messages.
hint: adding a fake PGP header won't work.
