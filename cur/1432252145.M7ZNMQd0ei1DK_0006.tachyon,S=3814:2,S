This is a worthy topic for those who may soon be in the
position of the detainees.

Some accounts say that a fair number of the detainees are
in NYC. If that is so, then prisoner treatment is quite harsh,
not only by the guards but by magistrates and the US Attorney's
Office.

Defense attorneys are kept on a very, very short lease despite
complaints of unfair treatment of their clients and themselves.

These procedures were described in exquisite detail during
the USA v. bin Laden et al trial earlier this year:

  http://cryptome.org/usa-v-ubl-dt.htm

Use the search on Cryptome to find the transcripts describing
the comb attack.

The harsh treatment appears to have been the cause of one
prisoner attacking a guard (reputedly a soft-heart) with a 
sharpened comb, blinding the man in both eyes and causing 
permanent brain damage. The treatment then got worse, and 
likely continues for new detainees.

In the case of the deceased Pakistani in New Jersey's Hudson
County jail: that pen is well-known for its brutal treatment of
non-Mafia prisoners, especially if they are colored any shade 
other than vomit, and the Paki may have been taken out by the
guards and or other prisoners in patriotic fervor, or just 
as a result of the usual racist sadism.

Most federal, state and city jail guards hereabouts are about 
the same quality as airport security personnel, and get their 
kicks abusing prisoners, lying about it, and getting winked at
by judges and prosecutors. 24 x 7 tapes regularly disappear
in case of an incident.

If airport security is federalized watch your carass even more

than before terrorism became an excuse for suicide by cop.
