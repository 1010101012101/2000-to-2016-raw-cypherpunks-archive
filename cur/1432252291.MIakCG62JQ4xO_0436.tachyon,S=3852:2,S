Deliberate vagueness on Asscruft's part, I suspect. As I understand it,
most of the Arab-looking men in custody are being held on technical
immigration charges. Thanks to changes in the law a couple of years ago,
immigrants in violation can be held indefinitely without trial or legal
representation, or even deported based on secret evidence. And
immigration laws are like traffic laws: it's virtually impossible to go
through life without an occasional technical violation.

INS's motto: Habeus corpus is for citizens.
