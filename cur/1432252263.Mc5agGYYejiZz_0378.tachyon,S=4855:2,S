I find far more joy in reading a book, eating a meal, drinking a good 
bourbon, riding my bicycle in Monterey, or hanging out in my recliner 
and surfing the Net while watching a movie on HBO...than I would in 
popping MDMA or whatever it is they do and dancing in a trance to 
some DJ making records go backwards.

The fact that _all_ of the so-called music entertainers at the SF 
event are "trancers" is...symptomatic...of something.

I hope they have fun.

Feh.
