I assume this means that nobody cares any longer about finding WoMD?

So does this mean we're going to skip over Damascus but continue west to
Paris?  We've liberated it before from foreign occupiers.  I guess we
now need to liberate it from itself.  I wonder, would a liberated France
be more resistant to a U.S.-organized constitutional convention than
Iraq looks like it will be?

Here I am watching a bunch of government lawyers at the 2002-11-22 ABA
conference worrying themselves to death over how to prevent spying
restrictions on domestic communications from going into effect when
"foreign terrorists" use hotmail accounts, and all I can do is laugh.
