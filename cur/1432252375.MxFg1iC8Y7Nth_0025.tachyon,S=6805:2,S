Though it is perhaps helpful for them to make such classification here:
a) that's in regards largely to exports, not internal use
b) the phrase is 'arms shall not', not 'things on our list shall not', so
any such classification list is irrelevent. Ignoring the NBC / large arms
debate, crypto is clearly small arms in this context and thus shall not
be infringed.
Crypto is also clearly necessary to the security of a free people, and thus
of/to the state being of the people. And shy of state failure requiring its use
in support of revolt, crypto is clearly a defensive arm primarily against
encroachment. In current example, mass surveillance, lack of individualized
warrant, abuse of process, abuse of implied right to privacy, of the 1st, 4th
and 5th, etc.

It would certainly be an interesting use/case/argument to explore and test.
