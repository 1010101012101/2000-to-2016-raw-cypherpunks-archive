Well, there is the fact that Trump is an orange buffoon, an inarticulate reject from Wonka's chocolate factory.

Im not saying he's any worse than Hillary of course... But he might be slightly less embarrassing.

I rather liked some of what I saw about Bernie. But anyway it's all a big fucking racket , isn't it...
