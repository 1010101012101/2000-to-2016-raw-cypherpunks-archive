Per p. 41, as of July 1 2002, the Hills' salaries will be reduced to $225K, 
and Hevizi's (the CEO) to $300K.

(which is still a lot of money, given all that they've burned through, for 
a company in this position.)

Also, the General Manager for the Enterprise Privacy Management group, Mark 
Weidick, resigned his $338K position as of May 31 2002. Enterprise Privacy 
Management is supposed to be a big part of their new business focus, 
receiving 40% of the proceeds of the IPO.

I get the impression that even though Stefan Brands has left ZKS, they've 
retained an option to purchase one or more of his patents, that option 
expiring in August.
(cf. 
<http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.2002.03.25-2002.03.31/msg00247.html>)

ZKS has also been the subject of three lawsuits for wrongful termination 
worth an aggregate of $240K, and have an ongoing dispute about a settlement 
gone bad, where the other party is seeking $630K and ZKS is seeking $100K + 
the return of a gift of 74,500 common shares (recently valued at around .75 
each). Anyone want to bet the unnamed individual with the disputed 
settlement is Brands?

I've mirrored a copy of the prosepectus at <http://parrhesia.com/zks.pdf> 
in case something tragic happens to the first copy.
