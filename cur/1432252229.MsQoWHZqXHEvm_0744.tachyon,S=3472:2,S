Accepting your definition for a moment, your analogy is still flawed because 
it assumes one group is rejecting science altogether, where here the two 
groups simply arrive at different conclusions from the same data.

But in fact, I don't completely agree with your definition. A Cypherpunk is 
one who is interested in the technology and use of encryption, and the social 
and political effects thereof. One definition assumes a conclusion, one 
definition defines a group in search of a conclusion. 

And really, my question would remain valid in either case. IF this list is to 
be the home of any sort of useful discussion, then the discussion must 
include both sides of the issue. Otherwise you don't have discussion, you 
have dogma.

Statists and communists both would be included in politician, Republican, 
Green, Democrat, Libertarian, crank (though not only statists and politicians 
fit there) and gun control nut. Just pick the flavor that matches the label.

And being railed at as statists and communists. Oh, some interesting people 
have joined on the other side, as well - but again, what value in one-sided 
discussion?
