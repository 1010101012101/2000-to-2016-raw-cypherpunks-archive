Not very much better.  I recognize that large groups of people 
cannot function without somehow separating a few destructive 
people from the group.  Imprisoning them is one route, killing 
them is another.  Which is more cruel is open to interpretation.

I see no reason why I personally should be called upon to be 
part of that machinery though -- nor any good reason why, if 
called, I should comply.

Yep.  This is pretty much my opinion about the whole assassination 
thing; if an anonymous market for assassination existed, people 
would be likely to use it the way the traditional assassination 
markets are used; Governments to eliminate dissidents, major 
corporations to eliminate competitors with better products and 
innovators with ideas that threaten major markets, and the sheeple 
to get rid of the people their spouses were sleeping with (or maybe 
their spouses).  Millionaire brats would use it to accellerate 
their inheritances, rogue cops would use it to destroy people whom 
they were unable to get quality evidence on, etc...  Bell's idea 
that government would feel the lash more deeply than anyone else 
is plain nuts IMO.

Anybody want to bet Jeff Gordon has more money to spend on AP than 
James Bell?  I mean, if it came down to it, who could afford to have 
whom eliminated?
