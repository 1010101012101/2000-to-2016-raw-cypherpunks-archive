No, I said she should be able to sue. To say that a person should not be
able to sue if they feel they have been wronged simply because somebody
wants to make a profit and such an action might impact that profit is NOT
acceptable behaviour from a civil society based on democratic ideals.

Actually theories do demand, in the sense of compliance or adherence. If a 
theory says that a particular boundary condition must apply in order to
apply (eg socialism equates to government ownership and management of all
property including people) and a particular instance doesn't comply then
it's clear another theory is required.

It is the same sort of definition for 'demand' as that used by people to
decide compliance as well. Your distinction is actually a false one.

We're not talking about what people say. We are talking about the
axiomatic requirements of theories and how to apply them to both pedantic
as well as real world examples.

The basic axiomatic definition of a democracy is pretty simply, the
citizens of the government each get a vote in what that government will
do. The details, whether it might be direct vote or through a bicamaral
house or some other mechanism, still don't change that fundamental
definition.

No realistic theory about democracy says anything about how individuals
will behave. If anything it is an open admission that people are so
diverse and different in goals and desires that it can't be encompessed
within a central organizational approach (eg socialism).

The power of democracy, and the failure of socialism, fascism, anarchism,
libertarianism, etc. is that it not only recognizes that no single set of
goals will satisfy everyone. It recognizes that everyone has a say in what
happens and why. It further, at least in most applications it appears,
seems to recognize the right of minorities to be protected in their
distinctions. In general any time a person feels that anothers behaviour
has infringed their free expression has a right to review by a 3rd party
(ie a court).

As I've explained before, a business is the espression of the right to
pursuit happiness. But the point that you and Tim always leave off is that
you have that right UNTIL IT INFRINGES ANOTHER. You habitually ignore that
others have equivalent rights you demand for yourself. In short, liberty
for me but not for thee.

Crypto-anarchy and libertarianism are just another form of fascism at best
and socialism at worst. It's a means for one group of people to oppress
and control another.
