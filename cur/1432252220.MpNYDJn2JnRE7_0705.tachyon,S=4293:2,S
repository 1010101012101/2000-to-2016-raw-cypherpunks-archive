See particularly an article by one author debunking some L-M "debunking"

"I have considerable sympathy with the criticism by L&M that some of the
arguments for path dependency have been based "on poorly documented
evidence that dissolves upon closer inspection." But their account in
JLEO of this particular history is subject to the same critique."
