Do you know of any  effective means of concealing one's web-surfing 
habits?  I know there are things like Anonymizer.com, but with all of 
these you have to trust the service providers.  I've looked into JAP, 
but they don't have a real network -- just one path between two links, 
both controlled by the same people.
