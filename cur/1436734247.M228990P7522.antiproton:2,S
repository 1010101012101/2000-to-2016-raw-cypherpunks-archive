Jim aptly notes the cheating use of technology and law, practiced
by lawyers and technologists, prosecution and defense, hardly
limited to millions of secretkeepers, litigous-technologicus ubquitious,
so to paraphrase Dr. Geer, we are all corner cutting opportunists,
highly trained and credentialed dual hatted techno-legalistic tricksters
now. Once IANAL prevailed, now IAATLT.

&gt; That reads, to me, that what the public adopts limits what I
can<br>

&gt;I guess where we quibble is I'm skeptical that the general public
(as<br>
&gt;defined by the courts?) will (ever?) adopt the types of tools
you<br>
&gt;refer to (uniquely identifying individuals based on

Months ago, FLIR announced an IR-imaging add-on for IPhones, which is

but even then the majority of the population won't buy, simply because

<br><br>
<br><br>
&gt;So my wonder now is if industry adopting a technology is
sufficient<br>
&gt;for the courts to qualify as 'general public'. But this, at best,
only<br>
&gt;affects exotic technology.&nbsp; We're already fighting this
battle.<br><br>
&gt;Automated license plate readers have never (?) been challenged<br>
&gt;(successfully?). They are an extension of &quot;a police officer
just<br>
&gt;watching a highway&quot; which is legal.&nbsp; And the courts like
extensions of<br>
&gt;things that are already done - see bulk collection of
metadata!<br><br>
<br>
This 'extension' principle doesn't always work.&nbsp; In 2012, the
Supreme Court ruled (US v. Jones)
<a href=3D"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._jones_%282012%29=

https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._jones_%282012%29</a>
&nbsp; that police could not place a GPS tracking device on a car without
a warrant.&nbsp; One argument that has been rejected in lower-court cases
was the idea that in principle, a car's movements could be tracked with
an army of police, one per street corner, so that a GPS tracking bug
simply automated that process.&nbsp; One problem that argument is that
society not only doesn't have the resources to accomplish such a blanket
coverage of an area, and that even if practical, society may not
necessarily want such an intrusive system to exist.<br><br>
This issue was (secretly) quite relevant to me.&nbsp; Federal authorities
apparently installed a tracking device on a car I used, probably in about
April 2000, without a warrant.&nbsp; Presumably, if challenged they would
have been claiming to follow a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision from
1999,&nbsp; U.S. v. McIver, which had allowed the placement of a GPS
tracking device on a truck seen at the location of a marijuana growing
operation.&nbsp; The problem with this justification, however, is that at
least in McIver, there was an actual crime involved, and the truck was
plausibly involved in that crime.&nbsp; In my case, after my release from
prison in April 2000, nobody alleged that I was engaging in any
crime.&nbsp; The McIver case didn't rule that police could simply choose
to place a GPS tracking device on ANY car, for no reason, and even
without 'probable cause' or 'reasonable suspicion'.<br><br>
What was particularly devious (and I call illegal) was that later,
probably in October 2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant for the
placement of ANOTHER tracking device on the same car (which, of course,
may have ended up being the same device!) WITHOUT telling the judge that
a tracking device was already on the car, and had been so since at least
as early as April 2000.&nbsp; Why the subterfuge?&nbsp; They later used
the result of the tracking device (at least, the portion taken after the
October warrant) against me in court.&nbsp; But they continued to conceal
the fact that a GPS device had been placed since perhaps April
2000.&nbsp; Presumably, they concealed that because they would have had
to explain, in court, why they were tracking me, without a warrant, and
despite the fact that they had no 'probable cause' nor 'reasonable
suspicion' to do so.&nbsp; To conceal that, they obtained the warrant,
making it appear that the GPS surveillance started in October 2000.&nbsp;
This was fraud, because in order to obtain a warrant, they have to
explain WHY they need the GPS device installed.&nbsp; Clearly, since a
GPS device was already installed in the car, there was no need to place
one.&nbsp; THAT misrepresented the need to the judge.<br><br>
You might ask, &quot;Jim, why didn't you complain about this during the
trial&quot;.&nbsp; As you might know, I was given a long series of
lawyers who, rather than being the first line of defense for me, were
actually the first line of OFFENCE for the government.&nbsp; What the
average person doesn't understand is that a defense attorney, colluding
with the government, has virtually unlimited power to sabotage his
client's case, and that was precisely what happened to me.&nbsp; The
crooked attorney was Robert Leen.<br><br>
And it turned out that the government had a powerful motivation, or at
least some of its employees:&nbsp; They had faked an 'appeal' case in the
9th Circuit, 99-30210, forging at least two filings as if I had done them
'pro se', as if I was bring that case.&nbsp; I did not, and I wasn't
aware of the pre-May 2000 existence of that faked case until June 2003,
when I first saw that case's docket.&nbsp; The crooked attorney who
concealed this from me was Jonathan Solovy.<br>
