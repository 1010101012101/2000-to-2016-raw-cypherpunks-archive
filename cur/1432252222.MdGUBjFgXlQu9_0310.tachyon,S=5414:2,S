I think because you as leak recipient could defraud the leaker of their
efforts by unwrapping and placing your own identity stamp on the leak,
the leaker would have to publish the leak themselves with their own ID
stamp into say a new time-secure blockchain dedicated to leaking.
Then the payment board would examine the chain for prior leaks
of the same material and award payment to the first such leaker.
If for some reason the leaker cannot leak to the chain, such as with
inconceivably digitizable/transferable materiel, they must obviously
establish the traditional trust mechanisms with their receiving/publishing
partner who will enter leaker's leak and ID in such chain as proxy.

Deciding what a leak is worth could be done in the usual AP
fashion by donating to classes of leaks.

Blockchain systems already have some N of M signature
requirements to release funds.

Zerocoin or some anon payment is still needed. And payment to
leakers ID would show up for verification in that system.
