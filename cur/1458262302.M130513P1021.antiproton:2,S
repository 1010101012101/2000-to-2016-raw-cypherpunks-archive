Distributed development of software, involving people scattered
all over the world, is routine these days.  Adapting tools like
git and i2p to create hard to find, hard to suppress projects
physically hosted at multiple locations in mutually hostile legal
jurisdictions is only a question of motivation:  When the
perceived value of a project exceeds the costs of making it
"stateless" and very hard to suppress, people will most likely do
just that.  I can't think of any technical barriers.

People who are competent to make "crypto products" are uniquely
qualified to do that particular trick.
