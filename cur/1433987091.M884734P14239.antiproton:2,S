I have some idea the truth will be both far from what we think it is, and,
depending on who you are, far more terrifying.

Let's imagine your an espionage guy, and you have clear evidence of something
the world needs to know. Like say that those high-frequency trading 'bugs'
were actually backdoor cash payments/bribes, which is my favorite conspiracy
theory.

Now you have a clear indication that the guys you know are making bribes are
off bribing the right people to make a political shitstorm that will dismantle
the most beautiful technological achievement you've ever seen or heard of in
history to root out bad guys and corruption.

Okay, granted, maybe I'm giving too much credit for idealism. But what the
hell else are we here if not a bunch of idealists? Besides, I think the 
above is just as plausible as a global currency-tracking sigint engine that's
not a blockchain.

By getting some archives of the data, and studying it.

Hell, if I could tape a few dollar bills to my planter and get free 1-inch
location tracking, this would substantially increase agricultural productivity
world-wide, as well as tracking & logistics.

Why bother with package tracking when you just tape a dollar on the outside?

We've already got an opticon, let's make the best of it and have it be an
omniopticon, and figure out how the hell to live with it.

The physics community built a global network to handle data coming from CERN.
The network and the computers are all there. The hard part will be convincing
physicists that discovering the true nature of money & surveillance is more
imporant than the true nature of the higgs boson, at least for a few weeks.

What's the data rate of this sigint thing? Does it exceed 30 Gigabytes/sec?

What are the chances we could just pick it up with a decent software defined
radio? Or is someone just baiting us to do some free work for their next
dystopian summer blockbuster movie?
