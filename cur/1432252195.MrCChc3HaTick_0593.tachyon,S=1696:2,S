Seconded, Harmon.  CP has long included privacy (ie control, aka
personal
infosec) as a topic.  And the use and abuse of wireless tracker^H^H^H^H
cellphones
(and what they will morph into) is a legit socio-tech topic which can
draw heavily on crypto.

And the other thread, s*veillance (ie reverse-panopticon) is completely
on target.
Again, the core idea being privacy.    Something for which crypto was
invented.

Keep 'em coming Bob.
