Apparently, one isn't permitted to celebrate National Dented Imperialism
Day through any means that requires more than one individual to be in an
airplane bathroom at the same time.

FORT SMITH, Arkansas (CNN) -- A Northwest Airlines flight was diverted
Wednesday to Fort Smith, Arkansas, after the pilot reported a disturbance
involving passengers in the bathroom, federal officials said.
   
"Apparently a number of men had locked themselves in the bathroom," FBI
spokesman Brian Marshall said.
   
Crew members and other passengers acted to get the men out, federal law
enforcement officials said. Marshall said no one was injured.
   
Three men were held for questioning at the Fort Smith Regional Airport,
authorities said.
   
A senior Bush administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the incident did not appear to be related to terrorism.
   
The official said the men are being questioned for "inappropriate
behavior," which he described as locking themselves inside a bathroom.
   
When the passengers would not leave the bathroom, the pilot decided to
divert the plane, the official said. No military jets escorted the plane
to the airport in Arkansas, he added.
   
Flight 979, an Airbus A320, was traveling from Memphis, Tennessee, to Las
Vegas, Nevada, with 94 passengers and five crew members when it was
diverted, the airline said.
   
Passengers were taken off the plane, and several police cars could be seen
around the plane on the tarmac.
   
The plane had departed Memphis at 8:45 a.m. CDT and was headed for
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.
