A link (http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=51200146) would
have been useful...

The JTAG interface is your (that is, the reverse engineer's) friend.  This is
why some security devices let you disconnect it using a security-fuse type
mechanism before you ship your product.  Of course that only works if (a) the
device allows it, (b) you remember to activate it, and (c) your attacker isn't
sufficiently motivated/funded to use something like microprobing or a FIB
workstation to bypass the disconnect.
