Huh?  That's like being for an atmosphere but against gravity.  
If there is strong crypto, then everybody, including traders, 
government critics, etc, is going to do whatever the hell they 
want to do with information.

Being in favor of something but against its consequences is a 
state of fundamental conflict, and people who hold such conflicted 
views are generally ignorable without loss of information in the 
long run. 

So if that's the case, why should we even care what he thinks? 
He's wrong, that's all.
