 >>That's why a functional AP system and widespread publication of the 
personal information of justice and LE employees is essential.

For who may have transgressed and fear that late nite no-knock its 
essential to supply these unwanted visitors with a one way ticket to the 
happy hunting grounds.  Claymores and far IR trip sensors are soooo 
good.  If you're 'gona do time you >>might as well do THE crime!

Hear Hear! Where is our PROMIS ? Our nuremburg websites? Operation soft 
drill appeals to massive civil disobedience?

Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number -
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you -
Ye are many - they are few.
