Reply-To: liberationtech <liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu>

As someone that would probably be within that subset of people singling out
Blue Coat, I would perhaps go as far as saying that the company is targeted
because it is relatively easy. Citizen Lab, Telecomix and others were able
to locate the devices because they had the sorts of signatures, tagging
and predictable configuration ports that clearly malicious devices would
not have. However, despite that they are not
single-use surreptitious listening devices, the company had so clearly
failed in any due diligence in manner that creates a broader debate that
also applies to the Ciscos, Fortinets, et al of the world.

If one were to tell me how to detect ZTE or Huawei kit on a network, you
would essentially be dictating my time and attention for the next month. By
all means, please.

Until then, at least Blue Coat provides the opportunity to educate
policy-makers on what should be done, case in point the civil society
comment to State asking this very question:

http://newamerica.net/publications/resources/2013/comments_regarding_sensitive_technologies_guidance

Comments to the comment are very welcome, had I realized it was publicly
posted, I would have shared it with Libtech earlier.
