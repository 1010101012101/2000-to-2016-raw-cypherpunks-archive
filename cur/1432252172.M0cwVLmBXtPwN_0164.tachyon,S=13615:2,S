NEWS RELEASE       2 June 2001=20

We have experienced undue delays in industrialising the production for =
the HP4100 and HP2000C (also HP2200C / HP2500C).

HP4100
This is mainly because we have had to encapsulate our HP4100 design in =
an electronic resin shell. Also there are other highly technological =
materials that we required from Europe in order to complete the process.

We have invested heavily in the production and this delay of a few weeks =
will only benefit you later as we have managed to save considerably on =
production costs by adapting our methods.

We are still hopeful that we will release the solution in 7 days. =
Resetting (docking booths) will release two weeks after this.=20

HP2000C
The delay on this is because we have had to farm-out the actual =
manufacture of the wafer board. The chip (non-encapsulated) is so small =
that we simply do not have the machinery and electronic manufacturing =
line to produce these on. This is really hi-tech and involved the actual =
design and manufacture of a wafer board that is around 1cm x 1cm.=20

We are still hopeful that we will release the solution in 10 days. =
Resetting (docking booths) will release at same time.

HP4500
Chips are in stock and are selling well. We have put the release of the =
resetting machine on a back-burner as a result of prioritising towards =
the HP4100 and HP2000C release. These machines will however be available =
in a month's time.

RESETTING HP4100 CHIPS IN THE INTERIM
HERE'S SOME RELIEF.........................Because of the delays you =
have experienced in the wait, we are happy to offer resets from South =
Africa.

We are glad to receive your removed HP4100 chips for resetting at our =
South African offices. We will charge a paltry US$7 for this service as =
an apology for the delays. Bear in mind that you will require to pay the =
freight both ways, however this will be fairly inexpensive.

What we need you to follow in this process: -

* Remove chip from each cartridge

* Leave the chip in its encapsulation (DO NOT REMOVE or OPEN THIS)

* Specifically mark the SERIAL NUMBER of the cartridge and tag this to =
each chip individually. This is very important. We recommend you use a =
sticker.

* The chip is quite robust in the encapsulation so you need only ship =
these in a FEDEX or similar box in wrapping

* We can offer a turnaround time per lots of 200 in 24 hours, but safely =
work on 48 hours

* The delivery address is: 47 PEACE ROAD, KLOOF, 3610, KWA-ZULU NATAL, =
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.=20
~ OR ~ you can ship via our US offices for convenience, who will handle =
shipping on your behalf

* All billing will be done ex Chicago and there is no need to pay the =
RSA office

* We prefer FEDEX rather than other couriers

* Please ensure you list your INTERNATIONAL: ACCOUNT NUMBER for return =
courier mail

* The product code is EI-HP4100RS1 (Edje Imaging - HP4100 Reset 1)


XEROX
We are selling the XEROX N24/32/40 chip solutions and are happy to =
"bargain" on price as we are VERY late to market. The only reason we are =
doing these is out of demand.

LEXMARK (FT-PRS)
We are still selling these in huge numbers. Please enquire for your new =
orders.

TOSHIBA, VERITEK, QMS, UNISYS
We are happy to make up special chip orders for you on these makes. This =
pertains to Lexmark OEM-partners using the PREBATE lockout chips. These =
are different from Lexmark in regard to unique coding so we would =
require your chip samples to read, during manufacture.

We look forward to your requests and orders. Should you have queries, =
please feel free to contact our offices.
