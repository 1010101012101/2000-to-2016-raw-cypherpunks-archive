One-way pagers are a great anonymous way to signal, especially since Web interfaces were offered.  With coded messages, originated from public access terminals and disguised as phone numbers, a lot of command and control is practical.

They fucking DID meet in person! There is not one iota, not one shred,
of evidence that Atta and and his 20 or so co-conspirators used "crypto"
in any form! (Including image file steganography, the form I invented in
1989-90 and which Kevin Kelly profiled in his book "Out of Control,"
based on interviews in 1992. I mention this because several journalists
have been writing b.s stories aoubt Osama using "steganography, files
hidden in images.' B.S.)

And even had Atta and Company used crypto, which there is no evidence
whatsoever of, this would be no more justification for "key escrow" or
"backdoors" than the use of curtains by Al Capone to hide his activities
was grounds for "transparency escrow" modes in curtains or for banning
sealed envelopes. Most crime takes place out of sight of law
enforcement. So?

Atta and his co-conspirators met in apartments, motel rooms, and sent
overnight letters. Unless the bozos at Reason are arguing for opening of
all mail, for microphones in motel rooms, for "1984" levels of apartment
surveillance, there is nothing that could have been done to stop the
planning.

This is all just very basic stuff, written about by some of us in the
mid-80s. That so many journalists are just now "discovering" the crypto
issue is symptomatic of our times.
