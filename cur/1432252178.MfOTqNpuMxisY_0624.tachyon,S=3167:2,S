The common fissionable isotopes are alpha emitters with half-lives
measured in thousands of years.  Their rate of decay is miniscule.  Alpha
radiation, which consists of helium nuclei, can be stopped by a sheet of
paper.

Plutonium-239, which has a half-life of about 24,000 years, is slightly
warm to the touch.  Fissionable isotopes with much longer half-lives do
not noticibly differ from room temperature.

Alpha emitters are life threatening only if ingested.

No ones hair is falling out.  Really.
