two new for DOCSIS tech @FBI, @CIA:

"Any and all "DOCSIS" technology records, including cross-references
and indirect mentions, including records outside the investigation
main file. This is to include a search of each of the following record
stores and interfaces: the Central Records System (CRS), the Automated
Case Support system ("ACS") Investigative Case Management system
("ICM"), the Automated Case Support system ("ACS") Electronic Case
File ("ECF"), and the Automated Case Support system ("ACS") Universal
Index ("UNI"). I also request a search of "ELSUR", the database
containing electronic surveillance information, for any and all
records or activities related to "DOCSIS" or "DOCSIS intercept" or
"DOCSIS access" technology. In addition, please extend the search
criteria across any external storage media, including I-Drives,
S-Drives, or related technologies used during the course of
investigation involving Cable internet data services. DITU
experimental technologies or research also within scope of this
request. Please include processing notes, even if request is denied in
part. Please identify individuals responsible for any aspect of FOIA
processing in the processing notes, along with explanation of their
involvement if not typically assigned FOIA responsibilities for the
record systems above."
