Oregon has vote by mail.  (Fun watching both of the major parties spending 
*LOTS* of time here when large numbers of people had already sent in their 
ballots.)

One of the more interesting ballot measures in Oregon would require the 
government to have a conviction before being able to seize property.  The 
arguments against are pretty interesting.  The first set in the voter's 
pamphlet is from the Humane Society claiming that the measure would "harm 
animals".  (When you can use the "Its for the chilldddreeennn" argument, 
hurting animals is the next best thing.  Reminds me of the National Lampoon 
cover with the dog with the gun to his head.  "Vote NO on measure 3 or the 
dog dies!")
