That's been around quite the while:

    [We've got mail] An aerosol spray that makes unopened envelopes
    transparent so that the contents can be read has been invented.

    "You spray it on and it temporarily makes the envelope clear," said
    Robert Schlegel, vice-president of the makers, Mistral Security, of
    Maryland. "It leaves an odor for 10 to 15 minutes, but there is no
    smudging of ink, no stain, no evidence at all. The envelope is
    transparent for a few minutes and you can respray it hundreds of
    times without leaving any stain."

I'd heard of use of same by CIA going back maybe ten years, if not
longer.

Peace.
