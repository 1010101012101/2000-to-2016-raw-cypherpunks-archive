	Where is that a requirement in what Jimbo said?

	He said that any (woman) involved in a relationship wanted to 
change the other party, and that made her a gold digger.

	I am stating that in *any* relationship where there are 2 parties, 
both parties would, under a "Perfect Truth Serum" be able to articulate 
at least 2 things about the other party that they want to change.

	So by Jimbo's definition we are all gold diggers.

	It doesn't matter how you define relationship, altho there was a 
certain kind of relationship assumed (I would stretch it to almost any 
relationship that lasts more that say, 25 minutes) However "change" in 
this context is rather obvious.

	Sure, but we're not talking normal definitions.

	It is considered polite to refer to a TV as a she.
