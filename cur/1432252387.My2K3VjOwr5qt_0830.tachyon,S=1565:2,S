I caught the last bit of Bush's rant.  The scary
part was him talking about the "resurrection" of
NYC.  Given how his little bubble-brain is addicted
to xianity, and his coterie has geo-political messianic
delusions, this is not good.

Just heard Clinton's going in the hospital to get a heart.
Maybe W can get a brain?  And Rummy some courage?

Maybe Frances is Nature reminding FLA to shape up this time..
