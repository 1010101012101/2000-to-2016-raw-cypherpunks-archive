In which case, you might be better off transferring the asset, rather 
than the nym.

Yeah, mature markets solve problems.  How to create a mature market is
a question that apparently can't be solved for all the tea in China,
or all the oil in Russia.
 
Not that I think the solution is all that hard; reading Smith, Hayek,
Friedman, Nozick and some other smart people gives you a very clear
map, but the folks with the guns over there still haven't read Olsen's
last book (thanks), where he explains that thugs do better to let the
economy grow than to take all the money at once.
 
Something about the first hundred names in the Cambridge phone book
springs to mind.

A nym is none of these.

Or these.

| as found in physical graded-commodity markets everywhere.

So here's the rub.  A nym (as I'm using the term) is control over a
private key thats associated with some reputation, which Alice is
trying to sell to Bob.  Alice can not provide direct assurance that
she won't keep copies of the thing she's selling.

Through intermediaries, Bob can buy some insurance that the revocation 
games Alice can play are limited.  How valuable that insurance is
depends on the trustworthiness of the intermediaries, how likely the
reliant parties are to properly check signatures, and the value of
social engineering in a field where process issues are not yet well
understood.  (See also

)

There might be a relationship here to the sale of music bits; the RIAA 
is all worked up over issues of how do they sell the same bits over
and over.  If you can answer the question of "How to sell a set of
bits exactly once?" you may be able to answer the question "How to
ensure that I don't keep a copy of those bits?" or "How do I sell a
million people copies of the same bits without them transferring them
around."

The problems are not identical, but some of the same sorts of
solutions may help.
