I was about to mumble a tune about SuperDollars and ww2 currency
devaluation attacks! They never really worked, or turned feasible, because
delivery is quite hard and printing currency is quite expensive.

They hopefully do.

But this is a crypto forum, right? So we can do better than just making
hard-to-produce bills. We can produce an actual signature scheme!

Using any crypto-currency but accepting double spends until an online check
with central authority (blockchain is just a slow and decentralized central
authority) can be done is probably really quite good. Optionally TPM's can
put the central authority in your pocket, or in your bill!

Too bad government sucks at technology.
