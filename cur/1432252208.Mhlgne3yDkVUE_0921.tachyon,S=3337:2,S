RSA (ie persistant keys) may be an option but MUST NOT be
required, for secrecy reasons as mentioned.  (At worst RSA keys
can be used once, then discarded.  Lots of primes out there :-)

Also, this is *voice*, ie biometric auth,
so public-key-web-o-trust verislime scam is
unnecessary at best.  (Although for ringing up a business it
might be a useful redundancy in case you misdial, and if there
are introducers more trusted and perhaps liable than verislime)

Get Real Networks or AOL or M$ to bundle a free, open secphone with
their regular
products.  In AOL case you can exploit their "buddy" (aka traffic
analysis) system
for your directory services.

I bet its suggested monthly.  And shot down by managers who have been
shown photos of their personal indiscretions taken by spooks.

One could always implement a brand new

We don't give a flying fuck as to which shiny new algorithm you use,
although were we a graph theory wonk, we might care.

What the NAT world (yawn) needs is free registry services exploitable by
any
protocol.  Those NAT-users with RSA-clue can sign their registry entry.

Net was a smaller place in 95.  A '95 machine didn't have MIPS to burn.
Not so many broadband nodes.  Bush was just an airhead redneck governor,
not
a rabid Caesar.
