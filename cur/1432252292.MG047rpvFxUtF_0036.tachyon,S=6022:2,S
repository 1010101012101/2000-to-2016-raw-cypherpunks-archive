Right.  I didn't see it this way,  I got the impression that she was
prevented from flying because she gave the guard attitude
(deliberately slowing down when he told her to speed up,
etc.) rather than for her politics as such.    Still unacceptable 
behavior, of course,  but (to my mind) not nearly as bad. 
My suggestion that he should be let off with a reprimand should
be read in that context.
	I should add here that none of us know exactly what happened,
and it's conceivable that she might have said/done stuff
significantly more threatening than what she mentioned, and that 
keeping her off the flight was actually the right thing to do.  Not
asserting that this is the case, of course, just pointing out the 
possibility.

I'm not sure how egregious is egregious in the context of missing
flights. I've been unable to fly when I was supposed to because
of weather, mechanical problems, and because the asshole cabs
weren't there to pick me up when they were supposed to be.
Never get any compensation for it.
None of this justifies anything, of course, but the point is that 
there's always a non-negligible chance that you won't be able to
get on the flight you paid for.  So the odds of getting significantly 
more than a refund on the ticket seem slim.
Also, so far as motivation goes, I expect that the airline employees
genuinely believed she was a safety risk, it seems highly
unlikely that they just felt like persecuting greens. Whether
or not that was a reasonable belief is a separate question.
