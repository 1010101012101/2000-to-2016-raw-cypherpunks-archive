    4:06:04 P.M. 	H.R. 2578 	An amendment, offered by Mr. Lamborn, to pro=
hibit the use of funds to collect information about individuals attending=
 gun shows, by means of an automatic license plate reader, or to retain a=
ny information so collected.
    .
    .

    Mr. Farr raised a point of order against the Lamborn amendment...


Sam Farr fuckery again. This putz claims to have voted against the Iraq
war but introduced a bill in the house that essentially militarized
California's construction industry to make it easier for his pimps to
get lucrative pentagon 'pave it over after we blow it up' construction
contracts.
