No.
They are *made of* people. This is not the same thing.

What? I call bull. First of all, it's not the corporation's decision, i=
t's a=20
decision made always by *some person*. You don't have to give corporati=
ons=20
these rights, as people that corporations consist of already have them.=
 So,=20
the government still cannot make *these people* fire other people for=20=

political views.

Secondly, it's all about the responsibility. If the responsibility for=20=

decisions stops at corporation level, we're fucked, as we are currently=
,=20
because people that actually make the decisions (in the end people make=
=20
decisions, not corporations!) think "whatever, even if something gets f=
ucked=20
up, I'm in the clear, so why bother".

But that still can be solved by bringing the rights and responsibilitie=
s down=20
to personal level. If a "secret order" issued to a corporation is in vi=
olation=20
of rights of physical people working there (as it seems to be in this c=
ase),=20
the order is unlawful, full stop. Solved.

Don't mix the freedom of association with the convenience of removed=20=

responsibility, or responsibility attached not to people, but to some l=
egal=20
fiction. The former is crucial, the latter is dangerous.

But corporations are thus ubermensch -- they have all the rights and po=
wers of=20
a person, without many of the responsibilities, with no danger of being=
=20
imprisoned, and the only real legal sanction the courts (and thus, the =
rest of=20
people) have against them are fines. Which, if the corporation is large=
=20
enough, can be factored-in as cost of doing business, hence being passe=
d on to=20
customers. So, passed to other people.

The problem is that our laws and constitutions had been written in time=
s when=20
governments had been by far the biggest threats to personal freedoms,=20=

possessions and life. They had posed (and continue to pose) a real thre=
at=20
because:
1. their sheer power (in terms of money, information, military power, e=
tc)
2. human flaws (power corrupts, etc)
3. (perceived) removal of responsibility ("what could they do to me any=
way")

Today all three (power, human factor and perceived removal of responsib=
ility)=20
is present in largest multinationals. I see no reason to fear them less=
 than=20
governments.

In fact, I am dreading the coming day the first corporation announces=20=

independence.
