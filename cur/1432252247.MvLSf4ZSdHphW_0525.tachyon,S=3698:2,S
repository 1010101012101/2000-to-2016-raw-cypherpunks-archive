Actually, the ipaq *does* support full duplex audio now.

PocketPC 3.0 doesn't, but compaq has provided a driver for WinCE, and
the linux distribution supports it too.

PocketPC supports an application called "Microsoft Portrait" and msn
messenger for voice over ip.  To provide maximal end-user benefit, the
thing to do is probably put strong crypto into msn messenger/ms
portrait, on desktop and handheld.

"Off the shelf hardware" is pretty meaningless to users if they need
to do the linux handheld install; I've tried before and even if you
know a fair bit about linux, it takes over an hour, and is somewhat
risky.  Whereas if it's just a "download this app and it works" thing,
it's a lot easier to get casual users.

http://research.microsoft.com/~jiangli/portrait/

is the microsoft portrait page.  It's MS Research, not MS MS, so it
may not suck.

Someone should probably contact the guy and see what's up.  If they
would support an open-source client, and add crypto to the protocol,
it might be good.
