I think he's right.  The only possible way around this one would be 
to have a substantial fraction of *ALL* traffic encrypted.  The day 
that Homer Husband and Harriet Housewife routinely exchange mail that 
is encrypted and undistinguishable from the mail that the players in 
your "anonymous markets" exchange, the anonymous markets will have a 
chance of going undetected.  

And you know what?  Homer and Harriet ain't going there, 'cause key 
management and crypto software is still a pain in the tush and they 
still don't know anybody's listening.
