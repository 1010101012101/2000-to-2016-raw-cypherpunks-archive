I think most, that entertainment value is what helped at least in part to
make their discussion palitable. After all it follows if the book is both
popular and influencial it is actually changing peoples mind.

Wells was contemporanious with the growth of atomic physics. I think it's
more likely a cose of being too close.

Actualy it gives us a reason, both reasoned and emotional, to consider
alternatives like 'harm'. They're more pragmatic and easier to define
across social belief systems. Things like murder, rape, & theft are pretty
common. Then we include concepts like freedom of religion and speech and
we begin to see a framework where a multi-cultural society can exist. It
allows the keeping of local 'web-of-trusts' while at the same providing a
more general framework for commerce and human experession.

I think the operable point is 'same premises'. The true test of a theory
is when the parties start at different premises.

A more specific form of socialism.

n-sided.

Oh, not at all. I'm simply saying that considering human nature any
society that isn't paranoid isn't going to last long. Like it or not
(personaly I'm rather fond of it) the human animal is a predator. A damn
smart, ruthless, cold-blooded, determined killer. That is one of the prime
facts as to why we got to where we are. This realization is one of the
reasons I'm interested in the subject.

No, I actually expect to see a growth in the desire for anonymity. As
people realize the true extend of data mining and the extent of both
commercial and government databases they will become more paranoid. People
will finaly come to realize explicitly that freedom IS security (which
I've always felt was the point behind Franklin's quote).

I've always felt these predictions didn't understand the fundamental
nature of the network requirements. The current internet and OS technology 
simply isn't up to it.

Ok, I've spoken poorly. I'm not talking of the society per se but rather
the network that it is built upon. If we follow the current model Lessig's
point of regulation by compiler will come to pass. However, if instead we
have a network infrastructure that is end to end developed Open Source it
provides no room to regulate. Lawmakers can't as a matter of course pass a
law dictating what network stack you might use (at least in the US). That
would provide a base for a more humane and reasonable society. A society
where freedom of expression and social responsibility are balanced as they
should be (at least under the 4th).

I'll have to disagree, it's a statistical mechanical problem. Not
deterministic at all. One of the primary memes, and primary problems, is
this point. It's almost like talking to DeCarte.

I don't see the relevancy.

Because within the arcology the society can set its own norms while at the
same time interacting with others. The question is what holds such an
arcology together? A strong common culture.

Actually for the arcology/zaibatsu to exist will require nanotechnology
and several other technologies to become practical. If we don't develop
then the entire process is fall down because the resource base won't
expand as fast as the need. Without the technology there is no way to
address the need.

Just remember, 20 generations is effectively billions. Consider that
society when it has moved off planet based societies and begun to process
extra-planetary resources. Lifetimes potentially moving toward the 500
year mark, genetic engineering to build custom chimeras. Consider the
potential for ark's with artificial wombs, stem cell management, and gene
banks.

Well that would depend on a family by family basis. In general what one
can say is that it will build a social structure where children visit
their grandparents for much farther than through their teens. And on for
the great grandparent...

Won't fly, but I'd like to hear your description of the driving forces...

What 'large bumps'? Considering that most generations will be 20-30 years
apart in age (at least at first, expect the age between generations to
extend outward). In addition the additional storage of culture will act as
a mediating affect.

> So all this is fine, but I dislike saying that this is what "will happen." 

So be it. Remember, something must happen. It will happen as a result of
cause/effect and random events.

I'm not predicting disaster, a slow lingering drown on ones own waste.
