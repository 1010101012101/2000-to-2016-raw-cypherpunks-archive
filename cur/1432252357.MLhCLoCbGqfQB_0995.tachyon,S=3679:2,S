/The Drones Campaign Network (DCN) is a UK-based network of organisations, 
academics and individuals working together to share information and 
coordinate collective action in relation to military drones. Membership of 
the network is by invitation but the network welcomes supporters, both 
individuals and organisations./
http://dronecampaignnetwork.wordpress.com/

This coalition came to my attention because of a monthly newsletter they  
have been publishing.  Here's the September issue, which outlines an  
upcoming Drones Week of Action (Oct 6-13):
http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=f4b7a7e4e1dc9a526bdcef140&id=59cb9eef33&e=33e16c34a4

I've cc:ed the coalition information address; we'd love to have your  
participation on the drone list, where we've gathered a stellar group of  
journalists, academics, activists, and citizens documenting the  
proliferation of drones in the States and beyond.
