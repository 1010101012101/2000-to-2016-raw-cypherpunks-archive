that's because corporations work more efficiently than governments. they
use whatever does the job with the minimal cost. at the moment, it's
armies of lawyers sueing critics to hell and back for some bogus shit.

rest assured, once the government stops doing so (e.g. by disappearing),
corporations *will* start to raise armies of their own.
