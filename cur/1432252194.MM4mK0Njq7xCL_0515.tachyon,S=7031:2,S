InfowarCon 2001:
Techniques and Strategies for Securing Shared Infrastructures	
Washington D.C.
September 5 - 6, 2001	
September 4, 7, 2001 Optional Workshops 	

A Conference for the Times...
InfowarCon 2001 has been developed to deliver proven techniques and 
strategies for protecting your shared infrastructures from external and 
internal attack.

Now in its 12th year, this critically acclaimed event brings together 
military leaders, political forces, academics, and industry captains from 
all over the globe who will share their hard-won experiences and expertise. 
You will benefit from the first-hand knowledge of in-the-trenches 
infowarriors from such highly regarded organizations as the Carnegie Mellon 
Research Institute, UK Ministry of Defence, the Joint Military Training 
Center, Logicon; TNO Physics and Electronics Labs, Netherlands, Defence 
Communications Services Agency, UK, the National Infrastructure Protection 
Center, and more.

You'll get proven techniques and broad perspectives from presenters that 
include in-the-trenches pros from the military, private, and political 
arenas. These front-line experts have seen it all, done it all, and done it 
better than anyone else.


6 Special Tracks

To make sure you optimize your conference experience and meet your 
objectives, we’ve organized InfowarCon 2001 into six targeted tracks:
Information Space: Chaired by D.H. Dearth, Course Director, JMITC
Sessions in this track examine the distinct mechanisms that help shape
Information Space.

National Infrastructure Protection: Chaired by Clayt Lemme, National 
Infrastructure Protection Agency

    Get the basics of international infrastructure policies
    and procedures and learn the lessons learned in the
    sessions in this track.

Law Enforcement: Chaired by Robert C. Rusnak, Senior Information Operations 
Analyst, Systems Technology Associates

    Sessions in this track look at the application of IW to
    law enforcement.

Technical: Chaired by Winn Schwartau, President, Interpact, Inc.; Founder, 
NiceKids.Net

    Past InfowarCon attendees have said, "Give some more bits
    and bytes," so here they are! You’ll find sessions in this
    track on advanced research and case studies from international
    experts in a variety of disciplines.

People Problems & Solutions: Chaired by Morgan Wright, Deputy Director, 
Information Security, Federal Government Group, Unisys Corporation

Security professionals forget that behind every keyboard
is a person with intent, motive and allegiance. This new
track is designed to give insights into various people
problems…from leaders to kids.

International Problems & Solutions: Chaired by Matthew Devost, Founding 
Director, Terrorism Research Center, Inc.

    From cooperative IO/IW to terrorism, the international
    community has a lot offer. The disparate sessions in
    this track cover the gamut of thinking and future ideas
    and capabilities.

Complete Conference Materials

Materials for all sessions (excluding workshops) whether
you attended them or notwill be posted on the Web after
the conference. Attendees will receive an access code with
which to access the materials, which will include case studies,
guidelines, comparisons, checklists, and more. You will receive
hand-outs for the sessions you attend.

discount. Registrations must be made and paid for at the same time. This 
savings cannot be combined with any other discounts.

"NETOPPS"
Networking opportunities abound at InfowarCon 2001. Scheduled receptions, 
luncheons, refreshment breaks, and impromptu discussions provide ideal 
backdrops for swapping ideas with colleagues and turning conference 
speakers into personal "consultants."

Vendor Expo
Leading vendors of security products and services will be on hand to demo 
their offerings and answer your questions.

In-Depth Workshops
Optional workshops before and after InfowarCon 2001 let you leverage your 
travel time and take advantage of an intensive day of learning.

each workshop.
