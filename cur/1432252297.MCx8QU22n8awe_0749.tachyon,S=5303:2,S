This is correct-

Col. Cooper had some interesting things to say about the Israelis-

<http://www.jpate.freeserve.co.uk/JeffCooper/jeff5_7.html>

"A couple of correspondents have asked us recently what we think of 
the Israeli "flat stance" in defensive pistol shooting. If you have 
seen the training films you know that the Israeli procedure is to 
rotate the pistol 90 degrees to the left so as to make it easier to 
operate the slide when the pistol is pointed at the target. It has 
been pointed out to me that a number of cinema presentations have 
featured this technique - apparently in an attempt to latch onto 
anything new.

It happens that Mossad, the Israeli attack squad, fancies the use of 
the 22 pistol as a murder weapon. This is quite sound when the pistol 
is used in a totally offensive mode, since the subject is confronted 
just out of arm's length and hit ten times quickly in the chest area. 
Ten 22-caliber holes in the thorax are fatal, as any qualified 
thoracic surgeon will tell you. In employing this system the weapon 
is carried in Condition 3 until the moment of confrontation, 
whereupon it is drawn, pointed straight out and the action is racked 
with the left hand. This is somewhat easier to do if the weapon is 
held flat rather than vertically. Accuracy does not matter and sights 
do not matter. Ten quick hits will do the job, whereupon the agent 
drops the pistol at the scene (for the laboratory to puzzle over) and 
walks quickly away.

Since the pistol is a totally defensive weapon, this Israeli flat 
technique is of only academic interest to us."
