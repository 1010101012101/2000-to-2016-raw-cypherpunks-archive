QWest came around to 'fix' the phone lines today...about
an hour before my Probation Officer showed up with two
colleagues to 'Jack Me Up' about my posts to the CPUNX
Disturbed Male LISP...
Prosecutor London, in his closing remarks during my last
AllegedImaginary Trial, stated that the reason I would soon
be InFarceRated was due to the fact that when the Secret
Service sent a couple of guys around to "Jack [Me] Up"
and get me to ShutTheFuckUp!, it didn't work?
Can eWe say, "DeJa Vu All Over Again?"
Sure eWe can...

So, the GoodNews is that I can probably avoid being
sent back to the BOP to be Tortured4BeingDisAbled
simply by ShuttingTheFuckUp!
The BadNews, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], is that I have thus
far proved incapable of doing so, despite, as a result, having
already faced PerseProsExecution, Physical Torture, denial
of Constitutional, Civil and Human Rights, Medical Torture
and Abuse, and threats of Permanent InFarceRation in a
Prison4TheCriminallyInSane...
This is probably all of the information eWe need before=20
placing your Bet on the Date of my ReLease rEvokation...

Richard Nixon said, "Let me make one thing perfectly=20
clear..." but he never did.  Neither will I, but anyone who
really wishes to hear what I have to say, without merely
using my words and thoughts to provide substantiation
of their own WorldvEwe, will find that my interests lie
only in providing my own personal Mirror of the Tao,
which one is welcome to look into order to take a look
at their own Reality [TM] from the perspective of=20
another, in order to expand their ReFlexion and their
AwareNess of ThemSelf.


FuckTheseMorons! [TM] seem to have a problem with my
eMail to the Seattle Times and the CPDMLISP, entitled,
"Fuck Thomas Wales, and Fuck His Whole Family..."
THEY [TM] seem to be unable to Face the FundaMental
Fact which contains the WholePoint of the Message,
which points out that, "I'm sure all of the 'nice' things you
say about the federal prosecutor who was recently=20
removed from office are true."

The Problem, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], is that the Man
who was Murdered was, in all likelihood, as the article
portrays, a wonderful Father&Husband, a good Neighbor,
a Conscientious CitizenUnit, and was Loved by his
Dog...
Leading to the Real [TM] Problem, for the multitude of
people employed in similar positions, which is...
Despite the above, the Dude is still Dead...
Despite the above, the Dude's Death is, in all likelihood,
a direct result of his activities in his chosen career...
Despite the above, it may well be that the Dude's Death
may have been the result of another CitizenUnit merely
replying in kind to Criminal&OR&UnJust Actions enforced
at GunPoint by the DeadDude, his CoConSpiritorColleagues,
or simply TheSystem itself...

MyProblem, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], is that I believe that
the EndLessCycle of PeopleFuckingPeople can only be
MitiGated&OR&Ended by individuals Facing the Facts
of Reality and the Questions thus engendered.
e.g. - Fact: Many of the leading Nazis loved opera, and
were loved by their dogs.  Question: How did Seattle
Time's reports on Hitler's death compare to the article
on Thomas Wales?

FCI-TRV Corrections Officer Waters, in the course of his
job duties, participated in my being FourPointed in LegIrons
and HandCuffs as PunishMent for Exhibiting Symptoms
of Medical DisAbilities for which the BOP was denying
me competent medical treatment.
CO Waters, out of the view of his superiors and fellow
employees, put a pair of socks on me, to help keep me
warm, as an act of basic human kindness.

FCI-TRV Counselor Brinkman chose not to interfere with
or object to a host of violations of BOP policy in the
course of my being subjected to illegal, abusive treatment
during my incarceration at FCI-Three Rivers.
Counselor Brinkman also took many opportunities to help
me circumvent my inability to meet certain BOP conditions
and requirements, enabling me to spend a reasonable
portion of my incarceration in living conditions which=20
were humane and non-abusive.

Perhaps federal prosecutor Wales was Murdered by
someone whom he or his colleagues subjected to many
of the Criminal Abuses of Justice and Human Rights
that take place daily in TheSystem which Mr. Wales
chose to make his career.
Perhaps Thomas Wales was Murdered by someone
whom he had gone out of his way to aid in receiving
Justice, for reasons which have little or nothing to do
with the conduct of Mr. Wales, himself.
Perhaps Mr. Wales' colleagues might take time to=20
reflect on how their own disposition of their job duties
increase or decrease the likelihood of those whom their
activities affect feeling justified in exacting retribution
for their treatment at the hands of TheSystem.

Perhaps if the Seattle Times were to publish an article
titled, "Fuck Thomas Wales, and Fuck His Whole
Family," questioning whether his death might be the
result of an Abusive Justice System's Chickens Coming
Home To Roost, I might feel compelled to point out that
Thomas Wales a good CitizenUnit and Neighbor, whose
family and dog loved him, may well have performed his
job duties in a way that increased, rather than decreased,
the likelihood of other CitizenUnits receiving Justice in
TheSystem in which he chose to make his career.
OfCourseOfCourse [TM] there would be those who wouldn't
want to hear this, and who would probably rather that I
just ShutTheFuckUp!

Perhaps if the MainStreamDream Media were to publish
something more than just predictable, meaningless drivel
in regard to the Reality of the Justice System leading to
Tragedy for all concerned, in an EndLess CrapShoot
of PeopleFuckingPeople, then there would be nothing
left for me to say, and I would just ShutTheFuckUp!
