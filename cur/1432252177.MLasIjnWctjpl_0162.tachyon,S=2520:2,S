   brindafella writes "The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, reporting on
   a legislative change last week, says 'the [Australian] Government
   [1]will have 12 months to access communications not only between the
   B-party and the suspect, but also between the B-party and anyone else.
   If you have unwittingly communicated with a suspect (and thereby
   become a B-party), the Government may be able to monitor all your
   conversations with family members, friends, work colleagues, your
   lawyer and your doctor.' The Australian Parliament's major parties
   combined to pass an [2]amendment to the [3]Telecommunications
   (Interception) Amendment Act 1979."
