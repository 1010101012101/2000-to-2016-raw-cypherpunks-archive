A construction crew working on an office building in Virginia in 2000 severed
a fiber optic cable that wasnbt on anyonebs map. Apparently it was a bblack
lineb used for carrying secret intelligence data, according to sources who
spoke recently with the Washington Post.

Within minutes of cutting the cable, three black SUVbs pulled up carrying men
in suits who complained that their line was severed.

bThe construction manager was shocked,b a worker told the Washington Post.
bHe had never seen a line get cut and people show up within seconds. Usually
youbve got to figure out whose line it is. To garner that kind of response
that quickly was amazing.b

AT&T crews arrived the same day to fix the line, an unusually prompt
response. When AT&T tried to bill the construction company $300,000, the
company balked and the charges bjust disappeared.b

The cut occurred in the Tysons Corner region, where the neighbors include the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National
Counterterrorism Center. The Central Intelligence Agency is a few miles away.

Tysons is also home to a site belonging to the Warrenton Training Center, a
communications training center and support facility for the National
Communications System that is suspected of handling some communication for
the CIA.
