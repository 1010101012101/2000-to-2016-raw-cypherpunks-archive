I understand that, but I thought having *incompetent* corrupt people is
better than having *competent* ones! Who said "let's be happy that we don't
have all the government that we're paying for" (or something like that)? The
flaw here is the idea that the government COULD be a good thing, provided
that the governors are competent. I disagree with that.

I'm not saying that all russians are such. (Not that I love them, being from
an ex-satellite...) Only that a significant number are (just like a
significant number of Americans are "couch potatoes"), and having to share
my earnings with them is a big disincentive.

Yep. As Ian Clarke (the initiator of Freenet) said, Americans look at the
big mansion on the hill and say "one day I'll have one of those", while
Irish (or Romanians, or Russians...) say "one day we'll burn that
sonofabitch".

That's what I was objecting to :) The solution is obvious: capitalism. The
real one, not the fascist version.

Really? I didn't know that. Anyway, being old people and so on, I am sure
they are nostalgic about the One Big Union.

Well, at least there's two of us <g>
