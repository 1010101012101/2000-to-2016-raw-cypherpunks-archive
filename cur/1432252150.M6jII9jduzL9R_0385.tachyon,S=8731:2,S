legend: "b" means Action Item! (If your name is mentioned after "b"
and you aren't really going to do that thing, then please let us
know!); "b" means Action Item that is already done.

#include <std/caveat/lector> // I don't have time to write
explanations of all this, and I may have forgotten parts.

in attendance: Zooko (scribe), Marcus, Brian, Evgeny, David-Sarah,
Kevan (briefly b technical difficulties), CiC (briefly)

Marcus found the quickstart doc to be fine b it was easy to get
Tahoe-LAFS set up. He had been using Linux for a while and so he was
just looking for "What's my 'make'? What's my './configure'
equivalent?".

Marcus says there's a parallel set of getting-started docs maintained
by the I2P people.

Marcus wonders why the multi-introducer patch hasn't been merged into
main Tahoe-LAFS yet, as it has been in use in I2P for a long time and
is quite stable for them. The I2P setup include a cron job that
downloads a new set of introducers and also downloads news. Answer:
the multi-introducer patch may conflict with the accounting project.
The accounting project is going to add the ability to control which
servers your client will use or which clients your server will serve.
In that case, access to the introducer will no longer be sufficient to
allow you to use a set of servers. In that world, we might want to
replace "introducers" with a "gossip" strategy.

BUT

We're reconsidering, because when/if we *do* replace the introduction
process, we could change this behavior without a great deal of
backward-compatibility problems. In fact, Brian thinks that even after
it does the sort of gossip he wants, he might still want a
distinguished set of introducers to serve as "seeds" for gossip, so we
might want to *keep* multi-introducers as is.

Things to do to about the multi-introduction patch:

b" See if it merges with current trunk (which has the
signed-announcements patch, which included significant refactoring of
introduction). b [[Who?]]

b" Let kytv know that we're interested. b [[Zooko]]

b" Write tests that actually exercise the behavior of using multiple
introducers. b [[kytv?]]

b" Write up a plan for forward-compatibility with gossip. b [[Brian,
because nobody else knows what sort of gossip Brian wants,
precisely.]]

Brian says there may be differences of opinion about design strategy
here. He favors a "fully distributed" approach where no node is
distinguished in terms of the introduction service that it provides to
its peers. Zooko wonders if this relates to the "Are We Client-Server
or Peer-To-Peer?" issue. David-Sarah says that this may not make any
difference *in terms of security* for our current use cases:
friendgrids, commercial services, volunteergrids, ... It isn't like
we're currently trying to implement the One Grid To Rule Them All use
case.

[[Added by Zooko ex post facto: I long ago posted a design for
"gossip/distributed-introduction" based on a Chord-like ring which is,
IMHO, simple and scalable, and which is described in sufficient detail
to be implemented. Here it is, it is ticket 68, comment 11:
https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/68#comment:11 . I don't
think it matters much whether the set of introducers that are
participating in that Chord-like ring are a specially selected set a
la the current I2P branch or whether "everyone is an introducer" a la
gossip.]]

Zooko says that the thing he is concerned about isn't the introduction
part b how clients learn about servers b but instead the authorization
part b how clients choose whether or not to use the servers that they
know about. Current Tahoe-LAFS combines those two issues, which is a
problem.

Zooko says that Tahoe-LAFS has very weak security against rollback
attack or DoS, but that if we had server selection (which is a part of
the accounting project) then we would have very strong security
against those. Zooko tells an illustration from Bruce Schneier: if
you're at a coffeeshop and you need to go to the bathroom, you can ask
a random stranger sitting nearby to watch your laptop. If you're
paranoid, you can ask three different random strangers to watch your
laptop and each other. But if three random strangers approach *you*
and offer to watch your laptop, that's different! Zooko says server
selection b where you choose the 1 or 3 servers that you're going to
rely on instead of accepting the offer from 1 or 3 random servers b
makes all the difference in the world in terms of security against DoS
and rollback. Brian wonders what the user experience for that is going
to be like.

Zooko veers the discussion onto Raph Levien's Trust Metric, and thence
onto Brian's cool "Not Tahoe" project.

discussion of Brian's Cool "Not Tahoe" Project. Zooko urges Brian to
make BCNTP be even more "Not-Tahoe-Like" by not having storage
servers. Not having storage servers means you don't have to worry
about how much different people's perspectives on the network overlap
with one another. Brian might use an S3-style hosted approach. He
might let a client publish which set of servers it uses, for the
benefit of its file-sharers. Also, file references can be fat in
Not-Tahoe, since they don't often get sent out of band, so they could
include information about servers.


back to docs: Evgeny's introductory doc is good! It is incomplete. It
is aimed at less sophisticated users. Zooko is unsure if it would
"fit" on the Download page of https://tahoe-lafs.org, or if it should
go somewhere else. It might make a good magazine article. We might end
up with too many started docs (that would be a good problem to have).
There is audience segmentation, for example the I2P starter docs have
been read by many I2P users but not by other users. Zooko wants better
docs for less sophisticated new users, so Zooko is inclined to use
Evgeny's doc. What's the next step? 1. LAFS developers answer some of
Evgeny's questions. b [[Marcus and David-Sarah?]] 2. Test out the doc
on some lab rats^W^Wnew users. b [[Evgeny?]] Evgeny has some users who
want to use Tahoe-LAFS who might beta-test his doc.


Tune in next time for:
 b" Proof-of-Retrievability; Zooko will post it to tahoe-dev in advance
of the meeting so you can read it before the meeting! Warning: it is
long. You might have to turn your phone off or something in order to
get through it. (David-Sarah quips that it probably isn't as long as
the Security Argument For Rainhill.)
 b" Report from Marlowe about translation efforts.
