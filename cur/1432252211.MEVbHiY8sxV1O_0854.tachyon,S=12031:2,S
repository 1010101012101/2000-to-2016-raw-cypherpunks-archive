**     THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM
**     PUBLISHING SCIENTIFIC PAPERS WITH POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS

THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM

In 1972, the United States, the Soviet Union and other nations signed the
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that was supposed to ban biological
weapons.  At that very time, however, the Soviet Union was embarking on a
massive expansion of its offensive biological weapons program, which began
in the 1920s and continued under the Russian Federation at least into the
1990s.

The astonishing story of the Soviet biological weapons enterprise is told
in an encyclopedic new work entitled "The Soviet Biological Weapons
Program: A History" by Milton Leitenberg and Raymond A. Zilinskas (Harvard
University Press, 2012).

	http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674047709

The Soviet biological weapons (BW) program was by far the largest and most
sophisticated such program ever undertaken by any nation.  It was also
intensely secretive, and was masked by layers of classification, deception
and misdirection.

"The program's most important facilities remain inaccessible to outsiders
to this day," Leitenberg and Zilinskas write, "and it has been made a crime
for anyone in present-day Russia to divulge information about the former
offensive BW program."  Needless to say, official archives are closed and
Russian government officials are uncommunicative on the subject, or deny
the existence of the program altogether.

Over a period of a decade or so, Leitenberg and Zilinskas were able to
interview about a dozen former Soviet scientists who were involved in the
Soviet BW program, along with dozens of other sources.  Their revelations
inform the authors' analysis and serve to advance public knowledge of the
subject far beyond previous reports.  Even relatively well-known incidents
like the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax epidemic are cast in a new light.  Many
other aspects of the program will be entirely unfamiliar to most readers.

Much of the book is devoted to a description of the vast infrastructure of
Soviet BW research and production, including descriptions of the various
institutes, their history, their workforce and the nature of their
research, as far as it could be discerned.  Along the way, many fascinating
and sometimes horrific topics are addressed.  For example:

**	In an effort to enhance the weapons-related properties of BW agents,
Soviet scientists spent years working to create a viral "chimera," which is
an organism that contains genetic material from two or more other
organisms.

**	Other scientists worked to eliminate the "epitopes" on the surface of
existing BW agents in order to make them unrecognizable to regular
diagnostic techniques.  By using such a modified agent, "the Soviets would
have made it considerably more difficult for the attacked population to
identify the causative pathogen of the resulting disease outbreak and begin
timely treatment."

**	A project codenamed Hunter (Okhotnik) sought to develop hybrids of
bacteria and viruses such that use of an antibiotic to kill the bacteria
would trigger release of the virus.  "Unlike other national BW programs,
which without exception used only classical or traditional applied
microbiology techniques to weaponize agents, the post-1972 Soviet program
had a futuristic aspect. By employing genetic manipulation and other
molecular biology techniques, its scientists were able to breach barriers
separating species...."

**	The Soviet BW program appears to have taken advantage of the
declassification in the 1970s of a large number of documents from the
United States BW program.  Thus, the design of the Soviet Gshch-304 BW
bomblet was found to closely resemble that of the declassified US E-130R2
bomblet.  In 2001, the US Government moved to reclassify many documents on
the US BW program, but "nothing could be done about recalling reports that
had been distributed relatively freely for more than 35 years."

**	The quality of US intelligence about the Soviet BW program left much to
be desired.  "Intelligence about Soviet BW-related activities is relatively
thin for the pre-1972 period; meager and often of dubious value during
1970-1979; and a little less meager and of better quality during
1980-1990." After 1990, little has been declassified.  "There is an unknown
number of still-classified reports concerning the Soviet BW program
produced by the CIA and perhaps by other agencies that we do not have," the
authors write.  The state of declassification is such that "we have been
able to collect far more information" about the history of Soviet BW
activities from interviews with former Soviet scientists and others than
from declassified official records.

**	In what the authors term "a horrendous mistake by the United States,"
the US government undertook a covert deception and disinformation program
aimed at the Soviet Union in the late 1960s which implied falsely that the
US had a clandestine biological weapons program.  This unfortunate campaign
may have reinforced an existing Soviet belief that the US had never
terminated its own offensive BW program, a belief that lent impetus, if not
legitimacy, to the Soviet BW program.

**	Today, the situation with respect to BW in the former Soviet Union is
"ambiguous and unsatisfactory," Leitenberg and Zilinskas write. "There
remains the possibility that Russia maintains portions of an offensive BW
program in violation of the BWC." Alternatively, "since we do not actually
know what is and has been taking place within the three [Ministry of
Defense BW] facilities since 1992, perhaps the situation is better than
might be feared."

In 23 chapters, the authors painstakingly examine many facets of the
history, structure and operation of the Soviet BW program.  They
scrupulously cite prior scholarship on the subject, while sorting out
verifiable fact, plausible inference, dubious speculation, and error or
fabrication.  (Thus, "No SS-18 ICBM bomblet delivery system was ever
completed, none was ever tested, and obviously none could ever have been
employed.")

But even after 900 pages of often dense text, "there are large gaps in our
understanding of the Soviet BW program" and "readers are cautioned that
much remains to be discovered."

"We have not been able to resolve definitively some of the most important
questions," they observe.  Unanswered questions involve basic issues such
as the motivation and purpose of the program.  Why did the Soviet Union
pursue the development and acquisition of biological weapons?  Who was to
be targeted by Soviet biological weapons b the US?  China?  Europe? b
and under what conceivable circumstances?  And what happens now?

Following a brief period during the Yeltsin years during which Russian
officials acknowledged this activity, "Russia's current official position
is that no offensive BW program had existed in the Soviet Union."

The History of the Soviet Biological Weapons Program was reviewed by
author David E. Hoffman in Foreign Policy last month.

  http://hoffman.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/06/17/why_did_they_do_it

In 2010 the US Government signed an agreement with the former Soviet
Republic of Armenia to cooperate in the control or destruction of dangerous
pathogens, and in other efforts to prevent proliferation of biological
weapons.  The agreement, one of several such documents, was published
earlier this year.

PUBLISHING SCIENTIFIC PAPERS WITH POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS

The recent controversy over publication of scientific papers concerning
the transmissibility of bird flu virus was reviewed in a new report by the
Congressional Research Service. The report cautiously elucidates the
relevant policy implications and considers the responses available to
Congress.

"Because of the complexity of dual-use issues, analysis of a topic
according to one set of policy priorities may lead to unforeseen
complications due to its intersection with other policy priorities," the
report says. "For example, maximizing security may lead to detriments in
public health and scientific advancement, while maximizing scientific
advancement may lead to security risks."

for Congress," July 12, 2012:
