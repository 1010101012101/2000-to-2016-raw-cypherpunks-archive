	It doesn't help me. It's a criminal organization that only

	OK. At this point you are pretty much some kind of bot.

	You don't know what justice is.

	Yes, that's your position. A clear contradiction in terms. An
	absurdity. Nonsense.

	You are supposed to present some kind of rational argument
	here. Crass contradictions are just the opposite of rational
	argument. 

	The game is totally and completely over and you lost big time.

	What are you talking about. Who gives a fuck about the pyramids
	or the space race? 

	Oh you think people should be sacrificed for your retarded
	collective pet projects?

	Whatever. Did I mention that your ramblings are pretty much a
	description of the 'system' we have now. 

	I honestly don't know what you are complaining about.

	"Freedom is not very strongly defined anyway" 

	More meaningless rambling. Are you high or something?

	lol...

	Shouldn't you learn the ABC and master BASIC LOGICAL THINKING
	before trying to 'advance humanity'?

	Are you fucking crazy? You can't grasp BASIC LOGIC and yet you
	want to 'advance humanity'??
