I liked it, but the realistic portions were destroyed by the A.I.
'argument' with the operator.

I have a hard time believing that to be the future, especially when in
the video itself it shows the A.I. making a poor decision and getting
the craft destroyed. I can't imagine a military buying weapons that can
routinely overrule their chain of command

Now explain to me that the female voice was actually a higher ranking
secondary operator, and i'd start to see the benefits.

*operator 1 : do not want to sacrifice craft for discovery of enemy*
*operator 2 : override previous command, potential enemy discovery of
greater priority.*

Making a superior officer appear as if they are 'Siri' could possibly
reduce confrontation and the feeling of being overruled, and thus
increase individual operator happiness, job satisfaction, etc etc.  It
could also reduce the chances that an operator takes personal
responsibility for their actions.

"That stupid AI fucked up, not me. I KNEW they were innocent!"

I liked it, though. Neat footage.
