One interesting variation  {and a suggestion of an alternative) comes from
naval diplomacy.

When there's an official US/UK naval dinner, toasts are drunk (at least on 
shore or on British ships - I think US ships are dry). The Americans
always toast the British Monarch. The Brits in return propose a toast
to the US Constitution.

While I have a lot of problem with the Pledge in any form, I think it
would be greatly improved if it were made to the Constitution, rather
than the flag.
