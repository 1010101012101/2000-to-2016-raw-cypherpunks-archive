A couple of ironies here...

Adelman is a resident of the same small town I live in, Corralitos. He 
has gained a lot of justifiable fame for his clever idea of digitally 
photographing, with accurate GPS readings, the entire California 
coastline. One can imagine all sorts of uses, including doing image 
comparisons, calculations of rates of sand movement, vegetation changes 
(e.g., in sand dunes), and, of course, various kinds of economic 
development.

The second irony is that just today I took my first flying lesson, in a 
Diamond Katana composite/carbon single-prop plane. I took off from the 
Watsonville Airport, which is, I assume, the home airport of Adelman.

(I don't know if I'll continue all the way with flying, but I have a 
second lesson coming up in a few days.)
