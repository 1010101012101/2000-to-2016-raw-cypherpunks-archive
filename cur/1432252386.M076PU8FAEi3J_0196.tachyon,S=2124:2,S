Its a perfectly accurate label.  We have good evidence for the
skin lampshades, and why would anyone raise the issue except to
white wash nazism?   The people who are posting in this list
that recently existent communism is not so bad, also post that
capitalism is really terrible.  Obviously they want to do it
all over again.  Similarly the people who deny the skin
lampshades, also argue the Jews had it coming.  Hitler did not
skin them, but he should have.
