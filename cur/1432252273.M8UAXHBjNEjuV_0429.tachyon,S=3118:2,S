let's look at 2002 operating revenue as a clue to telco size:
1. Verizon - $67,625,000,000
2. SBC - $43,138,000,000
3. AT&T - $37,827,000,000
4. Sprint+PCS - $27,256,000,000 (now add nextel?)
5. BellSouth - $22,440,000,000
6. Quest - $19,965,000,000

funny there is no mention of requests to Sprint; why their conspicuous absence?

here's a paranoid theory: they already provided pen register
equivalent data in real-time and could easily support the additional
raw fiber taps used for targeted capture before 9/11 made it a well
funded and well obfuscated priority across all carriers.

Daytona wasn't the only prototype / telco system adopted in this
domestic info war zone.

keep the whistles blowing...
