We posted Eric's comments to Wikipedia, and four mintues later
they had been removed. 

We posted a Wiki comment at the Berry entry about Wikipeida's 
censorship of the item and a pointer to Cryptome's hosting of the 
comments, and that was censored five minutes later. So an entry 
about the censorship was added to Cryptome's entry on Wiki.
