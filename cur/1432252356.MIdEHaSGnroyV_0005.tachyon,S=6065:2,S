Japan's Foreign Minister Tanaka Calls Pez Bush &quot;Totally An Asshole&quot;
by repost 4:19pm Thu Aug 22 '02 (Modified on 5:09pm Thu Aug 22 '02)

Original article at http://www.weeklypost.com/010625/010625b.htm#one "On 
June 17, a day before Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka would be meeting US 
Secretary of State Collin Powell, Ms. Tanaka visited German Town High 
School in Philadelphia where she studied for two years when she was a high 
school student.The alumnae of the high school gave Ms. Tanaka a grand 
welcome. She enjoyed a class reunion and talking with her old classmates. 
Ms. Tanaka did not accompany interpreters and stenographers. She made a 
remark about George Bush during her conversation with her classmates and 
her words will remain in the history of Japan's foreign ministers. When she 
entered the library, she sat in the same wooden chair she used when she was 
a student. She remarked, "I remember the smell of this chair. It has not 
changed at all." She was deep in sentimental memories of those days. Makiko 
Tanaka said, 'What I learned at this school was spiritualism based on 
religion, the principles of a simple life and love as well as peace. I 
learned how important it is to listen to others and express one's opinion. 
I have respected this principle throughout my entire life thus far." "Then, 
one classmate raised a political issue and said to her, "There is no 
scientific proof that the earth is warming and no legitimate reason why we 
need the 'star wars' missile defense system. Don't you think so?" Ms. 
Tanaka appreciated the question. In response to that question, Japan's 
Foreign Minister Makiko reportedly said, "I will definitely oppose the new 
missile defense plan proposed by President Bush. It is beyond my 
imagination that we need it." Ms. Tanaka's visit to Washington DC was 
agreed to by the US government after strenuous efforts by the Japanese 
government. The objective of her trip was to vindicate what she expressed 
about US foreign policies at meetings with her counterparts from other 
countries. She conveyed her messages of criticism about the foreign polices 
of the US government to them. She must have told them faithfully what she 
believed. Her address immediately caused problems in the Japanese political 
world. "During the conversation with her old classmates at the reception in 
German Town High School, The Weekly Post learned that Ms. Tanaka made a 
remark about George Bush, "He is totally an asshole" in English. The 
majority of her classmates seemed to support the Republican Party, however, 
they were critical about Mr. Bush's new missile defense plan. When Ms. 
Tanaka made this remark, the classmates in the room were reportedly 
excited.There has never been a statesman in Japanese history that called a 
US president, 'an asshole.'" --Weekly Post Editorial, 6/25/01
