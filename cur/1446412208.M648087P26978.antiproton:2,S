Because it helps you. Consistently applied and effective justice reduces
the crime rates. By defining crime to be behaviors that are:

* Game theory wise bad - like driving (very) fast being good for you, bad
for everyone else. Or contract enforcement - having serious enforcement
even for less valuable contracts is very hard (=3Dexpensive) to do. The edg=
e
of acceptable is sought, and usually differs significantly per person.
(Asbestos processing company CEO saying it's a good thing workers are
unaware of the dangers, it makes for greater profit, and therefore prevents
informing the workers. Past the line? Maybe, but it was legal and didn't
cause public retaliation*)

* Fragile but preferable - no petty theft (like jackets) makes it much
easier to be in shared spaces, but any enforcement is more expensive than
the jacket stolen. It's very hard to prevent petty theft. But also
shoplifting, being honest about products (Volkswagen's lies might've forced
other manufacturers to perform fraud), etc

* Simply too unkind - fraud, murder, serious harassment (although the
border is hard to place), theft of freedom (rape is both harassment and
theft of freedom), (not all but many ways of) causing pain or injury, etc

I think it's important to create law that's conservative and very morally
and ethically neutral. For me that's the difference between being a force
for evil and a force for good.

I ran into a fascinating example yesterday, a group of women was mad a
friend for leaving without saying she would (which is a strange thing to
do, why not say bye?), and for leaving with a guy although she has a
boyfriend. I don't know her boyfriend arrangement, or how they're doing,
but seemingly that made no difference in the first place. They were forming
a loyal monogamy cartel! They did not respect their friend's ethical/moral
choice. But I can't say it was entirely unreasonable, if she claimed to be
exclusive to the guy it's probably very unkind.

To clarify; this was a case of micro-oppression. Their friends were clearly
intend on excluding her and otherwise sanctioning her for her behavior,
although her behavior was, well, her conscious choice. They could've
decided not to care about her, and they wouldn't be upset about her
leaving. But they cared and sanctioned instead. If you don't like a person
you should attempt to disconnect and isolate first, I think.

I think justice should not depend upon ethics very much at all. If it does
it should incorporate the ethics of those involved into it's judgement, but
if you do this justice will become arbitrary complex and faults are likely.
(faulty justice is severe unkindness)

* justice increases the cost of retaliation - this is one of the biggest
disadvantages. An eye for several eyes might seem pretty reasonable as for
retaliation, but we punish this severely everywhere now. (I'd prefer not
wasting an eye) (real world: you may not stop NAM - a Dutch natural gas
company - from draining so much gas beneath the earth underneath your feet
that the earth gives way and fills the void with your house, because the
gas draining is legal, because it's hard to estimate the risk of pumping
the gas, and because it's very profitable (maybe worth more than the house
anyway))

It's a fucking for virginity kind of thing. And it's because our states are
so well matched - you need only be comfortably more armstrong than the
other wrestlers. (why that means you need to be able to nuke the entire
enemy a few times over, even after considering countermeasures, well, uhm,
we all make mistakes. Either that or the propaganda lies about the
countermeasures' effectiveness! So, is the USGOV incompetent or shrewd? )

True, but we have made it far easier by ways of state. Certain arrangements
are impossible without an allmighty third party. For example, you will
never expend 100 euro's to retrieve 50. So, a promise of paying 50 euro's
is not a very good promise if there's no cheaper way of enforcing that
payment. This is often possible, through reputation or the like, but not
always, and it's always difficult (=3Dcosts).

Having a third party say "I'll suffer any expense, and I sure can, to
ensure the enforcement of this promise, and will be sure punish the
violator severely", means the total enforcement cost becomes 0 - not even a
fool will challenge an adversary that truly means that.

That entity needn't be the state, but it's better the more
disproportionately powerful it is. Also because of vagueness. In "maybe
more powerful" situations a test of power is sometimes required. And if
there's more than two powerful parties they will weaken oneself with such a
test. (what doesn't kill you wounds you still)

Economies of scale is one reason. The other is singular ginormous efforts.

It's tricky. I meant that, one way or another, we arrive at "political"
decisions. One could say that the parts involved in arriving at that
decision are a system. If the system sucks, we're screwed.

It's much better to have a system that generates "appropriate" choices.
Sometimes the right choice is undefined, but a choice must be made still.
For example; a carbon emission auctioning system, which is the right choice
given Capitalism, Game Theory and something bad increasing with carbon
emission, is not implementable without filling out an essential parameter,
how bad do we accept things to get?

Like, maybe I'm okay trading an "idyllic truly empty desert" for "cesspool
of all things poisonous" if we profit a lot from it. ( if value of desert <
value of cesspool + value of profit.) CNGOV decided that was a good trade,
and I (strongly) agree. The BBC

not. (lake here

I meant, if we have a good way to generate general interest choices (or,
idk, "appropriate" interest choices) then we should use it.

I think the "special interest" should be humanity as a whole, averaged with
SUM(PERSON_i)

Through the political system. It depends on the system of course.

Related;
I think we can produce a formal logic for politics. It can model the
effects of a policy choice, and project them into a single dimension. The
single dimension is "desirability" or "euro's", it's supposed to be the
same thing anyway.

It'll be very challenging to do that formal logic properly. I don't think
it's useful in every situation. Mapping is easy for economic situations,
but very hard for emotions.

Particularly challenging would be, say, family law. When is it reasonable
to split a family? When Suffering_family < Suffering_society? Not if you
prefer to leave people alone, then it's Suffering_family + neutrality_bias
< Suffering_society. Also, both Suffering_family and Suffering_society will
be the results of combining a very large amount of factors.

One could model the amount of coercion upon an actor, how much a tax
exemption would create incentives.

I'm sorry for not having good examples. My understanding of formal logic is
not that great, and I haven't actually tried to model a government's
considerations. I think formal logic is the successor of "legalese", harder
to speak and read, but once the mapping and relating is done the reasoning
is absolute. Much easier to find mistakes, be precise, and much harder to
make mistakes regarding governance.

(note: formal logics dealing with fuzziness are even much harder to
write/read, but will be a definite must)

For the system's actors to behave as they should, as determined by the
system. In a republic a politician is intended to act in the best interest
of its supporters. Businesses can at times provide great enough incentive
to causes them to act otherwise.

Freedom is not very strongly defined anyway. It means you can't be "forced"
to do something, but it's very rare for death not to be an alternative
choice. Reality narrows our choices most significantly, but through law and
enforcement we can change the "economic landscape" and cause what once was
the best choice ('deepest valley') to become only meh, or very not good
('high ridge'). I guess freedom is when you have no (clear) optimal
choices, which isn't actually preferable.

But I think we understand people so badly that it's better to make them
responsible for their own mistakes, rather than sometimes make a wrong
choice for them. As our understanding of "the human condition" grows, so
does our ability to make choices that are actually better according to
certain measures (certain measures because nihilism informs clearly that
nothing truly matters). Perhaps freedom is being allowed to choose the
measure.

Mathematically it makes sense to have competition and free markets. In
practice the actors do not obey perfectly, and cause a lot of reality.
Additionally, while a market is finding it's optimum (the best way to do a
certain thing) competition actually has significant cost. Sometimes reality
shifts faster than markets anneal, and we get stuck with a lot of
competition instead of expediting that energy to moving towards the ideal
solution. (also game theory)

Uhm, the ideal criminal monopoly, to me, would be criminal enough to ensure
it's own existence, and do things I like as well. Like advancing humanity.
(competing with the aliens that might already be underway, or finding a way
for them to want to join our superior political system so we may advance
together against yet more aliens that might not exist, and then to delay
the heat death of the universe, I suppose)

Depends on what it does. It sure beats having competing governments.
Racism, inflation and excessive military power are what you get, not much
more afaik. (and replication of efforts)

Rights are defined by government, a self restraint alike "I'll never drink
again". But I don't think that's very meaningful. Rights are supposed to be
impossible to violate. If the government is incapable of violating the
right, then it's a right. But by that point it's synonymous with a
citizen's power. In practice "rights" are barriers, not absolute restraints=
.

Natural rights are entirely different from rights. It is as you say, a plea
for encoding some specific morality into law. Claiming something is a
natural right seems to imply that it's been a right since before the
politics determined what is and isn't a right. I think it's pretty
meaningless, but I deeply empathize with the emotions involved.

I could hear myself screaming that my natural rights are being violated.
(as a futile plea after I give up hope)

I think if humans have natural rights, then why don't animals? Maybe you
think they do, maybe you think they don't. But the same goes for humans,
some people think something should be a right, some people don't. But for
justice to be applied consistently we need there to be a clearly defined
set of rules, so we should agree upon that set of rules. We're not very
good at it :(

I think my understanding is still not aligned. What states pretend to get
their powers from 'natural rights'? I thought it used to be "God played
lottery and my name came up" for kings, queens and pharaohs. And at some
point that line could just be omitted because of legacy/buy-in.

I think when a (messenger of) the state comes up and goes "you better pay
your tax or I'll whip your ass" then that's, well, where they get their
power, and natural rights don't really come into the whipping.

Pretty sure it's more about whipping.

If it really was consent I could send a letter to the king informing him
I've had enough of his shit and I'll just fend for myself in the western
sahara, or on a boat or something, but I think they'll still come get me if
I break the law ((most) Dutch law applies to citizens abroad).

It's my plan for world domination. I just make a system that's so nice
everyone will come running. Probably easier than whipping everyone into
obedience. It could even be no-conflict with the governments, running two
systems in parallel until either gets attention starved.
