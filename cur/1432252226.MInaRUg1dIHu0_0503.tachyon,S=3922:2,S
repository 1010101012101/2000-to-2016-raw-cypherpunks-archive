    Spoken like a true fascist. What the fuck do you think executive pardon 
is but just another "checks and balances"? The fact is that it's the criminal
scum in power at the moment who are fucking the constitution with their dirty
little "war on some drugs". Basic 1st Amemdment freedom of religion went 
right down the drain with the very first drug law. It's religious persecution
pure and simple, nothing more, nothing less. Harry Browne should go further,
if elected he should not only pardon every person ever convicted of a drug or
gun offense, but he should order the immediate arrest of anyone who ever voted 
for a drug or gun law, and who ever enforced these despicable illegal laws.
    Take your stupid babbling about your phoney politics elsewhere -- it has no
relativity to cypherpunks.
