some very sensitive citizen data is already being accessed and processed
offshore I doubt there are laws against its only copy being moved
offshore as well. The companies doing so, of course, would need to
prevent the data's corruption or misuse. >ALso, anybody know if there are

by offshore workers unhappy with pay. I can't recall the exact details
but one situation, I think, involved some Pakistanis threatening to
release confidential medical patient data, a clear violation of the HIPPA
regs., if they didn't get more dosh. steve
