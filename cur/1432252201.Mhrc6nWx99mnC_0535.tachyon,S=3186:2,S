Unreliable? We average six and eight month uptimes. And when the outages
occur it has been either hardware failure or a service failure. We
average 2 hardware failures per year and it usualy(!) takes less than 4
hours to have it replaced (not bad for off the shelf consumer equipment).
A scratch OS re-load is a 2hr downtime. I have the system down less than 8
hours a month (usualy only a few minutes at a time) for routine
maintenance and cleaning. We usualy get about 4 service interruptions of
some sort or another a month. They usualy last about 4 hours. The section
of town I live in is over 100 years old and in major reconstruction so
this isn't too bad. Irrespective, there isn't anything I can do about
those anyway.

At your age, you wish you were as regular as SSZ is.

Yes, we had a ISDN/Ethernet issue. Replacing the hardware with a suitable
model was harder than expected, coudn't find anyone open with stock on
Saturday.

As to rain, 4in/hr is a tad more than a sprinkle junior.
