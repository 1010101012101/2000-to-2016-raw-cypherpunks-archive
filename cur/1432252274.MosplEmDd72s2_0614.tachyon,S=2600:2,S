It also doesn't seem to be on Springer LINK yet.

For what it's worth, this is not my experience. While not every paper is
online, a large number of people make papers available from their web
pages.

Plus I'm very lucky in that my library subscribes to the online Springer
LINK service.

It's been a while since looking at the Springer-Verlag copyright notice. I
remember that it allows authors to publish papers on their web pages. Is
this correct?

What are the ACM and IEEE copyright terms like? Do they also allow
publication on the web?

Computer science might have it better than the life sciences in this
regard. de facto if not de jure.
