"It" is not a point event. It's a long, ongoing process.

And yes, we're in it, but that is obvious to everyone. You're asking 
when to prepare, and the answer to that is to always be prepared.

This is a better data point...

Town makes it's own currency, wildly popular for local purchase. Most 
importantly (and not obvious) is that you could depeg it from the dollar 
the moment the shit hits the fan, and repeg it to the Canadian dollar, 
or something real. Merchants win even with the 10% "discount", since you 
avoid the visa/mastercard fees.

More of this is coming, state currencies aren't far behind.
