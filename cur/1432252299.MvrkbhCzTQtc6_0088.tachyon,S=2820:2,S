  My apologies. This is a not what I meant to  say. The brca genes
  can be passed through both paternal and maternal lines.

  I was thinking of eugenics where something was forced upon others,
  which I do not think is desirable. 

  The invention of agriculture has not yet culminated. It gave/gives

   Reverting may or not be possible. The products of some germ line
   may like what they are and wil lnot revert, no matter what other
   folks think.
