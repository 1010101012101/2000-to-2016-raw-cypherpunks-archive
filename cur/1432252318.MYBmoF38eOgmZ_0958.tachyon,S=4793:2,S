Coeur D'Alene has a lot of tourism going on,
and you must not get out much.
I hear a backfire at least once a week in Boston.

If anything, after the incident the AN's neighbors 
might have decided to milk it for what it's worth.
AN has been depressing the tourism in the area and
many of the locals want their heads on stakes. A friend of mine's
cousin was there at the last march and some of the neighbors
were there hoping to get a few punches in Aryan noses
and then blame the ruckus on the JDL. The AN
has a charming rep around there.

Oh, hell yes.

Sharpton and Jackson should both pay for
the damage and injuries they've incited in NYC.
