The timescale for checking these quotes was not specified, I think it's
safe to assume that years did transpire.

We've already seen how you picked up an extra word in that massacre quote,
is it safe to assume you've made other errors?

jim.com?  jamesd?  this is your personal website?  O-kaaaaaaay,,,
*there's nothing like citing an impartial source, is there?*
Just the same, I'll take a look.  If it's more than what, 200 words(?),
I wonder if Chomsky would be interested, along with the calumnies et al.?
*empty threat, I've no time and really don't care - but I wonder if the
page will still be up, tomorrow, when I check*

A-HEM,,,  THE content of THE quote is highly contentious, is it not?
           ^^^            ^^^

News flash for ya goodbuddy - that quote of yours has already been
repudiated.

Got anything better?  Something more recent, perhaps?
Like, within the last decade or two?
And hey?  Rather than a generic "Chomsky quotes..." give us a specific
one, like that other one we've sliced and diced and shoved back down
your throat.  20 years old, or less.
