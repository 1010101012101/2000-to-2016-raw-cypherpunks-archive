What processors, specifically? (If you expect a dual Pentium 100 system
to work miracles, that's your problem.)

What operating system? I'm pretty sure OpenBSD encrypts swap out of the
box, and it is SMP capable. Chances are if you're getting double-digit
load just from normal use due to swap encryption, you either don't have
anywhere near enough RAM, don't have enough CPU, or the code you're
running is inefficient.
