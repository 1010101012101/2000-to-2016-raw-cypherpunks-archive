Today some people on this list tried to tell me that 'Port 25 is SMTP'.
That's funny because I use it for SSH.

Yes it was.

It's doublespeak now, said political promises vanish once elected.
If the discriminators get their way you better hope you have
real estate in the Balkans.

Yes they are. You better encrypt the net now before they're
able to inject that power twist into arguments of political arms.

Just like AdBlockPlus, user's mail clients should be shipped and
extensible with simple local filtering spam/virus/malware processing
engines. Users, having no such simple plugin tools available to them
in early days, complained of spam which drove provider/anti filtering
more than providers separate ability to handle the traffic load did. All
the anti position did for providers was shift their cost from disk spool
storing it to cpu rejecting it. And users got censorship tools developed
and deployed against them in return. Failure!

Users need to do their own filtering and encrypt now.
