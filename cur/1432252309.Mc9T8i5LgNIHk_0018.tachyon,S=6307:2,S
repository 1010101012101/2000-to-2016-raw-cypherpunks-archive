Sure, those are still needed. Though I wouldn't be so sure that toilet and
floor scrubbers will be needed anymore 20 years from now.

This is just bull shit. You don't have to do well in school to do well in
the job market. You just need to have the right kind of skills to do well
in the job market; and if the companies not hiring you are stupid and only
looking at your (school) credentials and not what you know, you can always
put up your own company and succeed that way.

Truly that mentality of school worship, which you talk about, makes me
sick. It's a myth that you need to do well in school in order to make it
out there.

Oh, but it is not a zero sum game. Of course the bottom X% will always be
shit-haulers, sure. But here's the catch. If the bottom X% are people who
could do some complicated work that would earn them $100 000 a year, then
the shit haulers will have to be paid more than that amount a year. Or no
one will apply for those shitty jobs. The basics of economics: If there's
a shortage of something, markets tend to rise up the value until the
demand and supply meet. Exactly same does go for unregulated job market.

Hell yeah. Public school system should be abolished right now. Hmm, I'm
not quite as fanatical on these things as Tim is (who probably would want
to shoot all those teachers and administrators), but I do find public
schools to be something quite horrible.

No, no, no. Public schools don't educate. Their purpose is to teach
obedience and understanding that a single person cannot do without the
government. Thus the nooks in Washington can get to keep their power.

You really think there is this big conspiracy that covers all the
companies working in the US, which keeps these black lists and exists just
to screw those who don't like the system?

How about just saying that if one is lazy and does not do his work well,
he might be screwed - and that is frankly a problem of his own making. You
take up on a contract, you keep it.

Nonetheless, I think we do such people a great disservice if we do not
show that their culture has a very bad bias against learning and
understanding. Such a bias, if it exists, should not be hidden, or shunted
upon; it should be brought to broad day light and shown in all its
stupidity.
