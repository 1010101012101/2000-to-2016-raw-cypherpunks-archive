I don't know.  Sayyid Qutb, one of the founders of modern Islamic 
Fundamentalism managed to *write* his all-time bestseller "Mallem 
Fittareek" (Milestones) while in an Egyptian prison.  Nasser executed him 
for it a few years after he got out.

Actually, reading is quite popular in prison.  As is writing.
