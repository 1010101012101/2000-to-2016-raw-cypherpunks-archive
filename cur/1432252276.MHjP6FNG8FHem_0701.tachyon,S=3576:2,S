I modified the source, adding an option similar to
"pgp_create_traditional" that I called "pgp_text_plain".  Using this
option, any message that doesn't otherwise use a multipart/MIME
message will create a text/plain message with content-disposition
"inline".  This insures that any mailer that supports MIME but doesn't
recognize the application/pgp content-type will display the mail as
plaintext.  Presumably, things that don't support MIME will just
display the text automatically.

Would you like the patch?
