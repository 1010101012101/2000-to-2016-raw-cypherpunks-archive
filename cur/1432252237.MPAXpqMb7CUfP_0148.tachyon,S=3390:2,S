Hi,

I'm happy to announce the setup of a mailing list for strongSwan, an
OpenSource IPsec implementation for the Linux operating system,
running both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. The strongSwan project home is

   http://www.strongswan.org

strongSwan is based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and my X.509
patch that I have been developing over the last three years.

The mailing list forum is open both to strongSwan users and developers/
contributors. If the list traffic will grow in volume, it will be
split into separate users and developers lists.

In order to limit SPAM, only subscribed list members can post to

   users@lists.strongswan.org

Please subscribe to the list via the URL

   http://lists.strongswan.org/mailman/listinfo/users/

An archive of the mailing list will be maintained at

   http://lists.strongswan.org/pipermail/users/

Kind regards

Andreas
