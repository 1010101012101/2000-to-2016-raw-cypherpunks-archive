The system described allows the user to take a reciept (which has
only numbers on it) and use a website to determine that the vote
was recorded correctly.

A decoy receipt would also have to pass this test.

Frankly, the whole online-verification step seems like an
unneccesary complication.

* Both real and decoy receipts would have to be in the database
for verification - which bothers me a lot.

* There seems to be no provision for recounts - what are they 
supposed to do - have everybody send in their receipts? How can you
tell the decoys from the real?

I give VoteHere kudos for releasing their source, but it doesnt
solve the e-voting problem.
