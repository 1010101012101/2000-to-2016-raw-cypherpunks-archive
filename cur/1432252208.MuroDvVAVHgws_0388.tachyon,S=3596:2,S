The argument "Using X shows you have something to hide" is 
unlikely to impress in a world where most respectable middle 
class people have committed  multiple felonies theoretically 
worth seven years each.

Similarly, there is much truth in Black Unicorn's argument that 
the systematic destruction of potentially inconvenient records is 
illegal. However since many other things that large companies 
with deep pockets is doing are even more illegal, nothing is 
going to stop them from systematically purging records.  The
court will no doubt be unamused by Micorosoft's new email policy,
but it was even less amused by the emails that turned up last
time.
