No idear. I would not trust either source too much. There's
been much acrimony about frog admin in the remops days.
Both sides made good points about each other, so I dunno
whom to trust.

FWIW, apart from regular DDoSes I've never been harassed
about running a Tor server in Germany. Of course, for what I
know it might be tapped upstream, or (since the colo hoster
has root on it) bugged.

I don't care too much, because Tor is not designed to
be TLA-proof (also, my paranoia level is insufficiently high).
