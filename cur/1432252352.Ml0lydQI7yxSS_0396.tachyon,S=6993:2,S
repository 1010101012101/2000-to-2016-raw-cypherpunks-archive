"Indeed, I've heard the same. One could argue that for someone to believe in 
something (religion) so intensely as to shun all moral explanation against 
this hypothesis and to persist in those beliefs without any proof is akin to 
schizophrenia."

Well, I'm sure this is not an issue that Cypherpunks is going to want to 
spend a ton of time on, but let's be clear here. There's "belief", and then 
there's "faith". With belief,the believer refuses to acknowledge and accpet 
facts that disagree with their (narrow) worldview. I can't help but put the 
"Creationists" in this category. (Even a cursory look at their "science" 
makes it clear that there's TONS of information they ignored or explain away 
with absurd notions.)

Faith is a different matter. With faith, the faithful see the "facts" (as 
they are commonly understood) and still find a way to believe in something 
unseen. Belief contradicts reason, faith operates in parallel. I would argue 
that great scientists operated with a decent amount of the latter, and 
Galileo is a good example. At the time, the geocentric theory was still able 
to predict most celestial events better than a heliocentric one. But Galileo 
had a deeper intuitive sense that something was "wrong" with that geocentric 
theory, and its clumsy and mind-boggling complexity.

Likewise, every now and then one encounters religious people who recognize 
the "unreasonabilty" of what they believe. (Indeed, it's not easy to believe 
in a God that allows, for instance, the Holocaust to occur). I find these 
people very different from the "believer" category, and would place folks 
like Michelangelo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Kierkegaard, Galileo, St John of 
the Cross (a Spanish mystic tortured by the inquisition) and many others in 
this category.

As for being akin to Schizophrenia, I'd point out that Schizophrenia is not 
a "mental" disorder per se, but a genetically triggered even that causes a 
measurable, physical degradation in the brain (a Schizophrenic's brain can 
be identified in autopsies).
