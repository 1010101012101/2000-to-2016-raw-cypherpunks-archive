Al-Jazeera news service was one of the users of the
Infocom Corporation, http://www.infocomcorp.com/
web site in Texas that the Fedz shut down September 5.

based in Qatar, and
several major Muslim American organizations such as the
Council on American Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America,
