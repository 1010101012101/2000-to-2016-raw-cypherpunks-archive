Of course any animal is going to be an imperfect fit to a political 
point.  Both ants and bees, to just name two, are "social insects."

Anyway, we are stuck with the basic core, brilliantly given to us 
2500 years ago by Aesop (my recollection is that he compiled standard 
fables).

A pity that today's children are so busy being fed junk like "Heather 
Has Two Mommies" and are not being taught the most basic core values. 
Of course, I am not arguing that it is the role of State education to 
do this...this is why parents should not be taxed for schools. Or, 
failing this, they should at least get vouchers for the school of 
their choice.

Or, failing either of these better alternatives, set up a fairly 
simple system of "Blue" and "Red" schools, with competing curricula. 
The Blue School teaches reading, writing, and arithmetic, plus 
mix-ins of history, sports, science, etc. The Red School teaches 
self-esteem, racial harmony, the joys of lesbian sex, the horrors of 
capitalism, etc.

Let parents decide which school they want their children in. If 70% 
want their kids in the Red School, so be it.

By the way, this can logistically be done simply by erecting a 
moveable barrier down the middle of a school. Minor issues, not 
insurmountable. Then, as the parental preference shifts the 
percentage, the barrier can be moved.


Apparently complex problems often have simple solutions, something I 
once learned from John McCarthy.
