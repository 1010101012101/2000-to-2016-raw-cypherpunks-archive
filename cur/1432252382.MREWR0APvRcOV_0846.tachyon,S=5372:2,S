  Expert: Seized disk had encrypted files

  By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer

  Wed Apr 11, 9:36 PM ET

  A Navy investigator testified Wednesday that a computer disk seized from
  the brother of a Chinese-born engineer accused of stealing U.S. defense
  technology secrets contained encrypted files.

  Nicholas Mikus, an investigative computer specialist for the Naval Criminal
  Investigative Service, said the files could only be unlocked with a
  specific "key," a chain of 113 letters that was stored on a floppy disk.

  Mikus was the latest witness called by the government in its case against
  Chi Mak, an engineer accused of passing sensitive military information to
  the Chinese government for more than 20 years.

  Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen who worked for Anaheim-based defense
  contractor Power Paragon, has pleaded not guilty. He is charged with
  conspiracy to export defense material to China, failure to register as a
  foreign agent, attempted and actual export of defense articles and making
  false statements.

  His wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted.

  Mak, 66, was arrested on Oct. 28, 2005, after his brother, Tai Mak, and
  sister-in-law were stopped at Los Angeles International Airport as they
  tried to board a flight to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China.

  Investigators said they found a disk in their luggage that contained
  encrypted files on an electronic propulsion system that would make U.S.
  submarines virtually undetectable underwater.

  Mikus said the disk contained a folder labeled "DLL" that held three
  directories filled with encrypted files. The disk also contained three
  files containing notes from biology lectures and two files of Chinese
  music, he said.

  Mikus did not testify about the contents of the encrypted files but said
  the encryption was done on Oct. 25, 2005 - three days before the Maks were
  arrested.

  Prosecutors have said the floppy disk that contained the "key" was found
  inside a white envelope in a drawer in Tai Mak's bedside table.
  Investigators also said they found three disks from Chi Mak that contained
  the original, unencrypted files that were found on the disk in Tai Mak's
  luggage.

  Under cross-examination by the defense, Mikus acknowledged that encryption
  programs more sophisticated than the one used on the seized disk are
  available for free or for a small fee on the Internet and also come with
  Windows Vista.

  He also said the encrypted files were not "hidden" under the two music
  files, as prosecutors have alleged.

  Court papers indicate investigators found documents at Chi Mak's house on
  the DDX Destroyer, an advanced technology warship, and lists in Chinese
  asking Mak for information about torpedoes, electromagnetic artillery
  systems and technology used to detect incoming missiles at his house.

  Tai Mak has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to export defense
  articles, possession of property in aid of a foreign government, failure to
  register as a foreign agent and making false statements.
