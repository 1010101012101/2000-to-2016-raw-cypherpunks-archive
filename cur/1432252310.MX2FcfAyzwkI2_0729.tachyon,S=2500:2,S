I suppose neither Mr. Rupp nor the Inquirer could be bothered to read
the bill or the section of Oregon law referenced by it.  Or perhaps
reading a legislative summary was just too complicated or time-intensive
for their busy schedules, and they decided to skip that formality in
their quest to distribute their quota of truth to the public.

The provisions in Section 3 of the bill, currently in Section 19, Ch.
666 of Oregon Laws, are not related to the first part of the bill which
seems to define terrorism.
