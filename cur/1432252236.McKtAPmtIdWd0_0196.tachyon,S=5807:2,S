It is indeed, and many of us are fighting in many more areas than crypt=
o=20
alone. But strong crypto helps immensely, I can assure you from my expe=
rience=20
in debating with politicians about Internet censorship ideas.

If I can use *both* arguments -- that of surveillance/censorship being=20=

unethical and unlawful in a democratic state, AND that of technical=20
difficulties to implementing these due to crypto -- I can be much more=20=

effective in such debates:

I fail to see the relevance of this with regard to discussion of mesh n=
etworks=20
and us being able to create another layer on any layer that is already=20=

controlled by the government. Such layer (i.e. TOR, I2P, FreeNet, Retro=

does not fall into any of the categories outlined above (please note th=
e "and=20
performing any of the following" in the first; "having all of the follo=
wing"=20
in the second).
