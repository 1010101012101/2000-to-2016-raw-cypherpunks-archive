Renting a VPS is not ownership of the server/host.

If you don't own or at least control (physical access and all) the
hardware, your server's RAM is owned/pwned.

Think: VM is migrated across the hosting provider network, RAM and all.

Think: Root in the host, has access to RAM of all guests.

Think.

If you don't own it, you don't control it.
If you don't control it, it will be used against you.
