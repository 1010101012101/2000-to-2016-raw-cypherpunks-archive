Those are speaking words did you not say a few days ago,
now worth more than wired fool's nuggets. Who's your agent
for priceless yarp, and what's her cut? These questions are
aimed at learning how to peddle air, ragh, harrup, spittle to
the left, spittle to the right, pause, sip, shuffle notes, crack
a lame one, hunch your back, peer into the future, a thoughtful
wrinkle, lose your train, go blank, blink, cough, grind teeth,
stare at the blurred sheets, bowels rumble, pucker up,
gasp what was in that curry. A panicked recall: laptop left
in the loo, DeCSSed DVD XXX cropped to hit highspots.
Big ID blares: this belongs to Today's Speechifier, if found
dispose, do not, please, slashdot it.
