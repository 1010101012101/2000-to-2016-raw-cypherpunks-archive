October 9, 2000

This message is to alert United States citizens of targeting by Canada =
conservation officers threatening excessive penalties of alleged minor =
violations and exercising kangaroo court activities to achieve their =
goals. This message is also aimed at Canada citizens to urge their =
elected officials to monitor such activity and also urge them to repeal =
the current gun law registration regulations. These laws will not =
succeed in achieving the intended purpose, but only increase your taxes =
and insure the full employment of gun enforcement officers.=20

I would like now to summarize an incident I had on a goose-hunting trip =
near Lake Lenore and Humboldt Saskatchewan. While driving down a road =
with my son and cousin, we noticed a flock of white geese out in the =
middle of a quarter section of land.=20

I dropped my son and cousin off and my mission was to flush the birds =
and hopefully one would by chance fly over them and they could attempt =
to shoot it. Because they were quite a distant out in the field I =
attempted to drive my van closer to the flock to I could get out and =
flush the geese. Being more wary then expected the geese flushed before =
I could get very close to them so I turned around and exited the field. =
While driving down a public road after exiting the field conservation =
officer approached from the opposite direction and turned on his red =
lights and pulled me over. He accused me of chasing geese with a vehicle =
and proceeds to threaten me that the penalties could be very severe =
including confiscation of my vehicle, $50,000 fine, and arrest. He also =
asks to check my gun, which is in a case and in back of my van. He also =
attempts to confiscate my gun because he says I do not have a proper =
plug in it. I explain to him that the gun will only hold three 3 =BD =
inch shells, which was all that I was shooting. After checking with his =
office they determined that was ok. He then gives me an appearance =
notice to appear in provincial court and seizes one of our guns to =
assure that I will make an appearance and the penalty accessed will be =
determined by the judge. On the notice the section which contains the =
alleged crime is left blank so that I have no way of knowing what =
specific violation I will be charged with or what the penalties could =
really be.=20

When court date arrives I drive to the office of the conservation =
officer where court is held. The judge is actually a justice of the =
peace who also operates an automobile body shop in town. The =
conservation officer tells me that court may be a little late as the =
owner of the body shop had some employees that did not come in so it =
would be a while before he could come over and act as judge. When the =
judge arrives, he comes in is auto body uniform and the conservation =
officer reads some prepared script that provincial court under the crown =
is now in session. Just to paint a clear picture the court consists of =
two people, one being the Justice of the Peace and the other being the =
conservation officer who is acting as chief witness, prosecuting =
attorney, court reporter, clerk and any other function that most courts =
have. My name is read and I am asked to come forward. The conservation =
officer asks me if I plead guilty. I said plead guilty to what, the =
appearance notice that I was given does not have any alleged violation =
on it. I than recounted my story of what actually happened. I was than =
shown an Information Denonciation form that said I unlawfully used a =
vehicle to drive migratory birds to hunters. Since I did not know what I =
was going to be charged with, I had no way to defend what actually =
happened.=20

Since then I have looked up the word drive in Webster=92s dictionary and =
the following is a definition. 1 a : to frighten or prod (as game or =
cattle) into moving in a desired direction b : to go through (a =
district) driving game animals.=20

As you see the definition does not say birds. Now I would ask anyone to =
perform the following experiment. Drop two hunters off randomly on the =
perimeter of a quarter section of land. Drive your vehicle slowly, not =
more than 10 mph, toward a flock of birds in the middle of the field and =
see if there is any predictability where those birds will fly, much less =
come within shooting range of a hunter. I believe any attempt to flush =
birds consistently to a desired location at that distance will prove =
futile.=20

Now for the statement that the judge made that we have to have these =
laws and penalty=92s to protect our resource. These birds were white =
geese, which are rapidly becoming a nuisance bird. These birds are =
ruining their arctic breeding grounds, as vast areas are becoming barren =
as these birds pull the vegetation roots out of the fragile tundra. They =
also do considerable damage to the farmer=92s crops near Humboldt as a =
flock of thousands of these geese can ruin a field in one day. The local =
farmers urge hunters to shoot as many as possible because of all the =
damage they do. The providence of Saskatchewan has also a very liberal =
bag limit of 20 a day and a possession limit of 60. Many states in the =
USA have no possession limit and urge the shooting of as many as =
possible of these birds with nearly any means possible. I really do not =
think the argument of protecting this resource is very valid.

As far as pleading guilty or innocent to the charges, I would ask any =
rational human being to explore the options. The judge imposes a fine of =
$200 lowering the suggested fine of the conservation warden by $50. The =
conservation warden reminds the judge of some recently imposed surcharge =
of $30 and tells him to change the fine to $230. The options are either =
plead guilty and pay the $230 or plead not guilty and return the 1000 =
plus miles at a later date for a trial while $700 gun is confiscated =
until the trial.

Local residents informed me that it is a common practice for =
conservation wardens to target USA residents to increase their tax =
coffers. While in Saskatchewan I was listening to a local radio station =
and they were discussing the brain drain of Saskatchewan residents to =
the USA with the main reason being taxes and bureaucracy. The new gun =
registration law is just another example of a law, which will only keep =
bureaucrats employed and do little to curb crime. Part of the new law =
will imposes a $50 tax on all guns brought across the border by USA =
citizens. I believe there is also about a $60 fee for all Canada =
citizens to register their guns. I can just envision the activity of the =
kangaroo courts to comply with this.

I have made my decision that I will not come to Canada again for hunting =
or fishing because of their excessive tax and being targeted.

The final straw was recent treatment I received and the recent tax on =
guns. This along with their excessive tax on liquor, beer, cigarettes, =
gas, gst, provincial tax, etc. will deter many from this country.

Hopefully this message can be distributed over the world via the =
Internet and hopefully change can be made before it is too late. The =
actions of over zealous conservation officers need to be curtailed, a =
proper system of justice needs to be put in place, and the gun =
registration system needs to be abandoned. Only with adverse economic =
impact of tourists not coming and Canada citizens getting fed up with =
their government will this happen.

Anyone receiving this message electronically or in paper form is urged =
to distribute it to as many as possible.
