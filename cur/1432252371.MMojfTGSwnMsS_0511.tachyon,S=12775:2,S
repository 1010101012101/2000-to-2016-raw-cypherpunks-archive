As we all know, 'freedom' is a value-neutral term when 
used on it's own, without a suitable modifier, as in
the above.

I imagine that most people, in the fuzzy space of
colloquial conceptions, associate 'privacy' with the
information security of their own lives, and associate
`secrecy' with the concealment of corporate or government
information, processes, and assets.  But we may use the
terms interchangeably if it makes you happy.  

To wit: I have secrets which I would like to keep 
from malicious criminals and other government workers.

[skimmed]

Given the information-centric disparity that already
exists between individuals of varying allegiance or
association, how is it possible to assure that most
everyone is brought up to speed on the current state-
of-the-art in the numerous fields of study and 
technology that relate to intelligence and counter-
intelligence in such a way as to make the playing
field level for all?  As it stands, with the mutability
inherent in the acquisition and interpretation of 
signals and surveillance data, it is too easy for 
large masses of people to acquire widespread mis-
conceptions about the veracity of the information
at their disposal.  Put another way: hypothetical 
well-organised dis-information sophisticates could
in theory arrange to give the masses a false 
sense of security and inclusiveness within a subtly
fraudulent framework of public-mediated surveillance
and information sharing.  Perhaps this could be 
arranged by building backdoors and covert access
points in the public surveillance network which 
would allow the 'cabal' to diguise their activities
while also permitting them to arbitrarily muck
about with the publically availble data, subject only
to constraints imposed by the actual state-of-the-art --
enhanced on a practical level by virtue of limiting
in some ways the technology available to the masses.

If that makes sense to you, then it should become 
obvious that certifying the `public surveillance 
network' free compromise by privilaged elites of
any kind becomes a very difficult task.  And as we
all know, groups like the NSA and their foreign 
counterparts already enjoy an indeterminate lead
on the public in areas of interest and relation to
information technology and surveillance.  So, how do
we as average citizens mitigate the threat of being
lulled into a false sense of security by the flashy
newness of some kind of hypothetical BrinWorld 
public surveillance and sharing network?

Clearly this is a large problem, and I certainly don't
have the answer.  But, I think the idea of BrinWorld is 
the correct approach, and obviously some very intelligent
people think so too.  I would refer to the paper entitiled
"The Weapon of Openness", by Arthur Kantrowitz, which
approaches this issue from a more general perspective.   

Most likely, there is a solution that we all can live 
with.  Avoiding the risks will, however, be rather
difficult.  Personally, I wouldn't mind too much living 
in a total surveillance world if I were assured that
everyone else was subject to the same level of scrutiny. 
This is primarily because I don't engage in activities 
which are particularly shameful or which are dependent
upon the immoral or wanton explotation and subversion 
of another person's right to pursue interests that
do not harm others.  I am fully aware that a great
many people do engage in such activities, some of 
which are cultural rites or religious rituals that
are validated by the tacit legitimacy given to them
by a tyrranical majority.  And then there are people 
who live off the avails of crime because they find 
that such activities are `manly', stimulating, or 
otherwise pleasureable in some way.

I'm not sure that this is the _only_ way, but it is 
surely the way that looks as though it will acend
to the fore in the near term.

So goes the psychological theory of the moment.  I'm not
so sure that the mechanism is quite so simple as to lend
itself to a reduction that makes it no different to
chemical addiction.

Mmm-hmmm.

Well, yes.  But we also need to do quite a bit of
work to design the *secure* systems, networks, and
code to make it all happen as it should.
