Ja, I know the correct spelling is "untermenschen."

After naming my Siamese cat "Nietzsche," I finally learned not to 
make any spelling errors in that oft-misspelled name. I even usually 
pronounce the name as it should be pronounced, not the usual American 
form.

(Though one source says the name was originally Polish and so the 
"nee-chee" variant is almost acceptable.)
