      There's a number of router manufacturers that do a lot more than use PC
hardware. This one beats the Cisco 7500:

    I'm sure the hardware to deal with oc12s will be soon forthcoming, if it
isn't already available. Besides which, if you and I run a vpn between our
routers, do we really care if it goes thru a feeb checkpoint? Remailer
software could be modified to tunnel between themselves, not just encrypt,
etc.
    Of couse, the whole concept of what they're talking about is impossible
to implement. Easy to order, but I can't see how it would ever work in
reality, not well enough to keep the net actually functioning.
