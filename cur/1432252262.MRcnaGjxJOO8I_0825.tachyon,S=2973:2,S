UK riots: David Cameron announces his prescription

August 11, 2011 11:50 am by Jim Pickard
 

David Cameron is making his statement now. His main promises:

* Police: Increased police presence will remain until the weekend

* Army: The army will not be used to tackle rioters. But soldiers could be
brought in to help the police with everyday jobs, freeing up police for
bfrontlineb duties

* Face masks: At present people can only be asked to remove masks in certain
areas and for a limited time. That will change so police can ask people to
remove masks bwhere there is reasonable suspicion that they are related to
criminal activityb.

* Communication networks: They will be closed down (presumably on a localised
basis) where there are suspicions that they are being used to faciliate
criminal activity.

* Curfew: Government will look at existing powers and whether a power of
curfew should be used

* Insurance: SMEs affected will not have to file insurance claims within 14
days but can now take up to 42 days

* High street fund: A B#20m fund will be set up to help high streets affected

* B#10m recovery scheme: This money will go towards councils to help clean up
streets and improve safety

* Shutters: Planning laws to be changed so shops can more easily introduce
protective shutters

* Gangs: Gang injunctions to be used more frequently for children and adults

* Policing: More lessons will be learned from Boston, USA and Strathclyde,
Scotland
