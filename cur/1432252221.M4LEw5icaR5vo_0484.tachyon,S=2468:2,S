Doesn't this one count?

| According to Chief Superintendent Arye Edelman, head of the Tel Aviv
| fraud squad, which ran the investigation, Haephrati used two methods
| to plant his malicious software (or malware) in the target
| computers. One was to send it via e-mail. The other was to send a disk
| to the target company that purported to contain a business proposal
| from a well-known company that would arouse no suspicions. Then, when
| an employee loaded the disk to view the proposal, the Trojan horse
| would infect his computer.
