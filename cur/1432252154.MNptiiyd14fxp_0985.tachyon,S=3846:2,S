We'd pay good money for Agent Gordon in shiny red underwear...

         Beau Blushing As Scorned Girl Vents Fury on
         Net

         LONDON (Reuters) - A British woman has published photographs of
her
         boyfriend wearing skimpy panties and a bra on the Internet to
avenge his
         cheating ways.

         The 22-year-old, who identified herself only as ``The
Pimptress,'' said
         boyfriend ``Tom'' had asked her never to show the snaps of him
in various
         poses wearing her shiny red underwear.

         ``Guess he shouldn't have cheated with my best m8,'' she wrote,
using for the
         word ``mate'' the abbreviated text message language popular for
         communicating by mobile phone.

         The picture gallery of 20 snaps includes shots of ``Tom''
trying to squeeze on a
         pair of girl's cowboy boots and putting on makeup.

         By early Tuesday the Web site, www.uboot.com/u/pimptress, had
received
         nearly 6,500 hits, or visits by Internet readers. After it was
featured in the
         best-selling daily tabloid The Sun, that number was rising
fast.
