It is only 'reasonable' if you have probably cause. Let's take the example
of the cop standing on the corner with a photograph (obstensibly the same
as computer searches). That photo is of a particular person who has
particular characteristics. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the
person in the photo is a white, blonde, male. The police officer isn't
going to stop blacks, hispanics, women, children, etc.

However, the automated system does exactly this. They are not searching
for a 'particular person' as required by the 4th, they are searching
everyone for instances in the police records. Clearly non-conformal to the
wording of the 4th.
