Was there a digsig behind M.Vr's posts? If there was, has it been 
revoked? If not, take it as it is. If it has been revoked, forget about 
the post. If there's no digsig but used to be, forget.

And so on.

If there was no digsig to begin with, Variola should re-establish his 
credentials using other means, no? Till then, you should probably 
disregard him? No? ;)
