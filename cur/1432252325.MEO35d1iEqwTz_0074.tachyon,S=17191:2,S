Yes, there is finally coverage of the physical architecture of
spying not just the "digital-architecture" of slides, texts
and hyperbole.

Duncan Campbell has reported on this physical architecture
of hardware and facilities for decades and has advised
several of the journalists covering the NSA releases who
lack his experience and technical knowledge. Jacob
Appelbaum confirms, others have not yet done so, and may
be incapable of admitting limited knowledge after building
careers of knowledgeability, yes, this is about cryptology
and anonymity.

PKC and anonymizers have become a celebrity drugs.

Moreover, the valorization of comsec coding over the
physical architecture has misled both the coders and
their public about the weaknesses of comsec, a gaping
hole through which national spies have driven large
trucks to gather and transport mountains of data while
the cyber-guards gaze at online security programs,
engoring large fees for 24x7 protection, search and
destroy, Stuxnet, virii, hacks, 0-days, terrifying
kaboodle.

Keep in mind this which has received almost no
attention now or in the past:

What is online and on the roof of embassies is not
the source of most spying, that is a ruse.

Every building has a unique identification (UID) based
on its comprehensive materiality of building materials,
mechanical and electrical systems, shape, spaces,
usage, population, devices used by inhabitants (coming
and going and resting), rate of deterioration, repairs,
renovations. This in addition to official records in
a slew of regulating agencies, contracts for services,
networks, bugs, taps, implants, human spies, automation,
fautly security systems.

In effect, every building is a transceiver of its metadata
and its contents without need for the ruse of local
penetration. Just an ocean-going vessel, aircraft or
satellite. Virtually nothing is being done to prevent
this self-disclosing transceiving. Tempest protection
is insignificant, and SCIFs are ridiculous.

It is not clear if Snowden knows this or has been deluded
by the blinding conceit of cyber war and as a consequence
does not know what comsec delusion he is sincerely
promulgating to the great pleasure of those who know
exactly how to help him succeed by protesting vigorously.

Back to why Merkel, Obama and other leaders are dancing
in a global delusion of what they do not know, pretending
outrage so superficial it suggests they really can't believe
they are stooges. As do we.

Amir Rappaport | 29/10/2013 8:38<br>
What's behind the &quot; boxes &quot; uniformity mirror placed on the
roofs of the U.S. embassies in major cities around the world and building
additions seem &quot; natural .&quot; It seems to be hiding the most
sophisticated listening facilities .<br>
<br>
Researcher Ronen Solomon discovered the testing facilities identical
pictures of the roofs of the U.S. embassies in Beijing , Dubai, Berlin ,
Moscow , Madrid and Tel Aviv. , After comprehensive research published in
the German weekly &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; , following revelations about
the eavesdropping carried out by the Americans to the top German
leadership . according to &quot; citrus Spiegel &quot; , on the roof of
the embassy in Berlin built blocks that appear as part of the structure ,
but in fact it is made =E2=80=8B=E2=80=8Bof the facilities 'soft' gray or wh=
ite.
material that does not block the absorption from the listening facilities
are behind him.<br><br>
U.S. listening devices '' on the roofs of embassies in the world<br><br>
After the discovery Der Spiegel &quot; revealed for the first time ,
based on the findings of Solomon , that identical facilities on the roofs
of embassies are many other cities , including Tel Aviv. In all cases it
seemed as if it were part of the building , but we notice that
H&quot;kobiot &quot; are , in fact, building additions . If the findings
of the &quot; Citrus Spiegel &quot; right , the savers of listening to
the American intelligence agency scattered throughout the world.<br><br>
Tel Aviv is no exception : in addition L&quot;kobiot &quot; is also found
on the roof of the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv , like other major cities ,
Tel Aviv there are other antennas that are hidden , probably because it's
not an intelligence listening equipment .<br><br>
Israeli security officials say they are not surprised by exposing
eavesdropping in Germany and that they are aware of the American
listening mechanism being not only from the roofs of embassies , but also
through satellite listening equipment and other means . The assumption in
Israel is the U.S. listening to all the conversations that take place in
the Middle East as well as Europe , especially if they are not encrypted
.<br><br>
U.S. wiretapping saga continues world countries , and today the U.S.
ambassador was invited to Spain to talk with accusations that the U.S.
had listened to more than 60 million phone calls to Spain during the
month. Ambassador called to talk to the Spanish Minister for European
Affairs , Inigo Mendez de Vigo , and the meeting between the two lasted
40 minutes . Madrid at the end of the conversation released a message
saying : &quot; Spain to the United States emphasized the importance of
maintaining a climate of confidence in bilateral relations , and the
importance of awareness extent of the actions , if it turns out that they
actually took place , are unacceptable between countries that partnership
and friendship .&quot;<br><br>
As in the case of Germany and France , published information originally
one of the local newspapers , &quot; El Mundo &quot; , and its origin is
a document provided to the leak , a U.S. National Security Agency ,
former Edward Snowden .<br>
