Royalties? Not even an up-front fee. Nothing.

(Not that I care about such things...)

The editor, Jim Frenkel, told me several years ago that the piece had 
to be done over my Xmas vacation. I told him I could maybe get it 
done by January 10th or so. He reluctantly agreed.

Three or four years later, the book is still not out. As the nerds 
like to say, "Grumble."

So, if my article appears curiously dated, look to this several-year delay.
