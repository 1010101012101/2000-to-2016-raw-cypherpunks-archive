it's hard to sheild income, hence the advice to inflate expenses when
fudging taxes rather than trying to hide incoming funds.

these guys were making too much money to stay covert for long, so i
don't think tor or encryption of comms or data would have helped.  it
might have delayed the inevitable a bit, but that's all.

"Authorities said that to hide profits from his scheme, which ran from
November 2004 to May 2006, Pena bought real estate, three luxury
vehicles and a 40-foot motorboat."
  -- that's not a good way to hide funds :)
