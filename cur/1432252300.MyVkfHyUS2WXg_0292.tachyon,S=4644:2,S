Well (jamesd's "because they can" comment not withstanding) the stated
reason  for uncoupling money from precious metal was to allow the government
greater flexibility in controlling the supply of money. Supposedly they
could increase the amount of money available when times were bad (to make
things better) or decrease it during good times (to prevent inflation). Of
course it also allowed them (the government) to buy things without raising
taxes (just print more money), but they got burned when it led to inflation
in the 70's.

Check out Menard Keynes (sp?). Although I'm pretty sure most  people on this
list consider his ideas blasphemy :) .

There are still a lot people that believe the U.S. should return to the
"Gold Standard" meaning the amount of money in circulation should equal  the
amount of gold held by the U.S. government. That's what Fort Knox was
originally for.

Seesh 3:00 AM better get to bed.
