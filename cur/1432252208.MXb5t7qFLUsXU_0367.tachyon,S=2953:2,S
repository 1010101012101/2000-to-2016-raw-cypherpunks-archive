Send them Dr Kopsch relief, instead.

(Kopsch was one of the inventors of the teflon-coated, bullet-proof
vest-defeating bullet.)

Several of our elected wonders (eg, Maryland Gov Glendening, or Tejada
et al in Rhode Island) are pushing for laws restricting the purchase,
ownership, or use of bullet-proof vests without a permit. These
proposals generally have exemptions for LEOs, judges, and, of course,
elected officials.
