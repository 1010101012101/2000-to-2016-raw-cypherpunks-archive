Here's a potentially disruptive technology for global communication
that bypasses the fiber infrastructure, and hence more difficult
to tap and almost impossible to disrupt by other means than
total orbit denial weapons.

NASA prepares to launch 600Mbps space laser system to replace conventional =
radio links

By Sebastian Anthony on August 29, 2013 at 10:05 am19 Comments

NASA is preparing to launch the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (L=
LCD), a testbed that will use lasers to send and receive data between Earth=
 and the Moon. This will be the first time that NASA uses lasers instead of=
 conventional S-band radio waves to communicate with spacecraft, allowing f=
or massive data rates of up to 600 megabits per second, while also consumin=
g much less power and requiring much smaller antennae. Ultimately, shifting=
 to laser-based communications will allow NASA to receive much more data fr=
om spacecraft, allowing them to be outfitted with high-res cameras and othe=
r modern sensors that generate more data than S-band links can support.

Optical communications, as opposed to radio frequency (RF) communications (=
or simply =E2=80=9Cradio=E2=80=9D), are desirable for three key reasons: Ma=
ssive bandwidth, higher security, and lower output power requirements. All =
of these traits derive from the frequency of optical and radio waves. While=
 S-band signals are in the 2-4GHz range (similar to your GSM, LTE, or WiFi =
link), the laser light used by the LLCD (near-infrared in this case) is mea=
sured in hundreds of terahertz. As a result, the wavelength of S-band signa=
ls is around 10cm, while near-infrared has a wavelength of just 1000nm =E2=
=80=94 or about 100,000 times shorter. Not only can you cram a lot more dat=
a into into the same physical space, but there=E2=80=99s also terahertz (co=
mpared to megahertz in the S band) of free, unlicensed space that can be us=
ed.

A diagram of the LLCD architecture

Because the wavelength is smaller, the sending and receiving antennae can a=
lso be a lot smaller, allowing for smaller/lighter spacecraft and much easi=
er reception here on Earth. By the time a conventional RF signal arrives at=
 Earth from outer space, the beam can cover an area as wide as 100 miles, r=
equiring very large dish antennae (such as the Deep Space Network) to pick =
those signals up. Receiving laser signals, which are 100,000 times shorter,=
 requires a much smaller dish. As a corollary, due to these beams being muc=
h tighter, they=E2=80=99re much harder for an enemy to snoop on, thus incre=
asing security. Transmitting data via laser also requires less power than R=
F.

NASA's LLCD laser link diagram

The LLCD will be deployed upon the Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explor=
er (LADEE), which is scheduled for launch in September. LADEE (which could =
be pronounced lay-dee or lad-ee, we=E2=80=99re not sure) will orbit the Moo=
n, seeking to confirm whether the mysterious glow observed by Apollo astron=
auts was caused by dust in the lunar atmosphere. Thanks to the LLCD, NASA w=
ill have a 20Mbps uplink to LADEE (apparently 4,800 times faster than exist=
ing S-band uplinks), and LADEE will have a 600Mbps downlink to NASA (five t=
imes faster than current state-of-the-art lunar-distance links). The missio=
n will only last for 30 days, after which, if it=E2=80=99s a success, NASA =
will launch the long-duration Lunar Communications Relay Demonstration (LCR=
D), which will hitch a ride aboard a commercial Loral satellite. The LCRD w=
ill allow NASA to perform further testing of space laser communications, wi=
th the hope of eventually replacing RF links in future spacecraft.

Moving forward, space laser communications will allow for the creation of s=
pacecraft that are smaller, cheaper, and capable of more advanced functiona=
lity. With 600Mbps of downlink capacity, we=E2=80=99ll be able to outfit sp=
acecraft with high-resolution cameras and other advanced sensors that gener=
ate vast amounts of data =E2=80=94 and view that data in real time, rather =
than waiting for the data to slowly dribble over the airwaves.
