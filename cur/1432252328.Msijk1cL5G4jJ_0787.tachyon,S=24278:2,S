Abstract

For various reasons, most prominently privacy considerations, consumers on
the Internet become reluctant to reveal their true identity. Different
techniques and services have recently been developed which make Internet
activities, such as surfing, anonymous. Facilities are also available to
provide individuals with a pseudo-identity. This article explores the
status of anonymous electronic transactions under the Dutch private law
system and analyses whether new legal rules are required to protect
consumer interests.

Keywords: Anonymity, Semi-anonymity, Pseudo Identity, Private Law, Privacy,
Smartcards, International Regulation, Intermediary, Self-regulation,
Legislation, Consumer Protection.

1. Introduction

Lately, anonymous communications on the Internet have gained considerable
attention. A New Jersey state court judge ruled in November 2000 that a
software company is not entitled to learn the identities of two 'John Doe'
defendants who anonymously posted critical comments on a Yahoo message
board[ 3]. Fall 2000, Ian Avrum Goldberg's dissertation on A Pseudonymous
Communications Infrastructure for the Internet received world-wide
publicity[ 4].Ongoing concerns of digital privacy stimulate the debates
about possible ways to avoid being 'profiled' on the Net and communicate
anonymously.

Anonymous communication raises various (legal) questions. What exactly do
we mean by anonymity? Why would people want to communicate and transact on
an anonymous basis? What are the practical and legal restraints upon
anonymity when communicating and transacting with others? In other words:
aside from the ad-hoc problems that now arise under case law, what is the
larger landscape of the legal consequences of anonymity? This article sets
out the most important conclusions of the first stage of a study into the
dimensions of digital anonymity. It is intended to set out the problem,
make people aware of the intricacies of the problem and thus stimulate the
debate on useful legal structures for anonymity. The article focuses on the
private law dimensions, addressing situations where consumers want to
purchase anonymously on the Internet.

With the purpose of directing the key question towards future developments
in information technology, the study is based on a picture of the future in
which the large scale use of anonymous electronic transactions occupies an
important position. We hereby take the chip card as an illustrative example
and focus on the Dutch legal situation. Finally, it should be mentioned
that this study forms part of a broader search for sustainable legal and
organisational transformation processes arising from new information and
communication technology[ 5].

The article is laid out as follows. Section 2 provides an outline of the
key question into new law for digital anonymity and some background
information. Anonymity is a concept that is subject to multiple
interpretations, an issue that is discussed in section 3. The key question
is only worth addressing if absolutely anonymous electronic legal
transactions are technically feasible, and we can put forward a plausible
case supporting the practical significance of anonymity in electronic legal
transactions. We will set forth that case in section 4. Section 5 outlines
the status of an absolutely anonymous contract under private law, contract
law and property law. This provides an idea of the room that current
private law offers for anonymous legal transactions, which is a good
starting point for answering the question of whether these provisions will
be adequate when it comes to the widespread anonymous use of chip cards. In
section 6 we look into the legal status of less absolute forms of anonymity
in legal transactions (semi-anonymity). To answer the question concerning
the desired legal development, in section 7 we address the role that the
law will have to play if a situation arises in which anonymous electronic
legal transactions dislocate vulnerable legal relationships. We will then
examine two alternatives for the development of new law: based on our own
Dutch law or derived from foreign law. These considerations lead in section
8 to conclusions regarding the extent to which the risks of anonymous
electronic legal transactions will in the future necessitate the
introduction of new legal rules.

Given that legal development takes so much more time than the introduction
and distribution of new technology, it is of great importance to gain early
insight into the direction in which the law can best develop in response to
new technology. That is the underlying motive behind this part of the
overall study and the justification for directly reporting on the first
preliminary results, in the hope that this will set in motion a discussion
that offers prospects for timely legislation should the need arise.

8. Conclusion

In this paragraph we formulate our preliminary response to the question of
the extent to which the risks of anonymous electronic legal transactions
will in the future necessitate new private law structures, what these
structures will probably relate to and the direction in which this
development of law could occur.

Our legal culture places prevention above a distribution of incurred
losses, so that we anticipate that digital anonymity will be regulated as
much as possible rather than compensated for in insurance constructions. In
the case of absolutely anonymous and semi-anonymous contracts we have noted
that the space for these legal transactions is limited (contract law), or
is completely absent (property law). In a nutshell, it can be said that
knowledge of a person's identity is not a legal requirement under contract
law. Parties that knowingly take the risk of entering into a contract with
an absolutely anonymous or semi-anonymous party bear the risk of the
adverse consequences of a shortcoming. If the identity of the other party
cannot be determined, the party in question will face the same situation as
he would in the physical world: he will receive neither what the other
party was obliged to provide, nor any compensation for damages. A
consequence of this nature is acceptable and its implications are kept
within reasonable limits if people only act semi-anonymously to a modest
extent. The question remains, however, of whether this will be the case if
widespread use is made of the possibility to surf, order and pay absolutely
anonymously or spontaneously semi-anonymously in an electronic environment.
We feel that widespread anonymous actions are accompanied by so many new
risks to the various parties involved that this will lead to imbalances in
the legal relationships, which will give the legislator cause to seek
solutions to protect vulnerable parties and interests. Cases in point
include suppliers demanding full payment in advance in an electronic
contract entered into at a distance, stringent exoneration clauses and
unfavourable proof stipulations.

With regard to the content of the possible new legal structures, it is
likely that in our Dutch legal culture we will first be induced to search
for ways of extending existing formal regulations that limit the possible
use of absolute anonymity. In order to respond to a growing need for
anonymity in legal transactions, the regulations for organised
semi-anonymity could also be extended (e.g. under property law), so that it
will be possible to break through a person's anonymity retrospectively if
necessitated by court order or by the law. Organised semi-anonymity (or
pseudonymity) in legal transactions is therefore a useful weapon against a
number of disadvantages of acting absolutely anonymously or spontaneously
semi-anonymously, while retaining the envisaged protection of privacy. It
is only with the guarantee of this organised protection of a person's true
identity without that being abused, that identity fraud can be kept under
control and that pseudonyms can provide anonymity towards third parties
without damaging the legal order. That is not to say that this form of
anonymous legal transaction is easy to organise[ 25 ]. Beyond private law,
it will require extra regulations under administrative law, such as an
extension of the obligation of public and private bodies to check their
clients' identity, of the duty of people to provide proof of identity and
public-private co-operation in verifying people's identities and in testing
the soundness of general and contractual proofs of identity. Apart from
political and social issues that will have to be solved in an international
context, bringing about the information infrastructure needed for this
purpose will also take a lot of time and money. But balancing the interests
of protecting privacy and the need for anonymity in the future information
society on the one hand, and those of the legal order on the other, makes
extending organised semi-anonymity in our legal culture an attractive
course to take for vulnerable transactions.

Because both of the above solution directions under Dutch law will
reinforce already existing tendencies towards 'juridification' of our
society without internationally achieving the envisaged legal protection
under Dutch law, we feel that it is desirable to look into how more space
can be created for reliable legal transactions on an absolutely anonymous
basis, perhaps under our property law as well. This relates in the first
place to absolutely anonymous transactions that are of less social
importance and whose disadvantages can easily be insured. It also concerns
socially important, vulnerable transactions that already tend to be settled
on an absolutely anonymous basis world-wide. By way of making a first move
in that direction, we feel that it seems in any event desirable to look
into the extent to which already existing foreign legal structures such as
the agency are suitable for this purpose, and whether this could be
incorporated into legal systems that are not familiar with these
structures, such as the Dutch legal system.

At issue here are the trust in anonymous electronic transactions, consumer
protection, combating identity fraud and, let us not forget: the issue of
legal certainty when border-transgressing anonymous transactions are
involved. Given that the development of law takes so much more time than
the introduction and distribution of new technology, it is of great
importance to gain early insight into the direction in which Dutch law can
best develop in response to more digital anonymity. The importance of new
concepts and rules for digital anonymity in legal transactions makes it
desirable to discuss and perform research into the directions proposed
here, paying attention to the effect that derivation from foreign law has
on the key principles of private law systems that are not familiar with
such directions.

11 . A biometric number is a number that is derived using a formula from a
physical characteristic (e.g. a fingerprint, the geometry of a finger or
hand, or the characteristic movements when signing a document). A biometric
number yields a person- related pseudonym. All sorts of other numbers and
codes used to verify a person's identity are not person-related. Someone
can give a PIN number to somebody else, for example; the electronic
signature (code for encrypting data) is computer-related and can be used by
another user of that computer. See: van Kralingen R, Prins, J E J and

12 . Verification is generally not sufficient for the application of
criminal law. The police are therefore expected to irrevocably establish
the identity of a suspect when investigating a criminal offence. If errors
are made at this stage, the legal intervention will go wrong further on in
the criminal law enforcement chain. After all, it will generally not be
possible to rectify a faulty identification retrospectively by means of
verification because, for instance, the suspect can no longer be located or
because the available data are contradictory. If the police have made a
successful identification at the beginning of the criminal law enforcement
chain, other partners in this chain will be able to make do with
verifications further on in the legal proceedings.

own name. In practice, the identity of a subscriber is seldom verified, and
in the Netherlands an ISP is not authorised to ask for proof of identity
other than on a voluntary basis. Neither is he legally or practically able
to verify the soundness and validity of a proof of identity because of the
lack of authority and information infrastructure.
