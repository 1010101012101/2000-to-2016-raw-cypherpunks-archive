Hi
I`ve found cool site, It is a lot of programs in all european languages - english, France, Italy, Spanish, German.
and all of them cost very cheaply!
It's a url http://softewu.com
Also they have soft for MACINTOSH.
And you can download them right after purhases! You will no need wait 2-3 week for CD delivery.
