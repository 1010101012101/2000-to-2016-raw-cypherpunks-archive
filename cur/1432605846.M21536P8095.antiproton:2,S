I don't think there's a huge battery life hit...

With the exception of a few of us on this list and elsewhere, the majority
sentiment is:
Nobody cares about FDE.
Nobody wants to use a strong password that they have to type during boot
and during login and whenever the screensaver comes on.
Nobody wants to wait for the disk to be overwritten with random bytes
during install time.
Nobody wants to deal with the additional complexity at re-install or
recovery time. [Although, recovering a file vault partition with Apple's
'internet recovery' is a real treat. Kudos Apple - is that .iso signed?]
Nobody wants to deal with having to remember the complex, strong password.

Basically, the majority of people would be fairly upset at being subjected
to the limitations of FDE as it is, maybe they can mostly be designed /
implemented away, but that's point number one - nobody cares.

-Travis
