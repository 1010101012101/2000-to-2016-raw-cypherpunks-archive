	Nominally being the key word.

	Nothing I can point to, mostly vague rememberings of stuff I'd read. 

	I may be wrong about the G8--I may have it a little confused with the WTO. It's all part of the same bullshit in my mind.

	I'm not arguing that.

	Well, given that the fascists we have in charge now are *relatively* rational and reading from pretty much the same playbook (meaning the are fairly well organized relatively speaking), you are probably right. With the protestors in charge we'd wind up in a war.

	I did time in Art School. It's more like 99%.

	It's not my beef, personally I'm a big fan of gravity. And friction. 

	It keeps my motorcycle (mostly) on the ground, and friction keeps me from sliding into cars as often. 

	Besides, without gravity wheelies wouldn't be nearly as much fun.
