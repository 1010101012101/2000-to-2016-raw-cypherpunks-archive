I have now seen a worm for the OpenSSL problems I reported a few weeks 
back in the wild. Anyone who has not patched/upgraded to 0.9.6e+ should 
be _seriously worried_.

It appears to be exclusively targeted at Linux systems, but I wouldn't 
count on variants for other systems not existing.

Cheers,

Ben.
