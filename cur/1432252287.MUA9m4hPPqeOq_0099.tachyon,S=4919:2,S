NSI "lost" my registration for "MIFCO.COM" approximately three months into
it's life.  Not to worry that it went to waste though: another company
appeared with it the next day. After three months of back and forth -
reciepts, cajoling, and threats - I finally gave up.  NSI not only refused
to ack that the domain had ever been registered, they refused to issue a
refund as well, even though I had the cancelled chack to prove it.

Mysteriously, I recieved a refund check on MIFCO about two months ago,
totally unannouced and unexpectedly - more than two and a half years after
I gave up totally.

Keep an eye on your mail, I have no doubt that they will refund your money
- someday...

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
