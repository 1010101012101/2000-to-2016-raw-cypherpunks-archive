1.  "make them work for it" (Duncan)

2.  You can't prevent them from getting it

3.  sell it to them just the same as any other customer

4.  sell it to those who can afford it

5.  actively pursue them as customers

6.  as cooperative sellers, fill out their mandatory forms, tell them your
race and gender, and patiently wait longer than usual to get payment

7.  maintain a pro-active business relationship with them as a large-volume
provider of product and updates for many of their departments and world-wide
locations

8.  agree to their limits on production and distribution

9.  negotiate on backdoors and modifications

10. Happy Cpunk Fun Court is Not Amused


You have to know where you can exert influence over quality, and where you
want to draw the line against acquiescensce, in order to maintain
consistency with your purported philosophy.

The prospect for the future is, that either everyone must be made equally
weak, or everyone must be allowed to become equally strong.  If progress and
virtue is in better tools, then eliminating their availability is not an
option (although creating tools cannot be enforced, as it requires an
intellect and creativity which it is not yet possible to coerce into
existence).

But providing advanced and useful tools ("giving them the fire") seems to
call for a control of consequences which is beyond the humanly possible:
they may just end up burning themselves up with it.

Why did we, everybody, get bestowed with brains - such potential for power,
yet so little wisdom to use it; a little knowledge is such a dangerous
thing.
