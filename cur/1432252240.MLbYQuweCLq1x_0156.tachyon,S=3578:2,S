The New York anthrax death occurred about 30 miles west
of Plum Island, in The Bronx, which is located at the western
end of Long Island Sound. The Oxford, CT death is about
10 miles northwest of Plum Island, near the Long Island
Sound coast.

No other federal laboratory dealing with hazardous virii
is as close to these death locations as PIADC. Virii are
regularly shipped into and out of the Center; the Center 
boasts of how carefully the dangerous transport is monitored. 

Photos at the Center's Web site show an African-American 
deliveryman carrying bio-hazard packages. Most of the other 
personnel in the Center's photos are pinkish, but that could 
be a coincidence.  Wonder where that deliveryman lives,
Harlem, The Bronx? In a shack among millionaires in the 
Hamptons? Does he have grievances? Would he be an 
admirer of Malcolm X?

Who is LB&B, operator of Plum Island? All the gov personnel
were assigned to the firm when the operation was privatized.
The firm is doing $B business with federal agencies from DoD 
to NASA to gov contractors all around the nation. Must have 
lots of high-tech immigrants working for justice and fair play.
And maybe some former gov employees not altogether happy
with the new bosses financial affairs.

Couldn't find a Web site for LB&B on Google, but dozens of 
citations for work with others as "small business" partners.

Wonder if the firm does work for the Postal Service?
