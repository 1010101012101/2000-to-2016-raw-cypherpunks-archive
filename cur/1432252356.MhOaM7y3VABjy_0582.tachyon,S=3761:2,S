uh-huh. I thank you for you valiant attempt at entrapment.

It's far more fun and confuses the crap out of paranoid people to have
no secrets, and no paranoia.

There are good people who work for these agencies that will discover 
I have nothing to hide. And I'm counting on the dark-cockroach power
battles to strategically leak information harmful to their dark-roach
opponents, much like I'm sure some roach leaked information to Senator 
Feinstein to try to build their own budget.

Or was it the Mossad, or German intelligence that decided to hang 
the CIA in their own noose?
