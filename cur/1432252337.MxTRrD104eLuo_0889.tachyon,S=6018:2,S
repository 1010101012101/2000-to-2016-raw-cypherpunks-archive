Dude, politics has been with us at least since social primates.
Politics is not just played for money, power is another major
currency.

We can't. Unless you broke out of Plato's cave you have to stick
with models. Economics is a model, too.

Dude, I'm not interested in arguing religion with you.

You don't have to preach to the choir, you know.

No. You're still model-tarded. Economy is a special case of ecology.
People are not money-driven, they're prestige-driven.

Actually, I'm not the obsessive-compulsive one talking about
markets, so I resent such projections.

Thanks for lightening up my working day with some free entertainment.

So if I protest for my privacy, who am I stealing it from?

So if they send you to Guantanamo because you won't cough up your keys
how is cryptography going to protect you from being sodomized by a
broomhandle
by sadistic guards?

Cryptography solves jack if it's not being used. I'm not surprised
that I have to explain that to you.

I see them organizing public protests. I also see them writing code.
I see you trying to shut up people by your "cpunks write code" mantra.

> Hell, *you* proport to be a crypto person. You proport to write code. You

Nope, I'm not a cypherpunk. Never claimed to be one. I'm just tracking
political and technology news and running servers with code that
cypherpunks wrote.

> have a problem with the NSA, write code, problem solved.

I write code nobody uses (too afraid, too ignorant), problem not solved.
