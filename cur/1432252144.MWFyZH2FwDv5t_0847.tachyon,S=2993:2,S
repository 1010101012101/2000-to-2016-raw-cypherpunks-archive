But then the ballot is spoiled, and not counted.

In Canada we have the option to "decline to vote".  Go to the polling station, register 
your name, take the ballot, then tell the clerk that you "decline to vote".  This 
indicates that you believe that no-one on the ballot is a suitable candidate for 
office.  The ballot is counted, but none of the candidates gets a vote.  

This ensures that you don't accidentally elect an unsuitable candidate with a protest 
vote, ie. selecting the lesser of two evils.  By declining to vote you elect neither of 
the two evils.

I'm not sure what happens when there are more declined ballots than votes for a 
candidate. Certainly it should draw some media attention to the option of declining to 
vote -- I find that very few people know about it.  It sure caused a stir at our 
polling booth!
