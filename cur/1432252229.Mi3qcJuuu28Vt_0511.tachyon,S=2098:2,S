>>Ras says that once the privacy features are fully utilized by the
end-use then no one in the world can figure out who you are.<<

>>Despite what Ras might say about ES5, there is a large element in the
P2P community that question the claims made by Ras. Some even go as far
as to suggest conspiracy theories about the reason for ES5's existence.
