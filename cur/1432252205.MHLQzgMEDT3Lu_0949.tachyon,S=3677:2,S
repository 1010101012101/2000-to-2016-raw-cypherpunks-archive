You say that as though it hasn't been considered.

It doesn't, actually.  There is no clear and compelling reason to make a
passport remotely readable, considering that a Customs agent still has to
visually review the document.  And if the agent has to look at it, s/he can
certainly run it through a contact-based reader in much the same way the
current design's submerged magnetic strip is read.

This story says the data will be encrypted, but the key will be printed on the
passport itself in a machine-readable format.  Once again, this requires manual
handling of the passport, so there's *still* no advantage to RFID in the
official use case.

Yup. Bruce Schneier nailed the real motivation almost a year ago:

http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/rfid_passports.html

Interestingly, even the on-document keying scheme doesn't address the
fundamental problem. Nowhere is it said that the whole of the remotely readable
data will be encrypted. If a GUID is left in the clear, the passport is readily
usable as a taggant by anyone privy to the GUID->meatspace map.  Without access
to the map, the tag still identifies its carrier as a U.S passport holder. 
Integrating this aspect into munitions is left as an exercise for the reader.

This isn't about phishing. That's just a bonus.
