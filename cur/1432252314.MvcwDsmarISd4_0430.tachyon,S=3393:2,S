I missed that one, but recently tested out the "grape in the microwave" 
experiment, and found it to be quite impressive.

Take a seedless grape, and slice it in half (down what could be considered 
the equator of the grape.)

Leave a centimeter or so of skin connecting the two halves.

Dab off any excess juice with a towel.

Place sliced-side down on a plate.

Put in the microwave and nuke on high for 10-15 seconds. (I tried this in 
my girlfriend's microwave. It appears to still function properly.)
