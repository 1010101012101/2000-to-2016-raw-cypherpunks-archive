I've been running a 1970s-era lava lamp for some time, and found
that it can enter a stable attractor where you get a non-circulating
blob o' wax at the bottom.  While Walker et al.'s (?) LL video entropy
source is cute/clever, the general lesson we can take from this is to be
careful
that physical sources do not fail.  Cooling the lamp and restarting it
seems to have put it back into a quasi-random physical trajectory.
I suppose my visual observation counts as an online entropic monitor
that any physical source apparently should have.

This was driven by a 40 watt bulb and the ambient temperature dropped
when it
stabilized.  Shaking did not restart it; only cooling and then reheating
did.

Now back to your regularly scheduled war crimes.
