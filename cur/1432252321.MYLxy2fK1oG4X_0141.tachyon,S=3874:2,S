Congressional approval for this sort of thing is about like the
proverbial ham sandwich that prosecutors can get grand juries to indict.
It wouldn't be a problem in itself, but Congress can delegate
much of it to the bureaucratic\\\\\\\\\\\executive branch.
Furthermore, while states probably couldn't make the kind of
agreement that would give one state Constititional standing
to sue the other for non-performance of the agreement
without a bit of help from Congress, they can certainly have their
bureaucrats go discuss common standards without getting busted for
anti-trust violations.
