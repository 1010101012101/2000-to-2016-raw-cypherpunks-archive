Absolutely.

Operative word:  excuse.

Or like maybe the NSA needs to steal something that they can't buy because
they "NEED" to conceal the project that requires the stolen item.  Or
maybe a wealthy interest has a commercial interest to protect and bribes
an official to steal land that threatens said interest.  Or maybe it's a
Klan member who thinks that niggers shouldn't own property, and so he
steals it.  Or perhaps it's a Xtian who believes it's God's will to deny
property rights to heathens, as a lesson in coming to God.  Or maybe it's
a bunch of fucking theives who use any excuse they have at hand to justify
their own greed.

Sometimes it's a complete load of shit, and there's no real valid reason
that will stand intelligent scrutiny as to why some people are allowed to
do one thing that is denied to another people.

Personally, I believe that the people who run the US, the dirty ones, are
too well aware of the liabilities they have assumed as a matter of course
in their history, and who will do anything rather than face paying the
debt.  Anything.   And futher, this conclusion is not so foreign as to be
beyond comprehension, but rather represents a problem that no-one is
willing to deal with -- thus compounding the error.


Since you still aren't bothering to address messages I write in good
faith, I suggest that you should go fuck yourself.


Regards,

Steve
