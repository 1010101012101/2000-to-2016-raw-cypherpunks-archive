That might have been. But he was not, and he is shown and "paraded" on 
TV (and don't tell me he wasn't because showing a man in his state, 
showing how he gets examined is clearly an attempt to "break the morale").

Most people outside of the US are blissfully aware of this. After all 
they had bombs dropped on them for the last 50 years, being shot at by 
people that were founded by the US Government (have a look at South 
America) and so forth.

It is almost astonishing to hear arguments like these. You (and people 
who make these arguments) sound like the kid who gets smacked after 
burning down the house and then starting to cry and call foul.

So you advocate to "follow Bin Ladin"? If you (as in the US Government) 
consider him evil, then following him and do the same way he does makes 
you evil as well.

Having said that: What makes you the "good guy"?

Of course Libya is evil when it doesn't fit into the US foreign policy, 
but is a "good friend' when you can send someone there to get "vital 
information". If that involves torture than this is none of your business.

It is sort of ironic that a state like the US can claim no interrest in 
how the information was obtained and cheerfully extorts people to 
countries where they know very clearly that those people will be 
tortured. It seems not even another passport (like say, Canadian) is 
protecting those people from the wrath and zeal of the US Administration 
and their henchman.

If the Henchman happens to wear a turban while doing his deed, it is 
fine, as long as it is done under US Supervision, which can be denied if 
need be.

The UN is a meeting chamber. The UN is an ability for countries to meet 
and try to find solutions that do not involve dropping heavy explosives 
on other peoples head.

The UN also fails regularly because heavy weights like the US use it to 
throw their weight around. If there would be a proportional (as in 
number of people living in a country) representation the tables would 
turn very very quickly.

The UN security council should be dropped in it's current form and 
instead should be re-created without any permanent members or any 
countries power to veto the decisions.

It is not the leaders of most countries I am afraid of. It is the 
leaders of a handful of countries which possess the most power and have 
no problem in abusing it to further their own agenda.
