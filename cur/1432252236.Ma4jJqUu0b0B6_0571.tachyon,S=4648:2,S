Their website doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Grindingly slow,
almost contentless, no clues at all as to what they are proposing to
actually do to shut down the sites, which is the hard part. No
implication of automatic shutdown, they just say they will notify
people. So all they are selling is a search engine really. They are just
offering to search the web for files which you claim you own. 

There is some handwaving about timestamps and digital signatures - their
very tedious  Flash presentation implies that they copy, sign  and
timestamp the allegedly offending website and make two CDs of it,
sending one to the ISP and one to their customer.  Also screenshots.  
Dumb.

No hint as to what to do if the "infringer" sues you for copying their
website onto a CD. No hint as to what they do if two of their customers
claim to own the same content. No hint as to what they do if I claim
that I own some files just to sick them onto Disney or Murdoch. (Not
that it is hard to guess - as always with these things, he who dies
employing the most lawyers wins).
