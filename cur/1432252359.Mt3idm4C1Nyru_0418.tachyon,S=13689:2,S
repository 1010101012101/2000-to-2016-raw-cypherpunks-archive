Sixth Day:  Jim Bell Trial

The judge started out by giving the jury a generally boilerplate set of 
instructions.

Then London started his closing statement.  He re-read the counts, and covered 
what the prosecution has to prove.

He said that the government did not have to prove:

1. That the houses that Bell found were the correct houses for the people 
he was seeking.
2. That Bell had found the current home address of Gordon and McNall.
3. That Bell had gotten within a certain physical distance of Gordon and 
McNall.
4. That Bell was armed or actually dangerous.
5. That Bell intended to harm or had the physical ability to harm.
6. That the people that Bell checked out had to know that they were being 
pursued before being informed by Gordon.

London spoke of Bell's propensity for records collection, calling it the 
"obsessive" activity of "a grown man of 43 living with his parents."

London read count one again and encouraged the jurors to write down the 
numbers of the exhibits as he mentioned them.  He first listed exhibit 134,
 send 11/4 from Bell's home in Vancouver.  It had to be Bell's home, London 
said, because the email had Bell's IP address on it.

London said that if Bell had problems with surveillance or Ryan Lund, he 
should have filed a law suit, and gone through the "regular process."

London then tied more of the exhibits to the other counts.

London argued that the government didn't have to prove that Bell's only 
purpose was to harass, that the jury only had to find that one of his purposes 
was to harass."  London urged jurors to verify Bell's credibility and "what 
his intent was against his personal history over the last four or five years."

London noted the conflict between the secrecy that Bell wanted in his communications 
with McNall and Gordon and his postings on the internet and efforts to get 
John Branton to publish information about his investigations.

London then talked about the cypherpunks, "whose unifying belief is the 
encryption of email with keys or PGP.

"Why couldn't Bell send agent Gordon or agent McNall an encrypted email 
so that they could communicate and share the code between them?"  (At this 
point, it was clear that London has no idea how PGP works, to say nothing 
of the likelihood that agents McNall and Gordon have published their keys-
if they even have them.)

London brought in exhibits from 1996 that showed that Bell wanted to obtain 
and publish home address of IRS agents.  Bell hadn't changed his ways since 
then, and that "he still intended to harass."  Bell had failed to recant 
AP.

As far as Bell's intention to picket Gordon's house?  "What is the purpose? 
 The office is the appropriate place to picket?.  What is the purpose of 
picketing someone's house?  Harassment.  Purely harassment."

London accused Bell of trying to set up plausible deniability, which he 
defined as always being able to mask true intent, always being able to come 
up with a believable explanation for what one is trying to hide.  He said 
that Bell was not honest about his actions or intent, that he was engaging 
in plausible deniability, that Bell's research was to provide plausible 
deniability for harassment.

London discounted Bell's credibility because he was less cooperative on 
cross-examination than he was in answering questions from his own attorney.

London tagged AP as the basis for all episodes of harassment.  He said that 
AP was really closer than ten or fifteen years, because Bell had claimed 
in 1997 that it was seven to 10 years away.  (This was an interesting play 
on "if you kill the messenger, you kill the idea" theory, an interesting 
attempt since on the internet, everything stays up forever according to 
the prosecution.)

At this point, Bell said, "You're lying."  Tanner asked him if he wished 
to be removed?"  Bell apologized.  Tanner, miffed, said "Forget about apologies! 
 Do you wish to remain?"  Bell responded "I wish to address the jury."  
Tanner said that he didn't ask that, that he asked if Bell wished to stay. 
 Bell meekly said that he wished to stay.

The judge declared a 15 minute break.  As Bell was being escorted by US 
marshalls from the courtroom, he tried to hand a document to McCullagh and 
was prevented by the marshalls from doing so.  Bell protested, "You've allowed 
me to talk to him before, why can't I talk to him now?"

When court reconvened, London tied up his closing statement.  He pointed 
to Bell's mention of PCBs in an email on 10/24/2000, shortly before he took 
actions.  London said that the evidence established Bell's intent not beyond 
a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt.

"Bell did not get the message because it came from people he does not trust-
judges and law enforcement.  Now he needs to hear it from people he does 
trust-12 ordinary citizens."  London asked the jury to convict Bell on all 
five counts.

Leen started his closing statement by calling his client a brilliant man 
with a brilliant mind, a disturbed mind.

He told the jurors that they had to follow Tanner's instruction to follow 
the law as the judge gave it, that the jurors must not be influenced by 
likes or dislikes.  Then he tore into London's last statement:  "If a man 
is scary or poses a future danger, it's not your job to deliver the government's 
message to Mr. Bell."

The jury was only there to decide if the defendant is guilty or not guilty 
only on the charges, and was not on trial for anything else.  Mr. Bell was 
not on trial for common law court membership, for writing Assassination 
Politics, for writing "Operation Locate IRS," visits to Groener or the other 
Gordons.

Certain things, Leen said, are not evidence.  Attorney arguments are not 
evidence.  Jurors decide what to believe based on common sense.

Leen defined circumstantial evidence.  In this case, jurors have to deal 
with circumstantial evidence.

The jury was there to find guilt, "not to find that the defendant is wrong,
 bad, or scary."

Then Leen went through each count, saying that the government had not proved 
Bell's intent.

Leen called his client's mental state into question.  He said that people 
feared someone like Bell "because they think normally? they don't think 
like Mr. Bell thinks."  He asked the jury how they know intent.  "Mr. Bell 
was trying to prove that the cause of the failure of his life was not his 
own but the government's."  Bell's intent was to put the puzzle together 
and prove his case to people who would listen.

Leen said that the government had to prove intent.  Bell's thought processes 
were different than normal, and that the government's use of plausible deniability 
was a bald attempt to get the jury to believe that Bell was lying.  But 
Bell was telling the truth as he knows the truth.

The only decision that the jurors had was "Did Mr. Bell have a certain mental 
intent, and intent to harass?"

Leen said that his client was difficult to interview for defense preparation,
 that Bell claimed that Leen threatened to kill him and his family.

"I don't mock him, I pity him?  Look to the evidence.  Just because it's 
reasonable for Jeff Gordon to be afraid doesn't mean that Bell had an intent?. 
 The government has failed to proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. 
Bell's purpose was to harass, and that purpose was to expose, to prove that 
he was right."

London got the last word in, according to Federal Court rules.  He brought 
up two points:

1. Mr. Leen characterized Bell as having a flawed mind.  This was not London's 
characterization.  He said that Bell knew the difference between right and 
wrong.

2. "Mr. Bell's investigation to the extent that it took him to the doorsteps 
of people that he found was a form of harassment."  Bell committed a crime 
just by entering onto private property.  "Bell had to know that collecting 
addresses of IRS agents was itself harassment."

Tanner then issued his last four instructions:

1. The jury had to decide what testimony to believe.  In doing so, they 
were to consider a) was the witness able to see or hear the evidence that 
they testified to; b) was the witness accurately able to recall the evidence; 
c) what the witness' manner was; d) witness bias or prejudice; e) reasonableness 
of testimony; and f) whether the witness' testimony was contradicted by 
other evidence.

2. The weight of each side's case was not determined by the number of witnesses.

3. The jury cannot consider the punishment when deciding on a verdict.

4. The verdict must be unanimous.

Two jurors were then excused.  They both smiled and looked relieved.

The jury went into the jury room at 1:30.  At 3:30 they passed a note to 
the judge, saying that they wanted a definition of intent, and that they 
wanted a legal dictionary and the legal definition of intent.

Dictionaries aren't allowed in the jury room.  Leen moved that the court 
provide a definition of intent.  London objected, saying that the definition 
was in the instructions as knowledge.  Leen suggested to the judge that 
he define intent as "acting with object and purpose to commit a crime." 
 London:  "Tell them it's in the instructions."  Tanner decided to tell 
the jurors that the definition is in the instructions.

At 4:30 p.m., the jurors passed a note to the judge.  

Bell was brought back to the courtroom, and while waiting, he joked that 
he expected to be acquitted on some counts, that the jury "would split the 
baby down the middle."

The judge re-entered the courtroom at 5 p.m., and read the note.  The jurors 
had voted unanimously for a guilty verdict on counts 2 and 3, and were hung 
11 to 1 on the remaining counts.

Tanner sent the jury back to the jury room.

Tanner brought up that there was a form issue in the note (which becomes 
part of the court record).  Leen said that the note published the count 
of the juror's votes and moved for a mistrial.  Denied.

Tanner asked about the law on partial verdicts.  He decided to call the 
jury back in and poll them on counts two and three and the form of the verdict,
 and have the jury fill out the proper form.

The jury was polled and excused.  None looked happy, and none had looked 
at Bell during either before, during, or after the polling.

Tanner set sentencing for July 6.

Leen moved for dismissal of counts 1, 4 and 5.  London asked Tanner to dismiss 
without prejudice so that the government could refile the counts.  Tanner 
dismissed without prejudice.

Leen moved to dismiss counts 2 and 3 on the basis of jury prejudice.  Denied.

Tanner granted Leen 10 days to file for a new trial.

London said that he wanted the court proceedings copy back from the defense. 
 He moved to have Bell's notebook and other exhibits sealed.

Tanner:  "I don't think I have the authority to do that.  Do I?"  London: 
 "I'm not sure."  Tanner:  "Order [to seal] goes [applies] to jurors, period."
