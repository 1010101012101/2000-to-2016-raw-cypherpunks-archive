Thomas Friedman compares Noam Chomsky to USAma bin Laden.
http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=18278
"...When I asked Friedman during a recent visit to the Kingdom about his 
differences with Chomsky, he replied, "Just as you regard Osama Bin Laden 
as an extremist, we in the US regard Chomsky as an extremist."
Friedman also slags off Seattle 
activists...http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/merupert/Anti-Friedman.htm
Anne Thrax thinks these pinko liberals at the NYT need killing,she may have 
a point.
A suicide Bombing seems called for Anne?
