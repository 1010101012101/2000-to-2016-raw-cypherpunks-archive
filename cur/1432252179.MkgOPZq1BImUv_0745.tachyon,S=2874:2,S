Who, the Iranians? Which ones are fanatics?

I'll grant there are some fanatics left in Iran, but Iran seems increasingly 
dominated by fairly sleezy clergy/judges. Like any government, theirs is 
deteriorating into a mere racket. And if you ask me, fanaticism never lasts 
very long anywhere, only for about a generation during turbulent times. Iran 
in particular is a special case...seems to me their cultural momentum will 
always outweigh any temporary fanaticism. A country that has a small but 
thriving prostitution industry can't be all that fanatical.
