If you can actually build links between service personell and the public,
you don't need a document that says how to do shit.  You use what ya got
and ship the best you can do out to the real world.

As long as there are people in the military who are willing and able to
inform us on what they are *really* doing, we actually can feel pretty
comfortable with their missions.  It's gonna take a full polilce state
to prevent the dissemination of this kind of info.

Having known safe places and methods to send the info so the sender is
always anonyomous is hard.  Trash bags in parks isn't such a bad method
:-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
