I'm offended, if you can call it taking offense at all, by "cartoon
physics", and innumeracy in general, in the movies and television.

Just because we can show it on the screen and it looks real, doesn't mean
that it'll ever be physically possible, and I don't mean that in the 19th
century patent-examiner sense, I mean it in the "ain't physically possible"
sense. Sound in space is a good example. Or, frankly, "morphing",
"shapeshifting", or whatever. Sure, we might all turn into nanotech grey
goo sooner or later, but, frankly, that stuff more likely in the realm of
faster-than-light travel, which is another thing I have trouble with.
However, life is too short to grumble about *everything*. :-).


Moreover, all of these Hollywood Computer Generated Image applications were
designed to model *physics* to begin with, and it's just plain ignorance on
Hollywood's part, or at least on their audience's part, that keeps them
from being used the right way in the first place. Blame it on public
schools, or at least 30 years of socialist control of same.

I think it's a lot less consistent with the cypherpunk viewpoint than most
people here think. Morpheus et.al., are not libertarian anarchists, boys
and girls. They're proto-statists. When the sequel comes out, if ever, and
they show where the rest of the humans are, you'll see that, I bet. Unless
they read cypherpunks, of course. :-).

Amen. Hierarchical, frankly communist, nonsense. In a hairshirt, for that
matter. At least Banks is a communist with a sense of humor. Roddenberry's
Earth: The Final Conflict is certainly in the same vein, and, so, too, is
Andromeda, from the looks of it. I still watch the damn stuff though, even
if they take a chainsaw, or at least a lemon meringue pie, to Starship
Troopers.

Neither do I. With the exception that most people out there *are* statists,
and that the Matrix makes a marvellous allegory for the nation-state, at
least in terms of its pervasiveness. Frankly, having learned about the
impact of cryptography on public internetworks, it's hard to just "jack
back in", even if some of us can probably afford the odd Armani jacket
themselves now, as a result what they've learned here... :-).

Nope. Didn't intend that, sorry for creating that misapprehension.

No argument there...

Cheers,
