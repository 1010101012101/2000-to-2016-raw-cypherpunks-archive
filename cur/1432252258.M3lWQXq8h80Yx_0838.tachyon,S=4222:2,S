B B B B A man whose conviction for writing about private fantasies of raping and 
torturing children was overturned was expected to be released from jail today. 


B B B B Brian Dalton posted bail yesterday afternoon, not long after Franklin 
County Common Pleas Judge David E. Cain set it at $50,000. 

B B B B Cain told Dalton, 24, that he could have no contact with minors, no 
access to the Internet and that he was under house arrest and parental supervision. 


B B B B Paperwork for his jail release was being completed early this morning. 

B B B B Prosecutors had asked for at least a $100,000 bond. 

B B B B "Evidence shows that defendant has admitted prior sex offenses and that 
he poses a significant risk to re-offend,bb prosecutors wrote to Cain. " 
Defendant literally mulls over the idea of sex with children when he sees them on 
the street.bb 

B B B B Dalton never has been convicted of abusing children. He pleaded guilty in 
2001 to pandering obscenity. 

B B B B His mother had found a diary stating his fantasies about children and 
given it to his probation officer. 

B B B B Dalton said the children were imaginary. At the time, he was on probation 
for possession of child pornography. 

B B B B Dalton pleaded guilty to the pandering charge, which drew international 
attention. Critics said the charge and his imprisonment violated his First 
Amendment right of self-expression. He tried to withdraw his plea twice, but 
Common Pleas Judge Nodine Miller rejected his requests. 

B B B B She sentenced him to seven years for pandering, plus 4B= years for 
violating his probation. 

B B B B The Franklin County Court of Appeals overturned his conviction in July, 
citing ineffective counsel. 

B B B B Benson A. Wolman, one of the lawyers who filed the appeal for Dalton, 
repeated yesterday an argument he has made for months. 

B B B B "He ought not to be in jail on wild charges that are contrary to the 
First Amendment,bb he said. 

B B B B Franklin County Prosecutor Ron ObBrien declined to talk about the bond. 
His office has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to review the lower appealscourt 
decision, and Wolman said Daltonbs response to the Supreme Court is due Sept. 
29. 

B B B B If the Ohio Supreme Court passes on the case, Dalton still can be retried 
before Cain.
