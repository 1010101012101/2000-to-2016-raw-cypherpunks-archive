Tor moves your data through the cloud untraceably, but you have to store it
somewhere. If you're storing small amounts of data (encryption keys maybe?)
you could use a dht, and there are a few good open source ones.

If you're talking about storing more than a few K, then you run into the
problem of who pays the disk space for me to store my 500GB art film
collection? :-)

The difference between an encryption key and the key to a locked drawer is

Again, one wonders if a truly deniable form of TOR-based encryption might be
possible. If I enter key number one, message one is retrieved untraceably
from the cloud. If I enter key number 2, message 2 is retrieved instead. The
tough part is that there needs to be a mixed middleware service layer inside
the cloud that can take the requests in an untraceable manner and go to the
right place to retrieve.

Or is there any easier way, given ISP records of customer activity?
