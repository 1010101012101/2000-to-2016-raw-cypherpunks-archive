You also forget another critical condition: It's OK if your sub-national
group opposes a government which the US dislikes; therefore those
trying to overthrow Saadam are 'freedom fighters'., rather than
terrorists. 

The same group can easily flip from one status to another as outside 
conditions change - many of the Afghanis the USG now labels 
'terrorists' were started on their careers as US sponsored 
'freedom fighters'.

Another example: Kurds striving to establish Kurdistan are regarded
by the US as either freedom fighters or terrorists, depending which
side of the Turkish/Iraqi border they are on.

Of course, by the US Governments definition, George Washington 
and the other Founding Fathers were terrorists.
