Hand-Held Device for DVD Movies Raises Legal Issues

PARIS -- Hollywood's bid to control how its movies are copied, stored and 
played is being tested by an unlikely source: a former French oil engineer 
in an out-of-the-way Paris suburb, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.

Henri Crohas's company, Archos SA, makes a small hand-held device, like a 
bulky Palm Pilot, that can record and then play back scores of movies, TV 
shows and digital photos on its color screen or a TV set. The gadget -- 
which in effect does to movies what Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod does to 
music -- already has sold 100,000 units world-wide during the past six 
months, beating the big consumer electronics makers to the U.S. market.

Archos's device, which costs about $500 to $900 depending on the model, 
ignores an anticopying code found on a majority of prerecorded DVDs. That 
means consumers can plug the Archos device into a DVD player and transfer a 
movie to it. Users also can transfer recorded TV programs and digital music 
files to the Archos device. The Archos uses a video compression standard 
called MPEG-4 to cram as many as 320 hours of video at near-DVD quality 
onto its hard drive, the company says -- the equivalent of 160 two-hour 
movies.

A second kind of anticopying protection thwarts users from recording a 
playable copy of a DVD movie onto the hard-drive of a personal computer and 
then onto the Archos. But videos can be transferred from the Archos to a 
PC, where they could be burned onto a DVD or sent over the Internet, though 
that would likely violate copyright laws.

The gadgets alone aren't likely to spawn a Napster-style boom in online 
film piracy. Already, scofflaws with a PC equipped with a DVD player and 
special software can rip off films and share them over the Internet. And 
the process is slow: It takes as long to copy a DVD movie to the Archos 
device as it does to watch the movie. Still, Mr. Crohas and his 
150-employee team at Archos ( pronounced AR kos) present a fresh headache 
for Hollywood because they show how the industry's campaign to keep control 
of its films could be challenged by small players.
