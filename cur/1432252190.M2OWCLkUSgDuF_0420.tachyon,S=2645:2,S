Looks like at least one library is trying a variation the method I suggested...

"The Patriot Act also prohibits libraries and others from notifying patrons 
and others that an investigation is ongoing. At least one library has tried 
a solution to "beat the system" by regularly informing the board of 
directors that there are no investigations. If the director does not notify 
the Board that there are no investigations, it can serve as a clue that 
something may be happening. "

A foolish Constitutional inconsistency is the hobgoblin of freedom, adored
