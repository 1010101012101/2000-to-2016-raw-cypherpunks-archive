I think "cooperative isolation of someone" is a natural thing. 
Shunning, isolation, expulsion...it's how groups deal with characters 
they don't like.

Government has no role whatsoever to play in such actions, which in 
the U.S., at least, and for the foreseeable future, are supposedly 
protected by the "freedom of association" language of the 
Constitution.

An empty comment. "Tolerance" subsumes the right of some to be "intolerant."

Frankly, "discrimination" ought to be a goal, not the "hateword" it 
has become since the commies took over in the 60s.

As for your country, Finland, might I suggest you start letting in 
large numbers of refugees and other "darkies"? Countries like Finland 
and Sweden are fond of yapping about the discrimination in the U.S., 
but are predictably lacking in letting in large numbers of Gypsies, 
Romanians, Nigerians, Sierra Leonans, Turks, and other such races.

Niggardly of them, it would seem.

Let's see what happens when the average Swede or Finn is paying 70% 
of his income in taxes to support illiterate, thieving peasants and 
Gypsies.
