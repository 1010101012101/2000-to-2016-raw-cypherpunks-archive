	Feeding the medical and pharmaceutical mafia is another key
	objective - and purpose -  of the government. 


	In a free market, a kilo of a 'natural'(comes from a plant,
	it's quite green) stimulant like cocaine would cost, say, $100,
	whereas in the current fascist system, $100 buys you a few
	pills of the latest patented garbage sold by pfizer and pushed
	by the narc-cunts known as 'medical doctors'.
