And the answer to the above is: no.

I'll elaborate (Capt. Obvious, but whatever). The possibilities and=20
technologies of connecting and communicating had made such strides duri=
ng the=20
last 20 years, that we really do not have to limit ourselves to these t=
wo=20
suboptimal (to say the least) situations. We can have a decentralized a=
nd non-
controllable network if we want to, and it can piggy-back on or run wit=
hin any=20
network that is controlled by the government (not sure about balkanized=
=20
networks but I guess that would also be doable to some extent).

Just use the current "Internet" just as Internet used the telephone sys=
tem, as=20
infrastructure. The infrastructure was controlled by the government and=
 big=20
telcos -- meh, whatever, we just layered a better network on top.

The other way -- and a great one, but a bit harder -- is mesh networkin=
g on or=20
as close to the physical level as possible. Just look what these smart =
cheese-
lovers are doing:
http://ur1.ca/gdcy5

Think: "we can rebuild the decentralized network, we have the technolog=
y"=20
instead of "we're fucked".

Why is it a question that needs answering?
