You're going to die anyway. Kill yourself now.

Non sequitur. If the development doesn't happen you don't have a case. If
hardware gets cheaper but is not deployed because voters value their
privacy you have no case. If countermeasures are legal you have no case.

The same technology driving global surveillance also offers advent of
countermeasures. I mentioned anonymous telepresence hardware proxies, and
sooner or later telepresence is going to become the preferred means of
interaction, and much later complete redesign of our hardware platform at
molecular scale will become possible. This will take time to develop. We
don't need power-crazy maniacs ruining it for everybody, really.

Governments are not complete juggernauts. They're somewhat controllable. 
It's surveillance that gives them the ultimate power to squash opposition. 
You included. Don't give them the means voluntarily. Fight.

Dream on. Here's the point where Brin's assumptions break down. I can give
you a long list why this won't work.

You can delay both development and deployment. If you delay it long enough 
it will no longer have the bite it would currently have.

Political decisions could kill the demand driving development. Cheapest 
way for the fringe is to inform and develop countermeasures. Since 
cypherpunks no longer code, spreading information should have priority.
