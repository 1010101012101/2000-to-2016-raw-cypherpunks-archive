Okay, if you want to learn how to hack, I recommend the 
following books: (these are available on Amazon). 

	Introduction to Algorithms, from MIT press. 

	Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 
	same source. 

	The Art of Computer Programming, (get all 4 volumes) 
	by Knuth.


If you want to learn how to hack crypto, I recommend
these: (Amazon is your friend again) 

	The Code Breakers, by David Kahn. 

	Applied Cryptography, by Bruce Schneier. 


If you're smart enough to hack, that ought to keep you busy for 
a couple of years and you shouldn't pester us again until you're 
ready for more.  If you're not smart enough to hack, you'll never 
get through these and understand what's in them, and you should 
never pester us again.

		Good luck, 

			Bear
