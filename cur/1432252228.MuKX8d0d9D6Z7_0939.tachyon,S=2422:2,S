I hear them using this _frequently_. Just about any time I see a fat 
negro chick on one of the talk shows (CNN, MSNBC, etc.) I can count on 
her using the phrase "blahblah of color" several times.

Again, I hear the cripples using the phrases "physically challenged" 
_frequently_.

It's not enough that cripples always get the best parking places, by 
law, but they want all "Handicapped" signs replaced with more PC terms.

(I may start pulling cores on their tires after seeing so many 
apparently-fully-mobile persons getting out of their cars and vans with 
the "Handicapped" placards. Here in California, an entire industry of 
scammers and willing doctors has emerged to get more and more people 
declared "Disabled" and thus eligible for the special placards and, of 
course, taxpayer-paid-for free stuff.)
