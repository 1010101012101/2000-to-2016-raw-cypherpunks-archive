Good coders are rare, and since extremely busy, are essentially invisible.
If there's one present, somehow: you go back to your coding pen right now
ere you get hooked on idle chitchat.

Apart from being fun, explosives are extremely useful, in precision
material processing, geoimaging, as easily mobilizable scalable energy
conserve, research (HE-driven flux compressors for pure fusion devices,
nuclear device core assembly, and the like).

Getting the geometry and the timing right in your hydrodynamics model is
still what feds at Sandia and elsewhere are occupied with, and I don't
think they're done yet.

So, getting a spitting hissyfit over "bomb talk" shows of ignorance and
intolerance both. So phhtphpthtpth.

Come on, rigging your flat with active and passive tripwire type intrusion
detectors, and switching to an emission poor system (chucking CRT for LCD
would do plenty for starters) will make you know they've been there, and
if they go to the trouble of finding and disable offsite streamed video
feeds (all of them?) you're in deep doodoo land, anyway.

Siccing this type of specialist on a random geek just to gather evidence?
Such specialists usually don't bother with gathering evidence, and just
make people meet a Boojum when they go round a corner.

Too late. We have your DNA fingerprints in our database, and you failed to
see the pinhole aperture. Muahahahaha!
