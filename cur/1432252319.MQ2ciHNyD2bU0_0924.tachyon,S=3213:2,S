Extract ...The EFAis particularly concerned about provisions which 
authorize law enforcement officers to ask individuals to provide keys to 
encrypted data.
Mr Taylor said the Cybercrime Act was contrary to the common law privilege 
against self-incrimination.
"One of the major concerns with that is that you may not have access to the 
encryption keys or you have simply forgotten it."
Senator Ellison said the new law was consistent with the recommendations of 
the Council of Europe and would ensure Australia was leading the effort 
against cyber terrorism.

  "If "the law" is used to protect government-employed criminals, then the 
law is wrong and we should disregard that portion of it. . 
Government  agents must, therefore, expect to be accountable to the 
citizens, while  accountability in the other direction is virtually the 
definition of  tyranny." professor rat.
