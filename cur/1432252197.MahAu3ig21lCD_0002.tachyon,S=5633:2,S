Thanks for bringing the issue up. However, it seems an intermittent problem
at your end, that I cannot detect the same situation as you all had

Let me know if it still persists. Perhaps supply me more details. I suspect
it could be my service provider's fault. I shall start monitoring its
service quality closely now. 

Regards,
GS
