	I'm talking about the current kind of military contractors,
	which includes the tor project. 

	And what I said about insurance is that activities that
	currently are carried by the state/police can be replaced by
	insurace. As a matter of fact, even today the police doesn't do
	anything useful if you get robbed whereas if your stuff is
	insured you will get your money back.

	I don't think any kind of army belongs in a free society/free
	market so, no, no military contractors in a free market.


	Aaaaand, all this has nothing to do with the 'anonymous' firing
	done by the tor project anyway.

	'corporations' are a legal fiction created by the state, so no.
