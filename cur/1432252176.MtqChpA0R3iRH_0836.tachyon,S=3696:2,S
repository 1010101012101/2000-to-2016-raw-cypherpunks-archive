It's always the last war that's being fought.

Never more true than now, where the focus is on fingernail clippers and 
on New York City.

(BTW, I am watching on CNN the implementation of a "car pools only" rule 
for cars and trucks entering NYC. Vehicles with just a single driver 
will be not be allowed to cross the bridges or enter the tunnels. Gee, 
this means the attackers will have to find an accomplice to ride along 
with them...now where would they possibly find _that_?)

The attackers pulled off the 911 attack with skill and boldness. (No, I 
am not endorsing what they did. But I find the claims that they were 
"stupid" to be dangerous and, well, stupid.)

The likelihood is that the the couple of hundred (or more, estimated by 
"Newsweek" from sources) sleepers will do something completely 
different, something planned months ago and ready to be carried out. I 
could easily speculate what Rounds Two and Three might look like, and 
have on other lists.

New York will probably not be the target this upcoming time.
