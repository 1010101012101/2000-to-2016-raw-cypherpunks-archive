If NSA and GCHQ were, are, doing these alleged operations as surmised
with slightest evidence greatly amplified, cherry-picked and moshed like
a Tom Clancy hot seller, it is likely the Devil's Duo are meticulously
tracking, siphoning and implanting:

1. Those reporting, editing, checking, formatting and posting these
stories and documents from various countries and those spying all
these from inside and outside.

2. The hosting and keyservers of The Intercept, First Look and
interconnections and those spying all these from inside and outside.

3. The transceivals among the media staff, lawyers, bankers, bedmates
and those spying all these from inside and outside.

4. The comsec wizards being consulted and those they are leaking
stuff to and those spying all these from inside and outside.

5. The officials being asked for comment and their roladexes of
insiders and those spying all these from inside and outside.

6. The multiple-agencies counter-counter-intel agents double-checking
everyone involved and those spying all these from inside and outside.

7. The thousands necessarily swept up in the spiderwebs of linkages
for immediate or distant actionable operations and those spying all
these from inside and outside.

8. The other national spies working the same territories of gullible
targets armored with the world's greatest comsec protection,
no matter what ex-spies and ex-contractors claim is absolutely
dependable means to assure nobody is swiping and siphoning
and those spying all these from inside and outside.

Months, years to come, there will be even more gushings about
what has been dribbled out with insufficient context to understand
what is media hyperbole and what is worth worrying about and those
spying all these from inside and outside standards orgs, FOI
racketeering, crypto entrepreneurs of com, edu, org and
open source treacheries.

Recap: About 1,333 Snowden documents have been released by
commercial media, none for free.

Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.

Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).

Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.

So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.

Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.

The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.

So call it a $200-500M affair to date.

If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.

Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.

Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.

Thanks, Ed.
