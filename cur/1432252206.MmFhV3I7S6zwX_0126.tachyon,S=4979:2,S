No.  Assuming that ORBS servers were blocked at the edge (as is the case
here), they have absolutely no way to test for open relays (not that it
would do any good here, as we don't have any).  If ORBS probes are
blocked, ORBS will literally _invent_ the review of "open relay", and
apply it to the "movie" (domain) they never had access to "see".

There is another dark side to ORBS which seems to be missed here:  Most
people's primary complaint about spammers is that they (the spammer) is
making use of network services at someone elses expense, without
permission of the spamee.  ORBS is guilty of the EXACT same "crime" - but,
the ORBS is Politically Correct, so nobody seems to mind...   

Hypocrisy in action, eh?

You flatter yourself *way* too much Declan - I know of nobody who would
waste a cartridge on your useless ass.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
