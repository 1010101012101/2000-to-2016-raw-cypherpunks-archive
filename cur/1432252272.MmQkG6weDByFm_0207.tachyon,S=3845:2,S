Apster Beta in reigon? First, we all know that these computer systems come 
out, and has there ever been one that was perfect? I don't think so. That's 
why you have betas.
Why would someone who is breaking the law pay any attention to the law? 
It's so difficult to catch 'em. You just wonder what the effect would be. 
Good people who obey laws probably don't send out a whole lot of APster 
bets. Bad people who like to rip people up probably won't pay a lot of 
attention to the law, since they'll do it anyway.
