Hola, assuming some / most of these questions are posed as just open
ones to reflect upon... nonetheless, I've tossed out a few "answers"
anyway (take with healthy dose of salt)

This is generally happening / in process or has happened; you operate
under the assumption that it is happening or has happened and plan
time scale accordingly.

Not always possible to identify in advance.  Easier to ascertain
assuming your goals / objectives are clear (thus narrowing possible
adversaries) and understanding of people's customs, language, etc
where you will be functioning (online and off).

Don't loiter long
