Watch This Stock Monday Some of These Little VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Real|y Moving Late|y.

And When Some of them Move, They Rea||y Go...Gains of 10O%, 2OO% or 
More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to 
become a leading supplier of VoIP techno|ogy inc|uding the fol|owing 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca|ls from any telephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any ce|lu|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 20O,O00 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|ular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|obal sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan 
O|ivier,
