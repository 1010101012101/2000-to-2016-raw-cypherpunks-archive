nym-0.5 is now available from:

http://www.lunkwill.org/src/nym/

Most notably, this release fixes a bug whereby the client code didn't check
that returned signatures are valid.  Thus, a token server could "tag"
clients by returning invalid signatures which the CA would then detect.

A preprint of an academic paper on nym is also now included in the
distribution as well.
