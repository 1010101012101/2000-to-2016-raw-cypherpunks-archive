Show me the cites. I commit felonies on a weekly, even daily, basis.

IBM instructed employees to destroy records. At Intel, we destroyed 
records--I did so as part of the "Crush" program (to drive several 
competitors out of business). So long as we were not being ordered to 
turn over evidence, not any kind of crime.

A bookstore is not "spoliating" for failing to keep records of who 
bought which books.

Cop: "We have a court order requiring you to turn over all records 
concerning who bought the book "Applied Cryptography.""

Store: "We don't keep records."

Cop: "Why not?"

Store: "None of your business."

(Interjection by Black Unicorn: "The court is not amused.")

Cop: "We could charge you with spoliation!"

Store: "Go right ahead."

(Interjection by Black Unicorn: "It's not nice to fool with Mr. Happy 
Fun Court.")

The discussion included claims that those who use remailers, or who 
run remailers, may be guilty of spoliation. And it included comments 
that using offshore/unreachable methods if one ever expects to be 
charged is spoliation.

I say this is bullshit. By your vague (no plausible cites, just some 
1L literatlisms), whispering is spoliation. Failure to archive tape 
recordings of conversations is spoliation. Use of encryption is 
spoliation. Drawing the curtains is spoliation.

But you said, more than once,

"If it looks like you knew it was going to be a
court issue and you put it on freenet for that purpose, you're in trouble."

And why would it be a crime for John Gotti to make his communications 
inaccessible or irretrievable or unrecallable?

How aboutL "If it looks like you knew it was going to be a
court issue and you whispered so that the FBI could not understand 
your words , you're in trouble."?

Isn't this spoliation by your broad standards?

But, Black Unicorn, you're the one who chose to lecture all the children here.

I have asked for a cite that shows that higher courts, up to the 
Supreme Court, have held that using Freenet or encryption would 
constitute spoliation, which you brought into the discussion as a 
reason why Cypherpunks had better not count on using encryption, or 
offshore storage, or any other means that might cause the court to 
"not be amused."

They didn't get John Gotti for whispering, so I doubt "spoliation" is 
nearly the tool you and Aimee Farr seem to think it is.

John Gotti "knew or should have known" that prosecutors would have 
loved to have had his tape-recorded conversations. Was he then 
obligated by "spoliation" standards to have neatly archived them or 
could he re-use his answering machine tapes the way everyone else 
does/

(Again, he is not in Marion for spoliation.)

And so on. I could give a dozen examples off-hand of cases where 
records were not kept, where whispering or coded messages were used. 
No prosecutions on spoliation that I know of. Cites from you?

I'm asking for some cites that your broad interpretation, which you 
have even extended to saying that remailer operators may be running 
afoul of the spoliation law merely for not keeping records of who 
used their services, is at all in the ballpark of plausibility.

A person under indictment or called as a witness who throws a gun 
into a river, or who burns diaries, may be said to be tampering with 
or destroying evidence. Maybe "spoliation" is the Black's Law term. 
Who cares?

But this is a far cry from saying that anyone "who knows or has 
reason to expect" that he will someday be charged with some crime is 
committing spoliation by using remailers, offshore 
accounts,whispering, using secure phone lines,  etc.

Saying I should "look up the statute" is a cop-out. In fact, I did 
some Findlaw searches and found nothing to support your broad claim 
that using a remailer or an offshore storage site exposes one to 
spoliation charges. In the real world, that is, not the 1L 
simplicities of reading statutes overly literally.

If you're going to try to scare remailer operators with the claim 
that they may already be violating the spoliation laws, at least 
provide some strong evidence.
