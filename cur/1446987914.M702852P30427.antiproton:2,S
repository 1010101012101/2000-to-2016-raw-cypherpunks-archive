New York's Radical Left-Wing Attorney General Plots to Criminalize
Opposing the Left
November 8, 2015
Daniel Greenfield

Here's a little reminder for anyone who doesn't believe that what the
left really wants is a totalitarian state in which opposition to its
agenda is a crime.

New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is extreme even by
left-wing standards. He's a radical who ran by promising that violent
racist thug Al Sharpton would have an "annex" in Albany if he won.

Now Schneiderman and a few left-wing congressmembers have come up with
a great idea. Charge Exxon with securities fraud for not "disclosing"
the risks of Global Warming.

Whether on not any charges happen, this is a foot in the door for an
agenda list that goes well beyond Global Warming.

After energy companies that aren't paying protection money to Al Gore,
gun manufacturers can be hit with charges for not "disclosing the
risks" of gun violence. Private prisons can be hit for not disclosing
the risks of failing to back sentencing reforms. Educational companies
can be hit with charges for not disclosing the risks of not adopting
Common Core.

Basically any company that disagrees with a left-wing policy can be
hit with civil and criminal charges. It helps if the company, like
Exxon, at one point employed kooks who claimed the sky was falling.
But that just makes the case easier. If the executives disagree with a
left-wing policy, it's securities fraud.

Under this standard, it becomes child's play to cut off conservative
organization from any corporate funding. Furthermore, conservative
organizations would be muzzled by extension. Funding organizations and
people that dissent from the left would be "fraud". Because that is
what this is really about.

Global Warming is the testbed for making leftist ideology mandatory.
Manufacture a fake consensus, then use the law to make it mandatory.

Then there can be a pseudo-scientific consensus on a variety of
issues, such as the need for higher taxes, and a crackdown on anyone
who disagrees.

Since there's money in pursuing charges like this, and since the best
way to get the left off your back is to give their political allies
money, this is robbery for tyranny. And that's how the left does
business.

This is where the left has always been headed. This is a totalitarian movement
