Payee traceability made it possible to close accounts related to 
pornography.   Ecash is not truly cash like if the issuer can prevent it 
from being used by tax evaders, child pornographers, money launderers and 
terrorists.

Internet explorer already has the necessary hooks.  If we put the ecash 
wallet into an active X control then when the user navigates to a ecash 
page, the user will see the usual warning "Do you trust code signed by so 
and so".  If he clicks yes, the code will be downloaded to the client and 
installed behind the scenes, and he will never see that warning again, 
unless he encounters a page with an updated version of the ecash control.

The html code on the thumbnail page where one clicks on a porno link will 
need to be rewritten to support ecash.   If the porno page server is using 
IIS, the server will need an ISAPI extension to handle URL's containing 
ecash payments.   Apache has a similar extension mechanism, but I have 
never written an extension for an Apache server.

The page that has for-pay links does not need anything unusual about its 
server, or about the client's Internet explorer, but the server that serves 
links containing ecoins in their urls will need an extension, similar to 
extensions I have written before.

Unfortunately, if ecash is truly untraceable, you cannot give people their 
ecash until their payment clears, which means you cannot let them pay by 
credit card.  They would be able to pay by e-gold, Paypal, paper cheque or 
wire transfer.
