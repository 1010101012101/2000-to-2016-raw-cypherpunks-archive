I've been revising the principles, and came up with this. It's an early 
version.

As ever, corrections and suggestions are welcome.

Calling them Laws is perhaps a bit overreaching - but on reflection I 
thought that's mostly what they are, break them and the system won't be 
secure.

I will put the Laws up on the 'net shortly, hopefully with a link for 
suggestions and comments.



The Laws of secure information systems design:



Law 0: It's all about who is in control

Law 1: Someone else is after your data

Law 2: If it isn't stored it can't be stolen

Law 3: Only those you trust can betray you




Law 4: Attack methods are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal

Law 5: The entire system is subject to attack

Law 6: A more complex system has more places to attack

Law 7: Holes for good guys are holes for bad guys too




Law 8: Kerckhoffs's Principle rulez! - usually...

Law 9: A system which is hard to use will be abused or unused

law 10: Design for future threats

Law 11: Security is a Boolean





Law 12: People offering the impossible are lying

Law 13: Nothing ever really goes away

Law 15: "Schneier's law c" [1] holds illimitable dominion over all... 
including these laws








-- Peter Fairbrother

[1] "

a: Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can 
create an algorithm that he himself can't break. It's not even hard.

b: What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break, 
even after years of analysis.

c: And the only way to prove that is to subject the algorithm to years 
of analysis by the best cryptographers around."
