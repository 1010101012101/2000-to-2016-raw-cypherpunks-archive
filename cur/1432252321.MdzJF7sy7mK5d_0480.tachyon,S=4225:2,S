At 2:10 PM -0800 on 1/11/02, "Eric Cordian" makes an actual appeal to
ignorance...:


> I see not a single denial.

Ah. Prove to you that he didn't say it?
<http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/ignorant.html>


:-).


Not that I care either way, though I expect Peter's probably right on this one.

By way of *another* informal fallacy, :-), post hoc, ergo, propter hoc,
<http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/begquest.html>, with a nod to Bill Walton's
old stomping grounds, "if we lived here we'd be home now", and all that: If
Sharon said it, there are enough people who hate his guts in the mainstream
press that we'd have heard all about it by now.

> I certainly don't wish to adopt the position that

> are right that it's a bit suspicious.

There ya go. *That* makes a whole lot more sense, now, doesn't it? "Never
attribute to conspiracy that which can easily be explained by stupidity",
or whatever Pournelle said.

But then, a good thing never lasts, does it?, viz,

> I see no denials of this even more widely reported story, and I find that
> suspicious too.

Whoops. There you go again, Britney -- or "Eric", or whatever your name is...

(Just to help Mr. Choate in his subsequent mailbombs on informal logic, I
offer the following link farm. Knock yourself out, Jim...:
