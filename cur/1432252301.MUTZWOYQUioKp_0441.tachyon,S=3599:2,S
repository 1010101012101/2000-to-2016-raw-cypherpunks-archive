Without taking sides in your little local dispute over there, surely the
better analogy would be an ox realising that his food comes from the
killers of cattle?


Fat systems programmer decides to refrain from half-a-dozen bad taste
jokes about anthrax, cattle & sheep. But points out that the news media
might have covered it better if someone had told them that anthrax is
endemic in the USA and millions of people may have been exposed to
enough to have antibodies. Also decides not to discuss the current
literature on viable but non-culturable ("VBNC") bacteria which
generally concludes that culture methods often don't give a very good
indication of contamination.  Googling for Rita Colwell and cholera
might be informative.
