The client side stuff for Mojo Nation has been released under the GPL -
that's even a little bit understated, as mostly what they haven't
released is the mint and the metatracker source. You can't start your
own independent Nation, but you can get under the hood of theirs if
you want. 

An overlooked P2P resource is Jabber - it's been explained/marketed as
a cross-platform vendor-neutral chat/messaging system, which is true ..
but it's also a framework for delivering arbitrary XML objects between
not-necessarily-24x7 agents.
