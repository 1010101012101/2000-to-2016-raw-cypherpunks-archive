i have been thinking about this and i was thinking a lot about actual
nuclear bomb sites being added to the list
of 'hazard to public' and i was like - not possible to give the public any
kind of access to such horrors but then
its already in play ... NATOish people sold the design of the bomb to
pakistan and israel long ago so maybe
actually if more people were involved in the process it would be in safer
hands and there would be less
proliferation as it seems to be the modus operandi that there be more bombs
to counter

best film ever points in the direction of nano/bio tech possibilities le
jette with the murder of species... can we have the components make
themselves and self destruct when in danger?
