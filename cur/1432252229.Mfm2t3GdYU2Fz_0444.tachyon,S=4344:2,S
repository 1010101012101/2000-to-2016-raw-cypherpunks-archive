It's critical that vendors adhere to published specs. They can be
"standard" ones, they can be their own ones, but they have to be
PUBLISHED. Either as an RFC-like document, or as the source code of the
program/driver itself. I don't care about the form as long as I can take
that damned thing and glue it to whatever I am building at the moment
without having to reverse-engineering it. (Or, even more important, that
when I will be tracing why it doesn't work as expected, I will know where
I have to look for what.) If the specs are too tight for you to fit, or
aren't at all, good for me - but I want to have enough of data to write an
eventual convertor from/to something other. What it does inside is your
business, but I want to know what goes in and out - protocols and data
formats.

I want to see Billy "Greedy" Gates having to powerlessly watch his power
disappearing, his clout leaking through his fingers, his empire crumbling.
This would hurt him more than losing money. I want to see him suffer. I
want him to end in Hell, reinstalling Windows NT 5 forever.

I go for open source whenever I can. If I can't have the source, I want at
least the specs. I would have to think hard to find what I hate more than
feeling powerless - when a binary-only thing doesn't work correctly and I
can't take a look into it and litter the suspicious part of code with
debug messages. (I am in fighting mood now, freshly after winning a
several hours long battle with gnokii, smsd, and Nokia 3310, trying to
figure out why that damned thing sent a message 4 times and claimed error.
The reason was a response timeout constant defaulting to -1 (no wait)
instead of 30 (at most 3 seconds wait). If it'd be a binary-only thing,
I'd have to wait at least a day for the vendor's response, likely MUCH
longer - if it would have support at all.)

Mark Twain was right, when he said that the nearest helping hand is right
at the end of your shoulder. :) I just wish the corporations would let
people help themselves and wouldn't push for artificial complexity and
forced dependence on their "good will".
