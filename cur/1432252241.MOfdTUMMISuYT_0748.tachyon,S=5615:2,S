It's a myth that remailers don't distinguish between inter-remailer and
outside traffic.  Actually, remailers generally have built-in knowledge
of every other remailer, and mail from them is handled specially.

The reason is because of flood detection and prevention, which is a
feature of modern remailer software.  Attacks against the remailer network
in the form of message floods have been a common nuisance in recent years.
As a countermeasure, current remailer software detects and automatically
blocks addresses which provide excessive quantities of mail.

Unfortunately, the most common cause of large incoming volumes is
that the other sender is itself a remailer.  Hence it is necessary to
maintain a database of all extant remailers and disable flood detection
for those addresses.  This is a common practice for remailer operators.

It's also one of the main reasons why certain remailer chains
"mysteriously" fail to work.  With the set of remailers changing
frequently, especially in recent months, it takes time, often weeks,
before all the remailers get around to updating their databases to
reflect the current set of addresses.  Until then you have a failure
with any chain which goes from a remailer to another remailer which has
not yet added it.  You end up with these strange situations where A can
send to B which can send to C, and C can send to A, but any chain where
A sends to C fails.

At one time there was a somewhat romantic and idealistic notion that
remailers would all operate independently, with no need to be aware
of each other's existence.  Experience has proven that this is not
the case.  Remailers do know about each other, they need to know about
each other, and they coordinate their efforts via various mailing lists
and newsgroups.

Given this reality, it is time to consider a different approach to
remailers, one in which all remailer operators work together in a peer
to peer network.  It's crazy for remailers to use RFC2822 email to
communicate with each other, with all of its problems with reliability
and the many layers of software which mail goes through to and from the
remailing functionality.

Remailer operators should have permanent encrypted links to one another,
with constant (or at least message-uncorrelated) traffic volumes.
They can still use latency, message pools, and other features, of course.
But when it comes time to deliver messages to the next remailer in the
list, that should be done with a reliable and direct connection that
doesn't have to depend on the vagaries of sendmail, procmail, Microsoft
servers or the many other layers that get in the way.  This would both
increase the reliability of the remailer network and improve its security
by hiding inter-remailer traffic.
