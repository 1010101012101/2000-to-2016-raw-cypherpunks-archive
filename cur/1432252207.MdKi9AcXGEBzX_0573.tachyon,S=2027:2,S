Actually, that's an interesting point. Let's first of all remember that 
Gilmore was allowed onto the plane in the first place, so airport security 
didn't care or notice. 

You are correct, and this means that the TSA Nazis failed to adequately 
identify a potential security threat.  The button being discovered by British 
Airways.

Remember 9/11 was a failure of our alphabet agencies for adequately 
protecting us, and naturally in response we've run to protection to another new 
alphabet agency, how sad.
