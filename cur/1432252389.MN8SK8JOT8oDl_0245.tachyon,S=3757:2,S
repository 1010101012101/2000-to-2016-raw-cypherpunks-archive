Keying off of one phrase alone,

 > This combat is about far more than crypto...

I suggest you immediately familiarize yourself with last month's
changes to the Wassenaar Agreement, perhaps starting here:

http://oti.newamerica.net/blogposts/2013/international_agreement_reached_controlling_export_of_mass_and_intrusive_surveillance

Precis: Two new classes of export prohibited software:

Intrusion software

    "Software" specially designed or modified to avoid detection
    by 'monitoring tools', or to defeat 'protective countermeasures',
    of a computer or network capable device, and performing any of
    the following:

    a. The extraction of data or information, from a computer or
    network capable device, or the modification of system or user
    data; or

    b. The modification of the standard execution path of a program
    or process in order to allow the execution of externally provided
    instructions.

IP network surveillance systems

    5. A. 1. j. IP network communications surveillance systems or
    equipment, and specially designed components therefor, having
    all of the following:

    1. Performing all of the following on a carrier class IP network
    (e.g., national grade IP backbone):

    a. Analysis at the application layer (e.g., Layer 7 of Open
    Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1));

    b. Extraction of selected metadata and application content
    (e.g., voice, video, messages, attachments); and

    c. Indexing of extracted data; and

    2. Being specially designed to carry out all of the following:

    a. Execution of searches on the basis of 'hard selectors'; and

    b. Mapping of the relational network of an individual or of a
    group of people.


All the same arguments that applied exportation bans for crypto
software apply here, especially that of pointlessness.
