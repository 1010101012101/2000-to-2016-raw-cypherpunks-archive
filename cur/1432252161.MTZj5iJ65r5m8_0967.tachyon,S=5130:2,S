Perhaps this whole thing is just one person talking to himself, with
Tim listening in! -Dr Evil, CP list

Clearly I'm not talking about online systems here, where the
online DB-query prevents double-spending, and protocols provide
anonymity.  I'm talking about those systems where you have a 
tamper-resistant
device providing double-spend assurance.

Yes, I know that a bank's secrets are not safe in Paul Kocher's back 
pocket.  
But lets assume a tamperproof system protected by a reasonable PIN.
The stored-value smartcard in your pocket was bought off the shelf with 
cash and has
no identifying info.

I'm aware of the problems with biometrics & street surgery.  Ok, a PIN 
is fine.

Physical tokens are better user interfaces.  You can also leverage
their tamper-resistance as the origin of trust.  Without going online
for every transaction.   Obviously there are pros and cons for
different techs.  (I don't see why a secure smartcard couldn't be
used for online transactions if it has a convenient home-computer i/f;
dedicated devices are more reliable, anyway.)

Pay-to-bearer has finder's-keepers property, but the PIN can remove
this property.  I suppose this applies to online protocol based
systems, e.g., if someone trojans your computer and copies your coins.

Much like PGP does with private keys, requiring a passphrase to
get to them.

My claim is that anonymity can be present *unless* you want your card
(with its stored-value) back.  This is a feature that cash doesn't have.

to lose,

Much like a leather wallet & paper cash; but smartcard-cash could be
'safer' with a PIN & (anonymity-busting) reward mechanism.  Obviously
you can't 'cancel' a smartcard like you can a lost credit card, since
the smartcard transactions are not online.  So you hope its found,
instead of truly lost.  When you lose paper cash, you don't care, its the
same to you.
