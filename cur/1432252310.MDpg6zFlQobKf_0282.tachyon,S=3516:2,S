Her point, Tim, is that she doubts such a thing will ever be deployed 
widely or accepted, because she can't see a way for someone to make 
money at it. 

As presented, I think she's probably right.  Nobody in conventional 
business is going to want to do a deal with someone when they can't 
create a legally enforceable contract.  And "reputation capital" 
that would counteract that point to some extent depends on maintaining 
a consistent traceable pseudonym as someone who does something illegal, 
for decades, without getting linked to it.
