I don't know about what's happening to Mojo Nation exactly, but it seemed
to me that they were focusing on "P2P." Since that isn't doing so well
these days, I'm not sure where they are. They were at the O'Reilly P2P
conference earlier this month, but I wasn't, so I don't know what was
said.

On the other hand, PGP integration with mailers and OS is further along
than in 1996, at least on Windows. I use Outlook/PGP for work all the
time. (On Unix, there's premail, some pgp/pine scripts, built-in mutt
support, and I'm not sure what else).

Our chapter for that book included some of this. In retrospect it didn't
include enough; in particular, omitting Ian Grigg and systemics, inc was a
particularly bad oversight (and mostly mine). The second edition of the
book was recently cancelled, unfortunately.
