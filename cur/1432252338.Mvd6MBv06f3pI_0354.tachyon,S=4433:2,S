Well, I'm glad you'd seperate it, but when you get down to
constructing systems, you have to re-integrate it.  And if you're
talking about dissidents, you have to solve it really well.  I
wouldn't be comfortable saying "Yeah, use this and Bejing won't bother 
you" with anything less.  Maybe you would.

As far as not readable by the FBI/NSA, see the Back/Muller/Stiglic
paper.

As far as your opinions of our business, well, I'm really uninterested 
in getting into a pissing match with you.  The reality is that
customers and investors give us money tp produce privacy tools, and
they, not you, are the ones I need to keep happy.
