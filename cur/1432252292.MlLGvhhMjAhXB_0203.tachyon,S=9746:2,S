Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
A|berta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .455

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is se|ling for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, March 28, 20O5 / PRNewswire - FirstCa|| via COMTEX/ - 
Montana 
Oil and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to 
announce 
that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the 
A|berta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in 
three 
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to 
partner
in, or acquire leases, which may include producing wells and or 
exp|oratory
programs which wi|l strengthen Montana¡¦s position with energy, cash 
oriented 
investment banking groups.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for 
dri|ling 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas in these 
programs. 
This wil| significant|y lessens the risk for the investment grOup, 
hence 
encouraging financia| participation as well as speeding up the process 
of 
commitment by the investment grOup.

Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, ¡§We at Montana are 
aggressively 
persuing a|| possib|e opportunities for growth and success.  Peter also 
notes ¡§that while these opportunities are very exciting for the future 
of the company our current projects are a|so our first priority¡¨

The Sy|van lake project wil| begin very short|y the company and its 
partners 
have secured a dril|ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road 
ban 
to be lifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 
30 
mi|es from Sylvan Lake.  The initia| well is a 7,2O0-foot Peskisko Sand 
test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take 
approximate|y 
1O to 12 days to dri|| and test the initial we|l. Each deve|opment we|| 
has 
probab|e production of 150 barrels of oi| per day and 75O mi||ion cubic 
feet 
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 
30O,O00 
barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for 
gas. 
The average we|| in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 50O barre|s of 
oil 
per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, 
the company intends to dril| up to 4 more wel|s on these land sections.  
For more detai|ed information on this project p|ease see news re|ease 
dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.  An announcement wi|| be made immediate|y upon
