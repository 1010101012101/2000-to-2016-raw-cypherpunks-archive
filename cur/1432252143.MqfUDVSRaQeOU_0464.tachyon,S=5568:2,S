Ah.

Well, again no argument here. As for Asians in America, let's just say I can 
be considered an expert on that subject. No doubt the difference in success 
rate between Asians (and not just Asian Americans, but fresh-off-the-boat 
Chinese or Vietnamese) and blacks has become conspicuous in recent years, 
and I agree says a lot about what ISN'T being done, or taken advantage of in 
the US by some groups.

And until the Liberatarian utopia you speak of comes to pass, I still have 
the naivety to attempt discussing what kind of system (and realistically 
reachable from today's world) might actually lift as many blacks and white 
trailer trash out of their ghettos (in whatever form) and back into the 
workforce...

I'd argue that this isn't statist per se, as the state will continue to 
exist for at least a little while longer. Of course, it might be argued that 
any attempt at reforming the state is inherently statist, but I'm not 
convinced that a cataclysmic meltdown is necessary. It seems to me only 
reasonable to attempt to make things better, while the inevitable unfolds, 
if it will.

Which brings me to a sideswipe at the vehement anti-statists on the 
board...if something like crypto-anarchy is ultimately inevitable, then why 
bother "outing" the statists? Instead, to further the anti-state goals, it 
might actually be far more expedient to encourage said statists in their use 
and proliferation of strong crypto, thereby speeding the inevitable through 
the very same vectors that seek to delay it.

Meanwhile, why not at least try to match the social 1st and 2nd derivatives 
so to as minimize the bloodbath that could occur if things unfolded badly? 
Call this back-handed optimism if you will.
