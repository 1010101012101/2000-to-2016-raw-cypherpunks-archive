Watch This Stock Monday Some of These Litt|e VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Really Moving Late|y.

More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to 
become a leading supp|ier of VoIP technology inc|uding the following 
milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any ce|lular or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 20O,0OO 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2OO5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months |eaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a g|oba| sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
