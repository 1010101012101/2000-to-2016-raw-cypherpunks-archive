Gone in 20 Minutes: using laptops to steal cars


High-tech thieves are becoming increasingly savvy when it comes to stealing
automobiles equipped with keyless entry and ignition systems. While many
computer-based security systems on automobiles require some type of key -
mechanical or otherwise - to start the engine, so-called 'keyless' setups
require only the presence of a key fob to start the engine.

The expert gang suspected of stealing two of David Beckham's BMW X5 SUVs in
the last six months did so by using software programs on a laptop to
wirelessly break into the car's computer, open the doors, and start the
engine.

"It's difficult to steal cars with complex security, but not impossible.
There are weaknesses in any system," Tim Hart of the Auto Locksmith
Association told the U.K.'s Auto Express magazine. "At key steps the car's
software can halt progress for up to 20 minutes as part of its in-built
protection," said Hart.

Because the decryption process can take a while - up to 20 minutes,
according to Hart - the thieves usually wait to find the car in a secluded
area where it will be left for a long period. That is believed to be what
happened to Mr. Beckham - the crooks followed him to the mall where he was
to have lunch, and went to work on his X5 after it was parked.

While automakers and locksmiths are supposed to be the only groups that
know where and how security information is stored in a car, the information
eventually falls into the wrong hands.

According to the Prague Post leaving such information on a laptop is what
got Radko Soucek caught for stealing several cars. "You could delete all
the data from your laptop, but that's not good for you because the more
data you have, the bigger your possibilities," he says. He says any car
that relies on software to provide security can be circumvented by other
software. "Every car has its weak spot," he says. Soucek faces up to 12
years in prison.

The Leftlane Perspective: Many modern cars now rely on software entirely
for security. Gone are the days where microchips supplemented mechanical
locks as an additional security measure. In the case of true 'keyless'
systems, software is the only thing between a thief and your car. As
computers become more powerful, will stealing cars become even easier?
Never mind future cars with better security - what about today's cars a few
years down the road? With cars as inexpensive as the Toyota Camry offering
entirely keyless systems, these concerns a relevant to all consumers.
