When you've built a tolerance and don't fall out in a nod, opiates can be extremely stimulating .... I've had 8 hour bouts of creativity from opiate high more times than I can count, hacking code, pursuing intellectual interests, etc.... Of course the caveat here is the looming threat of addiction.

Then again, methamphetamine will give a similar stimulating experience, even more focused, for 24 hours+.... but the accompanying crash is awful IMO, and it sometimes gives me unwanted anxiety.

I stick to marijuana these days. ;)
