A Unique Delayed Messaging Service! (Find out more at http://www.ThingsUnsaid.com)

All of us have messages to be delivered, instructions to be given, hiding places 
to be told, secrets to be made public, statements to be made. In short, all of 
us have "things unsaid" for our spouse, parents, offspring, loved ones, friends, 
bosses, co-workers, subordinates, neighbors, childhood sweetheart, yes; even 
our enemies! It is now possible to send these messages whenever one wants to 
and to whom one wants to.  Details at http://www.ThingsUnsaid.com

In compliance with Federal legislation H.R.4176 - SECTION 101Paragraph(e)(1)(A)) 
AND Bill s.1618 TITLE III passed by the 105th U.S. Congress. 

Further transmissions may be stopped at no cost to you by replying to this message 
with the word "REMOVE" in the subject line.
