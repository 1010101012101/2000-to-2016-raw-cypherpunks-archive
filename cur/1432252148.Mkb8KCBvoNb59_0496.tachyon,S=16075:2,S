Sounds like we need new terms for a high latency network that is a low
latency network or a low latency network that is a high latency network?

Perhaps store-and-forward versus stateful?

<br>
Dissentr<br>
A High-Latency Overlay Mix Network<br>
<br>
Essentially, Dissentr is a security-minded network, inspired by Tor, with a=
 few important characteristics which serve to differentiate it.<br>
<br>
High-Latency<br>
<br>
Tor is a low-latency network. This makes it ideal for real time activities =
like web browsing, but as a result, opens it up to attacks involving large-=
scale traffic analysis methods known as end-to-end correlation. In these at=
tacks, an adversary with the ability to analyze massive amounts of traffic =
in a short period of time is able to match up traffic entering the network =
with the corresponding traffic which will inevitably soon exit it.<br>



<br>
Dissentr manages to protect against these sorts of attacks by being enginee=
red as a high-latency network. Assuming any given node has not been comprom=
ised, that node will intentionally hold off on forwarding its traffic to th=
e next node in the network until it is able to forward a large amount of da=
ta in bulk, rendering the aforementioned end-to-end correlation far less fe=
asible. For an excellent discussion on this attack, and possible countermea=
sures, see Practical Traffic Analysis: Extending and Resisting Statistical =
Disclosure.<br>



<br>
Cascades<br>
<br>
Much like any mix network, Dissentr models its network as a graph of nodes,=
 each responsible for handling the relay of traffic as it moves along some =
path through the network. Where Dissentr differs from a network such as Tor=
 is in how this path is constructed. In Dissentr, the network is constructe=
d out of cascades (A term I first heard described by Ian Goldberg, but I&#3=
9;ve been unable to pin down an original source for): essentially directed,=
 acyclic sub-graphs, in which a node defines a set of &quot;trusted&quot; n=
odes, through which they are willing to relay traffic through. Dissentr sim=
plifies this model by only allowing for nodes of out-degree 1, at this time=
. This construction brings about a number of useful results:<br>



<br>
In the event that a node is known to be compromised, individual nodes are a=
llowed the ability to either remove themselves from a cascade, or bypass un=
trusted nodes entirely, without the necessity of a trusted third-party.<br>



The network is protected from &quot;supernode invasions,&quot; in which an =
attacker floods the network with compromised nodes, in the hopes of either =
endangering the network&#39;s health, or placing the security of users pass=
ing through their nodes at risk of traffic interception, and subsequent ana=
lysis. This can be guaranteed because cascades are constructed by virtue of=
 a measure of trust between node-operators, and so long as there exists som=
e non-zero subset of trusted operators, they retain the ability to form a c=
ascade of their own, effectively shutting out the efforts of such an attack=
er.<br>



Use-Cases<br>
<br>
As mentioned previously, the high-latency nature of the network causes a sh=
ift in the sorts of activities best facilitated by its use, however, there =
do exist some unique opportunities which I have neither seen implemented in=
 the context of a mix network, nor discussed in the literature.<br>



<br>
A personal favourite idea revolves around creating a platform for political=
 blogging, which, assuming a noisy enough network, would offer political di=
ssidents the ability to freely write about issues of corruption or governme=
nt abuse, without many of the risks associated with using a lower-latency n=
etwork like Tor. If it takes a week for a blog post to appear in circulatio=
n after the author posts it to the network, it becomes magnitudes more diff=
icult for any assailant to</blockquote>
