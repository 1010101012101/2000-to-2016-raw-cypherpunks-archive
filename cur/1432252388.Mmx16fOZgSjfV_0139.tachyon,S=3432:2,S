Your generation was never libertarian. Libertine, yes, but not 
libertarian.

Antiwar during Vietnam, yes, but not libertarian.

Or have you forgotten the support by the college crowd, circa 1966-80, 
for statist policies like "affirmative action" and "welfare"?

I was in college during some of those years, 1970-74, and can assure 
you that most of the kids around me were very, very far from being 
libertarian. Yeah, they like free sex and cheap pot, and so on, but 
they favored "government that works!," and they flocked to lefties like 
Bobby Kennedy, Gene McCarthy, and even Hubert Humphrey. They saw high 
tax rates as punishment for capitalists.

Angela Davis was their hero, Cuba their idea of a just society.

"Eat the rich!" came out of that era.

So, with a few exceptions, that generation was socialist and communist, 
not libertarian. Hence the better question is this:

"How did we go from socialists to fascists?"

And the answer is obvious: "You were always there."
