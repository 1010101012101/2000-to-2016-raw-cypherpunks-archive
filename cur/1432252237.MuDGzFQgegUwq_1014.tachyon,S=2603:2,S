The population may very well increase, and the true value of physical 
collateral may indeed go to zero (how much is that big circa-2006 flat 
panel and that big luxury SUV wih a chevy truck under the body pieces 
actually worth ?)

But that does not mean that the average reputation will be worth anything, 
or that physical goods (of substance) are worthless.  It just means that a 
lot of people are poor.

Or a no-knock raid is quickly ramped up.  A reputation can be "about to 
blow" in all kinds of ways.
