Right.  All the "content-for-pay" artists now have to compete 
against all the unpaid amateurs who are webpublishing because 
webpublishing is easy and nearly free.  

Unless they can provide content that is absolutely above and 
beyond what the amateurs can do technologically and artistically, 
they are going to discover that there is no paying market for 
their stuff.

Right.  And that's when they learn something they did was expensive 
and not to do that again.  As long as the web agent can keep it under 
the budgeted amount, a few mistakes (and even a few scams) can be 
tolerated.  The race would be between people trying to build smarter 
web agents (popping up and saying, "Hey boss, this link's always been 
free before, but now it costs a buck -- are you sure you want to go 
there?") and finding more subtle ways to try and rip them off. 

Beyond a certain level of subtlety, ripping people off is known as 
"marketing," and considered a non-problem.

Absolutely.  There are angles for grifters and cons to exploit in 
every market where money changes hands.
