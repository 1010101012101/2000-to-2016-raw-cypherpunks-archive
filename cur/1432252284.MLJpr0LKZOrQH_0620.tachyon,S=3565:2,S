there are similiar examples, mostly with ancient languages - if they
still exist (roman/italian or ancient/modern greek/hebrew) they are
often virtually identical in written form, but very different when
spoken.
of course, there's also the question of how much we really know about
the ancient pronounciation.

the most interesting point about the hopi grammar is, that it takes the
observer into the picture. AFAIK, there can be no confusion in hopi
about whether something happened to you, or you imagined it happening,
or you saw it happening to someone else, or someone else saw it
happening to a third person. in english these are all 
"he killed (me, for real)"
"he killed (me, in my dream)"
"he killed (someone else)"
"he killed (fred told me)"
