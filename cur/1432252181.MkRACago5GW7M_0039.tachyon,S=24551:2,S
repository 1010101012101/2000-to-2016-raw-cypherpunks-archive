          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          July 27, 2001
                WINK PROSPECT DEVONIAN PRODUCTION TESTING

          Touchstone Resources USA, Inc. is pleased to
          announce that the Wink prospect, Morton/Halley
          23/24#1, which is located in Winkler County, Texas,
          is currently being evaluated by open-hole testing in
          the Devonian formation at approximately 14,000 feet.
          The Morton/Halley 23/24#1 was drilled to a total
          depth of 17,636 feet. After evaluating the deeper
          Ellenburger formation, the Company has commenced a
          plug-back operation to the Devonian. The Devonian
          was open-hole drilled drill-stem tested by
          Schlumberger at a calculated rate of 2,400 barrels
          of oil per a day (“BOPD”). A production facility has
          already been installed at this location and
          production is scheduled to start on August 1, 2001.

          Wes Franklin, Executive Vice President for
          Touchstone Resources, states “The Company is very
          excited with this discovery in the Devonian. This is
          a very significant “high impact” discovery, which
          enhances the real value of our development in the
          Wink prospect. The size of this discovery could be
          quite large by today’s on-shore U.S. standards. We
          anticipate continued success in other wells in this
          region.” Mr. Franklin further states, “The Morton 23
          #3 is drilling over 10,000 feet on its way to a
          proposed total depth of 15,000 feet. The well is a
          Devonian delineation/development well down-dipped
          from the Morton/Halley 23/24 #1 and will provide an
          indication of the size of the Devonian reservoir.”

          The Company is also pleased to announce that an
          additional field discovery has been made at the Wink
          project. The Morton 11 #2 was deepened to 11,000
          feet and is currently testing the Devonian chert at
          approximately 10,700 feet. Mr. Franklin added, “the
          Devonian here is in a separate fault block 2 miles
          north of the Morton/Halley 23/24 #1, which is
          testing the same formation 3,000 feet deeper. The
          Morton 11 #2 well has tested at a daily rate of 1.2
          million cubic feet of gas per day (“MMCFGPD”) and 4
          BOPD. Following bottom hole pressure testing, the
          well will be placed on production immediately.”

          The Canadian Venture Exchange has not reviewed and
          does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or
          accuracy of this release.
