The fact that a given person is using the remailer network is not a
secret.  At least one remailer finds out every time he sends a message.
The point is, the entry from the non-anonymous to the anonymous world
is a vulnerability.

You are not stating their claims accurately.  ZKS does indeed have
information about who is using it at any given time, if they operate any
of the servers.  Or at least the server operators can tell.  Each user
sets up a route through a chain of servers, and any given server knows
exactly who is using it as the initial connection into the network.
Again, the entry from non-anonymous into anonymous networks is visible.

No, but the fact that Alice transfered a certain amount of funds into
the anonymous bank is visible to at least some observers.  Once again,
the point is that as you enter the anonymous world your entry is visible.

Compare this with the original claim: "in a properly designed anonymity
system the users will be, well, anonymous, and it should be impossible
to tell any more about them than that they pay their bills on time."
These examples illustrate the falsehood of this claim.  Much more
is learned about the customers as they enter the anonymous system.

Not everyone will agree with every specific case.  But given our common
philosophical heritage, list members can come to agreement with regard
to most examples.  The test is simple, whether these individuals advance
the causes we support.

As long as you're listing examples, what do you think about Osama bin
Laden?  Would you support efforts to market crypto technology to Islamic
religious extremists?

The great thing about bin Laden as an example is that we can see
exactly what the consequences will be when he succeeds.  With McVeigh,
nobody knows for sure.  But chances are it would be much the same if
the militias achieved their goals: installation of a religious state.
Supporting these people means helping bring about another Afghanistan,
maybe right here at home next time.

An additional point: if you were truly unconcerned with moral issues,
you would have no objection to seeing discussion here about how we can
use computer technology to promote government power and control.

We'll see.  If you support increasing government power, then you are
correct.
