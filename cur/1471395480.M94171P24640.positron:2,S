THANK you!!

"Global warming" gets bandied around as though it is "scientific" or
even more ridiculously "accepted science".

And another thing !! <waves old wooden walking sticdk> it was always
called Global Warming, except then it got called Global Anthropogenic
Temperature Changes, except then it got called Global Climate Change,
except before in the 60s or 70s (dang, I can't remember which) it was
called Global Cooling - front page Time Magazine articles an all. Take
THAT yung whipperyschapperies!

Dang Global Scientific Marketers just can't decide which terms to even
use - that sure gave me confidence in their certinty!
