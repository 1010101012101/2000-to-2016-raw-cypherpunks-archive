I figured it would be something of that nature.. hence the math library I 
was working on.. :)

Ah.. I have implemented a sieve of eros..whatever his name is.. ;)  for 
finding smaller primes.. it runs very fast, the old rules don't apply so 
much anymore, memory footprint being more a concern then speed I've noticed 
so far.. moving the found primes into a sparse array as you find them and 
then reusing the memory is one way around that.. even my quickly written 
implementation takes negligible time to find all the primes within 16 
bits.. but I've been looking at rabin-miller and some other methods as 
well.  I'll take a look at that link, thanks.. reason again for the math 
library.. my stuff (obviously) falls apart > 32bits since my library for 
handling larger numbers is unfinished.

Ah cool.. I've heard very good things about GMP and had been thinking about 
ways to implement it.. could solve all my problems in one fell swoop. :)  I 
(for reasons that should be obvious) felt that writing the routines myself 
(with extensive testing) would be preferable, so I could avoid licensing 
issues as well as bugs/backdoors, but I'll look into this..  Thanks for the 
quick response.. the application will of course be available to anyone who 
wants it once finished.. and once Borland finishes Kylix, should compile 
nicely on the various x86 *nixes out there..
