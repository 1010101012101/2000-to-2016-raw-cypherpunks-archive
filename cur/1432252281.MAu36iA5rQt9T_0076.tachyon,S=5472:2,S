I appreciate her concern. No, I'm not being flip, I genuinely mean that.

I would, however, expect her to understand that it is both unfounded and 
counterproductive, given her overweening concern for discretion. I 
seriously doubt she's any kind of Federal agent, but she might as well 
be a Fedtroll. She's playing into her own fears here, and a lot of you 
are contaging. Don't be such wussies. As for her, if she wishes to be 
consistent with her professed intent, she should change her tack. From 
Irving Stone to Ibsen, maybe. As in, say, "Hedda Gabler".

If you can't see what she's probably being disengenous about, then, boy 
are you some kind of nimrod.
