Official: Implant chips into offenders
http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050329/NEWS01/5032903

While [Butler County, Commissioner Michael] Fox earlier had suggested the
use of electronic ankle or wrist bracelets to allow for passive monitoring
of offenders, on Monday he took the proposal a step further, calling for a
plan of implanting computer microchips into offenders so that they can be
tracked and located immediately.

"People have these GPS chips put in their pets and - in some case - in their
children, in the event they are lost or kidnapped," Fox said. "I don't see
why the same can't be done with probationees."

False Hopes for Implants in Criminals
By Sherrie Gossett  |  April 22, 2005
http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/3066_0_2_0_C/

The editorial was right when it stated such implantation raises serious
legal, ethical and civil rights questions. But first it raises questions of
factual accuracy. Why? Because there are no commercially available GPS
implants in existence. The Florida company, Applied Digital Solutions (ADS),
announced in December of 1999 that it had acquired the patent for a
syringe-injectable GPS implant that was powered by muscle movement and could
be remotely monitored. The location and movements of the host could be
stored in a database for future reference, the company said. ADS recommended
use of the technology for tracking felons and prisoners.

But it is now over five years since ADS made that announcement and they have
yet to produce any proof of such a device.
