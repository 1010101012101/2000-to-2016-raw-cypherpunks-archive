Curious article about some cell phone snooping during the capture of the
Texas 7. Not enough details to figure it out, but it seems they were setup
at the roadblock to intecept cell calls.

<http://www.dallasnews.com/metro/270831_main_25met.ART.html>

What is the law on this? I thought they need a court order, and then it was
only good for the specific number(s) only, and had to go through the telco
switch. Didn't know they could just capture every number from a specific
cell site or location. Article implies they had their own little black box
at the site that recorded all calls at that location.
