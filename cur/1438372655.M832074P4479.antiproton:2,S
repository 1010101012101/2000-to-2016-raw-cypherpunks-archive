I agree with that. =C2=A0I think it's better that we get 50% of the populat=
ion to use encrypted phones, where the encryption isn't truly known to be p=
erfect, than to get 1% of the population to use perfect encryption. =C2=A0V=
erifying the last little bit of doubt is going to cost a rather large amoun=
t of money. =C2=A0Raising the demand for crypto phones to 50% represents a =
huge market, which will be satisfied, and the profits for that market will =
pay for the next generation of closer-to-perfect phones.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
