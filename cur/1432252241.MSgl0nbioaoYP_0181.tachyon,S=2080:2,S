Yes, I know the common definition.

But, like I said, I was told by someone who claimed to know better,
and, thinking about it, I think he's right.

Since some people, like Peter, hypothesize that it's an extreme
example of evaporation and not sublimation, :-), I'm going to go poke
my nephew the chemistry student and see if I can get a pointer to an
authoritative explanation.

How's that?

Cheers,
