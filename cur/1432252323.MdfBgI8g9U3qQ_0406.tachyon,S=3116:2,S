That would be even more satisfying, here - building blueprints have to be
turned over to the city building office regardless of whether the building
is public or not. I.e., there exists a central database in every town
mapping out - at best in millimetre accuracy, thanks to GPS - its
layout. I've always thought that realizing such a map would be a fun
exercise in 3D coding, especially if applied online...
