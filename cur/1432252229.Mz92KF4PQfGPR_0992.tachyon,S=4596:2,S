Or because "information wants to be free" (*) and _someone_ will make 
the songs or images or whatever available for absolutely nothing. 
Good examples of this are Napster, of course, and the 
alt.binaries.erotica.* Usenet newsgroups.

(* I never particularly liked the "information wants to be free" 
slogan, for various reasons. See the archives for discussions.)

Probably not even then. Unless the Net is heavily censored and 
encryption is banned, there are just too many "degrees of freedom" 
for the above-mentioned "information wants to be free" point to be 
invalidated. The cases of Mojo, Gnutella, Freenet, and free versions 
of Napster make this point.

(Though the automated thievery, er, "sharing," of Napster made it 
trivial to install for even 6th graders, and thus led to the tens of 
millions of users, it is likely that future systems will still be 
used by many even if not so easy to "click and steal.")
