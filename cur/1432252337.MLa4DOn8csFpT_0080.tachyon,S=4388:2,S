The Mexico Federal Police parade their drones:

Worth remembering that a contingent of the Mexico Federal Police (FP)  
ambushed an American embassy vehicle carrying two CIA operatives a few  
weeks ago.  It's been suggested that the FP are well infiltrated by the  
drug cartels:

Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus Co-Chair Henry Cuellar (D-TX)  
suggested "using UAS to help Mexico fight drug cartels" at the  
Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus Technology & Science Fair this past 
week:

Congressman Cuellar's brother happens to be the Sheriff of Laredo, which  
is situated on the Texas border with Mexico.  The Cuellars hosted a  
demonstration of the Vanguard Defense Industries Shadowhawk in July.

Montgomery County-based Vanguard is the only company I've observed that is 
actively working on a less-lethal weapons package for domestic use of  
their drone.  That came to light after Montgomery County Sheriffs acquired 
a $300K Shadowhawk through a federal grant.  According to the Texas 
Observer article, the name of that grant program is Operation Stonegarden 
(OPSG).
http://www.fema.gov/fy-2012-homeland-security-grant-program#3

OPSG is funded to the tune of $46M in FY2012, down from $60M in 2009, and 
is part of the $831M FY2012 Homeland Security Grant Program:
