Orange County is taking what some civil libertarians 
consider troubling steps to keep tabs on released sex 
offenders, giving them periodic lie detector tests and, starting 
next year, requiring some to wear wristbands linked to 
satellite tracking systems.

The county will become the first in the state, and one of only 
a dozen or so nationwide, to track sex offenders on parole 
and probation with global positioning satellites, which allow 
officials to pinpoint offenders' locations around the clock.
