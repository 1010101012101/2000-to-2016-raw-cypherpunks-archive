You could say playing games is what politicians do. But not playing the
games means you get no game. Assange does explicitly, publicly and
knowingly play games. He knows they work. Had all the documents been
published unedited there would be a single headline in every newspaper.

Now there's thousands. Every week it's hammered upon. We see people
claiming "Oh, see, the NSA said something to make it okay, and I think it
actually is!" only to be stomped by the next headline showing it was
definitely not okay. This releasing scheme is a very, very good match for
the current journalistic reality.

Given Assange seems to be pretty well on the side of civil liberty, freedom
and power, I think he's doing a rather good job.
