Been at the doctor last week and just because I was bored b waiting scan
showed me that his wiifi for patients is shared with is laptop where
medial records are stored and only barrier is WEP.

In one pub I have been all payments transactions are processed through
PC with Windows connected to same net as unencrypted free wiifi
hotspot... everybody with smartphone/notebook and netmap and wireshark
can just read.

Fact is that security by obscurity still does work and again it is
double edged sword. In case you will want to have educated masses to
understand technology in the way they understand how vulnerable they are
at that same moment you will find how vulnerable is whole society. It is
probably good idea that normal people do not think about how easy is to
break this glass to just go into somebody house...

Do not be evil is basic rule here. How many sysadmins/sysops have root
password to whatever we are doing? To all of our identities and our
traces. Who of you can download half of today human knowhow just by one
smarter script... imho most of us.

And here we are technological leaders who decided not to fraud and
destroy. This is long time know story about good and about bad.
Common sense here seems like: ok we are good and gov is bad. Partially
agree because gov tend to be bunch of criminals after all [with more or
less visible motives].

Where this idea is heeding? Hard to say, it is not complete yet. But
open source is as important as never before after somebody decided we
are suppose to pay for copyright. Cryptography is more or less public
know how between at least some part of educated people. Kids in pubs are
talking about quality of encrypton of software they have in their smart
devices...

It is not self sustaining system nor gov or criminals are. It is about
work to be done after all. But I tend to be optimistic.
