Yes, VPNs will provide as much privacy as Tor does for purely local
adversaries. But if your adversary can get logs from the VPN server, or
the hosting provider, you're screwed. With Tor, such adversaries would
need to get logs from at least two of the three relays in circuits. And
circuits change frequently, so that means lots of relays.

And sure, you can nest VPNs. So a nested chain of three VPNs arguably
does as much as a Tor circuit. But it's static. Or at least, I haven't
figured out how to automate switching. And there's also the matter of
paying for a bunch of VPNs.

Anyway, I hedge my bets by accessing Tor through nested VPNs.

Right. I2P also runs on Java.

Well, that's cool, if it works for you. Doesn't work for me, however.

You have a point. But far too many people do seem to believe that
they're anonymous on the Internet.
