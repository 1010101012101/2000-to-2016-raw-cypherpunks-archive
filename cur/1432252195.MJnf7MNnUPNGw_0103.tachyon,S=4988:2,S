I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are
intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so
will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI
certificate, and for the most part they just do not.

In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce
administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly
act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user
training required.  The simulated thingness created by
cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as
physical thingness of the card.

Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now
imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get
into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer
to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard,
one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike
character of the card sustains the coin like character of
Chaumian tokens.

Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart
card, then the administration problem reappears.

USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug
them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go
where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
interface?

Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to
the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet
solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle
the masses.
