seems someone put AP into action - and it worked quite well, exactly as
jim predicted, and even without crypto (though without rewards either).

see

http://slashdot.org/yro/01/03/28/2130219.shtml


in short: an anti-abortionist website published names and addresses of
doctors who made abortions, then cheered whenever one of them was
killed.
circuit judge wrote: "[...] if their [works] merely encouraged
unrelated terrorists, then their words are protected by the First
Amendment."

I wonder if he'd had the same if the website had listed targets from
the political arena. or judges.
