Yup.  He killed millions of Jews.  Killing millions of Jews is pretty
fucking bad.  Therefore, they would have to be doing something REALLY
BAD to warrant killing them.  Like, I guess if having millions of Jews
around would mean the end of the universe, then yeah, he'd be
justified in killing them.

In any case, were the Jews causing any pain in Europe?  No.  Hitler
was a dumbass, and if he can't prove that they are causing ENOURMOUS
pain, then he is acting immorally.

I don't think your Hitler example applies, because he could not prove
that the Jews were causing pain.  In any case, my formulation of act
utilitarianism seems to suffer from those sorts of attacks less than
the normal formulation, and I have yet to find a moral theory as
coherant as utilitarianism.
