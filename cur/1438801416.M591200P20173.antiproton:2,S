its religious thought to even utilize the word 'evil' let alone think in
those terms and religious thought is a capitalist parasite >>> read
nietzsche for fuck sake he wrote in the 1800's

one of my arguments is that it is structurally unsound to rely on one
method >>> especially if built by your enemy - i look to nature as other
thinkers do/have and i think about buckminster fuller - his analysis of
panther dna making them vulnerable to extinction because it is all so/too
similar ... in any given situation i do not think in terms of one solution
... i have used this analogy before ... sperm: there are lots of them in
one load ... they all race to get to the egg sure but, they actually help
each other to penetrate - they dont care who gets in as long as one of them
transforms the egg into a being (i mean i cant really speak for sperms in
general but it has been analysed like this)... thats their job ...they even
have been seen to help each other non-competative like :: this is the kind
of structures we need moreso not monolithic structures that blind us ...
its really a geometry problem for me... math

but also it is all ethical to me as well : if my family was murdered by a
fucker i wouldnt go and use that fuckers infrastructure cause they made it
for me to use and sent some other fuckers around the globe selling it cause
like the fucker murdered my family i wont support them in any way ever
....why would i talk myself into supporting the murderer of my family when
i could think about, invent or utilize other methods - its just really not
logical
