The Siemens phone looks like a good bet, but have you looked into the
possibility of purchasing your very own NSA-approved Little White Van?
No? Ah well, here it is anyway...LOL


Mobile Tactical Cellular and Data Communications System
http://www.wheatintl.com/sp/taccell.html

TacCell provides a rolling cellular site with advanced data communications,
video conferencing and worldwide cellular communications. Designed for military
and crisis communications. 

Features:

* Small Size 
* Fits in commercial van or HMMWV 
* Fly away package can be transported on two airlift pallets 
* Sets up quickly (15-20 minutes) 
* Flexible configurations
* Powered by small 3 to 5 KW generator (included in package) 
* All commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components supplied by a Strategic
  Alliance of Industry Leaders 

Flexibility and Expansion:

* mercury capable (H.320 compatible) 
* Internet or intranet connectivity via router 
* NSA approved cellular encryption - cell phone to cell phone, cell phone to
  desktop 
* Deployable packaging or vehicular fixed mounting 
* Varying numbers of cell phones can be supported 
* External connectivity via satellite. microwave or local P.S.T.N. 
* Variable height retractable cell system antenna 
* Selectable frequencies minimize interference 
* Optional AirCell in-flight communications system available 
* Provides an interface for Tactical radios & conference calling 
* Can include ATM switches and bulk encryption using KIV-7 
* Can accommodate any brand of industry standard cellular telephone (TIA 553) 
* Higher power amplifier available for extended cell range 
* Individual cell sites can be linked to form multi-cell architecture 
* Transportability ideal for telemedicine applications and world wide disaster
  support 
* System can be modified by technology insertion. Entire system is plug and play

Using AMPS technology TacCell provides a compact, deployable, mobile cell site
which can field four to 44 channels. The modular system is easily expandable to
accommodate up to 2000 subscribers. 

TacCell has a digital output/interface allowing direct connection to both Basic
and Primary Rate Interface equipment for use in ISDN telephone systems. Up to
four mobile cell sites may be networked from a single switch to form an entire
mobile cell site architecture. The mobile cell system provides multiple options
to accommodate satellite modem connections or interface with local digital or
foreign telephone carriers.

An exciting new development with the Wireless Telephone System is the inclusion
of AirCell's aviation telephone allowing cellular communications at extended
ranges in the air. Communications between aircraft and ground are accomplished,
as are connections to any phone worldwide via TacCell.
