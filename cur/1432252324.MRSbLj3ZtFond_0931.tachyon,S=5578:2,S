One you forgot, didn't know about is 'distributed file systems' ala the 9P
(From Plan 9) name space. The two primary factors are that the files are
not stored in a solid block and that each component or piece is stored in
multiple places. Two further considerations are that the pieces not be
stored in plaintext (and the decryption keys are kept elsewhere) and that
the individual servers not be aware of 'where or who' they are.

Fortunately there are 9P clients for OS'es other than Plan 9.
