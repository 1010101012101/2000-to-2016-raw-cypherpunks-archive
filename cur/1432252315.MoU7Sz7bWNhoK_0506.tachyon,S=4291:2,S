No, actually, you probably came out about $1.60 ahead.

"Farebox recovery" -- the amount of a transit system's expenses that are
covered by direct rider payments -- tends about 30% - 40% of expenses.
This varies widely, a sparsely-attended rural service might rate 10%
returns, typical suburban service 15-20%, a well-served metro transit
system might come as high as 50-55%.

You're also neglecting the possibility that the fare might not have been
a whole cow, but just cost you an arm and a leg.

Peace.
