According to the web page http://www.outguess.org/  it offers a lot better 
than that.  Supposedly the spooks cannot detect the presence of a secret 
message unless they have the key, or the original unaltered jpg.

Of course, to be secure, you have to generate lots of original images, so 
that the spooks have no original to compare wiht, preferably somewhat noisy 
original images.  A sports site is ideal for this, particularly photos of 
sports being played in the rain.
