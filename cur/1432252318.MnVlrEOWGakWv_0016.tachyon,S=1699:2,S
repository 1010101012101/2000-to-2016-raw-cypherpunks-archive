Tired of that old klunky Minox B Spy Camera?
Want something newer, smaller, and more versatile?
Need a speaking-engagement bribe for David Brin?
Looks like there's finally something to do the job
(or will be once they actually ship the things in commercial volume
around May and not just review copies for magazines...)

The Philips Key109 Key Ring Camcorder is a USB frob with
128MB of RAM, 2 megapixel camera for videos or stills,
MP3 player, headphone jack, and remote control.
I'm surprised they didn't give it more RAM,
but perhaps they got into price problems.
The user interface is apparently all in the remote control part,
which is a bit odd but may be useful for some things.
