this is one approach, "zero knowledge" mixes.

there are interesting research avenues around low latency traffic
analysis resistant techniques. they're more complicated, of course,
and in fact it is this complexity to blame rather than any conspiracy.

effective cover traffic for zero knowledge mix is significant. this is
because to be effective in a traditional mix produces bandwidth
explosion among participants.

i challenge you to show an effective mix protocol without this
bandwidth explosion that also does not introduce a break in guarantee
of anonymity.

wrong. I2P does not provide traffic analysis resistance, nor defense
against active attacker.

wrong.  "way better" way too generous. this is just wrong.

part of the problem is that active attacks and traffic analysis are so
hugely effective. the defense of "adding some torrents" is misguided
wishful thinking.

again, more complicated. not just technical but legal.

Tor research continues. however, solving low latency traffic analysis
resistant anonymity is much harder than just "implement cover
traffic"!

in fact, you need to solve half a dozen hard problems at once,
including how to define an appropriate level of cover traffic over
selected links.
