Yes, please humor me.  I do so yearn to be entertained.

I would exclude one-time pads equal in length to the message.  I would
include all public key crypto, and all use of symmetric block ciphers
where an attacker given both the correct key and a wrong key could tell
which was which.

Let's assume the "technology" in box two can do big exponential searches
almost instantly.

While government secrets may be of little importance to you, governments
might very well be harmed if all those years worth of secure phone
conversations, faxes, and other communications stored in the archives of 
various intelligence agencies were suddenly decrypted en masse and made 
public.  

Consider the economic impact of SSL no longer hiding your credit card 
numbers from hackers, or ssh being no more secure than telnet.

The cost of having no secure communications without the parties meeting to 
exchange one-time pads generated by nuclear decay would run into the many 
billions.

Cough.
