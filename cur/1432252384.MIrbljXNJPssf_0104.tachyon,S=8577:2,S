You'll be disappointed to hear that recycling is largely irrelevant on 
the global scale, and was favoured by green parties as a policy only 
because it gets voters involved and makes them feel important to the 
solution. Same goes for changing to efficient lightbulbs; it's helpful, 
but practically negligible compared to your daily commute, your choice 
of diet, your insulation, etcetera.

In the end, industry, and the consumer products we buy from it that fuel 
its bad behaviour, is far worse for the environment than piffling things 
like bulbs and recycling. Buying less waste is better than segregating it.

What we need is energy decline, and what that means is travelling less, 
buying less, burning less. Our energy should come from nuclear, not 
coal. Our buildings shouldn't be made from concrete. Our diets should 
use less land; less meat, and higher yields (go-go-gmo!). Our products 
should last longer and do more (cf. Bunnie's concept of "heirloom 
laptops"), instead of doing less faster and then breaking and getting 
"recycled" by impoverished kids in bangladesh.

It's a totally systemic problem, and bullying people into just recycling 
makes them think that they've done their part, and the rest is up to the 
next worst person. They need to understand that shutting down the coal 
plant in their city would do more good all-round than if everyone in the 
city recycled everything they bought.
