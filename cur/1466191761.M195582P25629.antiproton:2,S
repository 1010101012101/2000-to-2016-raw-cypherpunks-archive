Meh, too childish...  It's becoming pretty boring!  :-/

Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.

The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)

I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.

A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/

Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.

Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/

I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D

Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P

Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D

She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)

Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P

Warm hugs and tender kisses!!!  Ah, thank you everybody!!!  I received some
lovely messages about helping homeless people and two donations, yay!!!  ;D

(No Tor t-shirts, but some hot blankets!  <3 )
