Yes.  The Jews knew what was happening which is why the rich, smart, and
/ or politically savvy got out early in the 30's.  Sure it may have
saved a few more lives, but prevented it, no.  Crypto won't hide your
ethnicity.  This is like arguing would widespread communications and
crypto in the US slave south have prevented black enslavement.  Sure the
underground railroad would have worked better, but your still black.
