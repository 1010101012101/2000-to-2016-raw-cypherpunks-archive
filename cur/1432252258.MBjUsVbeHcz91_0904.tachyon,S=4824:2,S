Just in time for Tuesday's election, Wired News has compiled a tech 
scorecard for the U.S. Senate.

The list sorted by last name:

Sorted by score:

Some interesting results: Democrats did well, nabbing the four top slots, 
and beating the Republicans 52 percent to 48 percent overall. But Joseph 
Lieberman, the Democratic VP hopeful, finished with just 38 percent, in the 
fifth-worst position.

Democrat Patrick Moyhihan did the best out of everyone, surprisingly. That 
was probably because he missed three votes -- on at least one he would 
probably have gone the wrong way -- but we scored on percentage of cast 
votes, not possible votes.
