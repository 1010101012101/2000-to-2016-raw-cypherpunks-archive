Call in sick and then stand at the window making funny faces at him and
when you get tired tell him to egress your property. If they don't leave
call the cops and report a tresspasser. A subpoena is not a search
warrant. Then at least you don't have to worry about them camping out on
your property. Also consider getting a dog. I prefer wolf hybrids because
they alert much quicker than 'domestic' dogs (there is no genetic
difference between that wolf and your chihuahua, sort of like Tims point 
about 'races'. Hell, we're all black under UV). They're not very good at
confrontational sorts of things however so the odds of them actually
biting anyone are pretty low.
