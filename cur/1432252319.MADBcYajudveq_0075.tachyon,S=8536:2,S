RSA-576 Factored

By Eric W. Weisstein

 December 5, 2003--On December 3, the day after the announcement of the
discovery of the largest known prime by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime
Search on December 2 (MathWorld headline news, December 2, 2003), a team at
the German Federal Agency for Information Technology Security (BIS)
announced the factorization of the 174-digit number
 1881 9881292060 7963838697 2394616504 3980716356 3379417382 7007633564
2298885971 5234665485 3190606065 0474304531 7388011303 3967161996
9232120573 4031879550 6569962213 0516875930 7650257059

 known as RSA-576.

 RSA numbers are composite numbers having exactly two prime factors (i.e.,
so-called semiprimes) that have been listed in the Factoring Challenge of
RSA Security..

 While composite numbers are defined as numbers that can be written as a
product of smaller numbers known as factors (for example, 6 = 2 x 3 is
composite with factors 2 and 3), prime numbers have no such decomposition
(for example, 7 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself). Prime
factors therefore represent a fundamental (and unique) decomposition of a
given positive integer. RSA numbers are special types of composite numbers
particularly chosen to be difficult to factor, and they are identified by
the number of digits they contain.

 While RSA-576 is a much smaller number than the 6,320,430-digit monster
Mersenne prime announced earlier this week, its factorization is
significant because of the curious property of numbers that proving or
disproving a number to be prime ("primality testing") seems to be much
easier than actually identifying the factors of a number ("prime
factorization"). Thus, while it is trivial to multiply two large numbers p
and q together, it can be extremely difficult to determine the factors if
only their product pq is given. With some ingenuity, this property can be
used to create practical and efficient encryption systems for electronic
data.

 RSA Laboratories sponsors the RSA Factoring Challenge to encourage
research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of
factoring large integers and also because it can be helpful for users of
the RSA encryption public-key cryptography algorithm for choosing suitable
key lengths for an appropriate level of security. A cash prize is awarded
to the first person to factor each challenge number.

 RSA numbers were originally spaced at intervals of 10 decimal digits
between one and five hundred digits, and prizes were awarded according to a
complicated formula. These original numbers were named according to the
number of decimal digits, so RSA-100 was a hundred-digit number. As
computers and algorithms became faster, the unfactored challenge numbers
were removed from the prize list and replaced with a set of numbers with
fixed cash prizes. At this point, the naming convention was also changed so
that the trailing number indicates the number of digits in the binary
representation of the number. Hence, RSA-576 has 576 binary digits, which
translates to 174 digits in decimal.

 RSA numbers received widespread attention when a 129-digit number known as
RSA-129 was used by R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman to publish one of
the first public-key messages together with a $100 reward for the message's
decryption (Gardner 1977). Despite widespread belief at the time that the
message encoded by RSA-129 would take millions of years to break, it was
factored in 1994 using a distributed computation that harnessed networked
computers spread around the globe performing a multiple polynomial
quadratic sieve (Leutwyler 1994). The result of all the concentrated number
crunching was decryption of the encoded message to yield the profound
plain-text message "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage." (An ossifrage
is a rare predatory vulture found in the mountains of Europe.)

 Factorization of RSA-129 followed earlier factorizations of RSA-100,
RSA-110, and RSA-120. The challenge numbers RSA-130, RSA-140, RSA-155, and
RSA-160 were also subsequently factored between 1996 and April of this
year. (Amusingly, RSA-150 apparently remains unfactored following its
withdrawal from the RSA Challenge list.)

 On December 2, Jens Franke circulated an email announcing factorization of
the smallest prize number RSA-576. The factorization was accomplished using
a prime factorization algorithm known as the general number field sieve.
The two 87-digit factors found using this sieve are
 3980750 8642406493 7397125500 5503864911 9906436234 2526708406 3851895759

2071125636 3590397527

 and can easily be multiplied to verify that they do indeed give the
original number.

 Franke's note detailed the factorization process in which "lattice"
sieving was done by J. Franke and T. Kleinjung using hardware at the
Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Institute at Bonn
University, Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in Bonn, and Experimental
Mathematics Institute in Essen; and "line" sieving was done by P.
Montgomery and H. te Riele at CWI, F. Bahr and his family, and NFSNET
(which at that time consisted of D. Leclair, P. Leyland, and R.
Wackerbarth). Post-processing of this data to construct the actual factors
was then done with the support of the BSI.

 For their efforts, the team will receive a cash prize of $10,000 from RSA
Security. However, award seekers need not be deterred. As the following
table shows, RSA-640 to RSA-2048 remain open, carrying awards from $20,000
to $200,000 to whoever is clever and persistent enough to track them down.
