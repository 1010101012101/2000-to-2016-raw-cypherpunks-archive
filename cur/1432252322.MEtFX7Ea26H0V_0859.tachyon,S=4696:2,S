[Court Ordered Fair Warning Notification]
 In keeping with a Court Order requiring
 me to notify recipients of my personal
 correspondence of any existing factors
 which would tend to implicate them as
 a suspect or accessory to any illegal
 or illicit actions on my part, simply
 as a result of overt association with
 me in any manner, recipients of this
 correspondence should be aware that 
 I am currently driving around with the
 body of Jimmy Hoffa in my trunk.
