Jim is appealing. He's off to the Supremes, as I wrote about in June, after 
the 9th Circuit dissed him:
http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,44567,00.html

Don't recall who's handling it; I'd have to see if I can dig up those 
papers (and I just had my office repainted, so it's a mess). Robert Leen 
may be, which would make for an interesting situation, since he'd 
presumably have to argue that he was an incompetent lawyer -- but I don't 
remember.
