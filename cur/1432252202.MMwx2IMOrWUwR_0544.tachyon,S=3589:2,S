	Not commenting on anything but the backfire thing:

	I've had several cars over the last since 1983 (when I 
started driving) that backfired at one time or another for various 
reasons--usually relating either to spark plugs not firing properly 
(broken plugs, wires, bad distributer wires going to the wrong plugs 
etc), vacuum problems, or just plain being a rolling disaster.

	It's *possible*.
