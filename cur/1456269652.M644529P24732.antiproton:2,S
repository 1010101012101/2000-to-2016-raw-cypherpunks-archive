This whole apple thing reeks of political spectacle. Nothing is
as it seems.. Is this really about that particular phone, or is
there some effort by one faction in the secret world to open 
the door and shed some light on the risks the law enforcement
Clipper Chip 2.0 crowd is going to put on national security?

Is there an FBI insider who carefully crafted the request to the
judge for maximum public political impact? Or was it a judge who
is fed up with one too many secret gag orders they can't discuss?

And what the hell's going on with the city, who happens to own 
the actual hardware. Why **this** phone? It's a perfect test case
to make the system explode from it's own contradictions.

In an election year, no less. Can you say "market volatility?"

The enemy of your enemy is sometimes worth collaborating with..
Do we have some public signals intelligence here from the
non-public folks that they don't like the FBI requesting the
crypto keys to the kingdom either?
