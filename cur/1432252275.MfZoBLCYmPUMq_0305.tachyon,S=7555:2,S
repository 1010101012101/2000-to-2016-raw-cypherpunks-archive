Reading the draft document provided by Asher, I find nowhere any
reference to this being a required activity for any ISP. Instead, it
talks mainly about how data flows between generalised entities (think
"devices").

So no, if ITU received a more governing role of the internet, that would
not _in itself_ lead to Y.2770 being a "required standard" to implement
for all ISPs (and I have no idea how this would happen anyway, given it
doesn't concern itself with specififying any actions for ISPs).

There are legitimate uses for DPI, though the examples cited in the
draft seems to be more about limiting BitTorrent traffic...

So basically, the standard is probably going to do mostly these things:
a) DPI equipment manufacturers can claim to be "standards compliant"
   which is a selling point in some circumstances
b) DPI might get more widely accepted as a technique. It is up to us and
   other hackers to make sure that censorship and traffic discrimination
   is not.
c) It might be slightly more easy for surveillance tech to interoperate
   between manufacturers, given that the main point of the standard is
   to suggest everyone output data and accept rules in a standard way.

To be frank, I have been trying to find out what the fuss has been about
regarding this standard and come up.. not blank, as it _is_ worrying
that ITU is spending time on this shit, but at least I haven't found
anything to inspire the absolutely massive shitstorm I have been seeing
in certain places (e.g. /.). Is it just because it's the ITU doing it
rather than, say, ISO or ANSI?

Best
