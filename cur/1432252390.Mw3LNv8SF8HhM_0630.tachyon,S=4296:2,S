====================

there's more to it than that. openPGP specifies SHA-1 (and nothing else)
as the hash used to generate key fingerprints, and is what key IDs are
derived from.

a real threat if this can be extended into a practical attack is
substituting a key with a *different* key having the same ID and
fingerprint. it would be difficult for average users (and impossible for
the current openPGP infrastructure) to tell bob's key from mallory's key
that claims to be bob's.

it can also be used (if the attack becomes practical) to forge key
signatures. mallory can create a bogus key and "sign" it with anyone's
real key. this would turn the web of trust into dust.

the openPGP spec seemed to have assumed that SHA-1 just wouldn't fail.
ever. this was the same mistake made in the original version of pgp that
relied on md5. the spec needs to allow a choice of hash algorithms for
fingerprints and key IDs, or else we'll play this game every time someone
breaks a strong hash algorithm.
