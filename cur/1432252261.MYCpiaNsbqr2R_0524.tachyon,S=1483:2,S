<snip "I should be free to smoke">
Actually I agree - you should be free to smoke all you want to; however,
given that
a) the rest of us don't want to share your smoke
b) you don't want to share the smoke you are paying for *with* us
the real problem is the inefficiencies of  your drug equipment - you really
should have some system so you get 100% of the smoke you paid for (rather
than less than 30% as now)
