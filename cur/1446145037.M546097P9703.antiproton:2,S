	That's unfounded TALK.

	That's more talk. And it's wrong talk too! Technology may be
	morally neutral, but it isn't 'neutral' in a general sense. 

	The current technology completly favors totalitarianism.

	I guess people with no arguments are unlikely to like a

	And the proof backing your baseless talk is...where? 

	Right! It's no-where to be found. 

	What you have is only...talk.
