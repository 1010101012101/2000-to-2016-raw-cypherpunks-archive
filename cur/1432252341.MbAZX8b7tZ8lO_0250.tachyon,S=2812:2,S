Sorry Major, I'm gonna have to call you on that one.  Yes, they are
lighting that fiber on COTS.  Likely on Nortel gear, which I can tell you
from personal experience requires an incredible amount of power, cooling,
and rackspace.

Totally different animal.  We are talking about lighting single mode fiber
and doing so for long distances: likely to standard 60-per-hop rule.  You
can't send light out that kind of distances without BIG power inputs:
lasers are not very efficient.
