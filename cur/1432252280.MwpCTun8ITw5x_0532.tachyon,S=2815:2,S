   Does anyone know where a copy of Jimmy Carter's statement yesterday can be
found? Tried a google and got a zillion hits. From the Washington Post's take,
it sounded quite interesting. Gee, Tim must be right, I must be a lefty if Jimmy
Carter is starting to sound good. 8-) And I've even decided that come the next
senate race in WI, I'm going to vote Dem for the first time in my life, at least
if Feingold is running.
