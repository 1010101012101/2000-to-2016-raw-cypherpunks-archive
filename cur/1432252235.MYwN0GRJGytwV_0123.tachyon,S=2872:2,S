Now the Western Washington District Court has removed
all TIFF images of court filings. Whether that is due to Judge
Jack's expanding his order forbidding public disclosure of 
discovery materials after we put a bunch of Jim's filings on 
the Net, or another counterterrorist ploy to censor Jim and 
his terrifying accusations, who knows.

No call back from Leen on my inquiry about being a witness
for Bell. Fuck him, bedwetting with the feds.

Remember, do not e-mail, telephone or visit me or you're
subject to subpoena. Same for tarred Declan, or anybody else 
pissants Choate and Leen are eager to CDR.
