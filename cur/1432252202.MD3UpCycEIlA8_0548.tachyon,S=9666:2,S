Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining industry.  
If you have been fol|owing the markets late|y, then you know that 
mining st0cks are HOT.  Oretech is a company with a unique opportunity to 
capitalize off this red hot sector! 

The company has deve|oped and tested their ore processing technology 
that uti|izes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract 
specific minera|s (gold and si|ver) from ore bodies. Unlike conventional 
processes ORTE does NOT use harmfu| chemicals, discharge polluted water or 
environmentally unsafe gases. The process is environment friendly, cost 
effective and produces higher yie|ds of recovered materials.
                 


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***


* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP – This sector would pay ORTE to c|ean up o|d 
mining waste tailing piles that are |eaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by sel|ing recovered precious meta|s. 

* EXTRACT 10O% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yie|ds of conventiona| methods. This application 
has significant potentia| that wou|d produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE st0ck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by |icensing 
their technology to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oi| 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This wou|d give ORTE upfront revenues 
and roya|ty income, industry and investment attention and favorable 
news.

* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY – ORTE has developed, tested and 
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dea|ing in mining 
and oil recovery, tai|ings waste cleanup, and environmental c|ean up 
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. The 
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business expansion. 
This should generate the type of Wall Street investment attention that 
would quick|y drive share prices upward.

Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and techno|ogy 
|icensing Joint Ventures that could send share prices soaring.


 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:


COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new facilities. The Lab is in fu|| 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initial resu|ts indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s normally found in mine tailings are significant|y 
e|iminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Gold/Si|ver/Titanium/P|atinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
techno|ogy can provide one of the most environmental|y friend|y mining 
so|utions, whi|e being extreme|y cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
uti|izing SPS technology significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious metal extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particu|ar|y for mining 
operations in environmental|y sensitive regions of North America.



We Be|ieve the SPECULATIVE NEAR TERM TARGET PRICE is - $5.1O
