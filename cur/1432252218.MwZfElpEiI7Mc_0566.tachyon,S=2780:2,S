I wanted to share with you all my speech at the Drone Summit last weekend. Here I explain why I believe that the FAA should regulate drones in the United States in order to protect privacy. I also highly recommend the other 3 speakers on my panel - Tom Barry, Jay Stanley, and Trevor Timm (you can select from the "latest videos" along the bottom of the screen).
