"Relevant legislation"? In Canada, in Iran, in Denmark, where?

Surely ZKS is not claiming that they will be somehow targetting each 
instance of their product to specific countries. If not, if the 
product is a general one, then just _whose_ "relevant legislation" 
applies?

(I presume this is related to their split key/key escrow/"trusted 
third parties" nonsense.)

This is beginning to sound like ZKS is restructuring itself as a 
consulting company, a la Arthur Anderson or the (now in the process 
of divorce) Kroll-O'Gara outfit.

Split encryption key. I think that says it all.

"Empower consumers"? "Responsible systems"? "Strengthens its commitment"?

How about:

-- no key escrow, no split keys, no trusted third parties

-- public key crypto

With strong crypto widely available, what business (or knowledgeable 
private person) is going to want or need this "ASSESS AND ADVISE" and 
"COMMIT AND CAPITULATE" (ok, I'm changing their stages) stuff/

I can't see how a large company, like an Intel or an Amgen, is going 
to move away from mathematically robust PKS systems and adopt some 
throwback to the 1940s, some kind of split key or key escrow system. 
And I can't see how Joe Consumer is going to pay for the (apparent) 
"review" of his (presumed) needs and then get some key escrow package 
tailored to his (presumed) needs.

So, what sort of customer is this product tailored for? Some 
middle-sized company which is clueless on crypto and which wants 
hand-holding? Some company in a country which _requires_ key escrow? 
Is ZKS setting itself up to be the premier supplier of key escrow and 
LEAF tools? Sounds like it.

The "relevant legislation" language is the real kicker. Sounds like 
the many former government types working at ZKS got the focus shifted 
from truly secure systems to basically uninteresting--and even 
pernicious!--systems which "meet the legitimate needs of law 
enforcement."

Key escrow, in other words.


"Big Brother Inside"


Whew.
