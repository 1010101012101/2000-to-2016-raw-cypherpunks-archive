Hi there,

Dnia poniedzia=C5=82ek, 3 listopada 2014 11:24:28 carlo von lynX pisze:=

I disagree. The small number of users and the confusion of which networ=
k to=20
use is a real problem, related to the network effect aka Metcalfe's law=
:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law

The same problem exists with truly distributed social networks, like=20=

SocialSwarm, MaidSafe, Twister et al. How should a user decide which on=
e they=20
should use?

Let's make that step easier by at least making an attempt at interopera=
bility.

To some extent you're right.

I don't agree. These systems already have tens of thousands of users, a=
nd=20
getting these users together on a single network is one of the challang=
es.

How do you know they can't scale? I see Diaspora scaling pretty well so=
 far.
And as far as hiding data from governments is concerned -- sure I'd pre=
fer=20
everybody to jump into RetroShare, but that's not gonna happen. And a=20=

decentralized system is much better, privacy-wise, than a centralized o=

even if it's not perfect.

Fair enough. But it already has hundreds of thousands of users.

For me, the endgame is indeed complete decentralisation and peer-to-pee=
r=20
social networking, a'la SocialSwarm, RetroShare and Twister. None of th=
ese are=20
ready yet, though, the way Diaspora or Friendica are ready and usable t=
oday.

So I'd rather help people switch to Diaspora or Friendica today rather =
than=20
have them wait unspecified amount of time fort the Golden Age of Social=
=20
Networking.

Because once we have them on the free software, decentralised, federate=
d sid,=20
we can write bridges/gateways, and have SocialSwarm connect with userba=
se on=20
The Federation.

That's not possibble with *any* walled garden.

But my girfriend doesn't have to use *my* server, she can choose any of=

So, this is interesting:

RedMatrix supports end-to-end encryption.

No, they're not. Still, many federating servers controlled by different=
 people=20
is much better than a single, centrally controlled network.

Somewhere there's a video of Bruce Schneier talking about how 10000 dif=
ferent=20
small and medium e-mail providers is so much better a situation, than 1=
0 large=20
ones. That's exactly my point here.

It is indeed. But if they have to do it on 10000 different servers, tha=
t's a=20
different ball game than when they have to do it on 10 or 100.

As above.

You know what? At this point let me say from the depth of my heart: fuc=
k you.

Don't you dare lecture me on Snowden and privacy. The fact that I have=20=

different take-away from these revelations (e.g. "done now is better th=
an=20
perfect in a decade") doesn't give you the right to be a condescending =
little=20
prick, smirking with contempt from your high horse of theoretical techn=
ical=20
superiority with not much to show for it but a few texts critical of pr=
ojects=20
that work *here and now*.

Where's the code? Where are the tools? How can I get involved? Can I te=
st=20
anything, apart from your ability to throw tantrums? Please don't tell =
me=20
that's all you've got in the pipeline since 28C3!

Here are some news for you: FreedomBox is not yet usable. SocialSwarm i=
s not=20
yet usable. I'd love them to be, but they're simply not.

And while you berate others about how they act as if "Snowden didn't ha=
ppen",=20
these others are getting people off of Facebook at least, today. That's=
 not=20
perfect, but it's a *step*. A step you can either try to build upon, or=
 a step=20
you can try to undermine. Guess which has a higher chance of eventually=
=20
solving most or all of the problems you mentioned?

Here, have a read:
https://medium.com/message/81e5f33a24e1

Especially the "In the end, it=E2=80=99s culture that=E2=80=99s broken"=
 part. Come back when=20
you do.

Had my grandmother had mustache, she would be my grandfather, as we say=
 in=20
Poland. Cry me a fucking river.

Also, had you spend the time you have spent writing this e-mail on deve=
lopment=20
work, you'd be a few steps closer to your goal. So, there's that.

What, now it's my fault that people that are completely unrelated to me=
 and=20
that make their own decisions are working on project A instead of proje=
ct B=20
which you tend to prefer? How sad is your world, how filled with bile m=
ust you=20
be that your pet project is not my pet project, or Friendica/Diaspora/R=
ed=20
developers' pet project!

Go out, talk, explain, reach out and convince people it's worthwhile to=
 invest=20
their time and effort in your idea. Heck, convince me that's worthwhile=
 and=20
that it will get people off of Facebook sooner than in a decade, and I =
might=20
start helping you out!

Hint: blaming me for your own problems with communication and having a =
fit=20
over other people taking different paths than yours is not the perfect=20=

strategy for that.

Ever thought that might somehow be related to how you go about introduc=
