	More noble to die in bed of old age, children raised to be 
self-sufficient and independent, bills paid up and burial money in the 
bank.

	Country and Cause are often masks, cover for hooligans and blackguards.

	It is not noble to die in defense of family and friends, to die in 
such cases is a failure, but at least it's a failure in the attempt to 
do ones duty than in the attempt to avoid it.
