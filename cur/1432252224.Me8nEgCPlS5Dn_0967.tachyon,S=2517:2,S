Declan,

This sounds good.

And what about the SSSCA that is the offspring of the coupling between
Hollings and media companies? Is that still alive?

There is a phrase that I remember from some of the anit-terror
legislation that bothers me -it's the "providing expert advice" part. Is
there any that this could be used to go after those who create,
distribute and teach about privacy tools or services?

Mike
