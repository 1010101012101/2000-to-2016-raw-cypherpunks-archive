I will explain to you why selecting Murphy to support any arguments you hav=
e is misguided. =C2=A0 Here is a paragraph from his essay, itself a respons=
e to his business partner, Robert Vroman, at: =C2=A0https://web.archive.org=
/web/20060208094246/http://www.anti-state.com/murphy/murphy17.html=C2=A0 =
=C2=A0I will first quote the whole paragraph, and then address it inline:
=C2=A0 =C2=A0"Simply put, I don't think Vroman or Bell realize just how=C2=
=A0nutty=C2=A0and=C2=A0horrible=C2=A0the AP idea seems to the average Ameri=
can. Especially if the government institutes a standing penalty of, say, a =
mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP donation, I don't think we wi=
ll have the millions of small donations that AP requires. The situation wou=
ld be a prisoner's dilemma: No individual donation of $10 or even $100 is g=
oing to make the difference between a target being killed or not, and so th=
ere would be no reason for the average person to use AP. The fact that the =
donations could be made "safely" is not enough; the government would surely=
 institute eavesdropping measures and would punish anyone who even=C2=A0vis=
ited=C2=A0AP sites.
My replies inline:
Simply put, I don't think Vroman or Bell realize just how=C2=A0nutty=C2=A0a=
nd=C2=A0horrible=C2=A0the AP idea seems to the average American.
I should point out why I view Murphy's comment as being wacky, in itself. =
=C2=A0The "average American" is fairly familiar with the deficiencies of th=
e world's status quo. =C2=A0 But he may not be aware that it has been estim=
ated that in the 20th century, about 250 million people DIED, killed by the=
 actions of governments. =C2=A0 =C2=A0http://www.evil.news/2015-10-07-natio=
nal-governments-murdered-262-million-people-over-the-last-century.html=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow "=
okay"? =C2=A0I very much doubt he'd say that was acceptable, and he probabl=
y couldn't argue much with the numbers themselves. =C2=A0But suppose those =
"average Americans" were FIRST fully informed of this fact, even simply as =
an estimate. =C2=A0THEN, suppose it was explained to him HOW a functioning =
AP system wouldn't allow that to happen, if necessary by killing whatever n=
umber of government employees were necessary to stop this, the "Democide". =
=C2=A0 If those "average Americans" were reminded that the death of a gover=
nment employee is no more unfortunate than the death of ordinary citizens, =
then wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude that to save 250 million ordinar=
y citizens, it would certainly be acceptable to kill 25 million government =
employees, and certainly 2.5 million government employees?
The "average American" has been aware, during and since the 1960's, that th=
e citizens of many major governments have been under a nuclear terror. =C2=
=A0Now, it seems, we simply accept it as it is a reality. =C2=A0As shocking=
 as that may see, perhaps it's made more understandable by the fact that th=
ere has not seemed to be anything we can do about it. =C2=A0
Suppose, then, these "average Americans" were told that a functioning AP sy=
stem would make any nation's holding of nuclear weapons absolutely impossib=
le: =C2=A0They are in the control of SOMEONE, or maybe hundreds and thousan=
ds of someones, and such people can be targeted by AP until those weapons a=
re finally shut down, and dismantled, and permanently rendered safe. =C2=A0=
As many government employees could be killed until that occurs. =C2=A0No li=
mit whatsoever. =C2=A0
So, where does Bob Murphy get off saying that the "Average American" would =
find AP "nutty and horrible"? =C2=A0I say, to the contrary, that a _well-in=
formed_ "average American", informed of what I say AP could accomplish, wou=
ld find Murphy himself and his arguments "nutty and horrible". =C2=A0Why sh=
ould the citizens of the world tolerate the killing of 250 million more peo=
ple by governments, beyond the 20th Century's toll? =C2=A0Why should the ci=
tizens of the world tolerate continuing to be held as nuclear hostages, tar=
gets of 2000 nuclear bombs, just to keep a few governments in power? =C2=A0=
Clearly, Murphy views the world's citizens' "natural state" to being owned =
and held hostage by governments, and certainly not the opposite!

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0" Especially if the government institutes a standing penal=
ty of, say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP donation, I don=
't think we will have the millions of small donations that AP requires. The=

fact that the donations could be made "safely" is not enough; the governmen=
t would surely institute eavesdropping measures and would punish anyone who=
 even=C2=A0visited=C2=A0AP sites."

Murphy, here, is beginning to show his 'inner paranoid'. =C2=A0"They would =
never let us do it!!!"Which, is one reasons we MUST do it. =C2=A0 I would s=
ay, to the contrary of what he said, that if "they", the governments, don't=
 want us to do something SO MUCH, then that's all the more reason we should=
 disregard those governments' official desires.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =
