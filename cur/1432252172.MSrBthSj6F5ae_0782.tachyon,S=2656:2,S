   [1]roach2002 writes "[2]Carnegie Mellon University is [3]fighting back
   against a [4]requirement that taps on campus internet access must be
   quickly obtainable. The technology that would allow the FBI to monitor
   internet access, after a court order, "at the flip of a switch" would
   cost at least $450 per student. [5]MIT is also covering the story."
   From the article: "'The Department of Justice wants 24/7 access,
   whenever they need it, and they want remote access. We find that too
   extremely burdensome in terms of money, staff, and technology,' said
   Maureen McFalls, Director of Government Relations for Carnegie Mellon
   and the coordinator of Carnegie Mellon's response to this issue.
   According to an ACE press release, the cost to universities could be
   upwards of $7 billion, or at least $450 extra on each student's
   tuition bill."
