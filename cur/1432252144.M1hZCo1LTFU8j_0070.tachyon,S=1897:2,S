Ah...I think that's a very interesting question, particularly in the larger 
sense. Public companies have to (and are well motivated to) report on their 
sales. A nice deep, statistical dive could probably reveal what equipment 
they're buying, at least as $$$/sale-->oo. Hell, a lot of these are even 
annouced as "Lucent signed a $1.5B contract to supplies equipment and 
services to the government today..."

Too bad there are no other superpowers around these days. Then again, I 
suspect the Soviets were always too fucked up to bother with something like 
that.
