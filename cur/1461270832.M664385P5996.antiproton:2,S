	I am a gold bug too, if gold bug means understanding of the
	fact that physical cash is a decentralized and anonymous
	system and that gold is a particularly good form of cash.

	Being truly decentralized and anonymous are not properties
	that any cryptocurrency has, as far as I know.

	On the other hand, a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is threat to
	governments and the financial mafia, so it's reasonable to
	assume that the mafia is going to come up with some kind of
	countermeasure.

	But yeah, it's also true that they've been 'developing' their
	own electric monies before bitcoin arrived into the scene...
