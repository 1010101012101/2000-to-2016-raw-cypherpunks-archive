"Is this that surprising?  The CIA isn't doing too well if they cannot
figure out that there are good reasons to doubt anti-Iraq intelligence."

The stuff I've been reading would indicate almost the contrary. Apparently,

added' analysis and grabbed the raw intelligence and interpreted it for 
itself.

Was that a splash sound I heard? Hope this rat likes the water...
