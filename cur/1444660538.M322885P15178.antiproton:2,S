Mike,

Nice troll,

My point is that specifically the value of this 'navel gazing' or
hypothetical conversation is very limited. Since you have not proven it,
what data do you ask us to look at? This entire conversation asks us to
suspend our disbelief in order to discuss the possible motivations of an
unnamed attacker who faked a GCHQ slide.

>From the beginning I've maintained it was asinine and pointless, at worst
you're riling up the neophytes who don't understand what's going on.

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this plausible?<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And did you missed the us-natsec trolling about the eu appea=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;NSA hasn&#39;t said it&#39;s fake&quot;=
 doesn&#39;t seem like a strong argument -<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially for a non-NSA slide. And again - *=
Snowden himself* has<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; accused<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outlets of releasing slides attributed to him=
 that *he says he<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Likely the NSA would distribute fake slides just t=

&gt; Snowden.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does Snowden deny the authencity of this slide?<br=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This slide appeared in _too many_ news AFAICT to g=
