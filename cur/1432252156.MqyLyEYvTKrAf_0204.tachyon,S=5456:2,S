Nonsense. None of the current "moral and societal implications of 
surveillance technologies" are either new or unexplored. From Bentham to 
Huxley to Orwell to Donner ("The Age of Surveillance," 1980) to Brin 
("The Transparent Society," c. 1996), the implications have been 
explored in gory detail.

The notion that these implications would be avoided or handled by 
submitting all research proposals to Inman's oversight board is naive in 
the extreme.

Inman's board, had the Constitution even allowed such "oversight" of 
private actor activities, would have killed RSA in the womb, would have 
blocked PGP, and would have put the kibosh on remailers....but would 
have endorsed surveillance cams in football stadiums.

I've been reading and thinking about these issues since I was a kid. All 
of the above authors I've read, plus a whole shelf full (Declan and 
Lucky can attest to this) of other such books. Laqueur. Kwitny, 
Richelson, Bamford, Wise, Kahn, and dozens of other works touching on 
surveillance, secrecy, terror states, espionage, and on and on.

But we don't have to justify to _you_ that we have read "academic works" 
or thought about the issues to then press for there being no Inman-style 
reviews of research, no Lincoln-style suspensions of habeas corpus, not 
statist-style restrictions on liberty in the name of fighting our 
"endless enemies."

Agent Farr, you need a new gig.
