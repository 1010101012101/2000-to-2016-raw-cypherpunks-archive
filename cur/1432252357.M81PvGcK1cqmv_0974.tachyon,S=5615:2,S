the latter is always done it seems, when the information is available.
the former, providing "in publicly accessible depository" is the crux.

so there it is: leakers should dump!

amused by your recent Twain discovery:
"We are of the Anglo-Saxon race, and when the Anglo-Saxon wants a

this is a potent criticism. encryption a convenient focus of hardness
while OPSEC weaknesses abound and multiply.

perhaps this is a suitable shibboleth: mention of encryption without
operational cautions an indicator of incompetence; the purveyor worse
