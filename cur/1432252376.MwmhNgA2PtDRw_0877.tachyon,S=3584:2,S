A lot of people living in the US make this kind of mistake. Actually, 
developed nations make up a minority of the world's population (though with 
China and India this may change wihtin our lifetimes). When one considers 
the abverage living standard for the entire world its been debated that it 
may actually be going down.

I'd argue that in some ways the real standard of living in the US has 
certainly gone down since the 1950s. Although technology has made things 
more affordable, the numbers of hours per week has increased steadily since 
the 1970s, and the number of homes where both parents must work has 
increased greatly.

So "obvious" it ain't.

(However, if China and India's standard of living continue to increase, 
within our lifetimes I think its quite clear that the world's standard of 
living will certainly be higher, on average, than its ever been.)
