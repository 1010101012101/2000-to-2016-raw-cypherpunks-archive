The time for confidences is over. Lawyers are considering
a change in their ethics about ratting on clients (see NY Times
today); priests are ratting about criminal confessions; reporters
are ratting on interviewees, psychiatrists are ratting patients.
DoJ and the courts are squeezing all the privileged listeners
along with ISPs and remailers and sysadmins and CDRs and
trusted circles and cryptographers -- so what makes anyone
think mathematics of concealment is any more protection than 
a concealed weapon when crypto has long been known as
a highly dangerous munition.

What is interesting is the fast shuffling going on among once
trusted confidants of all formulae, of all most trusted schemes
of protection -- authorities of all models are suspect, personal
as well as institutional.

The wargames of the snake oilers, read it here, grind your grist, spot
the narc, the provocateur, of the day, avoid mirrors or you'll shit your 
britches with recognition of self-deception.

Spit. Dry spit, unable to drivel, when your closest admirers decide to
rock you a Shirley Jackson to gain another year of not being backdoored.
