Clamoring to get on NSA hit lists for popular support and corresponding
business, researching, teaching, litigating and speaking opportunities is
a frenzy. Once it was a booster being on the FBI hit lists, then CIA,
then KGB, then MI5 and/or MI6, then Mossad, then Savak, then Cheney,
then Bin Laden, then AQ in Yemen, now Glenn Greenwald is swamped
with applicants to be put on list of names of US persons who are
desperate to be surveilled for starring roles in the multiple scripts of
the Snowden blockbusters, with many more digital Che's in the pipeline.

Snowden's mom has not yet, in public, rolled out a campaign for
evelasting fame and profit for her darling like Assange's mother
and various fathers.

Ed's dad has had his team going full blast for a year, in concert with
ACLU, EFF, Plato Cacheris and a gaggle of natsec sharks
and stunt arrangers, the red phones are hot between DC and
Moscow to set up beamings of Snowden for queues of ass-kissers
eager to be photographed with his metadata-rich talking head.

US attorneys in Eastern Virginia, DC, Southern NY and Northern CA
are wagering on who gets Assange, who gets Snowden, who
gets Greenwald, who gets Poitras, Appelbaum and unnamed
co-conspirators along with the dudes at EFF for orchestrating
Ed's seduction, purloining and dashings from Japan to Maryland
to Hawaii to Hong Kong to Moscow.

Other ex-NSA patriots are in heavy demand to beef up the
lightweight Snowden with dark musings on what the young
man had no access to but they did and will never ever tell.

Behind the legal and media shindigs technical agents are working
the outliers, FOI minions, CCC, Pirates, Torrents, Drops, Jabbers,
chats, IP2s, the invisible -- really -- of dark nets to gather intel on
counterspying apparatus and IO errors.

This is Phase 1.
