You need a Bill of Rights that specifies freedom of expression,
and judges that understand it.  Since you appear to be European,
where eg singers can be busted for singing political songs,
these ideas may be foreign to you.

Because when someone tells us that something is *mandatory*, we
tell them to fuck off, and we put them on our watch list.
OTOH nothing prevents you from 1. implementing
a hashcash-based node 2. automatically filtering what you receive.

Will no one think of the chiiildren?

Any legislator seeking to control how people use a communications
medium needs killing.

That's why mob rule^H^H^H^H democracy loses to the constitution.
If you don't have the latter, you suffer the former.

Well duh.

Why not use one of those "are you human" visually-distorted checks
that various websites use?  That is robust to automated spam.
Adding *voluntary* hashcash to remailer injection nodes is another
layer of defense in depth against spammers.

BTW, while spam is abuse, is a threatening message really abuse, or just

uncomfortable feedback?
