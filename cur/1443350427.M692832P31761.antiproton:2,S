Volkswagen is being rightly condemned from all directions, as its
methods were particularly cynical: its engine software would sense when
the car was in a test environment and cut back NO_x output temporarily.

As soon as the car was no longer under test, the car would change mode
and emit huge amounts of NO_x. This wasn't done for no reason – if a
machine is allowed to generate NO_x freely, it can be very
fuel-efficient – and thus, of course, its carbon emissions can be very
low too.

Comment:

Probably best defense for VW lawyers is:
"We got hacked and the hack made this.
We take sickyouareity seriously"
