Well, there's the "Executive Order", as well as the fact that many 
organizations are empowered to create "policy". Although policy is not 
specifically law, it may as well be. 

I am curious though:


1) Can the laws that grant policy making privileges be themselves secret?

2) Are policy making privilege laws restricted within a certain scope 
(within a specific organization)?

3) Are all *SIGNED* executive orders publically available?
