Subject: May 24: National Day of Outrage at NSA/Telco surveillance

Some alternative media groups have called for a national day of protests
against the telcos' latest sleazy activities, including their cooperation
in NSA's illegal surveillance of innocent citizens.

  http://saveaccess.org/

Events are already scheduled in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and
NYC.  You can register your own local event by sending mail to
protest@saveaccess.org.

Curiously, nobody in Washington, DC or Baltimore is protesting yet.
Perhaps a contingent should form outside NSA, with signs showing the
NSA employees on their way to/from work just what we think of their
disrespect for the constitution, the law, and the public.  Do we have
a local volunteer to organize it?

	John

PS: I don't agree with all the things these people are protesting, but
I admire their energy.  I haven't seen cryptographers and cypherpunks
with protest signs -- yet.  But I hope to see you out there on May 24th.
