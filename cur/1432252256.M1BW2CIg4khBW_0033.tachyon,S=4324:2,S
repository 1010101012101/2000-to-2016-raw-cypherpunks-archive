indeed. it usually boots a kernel image with whatever modules are
required to get the main system up and running;

The solution is only applicable to cold or moderately tamper-proofed
systems, to prevent analysis of such systems if confiscated. It can only
become a serious component in an overall scheme, but this is universally
true - there is no magic shield you can fit to *anything* to solve all
ills; this will add protection against the specified attacks and in fact
already exists for windows (drivecrypt pluspack) - it is just
non-windoze platforms that lack a product in this area.
