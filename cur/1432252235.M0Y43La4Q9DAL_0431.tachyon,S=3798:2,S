January 15, 2002 -- A new Web site 
devoted to local politics is breaking one scoop after 
another - but the one story it won't report is who's behind 
the effort.

PoliticsNY.com, launched Dec. 3 as a sister site to 
PoliticsNJ.com, beat all the local media in disclosing how 
Mayor Bloomberg was trying to block Andrew Eristoff 
from becoming the Manhattan Republican leader.

It also was first to reveal that former Mayor Rudy Giuliani 
was establishing his own repository for his official papers.

"Everyone's all hyped up about the site," said City 
Councilwoman Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan). "You 
constantly get asked, did you see such and such on their 
Web site."

Proud as they are of their exclusives, the authors - who 
appear to be well-connected - are no Matt Drudges: They 
won't step forward to claim credit.

"We have chosen to remain anonymous, much like when 
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay wrote 
the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym 'Publius,' " the 
writers proclaim in a message on the site.

One City Hall official said he's treating "everyone as a 
suspect" because some of the stories have so much 
background information that "it can't be someone new to 
the scene."

A Post source fingered the chief author as a former staffer 
in the Giuliani administration.
