No surprises there then, I remember the underground
talking<http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=3D55&id=3D10>about IOS
vulnerabilities in the 90s..

Wasn't that how Sabu et al got you guys, John?

NSA Laughs at PCs, Prefers Hacking Routers and Switches<br>
<br>
BY KIM ZETTER09.04.136:30 AM<br>

<br>
The NSA runs a massive, full-time hacking operation targeting foreign<br>
systems, the latest leaks from Edward Snowden show. But unlike conventional=
<br>
cybercriminals, the agency is less interested in hacking PCs and Macs.<br>
Instead, America=92s spooks have their eyes on the internet routers and<br>
switches that form the basic infrastructure of the net, and are largely<br>
overlooked as security vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
Under a $652-million program codenamed =93Genie,=94 U.S. intel agencies hav=
e<br>
hacked into foreign computers and networks to monitor communications crossi=
ng<br>
them and to establish control over them, according to a secret black budget=
<br>
document leaked to the Washington Post. U.S. intelligence agencies conducte=
d<br>
231 offensive cyber operations in 2011 to penetrate the computer networks o=
f<br>
targets abroad.<br>
<br>
This included not only installing covert =93implants=94 in foreign desktop<=
br>
computers but also on routers and firewalls =97 tens of thousands of machin=
es<br>
every year in all. According to the Post, the government planned to expand<=
br>
the program to cover millions of additional foreign machines in the future<=
br>
and preferred hacking routers to individual PCs because it gave agencies<br=
>
access to data from entire networks of computers instead of just individual=
<br>
machines.<br>
<br>
Most of the hacks targeted the systems and communications of top adversarie=
s<br>
like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea and included activities around<br>
nuclear proliferation.<br>
<br>
The NSA=92s focus on routers highlights an often-overlooked attack vector w=
ith<br>
huge advantages for the intruder, says Marc Maiffret, chief technology<br>
officer at security firm Beyond Trust. Hacking routers is an ideal way for =
an<br>
intelligence or military agency to maintain a persistent hold on network<br=
>
traffic because the systems aren=92t updated with new software very often o=
r<br>
patched in the way that Windows and Linux systems are.<br>
<br>
=93No one updates their routers,=94 he says. =93If you think people are bad=
 about<br>
patching Windows and Linux (which they are) then they are =85 horrible abou=
t<br>
updating their networking gear because it is too critical, and usually they=
<br>
don=92t have redundancy to be able to do it properly.=94<br>
<br>
He also notes that routers don=92t have security software that can help det=
ect<br>
a breach.<br>
<br>
=93The challenge [with desktop systems] is that while antivirus don=92t wor=
k well<br>
on your desktop, they at least do something [to detect attacks],=94 he says=
.<br>
=93But you don=92t even have an integrity check for the most part on router=
s and<br>
other such devices like IP cameras.=94<br>
<br>
Hijacking routers and switches could allow the NSA to do more than just<br>
eavesdrop on all the communications crossing that equipment. It would also<=
br>
let them bring down networks or prevent certain communication, such as<br>
military orders, from getting through, though the Post story doesn=92t repo=
rt<br>
any such activities. With control of routers, the NSA could re-route traffi=
c<br>
to a different location, or intelligence agencies could alter it for<br>
disinformation campaigns, such as planting information that would have a<br=
>
detrimental political effect or altering orders to re-route troops or<br>
supplies in a military operation.<br>
<br>
According to the budget document, the CIA=92s Tailored Access Programs and<=
br>
NSA=92s software engineers possess =93templates=94 for breaking into common=
 brands<br>
and models of routers, switches and firewalls.<br>
<br>
The article doesn=92t say it, but this would likely involve pre-written scr=
ipts<br>
or backdoor tools and root kits for attacking known but unpatched<br>
vulnerabilities in these systems, as well as for attacking zero-day<br>
vulnerabilities that are yet unknown to the vendor and customers.<br>
<br>
=93[Router software is] just an operating system and can be hacked just as<=
br>
Windows or Linux would be hacked,=94 Maiffret says. =93They=92ve tried to h=
arden<br>
them a little bit more [than these other systems], but for folks at a place=
<br>
like the NSA or any other major government intelligence agency, it=92s pret=
ty<br>
standard fare of having a ready-to-go backdoor for your [off-the-shelf] Cis=
co<br>
or Juniper models.=94<br>
<br>
Not all of the activity mentioned in the budget document involved remote<br=
>
hacking. In some cases, according to the document, the operations involved<=
br>
clandestine activity by the CIA or military intelligence units to =93physic=
ally<br>
place hardware implants or software modifications=94 to aid the spying.<br>
<br>
=93Much more often, an implant is coded entirely in software by an NSA grou=
p<br>
called Tailored Access Operations (TAO),=94 the Post writes in its story ab=
out<br>
the document. =93As its name suggests, TAO builds attack tools that are<br>
custom-fitted to their targets.=94<br>
<br>
A handful of security researchers have uncovered vulnerabilities in routers=
<br>
in recent years that could be used to do the kind of hacking described in t=
he<br>
budget document.<br>
<br>
In 2005, security researcher Mike Lynn found a serious vulnerability in Cis=
co<br>
IOS, the operating system running on millions of Cisco routers around the<b=
r>
world.<br>
<br>
Lynn discovered the vulnerability after his employer, Internet Security<br>
Systems, asked him to reverse-engineer the Cisco operating system to see if=
<br>
he could find security problems with it. Cisco makes the majority of the<br=
>
routers that operate the backbone of the internet as well as many company<b=
r>
networks and critical infrastructure systems. The Cisco IOS is as ubiquitou=
s<br>
in the backbone as the Windows operating system is on desktops.<br>
<br>
The vulnerability Lynn found, in a new version of the operation system that=
<br>
Cisco planned to release at the time, would have allowed someone to create =
a<br>
router worm that would shut down every Cisco router through which it passed=
,<br>
bringing down a nation=92s critical infrastructure. It also would have allo=
wed<br>
an attacker to gain complete control of the router to sniff all traffic<br>
passing through a network in order to read, record or alter it, or simply<b=
r>
prevent traffic from reaching its recipient.<br>
<br>
Once Lynn found the vulnerability, it took him six months to develop a<br>
working exploit to attack it.<br>
<br>
Lynn had planned to discuss the vulnerability at the Black Hat security<br>
conference in Las Vegas, until Cisco intervened and forced him to pull the<=
br>
talk under threat of a lawsuit.<br>
<br>
But if Lynn knew about the vulnerability, there were likely others who did =
as<br>
well =97 including intelligence agencies and criminal hackers.<br>
<br>
Source code for Cisco=92s IOS has been stolen at least twice, either by<br>
entities who were interested in studying the software to gain a competitive=
<br>
advantage or to uncover vulnerabilities that would allow someone to hack or=
<br>
control them.<br>
<br>
Other researchers have uncovered different vulnerabilities in other Cisco<b=
r>
routers that are commonly used in small businesses and home offices.<br>
<br>
Every year at computer security conferences =97 including the Black Hat<br>
conference where NSA Director Keith Alexander presented a keynote this year=
 =97<br>
U.S. intelligence agencies and contractors from around the world attend to<=
br>
discover information about new vulnerabilities that might be exploited and =
to<br>
hire talented researchers and hackers capable of finding more vulnerabiliti=
es<br>
in systems.<br>
<br>
In 2008, a researcher at Core Security Technologies developed a root kit fo=
r<br>
the Cisco IOS that was designed to give an attacker a persistent foothold o=
n<br>
a Cisco router while remaining undetected.<br>
<br>
According to the Post story, the NSA designs most of the offensive tools it=
<br>
uses in its Genie operation, but it spent $25.1 million in one year for<br>
=93additional covert purchases of software vulnerabilities=94 from private<=
br>
malware vendors who operate on the grey market =97 closed markets that pedd=
le<br>
vulnerabilities and exploits to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, =
as<br>
opposed to the black market that sells them to cyber criminals.<br>
<br>
The price of vulnerabilities and exploits varies, depending on a number of<=
br>
factors. Vulnerabilities and exploits can sell for anywhere from $50,000 to=
<br>
more than a million, depending on the exclusivity of the purchase =97 some<=
br>
vulnerabilities are sold to multiple parties with the understanding that<br=
>
others are using it as well =97 and their ubiquity. A vulnerability that ex=
ists<br>
in multiple versions of an operating system is more valuable than a<br>
vulnerability that exists in just one version. A class of vulnerability tha=
t<br>
crosses multiple browser brands is also more valuable than a single<br>
vulnerability that just affects the Safari browser or Chrome.<br>
<br>
The Stuxnet cyber weapon that was reportedly created by the U.S. and Israel=
<br>
to sabotage centrifuges used in Iran=92s uranium enrichment program, used f=
ive<br>
zero-day exploits to spread itself among systems in Iran, including a rare<=
br>
exploit that attacked the .LNK function in multiple versions of the Windows=
<br>
operating system in order to spread the worm silently via infected USB<br>
sticks.<br>
<br>
Ubiquitous router vulnerabilities are difficult to find since there are so<=
br>
many different configurations for routers, and an attack that works against=
<br>
one router configuration might not work for another. But a vulnerability th=
at<br>
affects the core operating system is much more valuable since it is less<br=
>
likely to be dependent on the configuration. Maiffret says there hasn=92t b=
een<br>
a lot of public research on router vulnerabilities, but whenever someone ha=
s<br>
taken a look at them, they have found security holes in them.<br>
<br>
=93They=92re always successful in finding something,=94 he says.<br>
<br>
Once a vulnerability becomes known to the software maker and is patched, it=
<br>
loses a lot of its value. But because many users and administrators do not<=
br>
