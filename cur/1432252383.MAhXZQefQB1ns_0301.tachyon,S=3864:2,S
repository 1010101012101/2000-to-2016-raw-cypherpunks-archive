Certainly.

Carl Ellison, Perry Metzger, and even law professors like Jane Kauffman
Wynn, have been saying this stuff for years.

Yup.

But, frankly, you don't want to do commerce, especially finance, on a
platform you don't have absolute control over, anyway. As Chaum and others
point out, you want your own box, with its own I/O, and so on. Fortunately,
falling hardware prices and miniaturization continue to accelerate apace.

And that's why I'm passing this around. Bruce succeeds where others fail,
by the way, because takes complicated crypto stuff like this and reduces it
to plain English better than just about anybody out there at the moment.
