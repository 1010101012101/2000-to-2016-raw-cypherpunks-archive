I strongly support your idea.  Although it would even be more
useful if you added:

c)  e-mail address user certs authenticated via confirmation
message sent to the e-mail address being certified
(as Lucky suggested)

d)  fully enable all certificates for all purposes, thereby
allowing the certificate to sign code.

I hope that you are able to implement this idea, as all efforts
to increase the volume of encryption on the internet will
ultimately increase privacy and show strong public support for
cryptography in general.
