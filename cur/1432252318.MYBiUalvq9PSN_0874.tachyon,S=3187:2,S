Did I miss some development or why exactly does cypherpunks care
about a release candidate of libevent (or Wolfram's New Kind of
Science for that matter)? Was I frozen for that long?

Note that I am not trying to be a bitch or troll, but I am on this
mailing list to follow the hacker culture and developments in
privacy issues and Internet technology, not to learn about all kinds
of tangential announcements.

Could someone bring me up to speed, please?

This is not flamebait. Really not.
