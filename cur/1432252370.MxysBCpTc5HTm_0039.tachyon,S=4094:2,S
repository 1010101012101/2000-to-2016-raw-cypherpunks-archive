In an opinion  column in the London Daily Telegraph, John Keegan calls
for a combined US/Russian/British invasion of Afghanistan:

He then goes on to say, and I quote:


==========

"There are other current movements of which to take note, as yet
insubstantial but certain to gather concrete form. One is the retreat of
human rights lawyers from the forefront of public life. America in a war
mood will have no truck with tender concern for constitutional
safeguards of the liberty of its enemies. The other, which ordinary
Americans will have to learn to bear, is interference with their liberty
of instant electronic access to friends and services." 

"The World Trade Centre outrage was co-ordinated on the internet,
without question. If Washington is serious in its determination to
eliminate terrorism, it will have to forbid internet providers to allow
the transmission of encrypted messages - now encoded by public key
ciphers that are unbreakable even by the National Security Agency's
computers - and close down any provider that refuses to comply." 

"Uncompliant providers on foreign territory should expect their
buildings to be destroyed by cruise missiles. Once the internet is
implicated in the killing of Americans, its high-rolling days may be
reckoned to be over."

==========


The "Torygraph" is the most conservative of Britain's serious 
newspapers, and is edited from (IIRC) the 30th floor of London's tallest
office tower, which overlooks London City Airport,  from which STOL
planes take off pointing straight at the tower. I know, I've been there
myself, it scared me then.  Their fear is excusable. Their
bloodthirstiness is understandable. Their stupidity is neither.
