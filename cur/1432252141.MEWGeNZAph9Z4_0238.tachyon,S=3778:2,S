No. I am a woman of few talents, however, to my dismay, it seems this is one
of them. My comments were sincere. I am just sorry that my prose is
inadequate.

Yes. However, I've been here a while. The dynamics of this community is
somewhat difficult to grasp, and I can only beg your understanding of the
same.

> They don't spew stilted jargon to lists which they are new to.

Yes. This was a grievous error. I am new, and obviously used inappropriate,
and possibly offensive jargon, in addition to my tasteless introduction.

No. I can get myself "fixed," if necessary, so as to render any
killing-proposition moot. Alternatively, my whereabouts are a matter of
public record.
