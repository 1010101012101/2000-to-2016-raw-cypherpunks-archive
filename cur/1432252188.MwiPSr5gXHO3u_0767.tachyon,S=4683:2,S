One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modu|ate the

major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.
