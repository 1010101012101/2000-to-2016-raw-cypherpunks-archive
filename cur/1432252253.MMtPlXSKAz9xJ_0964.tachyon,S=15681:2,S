Accidental discovery dramatically improves electrical conductivity
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-accidental-discovery-electrical.html

     "Quite by accident, Washington State University researchers have
achieved a 400-fold increase in the electrical conductivity of a crystal
simply by exposing it to light. The effect, which lasted for days after the
light was turned off, could dramatically improve the performance of devices
like computer chips." ...

[&]  Electrons with a "split personality" // anisotropy, metal, & lifetimes
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-electrons-personality.html

"Conventional or unconventional =E2=80=93 depending on momentum"

" Up until now, the interaction of the electrons has generally been assumed
to be isotropic. "

"In terms of electrons, resistivity corresponds to the mean free path of
the electrons, i.e. the distance an average electron covers before bumping
into something =E2=80=93 the shorter the mean free path, the higher the
resistivity. Generally, the higher the temperature the higher the
resistivity because the particles the electrons can collide with are moving
faster at higher temperatures which makes collisions more likely."  {what
is metal}

"Mazin's imaging device... dubbed the ARray Camera for Optical to
Near-infrared (IR) Spectrophotometry (ARCONS), sees all of the wavelengths
all of the times. It is literally the first imaging device to ever actually
see in color. It is also the first imaging device to utilize Microwave
Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), a superconducting photon detector
used to measure energy across the electromagnetic spectrum."

[also waiting for this tech in consumer digital & video cameras,
going beyond visual parameters, using IR and UV imaging vs.
stylized filters- why not multispectral wavelength options.
hell, what if there was an 'electromagnetic signals' setting,

Evelyn Glennie: How to truly listen  (video)
http://www.ted.com/talks/evelyn_glennie_shows_how_to_listen.html

description: In this soaring demonstration, deaf percussionist Evelyn
Glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply
letting sound waves hit your eardrums.

"... Allow your body is open up, to allow your body to be this resonating
chamber..."

"... please take note of the life of the sound after the initial strike..."

[bio] Evelyn Glennie

// in approaching music independently i enjoyed this documentary a lot.
// her approach is unique, educational, instructive, and inspirational...
// about tuning into events, learning to ~listen with all the senses

note: the expandable structures seem ideal both for satellite or spacecraft
and also lunar habits or robotic missions, such as a small format
expandable base camp tent, etc. likewise, emergency tents or shelters,
perhaps even windtunnel testing of the dome to consider if anchored
structures could short-circuit hurricane winds via acting more like ground
vs walls; for instance, with certain hi-tech fabrics perhaps flexibility
and deformity is a strength. also, potential antennas, collapsible or not,
or even portable radio telescope/telemetry arrays.
