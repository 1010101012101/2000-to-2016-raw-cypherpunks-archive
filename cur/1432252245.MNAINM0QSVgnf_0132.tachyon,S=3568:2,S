By the way, a few minutes with Google turned up other instances of

I Got Spammed by Esther Dyson:
Release, the Old-Fashioned Way

By LISA NAPOLI
  ecently, I got a note from the publisher of Release 1.0, the 
venerable newsletter put out by the venerable (and mythic) godmother 
of all things digital, Esther Dyson.

It wasn't a casual e-mail. It wasn't a letter asking me to write for 
the newsletter. It wasn't even a personal note asking me to have 
lunch, or attend her annual conference (which took place this week in 
Tucson, where, for the first time, non-Release subscribers were 
permitted to attend.)

The note was plain old-fashioned snail mail spam, asking me to fork 
over nearly 700 bucks for a subscription.

Dear Lisa,

Esther Dyson and Jerry Michalski believe that someone who's achieved 
your stature in our industry should be part of the Release 1.0 
family. That's why they've suggested I write this letter to you.


Stature? How did they measure that? Did Jerry Michalski remember 
sitting at the same table with me at a conference luncheon once? Did 
Esther ever read my now deceased column, Hyperwocky? Did some 
computer notice my name on all those mailing lists?
