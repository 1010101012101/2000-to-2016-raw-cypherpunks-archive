Subject: [Wikimedia-l] "Legalised Piracy"

Very interesting things happening in Antigua and the US:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21247683

Essentially, the World Trade Organization (WTO) have ruled that the islands
have the right to suspend US intellectual property rights. It all stems
from a trade dispute in 2003, where the US effectively banned electronic
interstate gambling, which in turn damaged Antigua's economy."

This has led to one thing and another, and "...on Monday the WTO's dispute
settlement body gave final authorisation for Antigua to sell movies, music,
games and software via a store that would be able to ignore US copyright
and trademark claims."

I'm not sure what this means for the movement - I'm sure there will be a
long and lively discussion - but it's a very interesting turn of events in
IP law.
