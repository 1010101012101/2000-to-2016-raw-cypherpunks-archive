Kewl. Nice to see that someone's blown the cobwebs off the stuff  
that's out there, and done something interesting.


So, one of the things I like is that it's got a distributed mint,  
kinda like Juels and Jakobsson's Breadpudding scheme for Shamir/ 
Rivest's Micromint.

Not to mention a variant of Adam Back's Hashcash proof of work stuff.  
I've never been convinced by the Bayes-filter guys' incessant attacks  
on proof of work schemes like Eric Johansson's Camram, myself, though  
I've always been more interested in underwriting other things of value  
besides mere machine horsepower. :-). Looks like this is long-awaited  
step in the right direction.

It's even got a shout out to Wei Dai's Crypto++ .

It's like old home week around here.


Cheers,
RAH
