Not sure if troll, but oh-kay...

I mean "I have subscribed to their list; this list provides clearly mar=
ked and=20
functional way of unsubscribing; thus, mail from this source is conside=
red=20
legitimate; and hence sending such mail by them is considered legitimat=

activity".

I'd say it's quite obvious, though.

Same here.

Well, my bad. Should have been more clear there, I give you that.

I do attribute malice to Google with regard to several of their recent =
actions=20
(the Jabber debacle and the anti Net Neutrality stance, for starters). =
With=20
great power (and Google does have great power over the Internet right n=
ow,=20
sadly) comes great responsibility; they *should* be aware of what effec=
t their=20
policies have on the rest of the Net.

And I would say, we should *expect* them to be aware of that. Even more=
 -- I=20
am quite sure they *are* aware. And hence, we're getting dangerously cl=
ose to=20
what could be described as malice: conscious decision to perform action=
s that=20
are heavily detrimental to a lot of other entities with the only ration=
ale=20
being profit maximalisation.

I shall re-phrase, then:

"We are being fucked in the arse by GMail, so let's ask them politely t=
o use=20
some lubricant".

This version leaves about as much space for GMail doing that completely=
=20
accidentally and without any knowledge nor awareness of the grave effec=
ts=20
their action will have as I am willing to leave. I.e. some, but not tha=
t much.

I'm sorry, but I find your your comment right there borderline offensiv=

Also, the .io domain here might prove problematic to interpret in the c=

Well, as with *most* of important things in life, there is no precise b=

Avaaz sees that as a grave danger, that might be some indication.

Okay, I think you didn't get the crux of the issue.

Avaaz, AFAIK, is *not* using Google's services to distribute mail. Thei=
r=20
members/users/activists do for their personal accounts. It's not that A=
vaaz is=20
*relying* on Google/GMail, it's that they have no say who delivers thei=
r mail=20
to a huge part of their users/activists.

Also, it's not a company, it's an NGO.

You *do* see the difference between:

"look, the problem is related to centralisation, considering moving to =
a=20
different mail provider would be a good idea"

...and...

"we demand you move to a different provider immediately"

...right?

Avaaz is ~20mln-strong civic organisation operating via on-line petitio=
ns to=20
try and convince politicians to sometimes do the right thing. Instead o=
f=20
slandering them, you might want to educate yourself:

Yes, I should have provided the link in my first e-mail, I assumed that=

this list Avaaz might be already known. See, everybody makes wrong assu=
