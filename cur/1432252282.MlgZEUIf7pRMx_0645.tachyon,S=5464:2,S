Ok, we're in sync.

So you're saying the 2nd and 3rd question are absurd?

You believe a priori there is a 'clear' concept of property?

Do you own yourself (assume for a moment we ignore the DoI & Const.)?

Clearly the patent and property courts don't agree, I sent a forward on
this aspect earlier today. 

You believe that there is some definition of 'property' that all can agree
on? I'd like to understand what makes you believe this.
 
The best real world definition I have is something that allows a person to
make money. No other significant principle of weight seems to be involved.

> You interpreted the third question right.

Apparently not if you believe your last two questions are absurd. I
suspect this is a 'native language dispute' where what you mean and what
comes out isn't what I'm seeing. Can you possibly reword your second
question so I can hopefully understand your intent better? Assuming of
course it's worth your time.
