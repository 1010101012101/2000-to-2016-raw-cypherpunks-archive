Back in 1993, as Clipper was unfolding, I drew up a logo for use on 
such pieces of equipment:

Big

Brother

Inside


Done, of course, in the "Intel Inside" tradition.

I understand that at least a couple of enterprising folks have had 
batches of stick-on labels made.

Personally, I think it's a tempest in a teapot. _Of course_ using 
someone else's computers is a security disaster...this has been 
well-known for decades. If someone uses Coca Cola's kiosk, or IBM's 
kiosk, or whatever, then they can expect passwords to be unsecure.

End to end encryption is the only real solution. By two years from 
now there should be more of this, especially on PDAs and WebPad types 
of devices.

Now what would be worrisome, and unconstitutional, would be some sort 
of ban on such end to end encryption for the Games, or the 
participants, or in general.
