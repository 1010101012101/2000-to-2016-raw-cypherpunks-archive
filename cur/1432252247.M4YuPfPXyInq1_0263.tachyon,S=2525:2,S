Barter units of money or BUMs start to circulate in lieu of dollar and 
float with the dollar.When the 1st letter from the tax office arrives to 
tell you your precious BUMs will be taxed as dollars they are subjected to 
AP.If they harden the tax collectors as targets then other federal 
employees,prison guards,forest service grunts,postal workers become fair game.
Like Osama says,if your paying taxes,your propping up a rogue terror 
state.Its time to tear apart the state.Bet the farm.
