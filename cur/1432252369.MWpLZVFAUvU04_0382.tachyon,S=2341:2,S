Yes, it specifies printed material rather than spoken; this wouldn't have 
been unusual to them -- English law has long distinguished libel from 
slander, for example.  Your statement implies that you think the framers 
were being deliberately vague or encoding various sorts of subtle nuances in 
the amendment's language.  It's much simpler to presume that they said what 
they intended to say.
