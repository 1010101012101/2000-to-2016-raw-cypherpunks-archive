Vanity Fair writer who penned Seagal/Mafia story reports gun threat
Ned Zeman was returning to his Los Angeles home last week, according to a 
Vanity Fair editor, when a car drove up behind him, shined a light into his 
car and pulled up alongside him. A man in the car pointed a handgun at 
Zeman and said, "Bang," and, "Stop what you are doing," before driving off. 
Zeman's piece on actor Steven Seagal's allegation that he was extorted by 
the Mafia appears on newsstands today. David Carr notes that Zeman is the 
second journalist to report being threatened -- the LAT's Anita Busch 
reported an incident in June -- while working on an article about Seagal's 
allegation. (New York Times/reg. req.)
Photographer caught a bullet...dead.
