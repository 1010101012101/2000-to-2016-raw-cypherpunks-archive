Has anyone recently attempted to open a non-interest bearing checking
account without giving out an SSAN?

What possible rationale (aside from "bank policy," "identification when
you lose your passbook," "it's easier for us this way," or "the computer
won't let us do that") could a bank (or the fedgov) have for requiring
social security account numbers on such accounts?
