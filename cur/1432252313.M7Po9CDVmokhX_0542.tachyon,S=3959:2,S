That is frightfully underspecified.  Creating such a system
could be very easy or very hard, depending on what range of
policies is to be supported, and depending on what your 
threat model is.

At one extreme I might trust an off-the-shelf PC if it were
booted from CD by trusted parties in a TEMPEST-shielded room
surrounded by armed guards.  At the other extreme, making
tamper-proof hardware to face unlimited threats is very, very
hard -- most likely outside the "PC" price range for the
foreseeable future.

Well, the "technical terms" are not and should not be the
sole focus of the current discussion.  There are other
questions such as
 -- what range of policies should be supported
 -- who gets to set the policy
 -- who decides who trusts whom
 -- etc. etc. etc.

I agree that there has been too much ad-hominem sewage
and emotional rhetoric mixed in with the valid arguments
recently.
