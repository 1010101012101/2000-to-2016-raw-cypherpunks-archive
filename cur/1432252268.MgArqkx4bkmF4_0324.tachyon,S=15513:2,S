America's baseball superstar Yogi Berra has a sideline as a=20
man-in-the-street philosopher. His epigram, "It's d=E9j=E0 vu all over=
 again",=20
sprang to mind while I was reading Linked and Nexus. Albert-Laszlo Barabasi=
=20
and Mark Buchanan deal with the emerging science of networks - how they=20
form, how information and matter move through them, how puzzling aspects of=
=20
everyday life can be explained by understanding their dynamics.
What's the message, then? Simply that all networks - -the Internet,=20
terrorist groups, multinational industries, interstate highways, Amazonian=
=20
ecosystems - follow the same simple and powerful rules. The "science of=20
networks" has sprung up to uncover these rules, and provide a firm=20
foundation for the care and feeding of these interconnected patterns.
Curious as to how Google came to be the most popular search engine on the=20
Internet or what it would take to dismantle the Al Qaida terrorist network?=
=20
The Barabasi volume will tell you. But if you want to understand the spread=
=20
of infectious disease, how riots form or why the rich always seem to get=20
richer, then Buchanan's treatment is for you.
The mathematician Paul Erd=F6s published over 1500 papers with 507=
 co-authors=20
before his death in 1996. This prodigious output gave rise to something=20
mathematicians call the "Erd=F6s number," an integer representing the number=
=20
of steps between Erd=F6s and any given mathematician. Erd=F6s obviously has=
=20
Erd=F6s number 0. Anyone who wrote a paper with him has number 1. Anyone who=
=20
co-authored a paper with one of Erd=F6s's co-authors has number 2, and so=
 on.=20
A low Erd=F6s number is a matter of considerable pride among mathematicians,=
=20
so important in fact that there is a Web page devoted to keeping track of=20
the Erd=F6s number of thousands of mathematicians.
What is quite astonishing is that almost everyone - even a=20
non-mathematicians like Bill Gates - has a very low Erd=F6s number,=
 typically=20
between 2 and 5. This is a quintessential example of what Barabasi and=20
Buchanan call the "small worlds" phenomenon. Basically, this web of science=
=20
is a small world because it is a highly interconnected web, in which almost=
=20
all mathematicians are closely linked to each other via a short path of=20
co-authored papers.
The network of mathematicians and their Erd=F6s numbers serves as a=
 prototype=20
for just about every human social network - including the Internet, as both=
=20
Barabasi and Buchanan show. Suppose you look at a particular Web page and=20
ask how many clicks of your mouse it takes to get from this page to any=20
other page via hyperlinks. Barabasi and his students actually did this=20
calculation for their website at the University of Notre Dame. It contained=
=20
325,729 documents connected by 1,469,680 links. Counting up how many pages=
=20
had one link, two links, and so on, they discovered that the number of=20
pages having a certain number of links decreased by about a factor of five=
=20
each time the number of links was doubled.
These results lead to a simple relationship between the number of links in=
=20
a network and the number of nodes in the network having that many links.=20
Called a "power law", this relationship forms a central principle by which=
=20
networks structure themselves. As both authors point out, power laws play=20
as important a role in understanding networks as the famed bell curve of=20
the normal probability distribution plays in understanding the role in=20
statistics of independent random variables, such as a person's height.
Two other extremely important rules of networks are also considered in some=
=20
detail in each of these books. One of these is the "weak link" discovered=20
some 30 years ago by sociologist Mark Granovetter. It refers to the=20
seemingly paradoxical fact that the most important connections for=20
spreading information throughout a network are not the people who are most=
=20
closely connected to you. Rather, the key "connectors" are those who form a=
=20
bridge between the cluster of people you know and other, similar clusters=20
of close acquaintances of your friends. Thus, the links in a social network=
=20
are not established at random. Instead,they are strongly clustered, and=20
some of the connections are more important than others - that is, the ones=
=20
enabling one cluster to link to another.
These "busy bees" with an uncommonly large number of links to many clusters=
=20
are the people writer Malcolm Gladwell claims are responsible for creating=
=20
fashions and trends. They make deals happen and generally serve as agents=20
or middlemen who "tip" things in one direction instead of another. The=20
central idea of his book The Tipping Point (reviewed by Paul Marsden, 6=20
May, page 46) is that tiny and apparently insignificant changes can often=20
have consequences out of all proportion to themselves, accounting for the=20
transformation of unknown books into bestsellers or the rise of teenage=20
smoking.
Both Buchanan and Barabasi give enlightening accounts of both Granovetter's=
=20
and Gladwell's work. Dig in, too, for fascinating accounts of the stability=
=20
of food webs, the formation of "old boys" networks, the "new economy", the=
=20
human genome, and much, much more.
Both books are extremely well-written, entertaining accounts aimed at the=20
intelligent lay audience. The overlap is inevitable: Barabasi and Buchanan=
=20
employ the same anecdotes, talk about the same people and use similar=20
diagrams to illustrate their message. Even the size and price of their two=
=20
books are roughly the same. You could call them two peas in a pod - but=20
their flavours are distinct. In short, both are to be heartily welcomed as=
=20
about the best introduction you could hope to get to the whys and=20
wherefores of networks, human and non-human.
