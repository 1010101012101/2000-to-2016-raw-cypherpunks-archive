So, have you ever tried doing substantial revisions on a large document 
that's going back and forth between two or more versions of Word?  It's in 
MS' interest to get everyone using the same version, so it's not really in 
their interest to spend great amounts of time debugging their version 
translation functions.  It shows.

If you need to coordinate working on a big Word document with several other 
people (e.g., clients or coworkers who are most comfortable with Word), you 
pretty-much will need to use not just Word, but the same version of 
Word.  That doesn't need any secure hardware to enforce, just buggy 
software.  You can sometimes work around this, but it's a pain to do.

Well, let's distinguish between:

a.  The sort of network monopoly situation Microsoft is in, where the world 
has more-or-less settled on a bunch of their products, and so they can do a 
lot of irritating things before they actually lose their dominant market 
position.  (Note that this doesn't mean they are unassailable; Word Perfect 
and Lotus -123 were once in similarly dominant positions.)

b.  Eventual laws requiring that every new computer contain a secure 
processing unit to enforce the dictates of the government, the record 
companies, or whomever else on your computers.

I think a lot of the objection to TCPA is the worry that it will be 
mandated eventually, and that it will then be used to cement the network 
monopoly held by MS forever.  And Vinge's description of "ubiquitous 
governance" comes to mind here--whether it's MS or the US federal 
government or the UN or the Catholic Church, if someone can put themselves 
in control of all computer equipment you own in some secure way, they look 
a heck of a lot like the government.

Sure.  Or you can often translate their documents, or open them with 
OpenOffice.  I do this when I just need to read and comment on a Word 
document.  But if you are going to be revising and sending back the 
document a few times, this will not work--you will lose some formatting, 
you will probably introduce weird formatting bugs, you may mess up the file 
format, etc.  It's just not worth the pain.  Though I have a legitimate 
copy of Word on my machine, when given a choice, I always do everything in 
ASCII text until the very end, and then paste the text into Word and do 
formatting last.  But again, this isn't too helpful if it's a document I'm 
working on with someone else.

Mainframe customers used to put up with this kind of treatment routinely, 
so it's not impossible.  Whether it will fly these days is an interesting 
question, but I don't think the answer is obvious.  Someone might ask the 
same rhetorical question about whether customers would sit still for buggy, 
insecure software.  But nobody would ask that question these days, as the 
answer is so painfully obvious.
