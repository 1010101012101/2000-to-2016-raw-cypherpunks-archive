Ummm, no. The diploments created the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, only two 
years before Apollo 11. There were plenty of satellites in orbit by then. The 
stated intention was to eliminate one source of tension between nations, 
particularly the US and the USSR, by making it illegal to claim 
territoriality of anything beyond Earth's atmosphere; therefore, the US could 
not claim the Moon. The reasoning was that if no one could claim the 
territoriy, no one could use it for military purposes. This was obviously 
false, since warships sail through international waters all the time, but 
what do you expect from diplomats.

Now, where did you get the idea that territorial waters are defined by the 
range of ship to shore artillery? That makes no sense at all. Territorial 
waters were originally defined at 3 miles, in a time when battleships could 
fire shots 20 miles; even now, the limit is only 12 miles.
