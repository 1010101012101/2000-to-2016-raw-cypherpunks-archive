Holy Shit, Sarath...what's that got to do with Variola's little quip?

And are you trying to suggest (On Cypherpunks, of all places) that the US 
government should somehow regulate outsourcing?

(Me, I work with outsourced experts all the time and for the most part it 
works out just fine. However, if the US government should do anything, it 
should be to level the playing field so that outsourced jobs don't go to 
countries which have no child labor laws, no pollution control or etc..., 
and even on this I'll probably get hammered on THIS list, which in general 
doesn't really trust ANY government to do much at all besides shore up its 
own power....)
