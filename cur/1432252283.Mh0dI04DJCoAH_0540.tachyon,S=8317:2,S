This is a problem as articles get bounced around, sometimes to some of

I was there, at Intel, and will give you my thoughts on this.

* When there were about 10 chip companies, extensive patent 
cross-licensing deals had been struck (mostly in the 1960s). There 
_were_ a few lawsuits (notably Fairchild suing others for violating the 
"oxide isolation" patents), but not many.

* The focus on patents was minimal. Trade secrets were much more 
important. I can tell you that Intel had several tricks ("Getter III 
V-over-I," "Pyroglass," "Dip-back," special equipment custom-built, 
proprietary CAD systems long before CAD companies existed, etc.) that 
were not patented, just kept secret. Something crypto folks ought to 
appreciate.

* The focus on patents was so low that our patent guy, Ed Taylor, kept 
his office in LA and only came up to Santa Clara a few times a year. 
Mostly he discouraged the filing of patents, and certainly middle 
managers did not encourage engineers to waste time trying to get 
patents. I got one during this time. A friend of mine was told not to 
bother to file for a patent on something that other chip companies later 
(two years later) were trumpetting as their patented invention.

* Things began to change for many reasons.

*First, the entry of the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Koreans into the 
market. They had not be party to the cross-licensing deals.

* Second, some American companies only peripherally involved in chips 
attempted to sue chip companies for violating their patents (a notable 
example being the Hughes Corporations suits against chip companies doing 
ion implantation...Hughes claimed that a patent they had gotten on ion 
implantation meant huge royalties were due them).

* Third, patent portfolios came to be seen as valuable in takeovers, as 
part of the "good will" that could be charged for. Some large companies 
bought small companies just to acquire their patents.

* It is not likely that patents and IP have had much effect on movement 
of people between companies. Just my opinion....I see as much moving as 
ever.

Stanford has gotten pieces of the action from many companies. This shows 
up in their holdings of stocks in those companies, reported on the Form 
144 Insider pages on Yahoo and other places. In the case of CISCO and 
Sun, I don't know all of the details, but there were no lawsuits against 
either. As I said, my understanding is that Stanford said "Go ahead" to 
those seeking to commercialize their projects.

Ah, "push technology," the buzzword of around 1997, just after set-top 
boxes and just before whatever.

And, I would argue, even harder if you DO have a bunch of money to throw 
at it!

(I watched friends burn through $8 million as they sat around thinking 
cool thoughts. More germanely to this list, look at several crypto 
start-ups who threw tens of millions at problems.)

And Sun, like many other successes, had very spartan office arrangements 
in the beginning. Then they got big. And bloated. Now they have an 
entire "campus," a much more campus-like campus than most companies 
have. But their stock is at $4.25 and the end is coming (IMO).

I have differing views on these points. But that's for another time.
