Yes, but under expat tax rates. Cf. the IRS site, tax regs, etc. for 
details.

Something like the first $70K per year of income is not subject to taxes.

Companies routinely protect their overseas employees by tax-protecting 
their offshore earnings. (And the tax protection is protected, so the 
companies protect _that_, etc. Fortunately, simple formulas for infinite 
sequence limits are available.)

As this is not a tax forum, and I'm not going to do research for others, 
consult the Web. Google is your friend.
