Uh, it just occurs to me that I may have misread you. 
The Design Issues in Anonymity and Unobservability is currently being
turned into Springer-Verlag LNCS 2009. So the proceedings aren't online as
a whole yet (indeed, we just submitted our final final draft two weeks
ago). You can find a list of papers at 

http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~hannes/wsprogram.html

our paper is at 
http://www.freehaven.net/doc/berk/freehaven-berk.ps

and searching for authors' home pages or e-mail may reveal other papers.
