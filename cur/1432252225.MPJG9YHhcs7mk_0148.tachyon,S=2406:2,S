Against the Soviet Union in its prime, or against the Nazi
commie alliance, an anarcho capitalist america would have been
in deep trouble, if it had the same level of technology as the
actually existent america had back then.

Against current enemies, not a problem.  Observe the big role
and great effectiveness of "special forces" (small numbers of
high quality espionage style forces).   An anarcho capitalist
america, while it would have trouble fielding big armies, would
probably do special forces operations considerably better than
big government bureacracies do.

Current enemies are not much, because americans have a
technological lead.  Americans have a technological lead
because america is the close to the most capitalist country in
the world, and it is the most capitalist large country.  An
anarcho capitalist America would in time have an even greater
technological lead.
