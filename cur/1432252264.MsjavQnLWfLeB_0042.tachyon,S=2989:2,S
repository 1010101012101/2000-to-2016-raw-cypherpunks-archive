said:
"That's a reasonable position: The White House has never made an 
unequivocal statement against the scheme, and it's possible that America 
could edge toward a situation where the federal government devises an ID 
and orders everyone to carry it at all times. Most European countries

Wouldn't this requirement violate the probable cause requirement for 
seizures of a person which been defined by a series of cases, beginning 
with Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)?
