the beauty of forever on the web, is that if only one finds your reply useful,
 one day, then all not in vain, even when trolled lightly, or with vigor. ;)

thank you! a reasonable summary for certain.


and Jim,

this special ".onion" domain is reserved by Tor, and recently
officially recognized.

when connecting via SocksPort, and requesting connection to a *.onion
host, tor the process handles this hidden service circuit building
internally, and connects the "hidden server" to your client through
this SocksPort connection.

this is why saying "Onions should not resolve" via normal means,
 is another way of saying "Use the Tor network to access that hidden site."

an excellent detailed technical review is here:
 https://ritter.vg/p/tor-vlatest.pdf

---

pedant detour:
 there is DNSPort and TransPort, which allows transparent proxy of
connections. when behind a transparent Tor proxy, DNS will indeed
resolve onions correctly, and your normal browser can reach these
previously unresolvable/unroutable destinations.

see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy
for details and caveats...


best regards,
