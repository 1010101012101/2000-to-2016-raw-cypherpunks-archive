The shittiest part about this is the 7 day notice. (I have +/- 2.5 years worth
of pseudonymous contacts, registrations, software releases, etc which 
I now have 7 days to figure out how to clean up  :P)

Based on that paragraph, it sounds like this was a decision ZKS made a long
time ago. Wow, I've never been fucked as bad as this by any company I
had trusted to "do the right thing". Guess that'll teach me.  And of course 
ZKS isn't even going to be decent enough to provide the option to have nym 
mail forwarded to another address for an interim time. 

Obviously, if the business model isn't sustainable, they have to shut it down. 
However the way ZKS handled the shutdown and in particular their total 
disrespect for their (ex)customer base is absolutely unforgivable.
