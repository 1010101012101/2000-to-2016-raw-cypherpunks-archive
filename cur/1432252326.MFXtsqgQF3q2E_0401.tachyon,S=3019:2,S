It is being widely reported that the Brazilian parliament has voted 
234 for, 6 against to allow passengers on airplanes to carry firearms 
of .38 caliber or less.  Details are said to be located at 
<http://www.jb.com.br/>.  I've sent an info request to my Brazilian 
and Portuguese speaking subscribers to Freematt's Alerts for 
confirmation and additional newslinks.

Details to follow.

Regards,  Matt-
