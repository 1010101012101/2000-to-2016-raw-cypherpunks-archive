That vote on the Electronic Signature law could be considered a positive.
It's a really lousy law.  It's not a _Digital Signature_ law-- 
there's no crypto involved.  Under this law, "clicking on a button"
is explicitly considered a digital "signature".  
That is very easy to forge.  This law opens up whole new vistas for
identy theft and abuse.   Maybe Paul has a clued-in person on his staff?
