My personal rule of thumb is that I don't say anything both online 
and off that I wouldn't mind seeing on the front page of the local 
paper.  I can remember being at a CFP a few years ago and having some 
beer and pretzels with some guys from the CIA who read my list.  Then 
later I went to a party at Declan's home and ran into a few more Feds 
and they commented on how much they liked my list.  My general 
impressions-  The CIA and NSA people were bright and on the ball but 
the FBI guys seemed more like your run of the mill cop types.  The 
Custom's guy seemed alright too, we walked out together and as we 
were walking down the street (In Washington, DC at night- Declan's 
'hood seemed safe enough) I noticed he had a fanny pack on.  I 
commented that at least we'd be safe if attacked-  But he opened it 
up and just showed me his badge and wallet.  He said left his gun at 
home as it was too heavy to carry around.

I thought everybody knew the feds read this stuff?

Regards,  Matt-
