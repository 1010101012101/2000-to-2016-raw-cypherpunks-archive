The feeling I get is that Oregon combines the worst of California and
the 'classic Western' states.

California has a highly intrusive, interventionist government, but this
is leavened by the liberalism of many of the positions it holds. Thus,
while California is really bad for some individual rights (such as the
RKBA), it's fairly libertine on others (such as lifestyles).

In the 'classic Western' states (I'm thinking of Wyoming, Montana,
Nevada, Idaho, etc, and I don't claim to be really well informed on this),
while the general population holds pretty rightwing views, this is
leavened by a strain of semi-libertarianism in the government, in the
'don't intevene' sense.

Oregon seems to combine the worst of both, along with none of the
good points - a highly intrusive California style government, with
very rightwing views.
