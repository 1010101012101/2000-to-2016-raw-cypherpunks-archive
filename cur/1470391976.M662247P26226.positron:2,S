Wow. That's very cool.

But they can't detect them.

But they must exist?

If so, that's really wild. Sounds like physicist are on some serious
psycho visual stimulants.

Sounds like a different meaning for the term 'imaginary'... and that
Wikipedia may need to be updated to reflect this imaginary fact.

You know, soon we'll be tapping subspace with polymorphic entangled
photonic array DNA implants into the 98% junk or "non coding" pairs, and
then they'll be telling us our DNA was actually better all along and
just requires a few histone induced nucleotide activations.

After all, DNA stores information so perhaps twins have a number of
entangled photon pairs shared between their medalla strands which allow
them to each observe the other simultaneously, but only when the other
is also observing...
