   Where are the crypt source blackboards?

Fellow Cypherpunks,

   It occurs to me that in mailing lists that concern crypt programming
there should be posts with programs and large code fragments of crypt
source lines. I don't remember seeing any such on Cypherpunks and the
little I've checked out on Coderpunks I haven't seen any there either.

   I know that in Amerika it may or may not be illegal to post crypt
source code, but I would think that foreign members would post crypt
code. So, where is it? For Amerikans, they should at least be posting
links to source code "blackboards" in order to develope crypt code. I
don't even find that.

   To what degree is the prohibition of posting crypt source code having
a negative impact on crypt developement and deployment?

Yours Truly,
Gary Jeffers

BEAT STATE!!!!
