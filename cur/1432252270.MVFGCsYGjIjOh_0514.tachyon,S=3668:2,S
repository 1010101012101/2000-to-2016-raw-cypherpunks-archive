Oh, come on - back when we were that age, instead of old geezers,
we did our share of staying up late at night dancing and consuming
various mind-altering substances*.   These kids are staying up a 
bit later, and some of their drugs hadn't been invented in our day,
and their music is no worse than some of the garage rock bands...

And while they're not walking 20 miles through the snow to school
like we did, it's San Francisco, so they're still walking 20 blocks
uphill both ways to the nearest parking space.

yet...]
