Some reasonable legal advice on the c'punk list!  Amazing!

M. Unicorn, I could sugest a few valid reasons for posting it on
freenet:

"Your honor, freenet is a system which backs up data on multiple
servers.  I thought the document was extremely important, and that was
the most reasonable way I could find to ensure that it is not lost."

"Your honor, this document describes the situation in Tibet/democracy
in Taiwan/Falun Gong, and I wanted to make it available to the
citizens of China, and Freenet seemed like the most reasonable way."

"I wanted to publish it.  Freenet is an alternative to using a more
expensive or difficult web server."

Would some of these be convincing to a judge?

Btw, if the defendant had any reason to believe that the document
might soon be the subject of a court proceeding, and he then placed it
out of his control in a trust, he would be in just as much trouble as
if he had used any c'punk methods.  It would be called a "fradulent
conveyance", right?
