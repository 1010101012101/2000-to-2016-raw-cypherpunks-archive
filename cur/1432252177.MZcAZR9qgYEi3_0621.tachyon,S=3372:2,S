Right, the Declaration of Independance starts off with "We hold these
truths to be self evident..." and lists that some rights are inalienable,
and granted to us just because we are human, so therefore they apply to
all humans everywhere...

Well, in practice between what was done to Native Americans, and African
Americans didn't exactly reflect that... but they got away with it by
changing the definition of what's a human being...

Just like now they're getting away with removing all of one's rights by
defining them as a "terrorist" or "illegal combattant" instead of as a
human being, etc.
