the first commercial quantum computer company is launching a demo
online in mere weeks with an adiabatic qubit pool of 16 or 64 qubits,
to scale to many thousands by 2008.

this isn't gate model, but it doesn't matter. see
http://dwave.wordpress.com/2006/09/14/a-special-treat/ for details.

so, who wants to map discrete log to max clique representation?  we
can split the processing cost as well as the profits on sale of the
verisign root...
