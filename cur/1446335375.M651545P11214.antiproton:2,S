Claiming that an assassination market solves the defense problem in
Friedman's utilitarian and general anarchocapitalism is very bold.
You have a betting pool for killing people.

You don't have any sort of collection of funds that protect a society
from something like everyday crime, you've merely got a hit market.

Your idea is effectively crowdsourcing, which in many ways could be
very useful for Friedman's hard problem. However, while remaining
purely voluntary in nature, what differentiates your assassination
market from:

	- taxes (compulsory collection of small amounts from many)
	- hits (a few wealthy individuals take out a contract)

Moreover, you still are facing the 'free-rider' problem, where, "if
everybody else in my community payed a dollar to kill this guy, why
should I have to do so, it is only -1 dollar.

I am neither trying to discredit nor insult your ideas; just curious
if you could expound upon how an assassination market fits into
defense in a free society.

This video might help set the context:

PS, though I may sound like one, not a statist.
