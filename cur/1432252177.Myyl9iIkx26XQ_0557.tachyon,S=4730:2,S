Some people think list-servs are a form of torture :-)

The main thrust of destroying the constitution was completed in the 70's
with RICO and polished off with the WoD in the 80's.  By 2000 even some
congress critters were noticing and were actually trying to slow down
forfiture law.  But it's all out the window now, and the precedents are
set.  The "illegal combatant" fiction is just one more small step in a few
decades of totalitarian crap.

Fortunatly dictators are incompetent idiots.  It's not that hard to stay
out of their way.  But it seems to me it's safe to assume the US is a
totalitarian state and act accordingly.  Be a bureaucrat to survive,
and maybe we'll get a Gorbachev to tear the whole thing down.  Only
another 40 years to go!

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
