Because they are afraid they will need to get out quickly so they want
to turn goods into money if they can.   Also there is the price-of-meat
effect which has often been observed in Africa, as much as 18 months
before a famine gets serious.  If people are running out of feed for
their livestock (for example in a drought)  they sell them rather than
watch them starve. So the price of meat goes down. This can also
temporarily depress the price of other food (which, of course, doesn't
help peasant farmers or nomads who graze their cattle).
