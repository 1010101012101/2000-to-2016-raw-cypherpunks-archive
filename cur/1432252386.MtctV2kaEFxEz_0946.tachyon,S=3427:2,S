Defunct Spy Satellite Falling From Orbit
By EILEEN SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
http://www.salon.com/wires/ap/2008/01/26/D8UDPIDG0_dead_satellite/index.html
Jan 26th, 2008 | WASHINGTON -- A large U.S. spy satellite has lost  
power and propulsion and could hit the Earth in late February or  
March, government officials said Saturday.

The satellite, which no longer can be controlled, could contain  
hazardous materials, and it is unknown where on the planet it might  
come down, they said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity  
because the information is classified as secret.

"Appropriate government agencies are monitoring the situation," said  
Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council.  
"Numerous satellites over the years have come out of orbit and fallen  
harmlessly. We are looking at potential options to mitigate any  
possible damage this satellite may cause."

He would not comment on whether it is possible for the satellite to be  
perhaps shot down by a missile. He said it would be inappropriate to  
discuss any specifics at this time.

A senior government official said that lawmakers and other nations are  
being kept apprised of the situation.
