    Nader Sends Privacy Quiz to Bush and Gore
    posted by cicero on Monday October 09, @02:22PM
    from the never-liked-those-safeway-discount-cards-anyway dept.

    Vergil Bushnell of Ralph Nader's presidential campaign just
    sent us news about a privacy survey. Turns out the Green Party hopeful
    wants to nail down where rivals George W. Bush and Al Gore stand on
    things like supermarket videocameras and marketing by Internet service
    providers. Unfortunately, Ralph doesn't include any questions
    exclusively on the topic of government surveillance, such as
    wiretapping, Echelon, or Carnivore -- which are precisely the areas
    the next Oval Office occupant can do the most to reform. Nader is,
    typically, focused only on corporate wrongdoing. His privacy survey is
    attached below.

The survey:
