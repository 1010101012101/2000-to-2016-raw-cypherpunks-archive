Oddly, putrescine is used by cell biologists as something used to keep
cell
cultures alive.  They use an odd, not fully characterized brew,
including
serum.

Skatole and indole are reportedly the odors in feces.

Interesting that the .mil doesn't use the riot control agents used by
domestic pigs
because the .mil is prohibited from doing so.  (.mil idea of nonlethal
force
is warning shots..)

It would be useful to find odors that freak horses but are not noticed
by humans, for dealing with pigs on horses.  Predator-urine odors have
been discussed here in the past but are hard to obtain.  Putrescine,
skatole
(and skunk) are cheap from chem houses; haven't looked on ebay :-)
