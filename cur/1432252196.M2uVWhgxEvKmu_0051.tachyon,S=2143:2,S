Schwarzenegger Hits Snag at Polling Place
By Robert Salladay, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger showed up to his Brentwood
neighborhood polling station today to cast his ballot in the special
election  and was told he had already voted.

Elections officials said a Los Angeles County poll worker had entered
Schwarzenegger's name into an electronic voting touch screen station in
Pasadena on Oct. 25. The worker, who was not identified, was testing the
voting machine in preparation for early voting that began the next day.

Somehow, Schwarzenegger's name was then placed on a list of people who
had already voted, said Conny B. McCormack, the Los Angeles County
registrar.

Schwarzenegger's aides were informed of the problem when they arrived
this morning to survey the governor's polling station. The poll worker
told the governor's staff he would have to use a "provisional" ballot
that allows elections workers to verify if two votes were made by the
same person. McCormack said the poll worker did the correct thing.
