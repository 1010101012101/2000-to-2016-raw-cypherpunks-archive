Just a few amusing points:

So they try each one until they get a success? This doesn't raise the bar 
by much!

Web bugs? Really???  Sophisticated users don't allow HTML rendering 
casually - web bugs make the entirely assinine assumption that the entire 
universe is using outlook or it's equivalent.  Bad assumption!  Add to 
that the fact that deep packet inspection systems can and are set up 
specifically to catch these "tricks", and it should be obvious that secure 
(really secure, not just *labelled* "secure*) installations won't even 
allow that web bugged document to cross a monitored wire.

"Surprising"?  That's a contextual question unlikely to be successfully 
modeled on a machine.

A *** 100% *** accuracy rate that also has an ERROR rate?  Someone needs 
to go back to school.

Ahhhh.... "When Harley Was One" returns for a repeat engagement!  Really, 
this was a an idea that had statistically significant accuracy in the 
70's, when users were extremely limited in numbers, and access to 
particular machines were known in advance.  In today's dektop laden world 
the chance of it being useful to anyone other than the vendor who is paid 
to reimplement it is close to nil.

This has been in place for years now - how well has it done so far? Why 
does nyone believe the numbers will change?

The real question is why do "social networking" sites get access to secure
environments in the first place?  Does the USG Dept. of Hall Monitors
really need a Facebook page?  Really?

Lastly, re: Stuxnet "leaks" - are they serious?  Stuxnet's ancestry goes 
all the way back to the 80's Air Force contracts handed out through 
Battelle.  Hardly a secret: at one point they were actually advertising 
for writers on early Prodigy!

The single rational point is that there is incredible overclassification, 
and virtually no declassification - unless politically expedient, in which 
case "super-duper-above tippy-top secret" secrets get suddenly 
declassified the day before a politically convenient press conference.
