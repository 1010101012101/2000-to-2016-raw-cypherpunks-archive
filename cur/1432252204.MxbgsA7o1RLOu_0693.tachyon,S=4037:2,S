That I didn't know. I've been under the impression that most failed cloning
attempts result in a miscarriage. But, it really doesn't affect my point --
if we think that starting a pregnancy known to end in unhealthy babies gives
the government a reason to intervene and incarcerate, then we also have to
apply the same standard to those who smoke/use dope/live unhealthily during
normal pregnancy. That is what I meant by the "unborn babies", the view that
we should think of foetuses as first hand citizens with constitutional
protection that is being violated when they're "made unhealthy".

Yep. That's even worse.

That I can relate to. The point was less about whether cloning is ethical
than about the right of the government to stop it.
