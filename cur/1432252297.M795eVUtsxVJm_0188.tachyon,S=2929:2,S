Uh, you *really* have no idea how much the black hat community is 
looking forward to TCPA.  For example, Office is going to have core 
components running inside a protected environment totally immune to 
antivirus.  Since these components are going to be managing 
cryptographic operations, the "well defined API" exposed from within the 
sandbox will have arbitrary content going in, and opaque content coming 
out.  Malware goes in (there's not a executable environment created that 
can't be exploited), sets up shop, has no need to be stealthy due to the 
complete blockage of AV monitors and cleaners, and does what it wants to 
the plaintext and ciphertext (alters content, changes keys) before 
emitting it back out the opaque outbound interface.

So, no FUD, you lose :)
