   No, it went to the correct address. I've set up and run majordomo lists, so
am fairly familiar with the procedure. The problem is that my email server sits
on an ameritech dsl line, and in the last year or so, a number of domains have
begun rejecting email from such. Some because it's a "block of IPs used for home
dsl lines", some because "someone on your network has been sending spam", etc. 
   IIRC, didn't you yourself have a problem awhile back mailing to lne.com? I
haven't been able to mail to it for a long time, but stayed subscribed because
of Eric's good filter, and just posted thru another node. 
    With other domains, like new.rr.com that reject mail from my server, I just
map it to go thru the ameritech smtp server, which works but is annoying. At
this point there are eight domains I've had to do that with. Could have done it
with lne.com too, of course, but prefered to not have my posts to cpunks going
thru the ameritech server with it's (probably) attendent carnivore box. Maybe
that's irrelevant -- maybe they have it on the gateway routers instead.
