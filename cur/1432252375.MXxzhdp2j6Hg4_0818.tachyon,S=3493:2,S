The cpunk manditory goal is hyperbole, Declan, newsworthiness, 
waste not proffering unreasonable restraint else you get Brill-filed. 
Oops, Br*lled. Headlines are the content misidentified. Watch
the initiation here of subject lines. Use k*ll, win a diss.

Many went to jail of corporate promises of riches, none to gaol, 
one a daredevil repeat offender, thanks to you and me and 
Jessica Wahup, and 60 Minutes, and the Fedparsers of fine 
literature, paper servants, and lop-sided witness list. 

If the timeservers had been decently ignored none would have 
gone to the pokey, none would have believed the promises of
riches, but why not when non-jail and the stock market are 
looking so bleak. 

All the prime intellects of world-class dissent and fraud are 
in jail, mostly US federal, and if you're not that tells the
full story of who rats. Gnaw, you say, not me.
