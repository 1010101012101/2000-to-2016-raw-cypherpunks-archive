Not with 802.11 anything will it be 'clear across town'. A few hundred
yards w/ 802.11b and maybe a mile with 802.11a. Now if you're talking
directional then it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to ask "Where does
that nifty parabolic point? Why, at that other nifty parabolic. Well,
gentlemen, how's 'bout we take 'em both down?"

If you want distance you'll either have to add an illegal final or else
use packet or some other mechanism (probably illegaly as well).
