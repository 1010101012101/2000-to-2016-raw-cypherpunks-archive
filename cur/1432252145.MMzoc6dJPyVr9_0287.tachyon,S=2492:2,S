Yes.  Big ass toys for a bunch of boyz without brainz :-)  And remember,
"Ivy Bells" technology won't work here.

That aside, I'm not arguing that it is un-doable, I am arguing that it is
so difficult that it must be reserved for only those "special cases" where
the risk/cost/benefits can all be balanced out (and where there is some
backhaul available).

Attempting to do this on a universal scale, just won't, well, *scale*.
Not yet.  I am looking eagerly towards entangled photons though, just to
be sure we never reach the point of scalability  ;-)
