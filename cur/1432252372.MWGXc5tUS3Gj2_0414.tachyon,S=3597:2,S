    Justice Department Carnivore Review a Sham?
    posted by cicero on Thursday October 19, @05:44PM
    from the say-could-it-be-an-election-year? dept.

    Dick Armey, House majority leader and Republican firebrand, is once
    again making trouble for the Clinton administration. Armey this
    afternoon sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, saying that
    the Justice Department's review of Carnivore appears somewhat less
    than objective: "I have questioned the independence of this review.
    Several in the media have questioned this review. Several universities
    refused to submit review proposals because, in their opinion, the
    review process was unfair." Having the supposedly secret names of the
    government-affiliated reviewers revealed last month sure didn't help.
    Neither did the information in the Carnivore documents obtained under
    the Freedom of Information Act. (Armey's letter is below.)

The letter:
