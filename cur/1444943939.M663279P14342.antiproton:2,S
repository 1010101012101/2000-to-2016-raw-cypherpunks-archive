I don't know about the specific products you mentioned, but it would be tri=
vial to build an intermediate product to protect the products from each oth=
er. =C2=A0USB consists of four connections: =C2=A0GND, V+, and two datas. =
=C2=A0Aside from adding some intermediate series resistors of relatively lo=
w value, perhaps a few tens of ohms., diodes (silicon rectifier and perhaps=
 Zener) would easily shunt over-voltages and block them. =C2=A0Obviously, t=
here would be a limit to what a given protection system would protect again=
st: =C2=A0Apply a 1000-volt, 10-amp power supply between V+ and ground, and=
 SOMETHING is going to die! =C2=A0But the 'threat model' is far simpler for=
 real-world dangers.
The tricky part is that you are supposed to be able to USE the power provid=
ed through the V+ pin for external devices. =C2=A0That's a convenience, but=
 it is also somewhat of a danger. =C2=A0Who knows how much protection is al=
ready built-in to a typical computer's USB ports? =C2=A0A good 1000-volt PI=
V silicon diode in series with V+ would prevent an external circuit from fo=
rcing positive current into that pin. =C2=A0Similarly, another 1-amp diode,=
 connected to the V+ and GND, backwards, would prevent V+ from being pulled=
 appreciably below ground. =C2=A0Placing a 20 ohm resistor outboard of thes=
e diodes would limit current flow, etc. =C2=A0The trick is that you might w=
ant to use the entire capability of voltage and current from that USB port,=
 without IR (voltage loss over a resistor or diode) loss. =C2=A0
There are also devices called "opto-isolators" (also called "opto-couplers"=
) which could be used to provide well over 1000 volt isolation to the data =
signals themselves. =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =
