Not cheap but within reach. If someone gets serious I could get advice
about equipment and methods from a friend who did this sort of testing
for years.

If you don't have a Faraday cage and a spectrum analyzer and you still
want a rough idea of how noisy your device is you can tune an AM radio
to a vacant space between stations, crank up the volume, and listen for
your device's noise. Turn it on and off, press some buttons, you can
actually make some pretty good correlations between what you hear and
what your equipment is doing. 

There will probably be some nice configurable SW radios soon. I don't
know about sensitivity or noise problems that might go along with this
but it seems pretty interesting. Maybe someone who knows more could
comment.
