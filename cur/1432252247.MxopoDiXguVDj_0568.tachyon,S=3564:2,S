Eric, I think you could nuance this a bit.

Ryan isn't supporting Bush's little war - the military
has plenty of comm channels for C&C which Ryan wouldn't be 
allowed near.

What he's doing is supplying US soldiers with an independent,
uncensored and unreviewed channel through which they can find
out outside views of the war, information which their superiors
won't pass down to them, and a means by which they can
pass back their own views and opinions. Frankly, I'm suprised
the brass are letting him do it.

How do you think the prison abuse photos got back to the US 
media?

Would you rather the soldiers rely on Stars & Stripes for info
on the changing situation back home?

If anything, what Ryan's doing advances the so-called
'cypherpunk agenda' more than anything being done at the
ideologicaly pure but practically insignificant Sealand.

Just my opinions....
