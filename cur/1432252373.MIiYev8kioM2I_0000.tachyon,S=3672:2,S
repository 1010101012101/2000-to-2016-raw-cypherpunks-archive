The only thing to stop that is the certificate on the TCPA's built-in
key.  You would have to shave one TCPA chip and use its key in the
virtualized version.  If you distributed that shaved key publicly or
just to too many people, then its compromise would likely be detected
and its power to attest to S/W configuration would be revoked.

However, if you kept the key yourself and used it only at the same
frequency you normally would (for the normal set of actions), then
the compromise could not be detected and you should be able to run
virtualized very happily.

That's one of the main problems with TCPA, IMHO, as a security
mechanism: that its security depends on hardware tamper resistance --
but at the same time, the TPM needs to be a cheap part, so it can't
be very tamper resistant.
