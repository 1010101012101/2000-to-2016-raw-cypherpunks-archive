Here's an introductory message from the group moderator:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, 

I am writing to ask you to join my email list. One of the most important issues facing our nation is the recent terrorist attacks and how our immigration laws contributed to this tragedy. 

In this email list we are discussing the recent terrorist attack on NYC and the PENTAGON. We are discussing the religion of Islam and why so many terrorists are Muslim. We are discussing how legal and illegal immigration played a role in these terrorist attacks. Please join us. We are covering stories that you will not find in your local newspaper, nor anywhere in the mainstream media. 

TO JOIN THIS EMAIL GROUP PLEASE SEND AN EMAIL TO THIS ADDRESS; 
Anti_Immigration-Subscribe@yahoogroups.com 
AND YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THIS EMAIL LIST. 

OR JUST SEND A  "REPLY" TO THIS EMAIL AND YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THIS LIST.

I started this Yahoo email list for the purpose of discussing the legal and illegal immigration that is threatening to overwhelm America and destroy our Republic. Did you know that there are over 60 MILLION immigrants living in America today who were not born in America? That is a huge number. I contend that it is not good for the future of America to continue accepting such huge numbers of immigrants from every third world nation on earth. Do you agree? Please join us. 

This is a moderated group and the volume of email in this list is intentionally kept to a very low number of emails per day (usually less than 3 or 4 per day weekly average). I pledge to never overfill your email box with too many emails. Please join this List and invite your friends join also. 

So that you will know exactly where I am coming from I wrote the following;
