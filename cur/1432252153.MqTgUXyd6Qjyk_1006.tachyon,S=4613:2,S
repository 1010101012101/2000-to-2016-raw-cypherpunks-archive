There are many, many news reports about November 17th, this coming 
Friday, being the deadline for all absentee ballots. This from 
election officials, state legislators, reporters, legal scholars, etc.

So, yes, I would say that there must obviously be other language on 
this. If not, then you could have the journalistic scoop of the 
century, er, for a few days, until bigger bombshells fall.

And this is the same situation, more or less, in other states. 
Language about ballot envelopes being _postmarked_ on or before 
Election Day.
