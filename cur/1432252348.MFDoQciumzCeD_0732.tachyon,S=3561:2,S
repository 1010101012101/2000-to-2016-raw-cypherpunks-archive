Tor 0.2.0.35 fixes a big bug that was causing Tor relays with dynamic
IP addresses to disappear from the network. It also fixes a rare crash
bug on fast exit relays.

https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html

Changes in version 0.2.0.35 - 2009-06-24
  o Security fix:
    - Avoid crashing in the presence of certain malformed descriptors.
      Found by lark, and by automated fuzzing.
    - Fix an edge case where a malicious exit relay could convince a
      controller that the client's DNS question resolves to an internal IP
      address. Bug found and fixed by "optimist"; bugfix on 0.1.2.8-beta.

  o Major bugfixes:
    - Finally fix the bug where dynamic-IP relays disappear when their
      IP address changes: directory mirrors were mistakenly telling
      them their old address if they asked via begin_dir, so they
      never got an accurate answer about their new address, so they
      just vanished after a day. For belt-and-suspenders, relays that
      don't set Address in their config now avoid using begin_dir for
      all direct connections. Should fix bugs 827, 883, and 900.
    - Fix a timing-dependent, allocator-dependent, DNS-related crash bug
      that would occur on some exit nodes when DNS failures and timeouts
      occurred in certain patterns. Fix for bug 957.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When starting with a cache over a few days old, do not leak
      memory for the obsolete router descriptors in it. Bugfix on
      0.2.0.33; fixes bug 672.
    - Hidden service clients didn't use a cached service descriptor that
      was older than 15 minutes, but wouldn't fetch a new one either,
      because there was already one in the cache. Now, fetch a v2
      descriptor unless the same descriptor was added to the cache within
      the last 15 minutes. Fixes bug 997; reported by Marcus Griep.
