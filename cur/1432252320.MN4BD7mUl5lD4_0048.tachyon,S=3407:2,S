Would this be the DHCP working group that on at least 2 occasions 
when I was there, insisted that secure DHCP wouldn't require a secret, 
since DHCP isn't supposed to require "configuration"?

And all I was proposing at the time was username, challenge, MD5-hash
response (very CHAP-like).  They can configure ARP addresses for 
"security", but having both the user and administrator configure a per
host secret was apparently out of the question.
