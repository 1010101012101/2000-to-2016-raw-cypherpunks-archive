Get a clue. The issue is not "get to see Mommy."

Rather, the issue is the holding of 600+ various persons, some of whom 
are very vaguely claimed to be "material witnesses."

An abuse of the Constitution. And I hope some large fraction of those 
600, when they are ultimately released because there are no grounds for 
indefinately imprisoning them, take up flight training.
