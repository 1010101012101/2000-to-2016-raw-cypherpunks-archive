> Why is there still no functional software for the Win32 platform?

Start with the obvious: What purpose would it serve? You say you "need" one, 
why? Why do you need to run a server? The client for Mixmaster is an email 
client. As a result there is no need for a billion mixmaster servers out 
there, since the high bandwidth big mail systems run on UNIX, and those are 
the primary target for Mixmaster, I really don't see the purpose in 
supporting anything else.
