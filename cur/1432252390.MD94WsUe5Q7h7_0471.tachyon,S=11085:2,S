What do you mean by that precisely?
I don't think PGP/GPG/OpenPGP is meant to encrypt private keys on
servers. In what way OpenPG or GnuPG would be linked with keybase.io
private key encryption scheme or algorithms choice? I don't know
everything about OpenPGP standard but I'm pretty sure it doesn't deal
with such things.

Again, what has PGP/GPG/OpenPGP to do with keybase.io good or bad
choices (you don't seem to know anything about that either by the way
:-) regarding encryption of secrets on their servers? I don't get it.
