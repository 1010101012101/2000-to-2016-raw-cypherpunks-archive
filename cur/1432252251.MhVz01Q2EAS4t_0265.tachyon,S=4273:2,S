and you seriously believe you can debunk a point by pointing out that
there's a few assholes among its followers? oh, come on.

"evil" could, I believe, be *defined* as "the term pretty much everyone
uses to describe his or her enemies". on the other hand, I don't know
many people who don't consider themselves righteous, good, etc.

thinking about it, objective is a word that has been abused quite a lot
by virtually any faction in power during a given time. it's not been too
long since the existence of god, heaven and hell was an "objective
fact".
stalins definition of "objectivism", as you repeat it above, is just one
more of those abuses. what you say is merely that he called everyone who
opposed his philosophy by that term. however, in most of the worlds
we're living in today, the label of a thing is seperate from the thing
itself.
