Needless to say, but I will say it anyway, no game company or 
software company or music provider or anyone else will ever put in 
something so arcane as a "stego channel." We have to "get real" on 
these issues.

Fortunately, it isn't needed at all. There is so much bandwidth 
available that no such special channels or provisions are needed.

The average "Kill the son of the Scientology dog in Edmonton, Canada 
on Friday, October 6" crypto message can easily be stegoed in oh so 
many ways. Possibly even in messages to a.r.s.

And the real use of stego is not in sending Usenet- or Napster-like messages.
