Slick UI would be cool, just a shame that's being used as an excuse by
ppl who can't be arsed to do a bit of work.
What's the excuse once it has a nice UI?

As for nobody is using PGP, I think that may be a little overstated -
what you mean is nobody who doesn't give a fuck about privacy is using it=

except the key has been around for quite some time, I did re-sync with
the sks servers yesterday.

No, it hasn't been signed by anyone as I don't have any friends in real
life who give two shits about security as I mix with non-techies offline.=

This is not a difficulty issue, I can't even begin to talk about
encryption with them without them changing the issue to great subjects
such as what was on telly last night.

Oh yeh, some bright spark came up with STARTTLS for encrypting comms
with mail servers but made it optional, not a GPG issue.
However, the metadata issue a big problem for everyone who connects to a
server that isn't owned by them and I suspect really requires a new mail
protocol to resolve.

1) friend network - can't be avoided if you want a system for vouching
for email sender authenticity.
2) That's part of what PGP is about - sender authenticity. My PGP is not
attached to a Gov Issued ID.
