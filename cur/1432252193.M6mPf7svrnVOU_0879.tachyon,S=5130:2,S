Oh no, I just meant the ones people here are recommending most. The ones I had
my eye on to begin with, plus some .40s and others.

Concealed carry it the only way to go, after I iron all the permits out. 

I'm a firm believer in mobile preparedeness: in fact, every day I never leave
home without carrying a complete BOB concealed in a Kate Spade bag. And I mean
fucking EVERYTHING, the true survivalist nutcase works: first aid kit, emergency
rations, flashlight, space blanket, poncho liner, magnesium fire starter, water
purifying tabs, mini-entrenching tool, Swiss army knife, NIOSH-95 filter mask,
nitrile gloves, monocular, grundig shortwave, passport, etc etc. (Full contents
available on request, it would take awhile!)

Since I put some effort into cutting the items' weight, and densely packed and
organized everything into 3 see-through zipper pouches for easy access, I can
actually get away with going much smaller than a lot of the regular
women's handbags you see every day. Total stealth: nobody would ever know it's
not just a regular cute, fashionable purse. Would you believe I've actually 
been complimented on how nice it looks? LOL! If only they knew!

Once upon a time, I lived out of such a stealth bag, minus most all of the cool
stuff. Just because I'm doing well now, I see no reason to deprive myself of a
system that works. It's a nice feeling to know that at the drop of a hat I could
disappear completely off the face of the earth, survive and thrive. And even if
I were separated from my BOB, I've studied primitive skills (shelter, 
firemaking, trapping etc) so I know I'd pull through. With the right attitude
and knowledge, you can live through most anything. 

But then, investing in a solid concealed carry never hurt anything either. :)
