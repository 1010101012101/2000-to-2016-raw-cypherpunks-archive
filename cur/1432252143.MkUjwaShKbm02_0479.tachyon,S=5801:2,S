He initially reached out to Glenn and Laura via Tor (Tails, as I recall
reading). If the NSA has totally pwned Tor, they would arguably have
detected that. We know that they focus on encrypted stuff, and one would
hope that they monitor their staff and consultants.

But then, maybe it's all bullshit. I certainly have no inside info.

He's clearly an American nationalist. He's said repeatedly that he
released stuff through reporters, rather than directly, in order to
reduce the risk of hurting US interests. Is that a "red flag"? I would
have rather seen it all, but de gustibus non est disputandem ;)
