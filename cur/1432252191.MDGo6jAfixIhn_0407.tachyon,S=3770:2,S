Your taxes at work dept; Massive increases in Humint and NSA,etc.2002 
(cryptome)

 >>the intelligence community has got to be better focused on strategic 
intelligence and better positioned to be able to get access to so-called 
plans and intentions, that is, what is going on in the minds of the 
evil-doers, the mischief makers, in order to prevent the crisis. We do not 
want to be just great at sweeping up after the tragedy; we want to stop the 
tragedy before it happens<<

Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad of Malaysia said that the United States 
has been learning from his country how to combat terrorism and that the 
West, which once accused him of trampling on human rights, now is following 
him.
"It's no good taking action after the crime," Mr. Mahathir said. "We have 
to act in anticipation, and not in the usual manner, because having to find 
proof of a crime which has not yet been committed is difficult." Timmy 
preserve us!

 >>Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.<<

Or,when we get called evil-doers,mischief makers and/or pedophile 
pornographers? A Chinese guy just pulled 4 years for a post re.Tienamin 
square.As crypto winters getting nippy I suggest a pre-emptive strike.Soft 
drill fort detrick,anyone theres fair game.No jury would convict.
