Welcome to the twelfth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter=20
that covers what=E2=80=99s happening in the closely-observed Tor community.

Official response to QUICK ANT disclosure
-----------------------------------------

Another round of speculation regarding the attitude of state
surveillance agencies towards the Tor network was provoked by a
slide [1] featured in an edition of the Brazilian current-affairs show
=E2=80=9CFant=C3=A1stico=E2=80=9D, broadcast on September 8th [2]. The slid=
e, leaked as part
of the ongoing Snowden disclosures, appeared to show a tab in the
alleged GCHQ [3] FLYING PIG surveillance interface labelled =E2=80=9CQuery
QUICK ANT =E2=80=94 Tor events QFD=E2=80=9D. Users on Reddit [4] and Twitte=
r [5] began
to suggest possible attacks on Tor that might be managed through such an
interface.

Andrew Lewman posted an official response on the Tor blog [6] in which
he reiterated that =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s not clear what the NSA or GCHQ can=
 or cannot
do=E2=80=9D, and that well-known theoretical attacks against the Tor networ=
k are
clearly described on the project=E2=80=99s FAQ page [7].

He further added that the tool in question was more likely to involve
=E2=80=9Csome =E2=80=98Tor flow detector=E2=80=99 scripts that let them pic=
k Tor flows out of a
set of flows they=E2=80=99re looking at=E2=80=9D than =E2=80=9Canything to =
do with deanonymizing
Tor users, except insofar as they might have traffic flows from both
sides of the circuit in their database.=E2=80=9D

Finally, he remarked that instead of engaging in speculation based on
limited evidence, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99d rather spend our time developing To=
r and
conducting research to make a better Tor.=E2=80=9D

Entry guards and linkability
----------------------------

Leif Ryge pointed out [8] an issue with Tor=E2=80=99s current =E2=80=9Centr=
y guards=E2=80=9D
system, whereby connections entering Tor from different points on the
same network could potentially be linked to an individual user based on
the three entry nodes selected by that user=E2=80=99s Tor client, which rem=
ain
constant for a period of 4-8 weeks [9].

Leif suggested that =E2=80=9Cassuming this is an accurate assessment, would=
n=E2=80=99t
it make sense to maintain separate sets of entry guards for each network
that the user connects from?=E2=80=9D

Nick Mathewson replied [10] with an acknowledgement of the problem and a
number of reasons why simply generating separate sets of guards might
also harm a user=E2=80=99s anonymity: =E2=80=9CYou would *not*, for example=
, want to
maintain a different set of entry guards for every IP that you receive,
since if you did, a hostile DHCP server could feed you new IPs until you
picked a hostile guard. Similarly, if you are a busy traveler who
changes your view of what network you are on hundreds or thousands of
times, your chance of picking a hostile guard would rise accordingly.=E2=80=
=9D
He also pointed out that =E2=80=9Chaving a record in your state file of eve=
ry
network you have visited is not necessarily the best idea either.=E2=80=9D

Nick concluded by mentioning Roger Dingledine=E2=80=99s proposal to lower t=
he
number of entry guards selected by a client to one only, =E2=80=9Cto avoid =
the
property of letting guard choices identify Tor clients=E2=80=9D.

The lifecycle of a new relay: further research needed
-----------------------------------------------------

In response to some confusion on the part of relay operators over the
apparently slow growth in the use of newly-established nodes by clients,
Roger Dingledine posted on the Tor blog [11] a detailed account of how
new relays, and the bandwidth they supply, are gradually integrated into
the Tor network by directory authorities, bandwidth authorities, and
clients themselves. Roger stressed that =E2=80=9Cthe descriptions here are =
in
part anecdotal=E2=80=9D.

Roger outlined the four broad phases that define the development of a
relay within the network, and finished by offering a number of questions
for further research, under a general rubric: =E2=80=9Cwhat do these phases=
 look
like with real-world data?=E2=80=9D If you would like to contribute to the =
Tor
community=E2=80=99s understanding of the interaction between individual rel=
ays
and the network as a whole, please take a look both at the list of
sample questions and at Tor=E2=80=99s publicly-available archive of metrics
data [12], and see what you can find!

Food for thought
----------------

=E2=80=9CBack in the ancient pre-Tor days, at the height of the crypto wars,
Ian Goldberg asked me at Financial Crypto in 1998 why we created onion
routing. Not entirely facetiously I told him that the fascinating
technological problems and the potential to better protect people and
their activities was nice, but the real attraction was to create a
context where people who were sure they should hate each other were
forced to collaborate.=E2=80=9D [13]

Tor help desk roundup
---------------------

The Tor help desk received a request for assistance setting up
Thunderbird to work with Tor. Thunderbird can be made to route
connections through Tor using the TorBirdy add-on. Further information
about using Tor with Thunderbird can be found on the wiki [14].

Another user wrote to comment on the lack of OpenSUSE support on Tor=E2=80=
=99s
rpm package page [15]. There is an open ticket concerning this issue,
but it hasn=E2=80=99t seen activity for some months [16]. A new ticket was
opened that addresses this concern more specifically [17].

Miscellaneous news
------------------

The commitment level for the proposed Tor StackExchange page is hovering
at 88%; it needs to reach 100% before it will be accepted into beta. If
you think you will be able to contribute by answering questions from
current or potential Tor users, please sign up! [18]

Brian Callahan alerted relay operators running FreeBSD and OpenBSD to
the release of ports updated to the new tor 0.2.4.17-rc [19].

Christian Sturm then promptly announced the release of updated packages
for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, illumos, Minix, and =E2=80=9Cother systems
potentially using pkgsrc=E2=80=9D [20].

Karsten Loesing updated tor=E2=80=99s GeoIP database to the newest version =
[21].

Karsten also published the results of his memory usage test on a version
of tor that reports additional statistics, which he conducted using the
Shadow network simulator [22].

Finally, Karsten asked for comments on his proposal to retire the old
method of estimating user numbers on the metrics page over the next few
weeks in favor of a more reliable, more efficient system (which has been
in beta for some time already), and with it to remove the accumulated
data associated with the older method [23].

round-trip time (RTT) measurement, and their efficiency in building
circuits through the Tor network [25].

George Kadianakis asked for comments on his early draft of a proposal
for different methods of migrating the Hidden Service protocol to a more
secure version [26].

George also pushed new versions of obfsproxy (0.2.3) and pyptlib
(0.0.4) [27].

override one of Tor Browser=E2=80=99s anti-fingerprinting measures [29].
