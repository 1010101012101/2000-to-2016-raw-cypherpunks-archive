 >>Yes, but the bigger they are the shorter they survive. It's sort of like

long. <<
Que? Bigger what are? Stable states of anarchy? Lets create a global one

In "age of empires?"trad anarchist theory?Situationalism?Cypherpunks 
list?On this list anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism is often said to be 
the goal-a quote on that from Salon..."No libertarian state, after all, has 
ever existed in the world. (America, incessantly denounced by libertarians 
as a Great Satan of regulation, is, ironically but not surprisingly, much 
closer to being that free state than any other developed nation.) This 
gives libertarianism a futuristic allure that resonates with high-tech 
visionaries -- but it also raises suspicions that the whole thing is a pipe 
dream, a vaporous, almost psychotically elaborate "system" that resembles 
an elaborate science fiction alternate universe, or that plan labored on by 
Swift's Lagadan "projector" for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers. When 
something has never been attempted, it may be because mankind has not 
evolved sufficiently -- or it may be because it can't be. (Of the 
libertarian belief that all social difficulties would vanish if a perfectly 
free market system could be established, the Burkean conservative Russell 
Kirk wrote, "This was very like saying that if only the Sermon on the Mount 
were universally obeyed to the letter, sin would vanish from among men. The 
trouble is that the Sermon on the Mount will not triumph until the end of 
all things earthly. There exist reasons for believing that the ideal 
universal free market is nearly so difficult of attainment.")
Libertarianism's cold, Platonic perfectionism arouses suspicions. (Plato's 
Republic, like the libertarian utopia, is divided hierarchically -- and 
it's a safe bet that few libertarians believe that when the great Free 
Market Future dawns they will find themselves shoveling coal in the Race of 
Iron Steel Mill.) There is something lab-coaty about this philosophy, 
something that conjures up images of '50s scientists with wire-rimmed 
glasses and crew cuts: "3:05. We removed all governmental controls. 
Seventeen subjects died of malnutrition. Three became wealthy. Plague broke 
out in the southwest quadrant. The experiment continued without further 
incident."
