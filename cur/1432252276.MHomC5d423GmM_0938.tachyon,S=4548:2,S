How does a bright guy like you get involved in so much name calling? 
Might it not be possible for you to just stick to the ideas and leave 
the immature behavior at home?   Remember when you libeled physicist 
Laurence Godfrey, in a newsgroup, soc.culture.thai, first on January 
12, 1997, there again later, and subsequently on uk.legal.

Here's an article:

Excerpt NYT article 
http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/yr/mo/biztech/articles/01britain.h 
tml

"Mr. Godfrey's solicitor, Nick Braithwaite, did not return several 
telephone calls today, and it was unclear exactly what the substance 
of the remarks made against Mr. Godfrey was. He is no stranger to 
libel actions. In 1994, a fellow physicist, Philip Hallam-Baker, 
agreed to pay Mr. Godfrey an unspecified amount in damages after Mr. 
Godfrey sued him for libel in connection with a number of postings 
Mr. Hallam-Baker made on the Internet raising doubts about his 
professional competence."

Regards,  Matt-
