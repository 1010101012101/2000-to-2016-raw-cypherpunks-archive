(from /.) http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/eol/
has a good rant by John Walker on how NAT turns
users into consumers.

Also Speak Freely maintenance is ending.  Sic transit
unix to PC secure vox.  Note that PGPfone devel
ended a while ago, unsupporting PC to Mac secvox.
Nautilus is AFAIK PC to PC only.

John is also pessimistic about 1. IPv6 deployment
and 2. the return of NAT'd broadband users to non-consumer
(ie, potential server aka publisher) status.

As always, Walker is worth a read.
