In no way. But in this case Bob does not abide by the same idealism that
bounds Alice and the point is moot. Anarchy brought to its logical
conclusion for all practical purposes precludes hierarchical relationships
between those who share the ideology.

Really, from what little I know about anarchy, I believe its rhetoric
revolves less around the concept of individual rights than it does around
the one of equality. In that context your above emphasis on volition seems
to lose some of its relevance.
