I'd definitely put my money on the latter--he has excellent sources and 
knows a lot of tremendously cool people. For example, you might be 
interested in the following book by a man who used to be on the Church 
Committee who spoke at Steele's conference a couple of months ago. Serious 
analysis by a brilliant thinker and a real pro. Worth a look!


Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information

Gregory F. Treverton

Description
Government intelligence today has many targets, numerous consumers - not 
all of whom are American or in the government - and too much information, 
most of which is not owned by the US government and of widely varying 
reliability. In this bold and penetrating study, Gregory Treverton, former 
Vice Chair of the National Intelligence Council and Senate investigator, 
offers his insider's views on how intelligence gathering and analysis must 
change. He suggests why intelligence needs to be both contrarian, leaning 
against the conventional wisdom, and attentive to the longer term, leaning 
against the growing shorter time horizons of Washington policy makers. He 
urges that the solving of intelligence puzzles tap expertise outside 
government - in the academy, think tanks, and Wall Street - to make these 
parties colleagues and co-consumers of intelligence, befitting the changed 
role of government from doer to convener, mediator, and coalition-builder.


Chapter Contents
1. The imperative of reshaping; 2. The world of intelligence beyond 2010; 
3. The militarization of intelligence; 4. Designated readers: the open

intelligence of policy; 7. A reshaped intelligence.
