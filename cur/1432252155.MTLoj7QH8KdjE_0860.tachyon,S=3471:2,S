Apples and oranges.  There is a world of difference between targeting
innocents (the focus of my post) and targeting military targets with
resultant innocent casualties.  If a gunman grabs a human shield and starts
shooting at me, I will (regrettably) return fire.  Hopefully, I'll hit the
bad guy and not the innocent human shield, but if I do hit the hostage, the
moral responsibility is on bad guy, not me.
