Dear Friend,

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : ''Making over half million dollars in about a years 
time from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time'' 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
I RECOMMEND YOU PRINT THIS LETTER FOR EASIER READING.
================================================================
Before you say ''Bull,''please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing 
about on the news 
lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an 
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. The 
show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the 
participation in 
the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some 
mega 
bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost.” DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & 
RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER 
THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many 
times before but 
each time I passed on it. I am so glad I  finally joined just to see what one could expect in 
return for the minimal 
effort and money  required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, 
with money still 
coming in.''
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:
================ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below================= 
For each  report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE 
ORDERING 
and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to 
the report. 
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER 
in case of 
any mail problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need 
all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 
5=$25.00.
=== Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 
different individuals. Save 
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people 
who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something 
happen to your 
computer.
=== IMPORTANT: DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each 
report, or their 
sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' 
or you will lose out 
on majority  of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it 
does not work if 
you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,  it will NOT work !!! 
People have tried 
to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it 
does not work this 
way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try 
to change anything 
other  than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, 
honesty reaps the 
rewards!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & 
address of the 
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt 
counting their fortune.

2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 

4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE

MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
================================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and  save it on your
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you lose any data. To assist you with marketing 
your business on  the 
Internet,  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information 
which includes how 
to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of  free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary 
methods to get this  venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
================================================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and  we will assume You 
and those involved 
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.02% 
response (the 
response could be much better but  lets just say it is only 0.02%. Also many people will send 
out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out 
only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.02% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by 
sending out 5,000 
e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.02% responded with 
orders. That's 100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.02% 
response to that is 
1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 
0.02% response to 
that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-
mails. The 0.02% 
response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5  THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 
EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). 

Your total income  in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 
5..... 
$500,000........ Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST 
POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A 
LOT OF 
MONEY !
================================================================
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 
5,000 YOU 
MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
1/4 of those people 
mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet 
worldwide and 
counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!
METHOD # 2 :  BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
================================================================
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a 
lot of free ads on the Internet will easily  get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1 
and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail 
them the Report 
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee 
that the e-mail they 
send out, with your name and address on it, will be  prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the 
report. 
====================== AVAILABLE REPORTS==================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash 
(U.S. 
CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed 
by wrapping it  in at 
least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you 
are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for  Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue 
sending e-mails until you 
do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 
orders or more for 
REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  Once 
you have received 100 
or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for 
you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name 
is moved down 
on
the list, you are placed in front of a different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK  of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering 
from you. IF 
YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS 
AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from 
this business !!!
================================================================
 FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your 
life, with NO RISK 
and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. 
Do Not 
change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. This is a legitimate program that 
honestly works like 
a charm. If we all would open our eyes and see the possibilities, then we would understand 
that we can help 
each
other get rich, and live life to the fullest. You have nothing to lose, and the world to gain. 
LET’S HELP EACH 
OTHER. Do not delay! Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and 
address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the 
people you send this 
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and  your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the 
more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given 
you the ideas, 
information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU 
NOW!

“I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given 
it a try.  Of course, 
I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again 
by someone 
else.......11 months passed then it luckily came again.....I did not delete this one!  I made 
more than$490,000 on 
my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.”
