SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Police have arrested a California man in connection 
to a burglary in which a computer with sensitive information about Wells 
Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC - news) customers was stolen, officials said on 
Wednesday. 

(snip)

Investigators traced the computer to Krastof when he logged onto his own 
America Online account at home through one of the stolen computers, White 
said. That enabled authorities to connect the computer's Internet Protocol 
address, a number that identifies a computer on the Internet, to Krastof's 
home address through his AOL account, White said. 

(snip)

My guess that there was some sort of application (maybe an internally based IM 
client) that "phoned home" when the thief started up the computer.

Or at least I hope ....
