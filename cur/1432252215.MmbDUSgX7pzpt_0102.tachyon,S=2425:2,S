Robust De-anonymization of Large Datasets
(How to Break Anonymity of the Netflix Prize Dataset)

Abstract

We present a new class of statistical de-anonymization attacks against high-dimensional micro-data,
such as individual preferences, recommendations, transaction records and so on. Our techniques are
robust to perturbation in the data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversarybs background knowledge.
We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains anonymous
movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the worldbs largest online movie rental service. We
demonstrate that an adversary who knows only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily
identify this subscriberbs record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the source of
background knowledge, we successfully identified the Netflix records of known users, uncovering their
apparent political preferences and other potentially sensitive information.
