Something in the way you write that reminds me of my brother.  He 
watches Television.  He doesn't watch actual shows.  He flips to 
a random channel, watches it for 15-30 seconds, flips to another 
random channel, watches *that* for 15-30 seconds, repeat for hours...
He's not interested in actual shows, but he is fascinated by 
Television - what kind of images people compose, what kind of ads 
different channels have, choices in background music and how 
they've changed over years of soap operas, fashions in body type 
represented by shows of different eras, etc. It forms some kind 
of gestalt to him, some fairly sensible idea of how the filters 
on human experience are and how they've been changing. 

Me, it just drives bugfuck.

>Who reads this stuff?

The literate subsection of society has clearly become more 
diverse, during the same period in which the aliterate have 
become less so.  This is interesting.

>Very few current books actually are _important_. 

Perhaps true, but no two people have the same list.

Collided, I'd have said, in the last ten years.  It's just that 
we can't fully see the consequences yet.
