Magnesium seawater battery - its pretty much bronze age techmology -

<http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/191_IR/chap_03/c3_5.htm>Can melt down
alloy car wheels for a start. Otherwise AZ61 alloy is hardly a controlled
substance. Only other thing you need is  twisted wire titanium brushes with
carbon fiber bristles. Easily made in some South Asian sweatshop, with
barely a record kept.

The electronics is the tricky stuff, but once you get the first one working,
replicating to 1000s is easy enough. Again, south asian sweatshops, or
buying a middle tier chinese RC toy maker isnt out of reach for the South
American combinas.
