They caught my 14 year old ass in the Jersey City freightyard with an
older friend (16) and I didn't make it... But I got my licks in anyway!

Note that Jill Stein is going for the Democratic Party's throat b/c
#DNCLeaks:

    I said it once today, I'll say it again: #BernieMustDisavow the DNC.
    #DNCLeaks make it obvious there was no room for the revolution.

She also invited him to join the Green Party.

The Hill's lede on Twitter:

    "Jill Stein invites Sanders to join the Green Party and "continue
    his revolution"


http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/288987-green-party=
-candidate-sanders-should-leave-the-party-that

IF he decides to do that when he speaks at the DNC... ROTF!

The "revolution" starts NOW! (Steve Earle, the Musical Marxist said that)=
