US slaps on the wardriver-busting paint
By Lester Haines (lester.haines at theregister.co.uk)

Security-minded US decorators' supply outfit Force Field Wireless
(http://forcefieldwireless.com) claims to have developed a DIY solution to
the international menace of marauding geek wardrivers - DefendAir paint
"laced with copper and aluminum fibers that form an electromagnetic shield,
blocking most radio waves and protecting wireless networks".

According to a South Florida Sun Sentinel report
(http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/local/sfl-sbgizmos09jan09,0,2849380.story?coll=sfla-business-headlines),
one coat of the water-based paint "shields Wi-Fi, WiMax and Bluetooth
networks operating at frequencies from 100 megahertz to 2.4 gigahertz",
while two or three applications are "good for networks operating at up to
five gigahertz".

Simple as that. Of course, there are a few downsides to this miracle
product. First up, you must be careful how you slap it on. Force Field
Wireless rep Harold Wray admits that "radio waves find leaks", while the
company asks users to be aware that the product "must be applied
selectively" otherwise it "might hinder the performance of radios,
televisions and cell phones".

Reg readers can make of this apparent contradiction what they will, and are
asked to direct any technically-based sceptisicm to Force Field Wireless,
and not to Vulture Central. Thankyou.

Another snagette is that DefendAir is available only in grey - a fact
sufficient to provoke what is known in the UK as "interior designers'
wobbly". Mercifully, it can be used as a primer, so those who require
wireless peace of mind plus bold fashion statement can rest assured that
coat of "Wardriver Crimson" will cover it up quite nicely.

It only remains for us to say that DefendAir costs a cool $69 per gallon
(US gallon, presumably). Still, that's a small price to pay for the
absolute certainty that High School students are not right now sitting
across the street recording your credit card details for later deployment
in the online purchase of pornography, drugs and semi-automatic weapons. .
