I'm aware of one person, living in Oakland (CA) who simply ignored the 
annoying form. I'm told the Census people came to his apartment several 
times but were unable to even reach his apartment door because the 
apartment building had been hardened with security features which prevented 
access by burglars, panhandlers, solicitors, etc., so they were forced to 
leave notes requesting compliance, which didn't meet with a lot of 
sympathy. I'm also aware of a similar example in Mountain View, CA - it's 
pretty hard for them to bother people who use even elementary measures to 
protect their privacy and security.

They can get all the data they need from Social Security, drivers' license, 
and ID card data. The mandatory Census is a ridiculous waste of time and 
money. Sure, it's interesting to learn about the demographic makeup of the 
country, but that's not a project that needs to happen at gunpoint. (Nor 
should it, if they're hoping for accurate results.)
