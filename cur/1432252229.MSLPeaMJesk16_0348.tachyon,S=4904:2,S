Let me elaborate:

  Panels, meetings, testimony...where's the research? What is even being
studied here? This sounds like a "problem" fumbling around until it
reaches a critical consensus of definition. The opportunities for
shenanigans, for good or ill,  should be evident. 

 Personally, I was a horny little fucker as a kid. I won't say when
exactly, but the the lurid pulp covers at my eye level at the time tended
to focus on Ilsa the she-bitch of the SS S&M type themes. I DID find this
somewhat disturbing, if fascinating. It was not till sometime later that a
friend and I discovered his father's Playboy collection (my old man kept
his stash a lot better hidden)  and I was exposed to more gratifyingly wholesome 
images. I can't say that any of it did me any harm, though. 

 Anecdotal, to be sure, but it tallies with my observations of children in
recent years, whether watching cable, surfing, or whatever. I know there
are folks who won't abide it, but they will be better served by
Consumer Reports. 

And so I've said my say,
jbdigriz
