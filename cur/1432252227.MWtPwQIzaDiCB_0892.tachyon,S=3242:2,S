When even tell them that? I know that it's easier not to talk to the
Feds when you've got a team of lawyers on your side, and I don't
really (for once) mean to pick on Jim, but I'm not sure what such
polite chitchat accomplishes. What I can imagine is how words --
"bunch of guns" -- can be twisted and used against Tim or other
cypherpunks.
