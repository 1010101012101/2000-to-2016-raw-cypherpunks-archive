"We seem to be approaching something of a "perfect storm" of events, where 
the technology and policies of the Internet are colliding head-on with 
many traditional sensibilities of government."

"Never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and public
plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to
the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always
be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by
predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty."

Joseph Pulitzer, 1907 Speech
