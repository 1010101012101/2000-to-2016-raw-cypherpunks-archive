Subject: Re: [IP] Google's Web Accelerator is a big privacy risk


Dave,

I guess it's going to take some kind of major Google-based privacy
breakdown for people to finally understand what we've been saying.

It doesn't matter how sweet, nice, trusted, or cool a service may
be, the collection and archiving of vast amounts of users' Web
search, e-mail, browsing, and other activities is a recipe for utter
disaster.  Google isn't the only culprit, but they're the big
enchilada so they represent a very major risk.  The only way to
avoid abuse of such data is not to keep it around in the first place.

Google's new Accelerator service ironically appears to wed the source
masking aspects of caches (along with all of the usual problems with
caches both for users and destination sites) to the worst aspects of
Google's highly problematic data archiving policies.

Google is smiling their way into becoming -- probably more through a
bizarre combination of hubris and naivete than purposeful intentions
-- a one-stop surveillance "shopping center" for every lawyer,
police agency, district attorney, government agency, and so on who
wants to know what people are doing on the Internet.

Any entity able to pull a civil, criminal, Patriot/Homeland Security
Act, or other investigatory operation out of their hats, will come
to view Google as the mother lode of user tracking.

Google is making money hand over fist.  In exchange for their
continued prosperity, it's time for lawmakers, regulators, and the
Internet Community at large to demand not only that Google's data
retention policies be made utterly transparent and public, but that
they cease any long-term archival of detailed user activity data.
