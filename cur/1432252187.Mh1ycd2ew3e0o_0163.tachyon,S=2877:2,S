And several months later:

"We are prosecuting the defense attorney for the man convicted last 
month of thinking about planning to possibly travel to South Central to 
try to join a gang. His crime was that he whispered to his clients 
during meetings in the jail, preventing us from tape-recording what 
they they said. Inasmuch as his client was convicted as part of the War 
on Some Drugs and has been transferred to our military prison in 
Guantanamo Bay, we are charging this attorney as an "illegal combatant" 
in this War on Some Drugs."
