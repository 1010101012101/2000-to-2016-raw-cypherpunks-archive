(in response to a topic mentioned in various threads)

I agree that neither CA-verification nor WoT-verification is as
useful as Key Fingerprint-verification for secure communication
between crypto-aware individuals.  After all, CA's can be
subverted and WoT is probably best used as a back-up option
when direct key verification is not possible.  Key Fingerprints
can be verified in both PGP and S/MIME, but neither system
enforces it.  I would prefer for Key Fingerprint-verification
to be more central to the system.
