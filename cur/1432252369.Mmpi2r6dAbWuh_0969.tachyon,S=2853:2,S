Said Tim May:

:-- ZOG lovers like Dershowitz are calling for torturing suspects until
:they confess
:
:(One of our fun ideas in the Sierras was that someone should kidnap
:Dershowitz, torture him for 5 days, release the tape of his various
:"confessions," and then dump his body in front of the Supreme Court.)

:Fuck America. Fuck it dead.

Between all the criminals vs crime-stoppers in the world, not to mention all

Jamesd, can you straighten this out?
