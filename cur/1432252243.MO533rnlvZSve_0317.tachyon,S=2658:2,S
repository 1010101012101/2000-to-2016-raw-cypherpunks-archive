       So why are Tesla's papers still classified anyway? I'm not in any
way arguing Bearden's case, but Tesla did indeed do some pretty
interesting stuff, and if the government finds a need to keep it secret
at this point, that seems more than a bit strange. Unless it's simply
that "once classified, always classified" is their norm, and no one has
taken the trouble to get them to release the stuff?
