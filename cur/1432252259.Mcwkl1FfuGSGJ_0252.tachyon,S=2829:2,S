Speaking of "pseudonymity"...

Yes, again, and I'll keep repeating it until you get it. :-).

For some definitions of "who". To paraphrase a famous sink-washing
president, it depends on "who" you mean by "who". :-)

Fine. Ignore the output thereof as noise, it's probably safe to do so.
Though concordance programs are your friends. Behavior is biometric, after
all. The words you use give you away, and can be filtered accordingly. Ask
someone named Detweiller about that. Or, for that matter, Kaczynski. Or
your trading patterns in market. Just like your "fist", in telegraphy.


>"Perfect pseudonymity" is "can't tie it to meatspace".

See "who", above. Since we haven't quite gotten AI down just yet, that's
good enough for me, though I expect, like Genghis, and not True Names,
we'll figure out that "intelligence" is an emergent property of *active*
physical manifestation, and not a giant pile of data.

Yup. That's what I mean by reputation, if I take your meaning right.

Cheers,
