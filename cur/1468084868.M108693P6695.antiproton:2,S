You understated G4s' role. They ARE a mercenary recruiter with quick
reaction teams stationed in South Sudan and elsewhere. They also provide
armed security, executive protection teams, etc.

The military's already trained you to kill without compunction and never
deprogram you.

Whatever rage resides in you from that, or other experiences, is easily
steerable. When people are confused or angry they DO NOT make correctly
informed decision. Easy prey for government spooks.

Just in... Local action just as I was reading The Hill's article:
"America's anger boils over"
<http://thehill.com/homenews/news/287093-american-anger-boils-over>
which is quite hot. In the eleven minutes after I posted the following,
it had *336* new comments:

    "Right now, outside this cafe' there are 3 police cars & 6 cops from
    3 different agencies because of a car without a back plate belonging
    to a local disabled vet.

    They know who the car belongs to. He has coffee here every day. He's
    an amputee who gets meds. They think he's a drug dealer because he's
    kind to the homeless and outcasts andbuys them coffee, gives them
    spare change... and the missing plate gave the police, the
    semi-deputized 'rangers' (muni codes only) and a private patrol
    company that's totally un-deputized, a chance to harass him.

    I told one of the 'rangers' (A city councilmember's son) to be
    careful... There's people out there who like to kill cops.

    Normally I wouldn't say anything of the sort in my normal dealings
    with them but f*ck them. If the act like pigs MAYBE we SHOULD make
    bacon."

Some kind of "disposable hero" syndrome?
