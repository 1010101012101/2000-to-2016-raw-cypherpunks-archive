Non endangered generic duck for example.  Assume it's hunting season.  Now
assume it's a radio controlled flying bot with a camera.  Can I shoot it
down if it's flying over my land and I recognize it for the spook gear it
really is?

Probable cause != warrant.  Probable cause is needed to obtain one.  Not the
same thing.  Search warrants do not allow cops to remove blinds from windows.
They allow them the ability to search a specific location for specific items
for which they have presented a judge probable cause that they'll find said
items.  It does not allow for open ended surveilance - i.e. a fishing
expedition.

Newsflash, neither does the word 'privacy'.  Hence it's not a constitutional
issue, though it should be.  It is however a 4th ammendment issue as it
involves "searches" by government types.
