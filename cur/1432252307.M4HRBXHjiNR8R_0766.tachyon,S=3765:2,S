The airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania was the one where one of
the passengers called his family on the cellphone and said (after other things)
they were going to try to rush the hijackers.
I'm not sure if that's the same plane where the cellphone caller
said the hijackers claimed to have a bomb or not,
but even if they *said* that it doesn't mean they really had one.
So it could have been a bomb, or it could have been a fight in the cockpit.

Some of the pilots may also have had family killed by Israel
or by US bombings in Iraq or the ten years of blockade --
today's (pre-bombing) Marin County CA paper had an opinion-page column
by somebody who just had permits rejected by the US export bureaucrats
for water chlorination systems they were trying to export to Iraq;
they smuggled them there anyway because unsafe water is *still* the
leading cause of death in Iraq.  Soldiers who are really angry
are sometimes willing to do suicidal attacks.
