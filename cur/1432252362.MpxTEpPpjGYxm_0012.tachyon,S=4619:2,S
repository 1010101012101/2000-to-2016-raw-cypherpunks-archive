Some time in April 2012, China planned a drone strike in Myanmar against a
drug lord responsible for the death of 13 Chinese sailors.  Before
implementation, the target got arrested, and now is in China appealing a
death sentence.  News media stories Feb 2013 speculate that China had no
intention of informing Myanmar of this operation.

This parallels:

*       USA and NATO allies drone strikes in Pakistan and other nations,
ignoring their sovereignty;

*        Israel uses drones in its war with various enemies in the occupied
territories;

There are probably more such cross-border drone attacks, whose details I do
not have handy.
