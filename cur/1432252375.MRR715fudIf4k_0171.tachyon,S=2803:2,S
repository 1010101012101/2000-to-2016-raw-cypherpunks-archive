I know, I was just hoping for a few meaningful shortcuts to achieving the 
full combination of "do-it-yourself" (because tinkering is more satisfying 
than COTS), "cheap"(limited funds; low on my priority 
list), "effective"(too much hokum floating around the subject), 
and "portable" (obvious). It's still a tall order, but I've found the 
discussion so far quite helpful. There you go!
