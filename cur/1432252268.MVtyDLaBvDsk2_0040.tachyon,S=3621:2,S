But google doesn't save the images, including navigational images
(which tend to be .gifs) nor does it -traversal -crawl

And the dynamic (CGI) site problem.

Also, I realize this is a lot of bandwidth.  Perhaps sites could
automatically self-nominate for mirroring?  Ie, Joe Sixpack
putting up his housecat site won't bother; but a dissident
would.  But that's a Freenet-type scheme.

Yes and I realized shortly after posting that Google probably is smart
about compressing what can be.  Basically I need dense (but slow)
nonvolitile memory prices to decrease, not software.

Eventually tech could outpace human output.  Everyone would have a Slab
containing the history (and all uncopyrighted and copyrighted works,
the latter licensable of course :-) from the Sumerians to last month's
concerts.  And everyone painting and singing until the sun burnt out would not
fill another Slab.

Meanwhile make backups.  And mirror the twisted.  :-)
