I followed a link in the /. thread to http://policeabuse.com , 
highly recommended.  They track episodes of police abuse, and
do some quality-control on the procedures police departments
to handle (or avoid) complaints.

They contend that taping police (video and/or audio) is legal in most
states, in most circumstances.  An alleged lawyer posted
to the /. discussion, saying the Mass. story the thread
is about was actually narrower than simply "recording
police is illegal."

This is a good opportunity to urge cp's who haven't yet,
to read David Brin's "Transparent Society."  It's pie in the
sky, but essentially advocates having cameras everywhere, so
that anyone anywhere can tap into a video feed.
