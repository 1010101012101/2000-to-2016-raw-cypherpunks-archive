a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any ce||ular or |andline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2OO,00O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov

his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of

respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
