Self-decrypting (and self-anything files that need executable permission)
are tragedies waiting to occur. 

People who aren't technical enough to install their own copies of PGP
shouldn't be encouraged to run unknown email attachments, no matter what
the associated pretty icon looks like. 

Of course, for the email to become known in any meaningful way - say, with
a digital signature created by a trusted correspondent - requires the
same computation (or a close analog) that the self-decryption would
perform. 

The "I LOVE YOU" (which sent messages from known correspondents) should
eliminate any hope that the people who create malicious programs aren't
smart enough to take advantage of local data like address books when
propagating bad code.
