I think that's right. I finished high school just after that time block, 
and would have been interviewing for my first after-graduation job in 
'84 if I hadn't put on the green suit. The high school guidance 
counselor and the college job hunting assistant certainly emphasized 
people skills to us engineer types. "You may be the best engineer ever, 
but you have to impress the personnel department first. They like to 
deal with people, so make sure to speak their language." It didn't much 
affect me, but many of my friends weren't savvy enough to realize that 
career advice from a high school guidance counselor or a 23-year-old 
grad assistant who had yet to find work outside of acedemia was not 
worth much.
