German police have searched and seized the rooms (dorm?) of one of the JAP 
developers.  They were on the look for data that was logged throughout the 
period when JAP had to log specific traffic.  The JAP-people say that the 
seizure was not conform with German law. They suggest that the police was 
afraid that they wouldn't  gain the right to use this data before a normal 
court. So they "stole" it to make things clear.  And since the JAP team did 
cooperate with them the previous time they now have the logs to get seized.

I'll bet the logs weren't encrypted.  Fools.

Anarchy may not be a better form of government, but it's better than no 
government at all.
