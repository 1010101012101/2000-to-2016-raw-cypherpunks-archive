It works with symmetric cryptography in which the same secret key, or mathematical code, is used to encrypt and decrypt, as opposed to public key cryptography, in which two different keys are used. The new algorithm has been submitted to the U.S. Patent Office and proposed to the National Institute of Standards.


I'm guessing what's described above is this:

Encryption Modes with Almost Free Message Integrity

We define a new mode of operation for block encryption which
in addition to assuring confidentiality also assures
message integrity. In contrast, previously for message
integrity a separate pass was required to compute a
cryptographic message authentication code (MAC).
The new mode of operation, called Integrity Aware CBC (IACBC),
requires a total of m+log m block encryptions on a plain-text
of length m blocks. The well known CBC (cipher block chaining)
mode requires m block encryptions. The second pass of computing
the CBC-MAC  essentially requires   additional m block encryptions.
A new highly parallelizable mode (IAPM) is also shown to  
be secure for both encryption and message integrity.
We also show a lower bound  of Omega(log m) additional block
encryptions  for any reasonably modeled  (linear)
scheme which assures message integrity along with
confidentiality.
