i have loved the padlock engines on via cores since they hit the
market in C5XL form with a single hw generator available via XSTORE.
unlike many designs this free wheeling resource can provide a torrent
of entropy sufficient to sate even the most gregarious consumption.

as mentioned above, you need a fast user space entropy daemon sanity
checking the raw, (probably) biased stream coming from hardware but it
is still good practice to digest this entropy to obscure any potential
generator state/bias heading into the host entropy pool.

that is to say, of the two common modes for utilizing hw entropy:
a. conservatively sample from a whitened, string filtered entropy
source for a low rate of high quality output (see xstore config words)
b. ramp un-whitened, un-filtered source(s) to maximum rate and AES/SHA
mix for high throughput, high quality output while irreversibly
masking generator bias/state present in the raw source stream.

the latter is more effective in practice and capable of generation
rates > 20Mbps with full FIPS sanity checks. the former tops out
around 1Mbps or less with more transient latency spikes on read (when
successive attempts to read fail to pass whiten+strfilter). note that
padlock engine supports SHA and AES on die as well making these easy
and fast to apply to generator output.

if you are still concerned a more conservative configuration would
estimate entropy density while feeding from raw input stream and add
encrypted/digested product to the host entropy pool with the specified
entropy density estimate adjusted downward to your requirements. (most
OS'es support this)
