even more fun. :) If you're in the DC area, join us to toast the official 
end of the patent at midnight tonight. --Declan

                             present
               The End of Patent 4,405,829 Party
                 Wednesday, September 20, 2000
              7 pm 'til the official end at midnight
                 in Adams Morgan, Washington, DC

Why: Some say that US Patent 4,405,829 suppressed a wonderful
technology by giving one company a monopoly on an algorithm. Others
say that the patent ensured that there was sufficient financial
backing that helped develop the technology. RSA did use its legal
rights under the patent to pressure Phil Zimmermann when he developed
PGP. In any case, the debate is now over. Come celebrate the algorithm
developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman that gave us
privacy and authentication for the web.
