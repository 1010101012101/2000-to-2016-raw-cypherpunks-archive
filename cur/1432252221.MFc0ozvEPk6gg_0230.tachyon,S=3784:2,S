Both Netscape 6 and MSIE 5 contain ~100 built-in, automatically-trusted CA
certs.

 * Certs with 512-bit keys.

 * Certs with 40-year lifetimes.
 
 * Certs from organisations you've never heard of before ("Honest Joe's Used
   Cars and Certificates").
   
 * Certs from CAs with unmaintained/moribund websites ("404.notfound.com").

These certs are what controls access to your machine (ActiveX, Java, install-
on-demand, etc etc).

  * It takes 600-700 mouse clicks to disable these certs to leave only CAs you
    really trust.

(The above information was taken from "A rant about SSL, oder: die grosse
 Sicherheitsillusion" by Matthias Bruestle, presented at the KNF-Kongress
 2002).

>Why is not someone else issuing certificates?

How many more do you need?
