"The volume of data they collect has reached the point where good
analysis is no longer tractable in a theoretical algorithmic sense with
the best tools they currently have at their disposal, particularly when
you have a data space as broad and diffuse as "terrorism" to sift. "

This is also going to get increasingly difficult in the US, as the entire 
world begins to view us as a rogue nation. In other words, within a few 
years a search of potential terrorists is likely to spit out 95% of the 
world's population! (Unless, of course, we can convince everyone that 
torture is a necessary tool for freedom.)
