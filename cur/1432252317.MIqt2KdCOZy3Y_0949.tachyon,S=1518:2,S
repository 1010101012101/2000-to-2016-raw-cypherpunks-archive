Hi, Wilhelm

What a strange feeling….:  We are so distant, you are so far away, but I 
still can feel that you are by my side…I even think that I feel you 
breathing, I might imagine the touch of your lips, hear your soft voice…  I 
think I like your voice very much, I don’t know why, but I can’t not like 
it, because I like everything about You!  When I close my eyes I try to 
imagine how you look like in real life and what your eyes are:  they are 
deep, they are endless, they are like night…  It is you, my Man.  Even if 
you are not with me right now, however the best and most pleasant thoughts 
and dreams give me faith and belief, I believe that we can be together… will 
wait for you at http://allisloveandlove.com/mylovelygirl ... Only you and me ...

Kiss-kiss
Olga S.
