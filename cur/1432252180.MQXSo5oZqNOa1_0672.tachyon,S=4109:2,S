I'd like to make a similar offer to any developer and/or
author of 
cryptographic and/or steganographic software or other
related material 
(HOWTOs , books etc.). We are setting up a mirror at
University of Tuebingen 
in Germany, which is eventually going to have a reasonable
amount of HDD 
space (~10 GB, perhaps more) and HTTP access (eventually CVS
for developers) 
for that purpose. Anybody who's interested should simply
drop me a line (best 
would be PGP-encrypted, see header).



Regards,



David
