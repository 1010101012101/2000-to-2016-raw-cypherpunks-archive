It's easy to think it's a big scam, but it doesn't make sense. If
magicaltux wanted to "walk away with the money" he would do better hiring
someone else as CEO and then just doing whatever the hell he wanted with
his financial returns. In at most 20 years he'd have all the money he just
stole, with none of the crime, shaming, etc, legally!

He'll truly never be able to launder those "stolen" Bitcoin.

The leaked info is incredible, but it's all quite coherent.

I haven't made up my mind yet. We'll see it play out.
