Ok, the term "proprietary" was a little strong. Of course the=20
sourcecode of theses projects is open. But can you give me any serious=20
documentations (more than a Wiki or some ML links) that can help me to=20
implement properly the Diaspora/Friendica/GNU Social protocols like=20

No, they wrote their own protocol for their own project, and someone=20
just try to implement it to try to be compatible. But it's a one way=20
work, the guys from Diaspora will not adapt their protocol to help the=20
guys from Friendica/GNU Social/whatever.

What is your plan with The Federation ? To build a project to help all=20
theses project to talk each others and find a way to "standardize" the=20
communications between them to be compatible with eachothers ?

Then you will define some basic schema of authentication/packet format=20
(JSON/HTML/XML=E2=80=A6)/global architecture=E2=80=A6
In the end it will looks like this : https://xkcd.com/927/

If your aim is to ask theses project to have a public API to share=20
stuffs between their different servers, well good luck.

> Shouting "XMPP! XMPP!" is not helping.

No, but I prefer to contribute and improve a 15 years old protocol,=20
with millions of users and hundred of implementations, managed by a=20
strong Fundation that works with the IETF than on a 4 yo protocol=20
implented by ~2 project where all the documentation you can find on it=20
is here=20
