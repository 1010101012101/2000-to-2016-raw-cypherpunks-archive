I was thinking the same, having been in -40 weather before. I haven't 
been in -40 with a 500MPH wind chill, though. On the other hand, we're 
not talking a convertible jumbo jet with the top down, so the wind 
chill might not be that big a factor. Bottom line, I think Choate was 
blowing smoke, as usual.

But Maj Variola made a questionable point, too:

> At 30K feet, you have about half a minute before you pass out

I just tested that, sort of. I emptied my lungs, then lifted weights for 
30 seconds. It was a little painful toward the end, but I didn't grey 
out or anything.
