	So there's no reason to pay attention to what you say? =)

	I know my command of the english language is far from perfect,
	so maybe that's why you misunderstood what I said. 
	
	I'm asking if the moon *landing* was tracked using radar
	'illuminating' the target from the earth. 
	
	I realize that signals *directly* transmitted by transmitters
	on an object can be used to track the object, but that isn't
	strictly speaking radar is it? 

	I also can ask : when relying only on triangulation and doppler
	measurements, what kind of *resolution* do you get? How can you
	tell if the object actually landed on the moon?

	Like I said, you misunderstood. I didn't mean that the signals
	received on earth were somehow all just reflections from the
	moon. That would be absurd.

	Again, you don't seem to be following what I'm saying. I
	didn't mean that the whole thing was fake.

	That's historical data. It isn't 'obvious' to me at
	all. Your hams may have had first hand access to the evidence
	bu the direct evidence isn't available today. At best there is
	some kind of record of it.
