...is that at least _some_ people are against the war.  To my surprise
and delight, an anti-war march just passed my window taking up all of
Mass Ave.  Presumably they're marching from MIT up to Harvard.  Not
like it'll do anything, but it's nice to find people who agree that
going to war over all this shit just doesn't make sense.

I was saying to a friend not half an hour ago that maybe our
generation needs a Vietnam.  I'm at once sad and glad to see that it's
starting.
