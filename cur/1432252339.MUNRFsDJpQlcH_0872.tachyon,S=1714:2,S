Unbelievable. The guy gets jail time for submitting a fake obiturary to a 
newspaper.

Now from the story it's possible the guy got ahold of an 'official' obituary 
form and then 'tampered' with it to make it seem the teen had died. HOWEVER, 
even if that's the case, all he did was give it to a newspaper, which then 
failed to verify the obituary. It's not like he submitted the form to 
another government agency.

Let's face it. There are no conservatives in this country, not even in Iowa: 
Only warmed-over Stalinists.
