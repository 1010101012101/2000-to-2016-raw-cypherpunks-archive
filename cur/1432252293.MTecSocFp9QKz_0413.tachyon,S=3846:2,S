Actually, many stores go to a lot of trouble to find a pessimal
arrangement of items - the more shelves a customer walks 
past, the more impulse buys he/she is likely to make. There's
a reason the dairy section is usually the furthest from the door.

At Shaw's (one of our local chains) using the courtesy card
can sometimes lead to quite substantial savings - 50% on
some items such as meats. At times, my overall grocery bill
has been cut 20% by using a card.
