Huh? Apparently you've never had the treatment; children can be intolerant
as hell. Primary school gave me the most frightening examples of herd
behavior I've *ever* seen.

Heh, that wasnt my point, I wasnt trying to say that primary school kids
dont provoke, and dont cause trouble, etc etc, my point was that most
primary school kids would definatly find other means than singing Christian
hymns at her, in my experience kids are not ones for singing hymns, they
prefer to act in far less subtle ways?  Maybe Im wrong? *shrug*
