TKIP is NOT the same as RC4 … while we are trying to remove it from
any usage in Wi-FI, it has yet to be fully broken (publicly).

… vendors create crappy UIs.  WPA2 only should mean just AES-CCMP.
Some are done correctly.

Please elaborate.  TKIP has not been identified as a ‘active attack’ vector.

WPA2 is supposed to mean AES-CCMP.  WPA is TKIP.  
Unclear that you know what you are saying ….
