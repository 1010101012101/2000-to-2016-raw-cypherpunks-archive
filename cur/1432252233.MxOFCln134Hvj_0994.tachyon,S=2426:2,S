If someone I knew wrote some detailed Wiki entries about Telecom DCC control 
channel protocol throughputs and attacks, he could objectively state that 
there would be very few people in the world up to the task. He might also 
want to maintain anonymity.

Shutting down this source of wiki entries means that the general flow of 
Wikipedia content has been altered slightly, but I would argue 
significantly.

I see no material issue with an individual claiming that the absence of his 
posts to Wiki is significant, even if this is in fact untrue for his 
particular case. The ego is not material to the essential point.
