I have suspected this in the past over some postings but the ip address in the
headers looks legit.

Although I dislike, as ever, Tim's tone in these matters he has, as he
often does, a valid point hidden under his bitterness and his
experience at an American university is similar to my own, more recent,
experiences at English universities.

In a basic course that purported to teach "economics" (actually a
dumbed down blend of vague sociology and Keynesianism) the majority of
students were foreign and had a poor grasp of the English language.

The level of debate was poor and the lecturer had an easy job.

I am not racist against foreign students and think poking fun at poor
English isn't constructive (they generally speak English better than I
speak their own language) but there seems to me something basically
broken about a system which doesn't teach basic English _before_ trying
to teach complex ideas in that language.
