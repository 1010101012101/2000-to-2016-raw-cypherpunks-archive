It's not the miners that count, rather than economic majority.  It's a
surprising fact, but here's how it works: lets imagine 75% of the
miners decided they'd change the economic rules, in a protocol
incompatible way.  Result: the miners form a new alt-coin with no
users.  Bitcoin difficulty adjusts, and carries on as if nothing
happened.  The hostile miners earn 25 forkcoins which have  a market
price of 0.  They are burning electricity so they either go bankrupt
or the give up and rejoin the network.

There's a lot to game theory that is subtle.  It could do with a FAQ
writing on it really.
