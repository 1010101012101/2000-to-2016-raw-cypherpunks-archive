You think most of these posts are by sober people??

Not really.  In the 70's people would toke leaf.  Now everyone
knows that's pointless.  The THC content of hash has been relativly
constant for the past 1000 years.  The flavor and distribution of
canabinoids is more varied now, so the "high" is different between
body effect and mental effect (and now we know why too - the receptors
in the cerebelum are different than those in the frontal lobes, but
are designed for the same brain chemical that canabinoids mimic).

Yeah, there's a few counties in Tennessee where they can't get a jury
to convict anyone for growing pot, so the feds have to request the
trial in other places.  But only the feds bother :-)

Probably not crypto related, just sensor/transmitter.  Most growers
are moving to Canada tho, it looks like Canada will go decrim this year
or next.  "Yeah, it's my private plot.  That one is my brother's and
that one is my mom's!"
