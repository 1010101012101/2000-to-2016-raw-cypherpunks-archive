"Photons are bosons, so they don't interact with each other. Photon
detectors can and usually have anisotropic sensitivity. Sure you can never 
beat fiber, but line of sight is free..."

Well, by interfere I meant in the detectors of course. So are you telling me 
that two WiFi receivers pointed in different directions will not receive the 
same information? I don't think WiFi (IR) is all that directional is it? If 
it is, then maybe we CAN have a new LAN segment.
