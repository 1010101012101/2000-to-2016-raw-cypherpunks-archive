good point, but IMHO it actually makes the system WEAKER yet, because it
gives more feeling of security to alice and bob, which may be highly
betraying because it also adds  key-exchange trouble and we all know
that is the real weakness of many systems.

my point exactly. one way or the other you can't TRUST the stream,
therefore it is worthless.

especially when it's sitting in orbit, where even if you wanted to and
were allowed to you simply CAN'T get at it.
and it's pretty obvious that examining it while it's still down on earth
does nothing. any stage magician worth his money can switch things right
under your nose, and any of the major TLAs would surely be capable to
switch a satellite even with dozens of people believing they've been
watching it continuously.

didn't think of that. yet another nail in the coffin. so, what do we
have? a scientist (or is he? anyone checked the credentials?) who is
much better at generating media hype than at cryptography. :)
