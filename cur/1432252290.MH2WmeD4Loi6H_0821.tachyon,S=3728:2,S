Too expensive.  Just wire the card reader into the serial port of your 
handy Palm (III|V|VII) and collect away. I saw several articles 
(sorry, no links) last year about skimming, and at least three of 
them had accompanying pictures of a Palm-based skimmer unit 
with attached card reader.

Fact is, I have a card reader unit that I bought a couple of years 
ago.  I've been "about to get around to doing" a reader app on my 
Rabbit development board, but now that I have a CerfCube, I'll 
probably do it on that.  A Tiqit is $995, but a CerfCube is only $495 
(or maybe $299, if they repeat the sale) and will also take a 
Microdrive.
