Well, again you've WAY oversimplified things.
Indeed, this oversimplification is curiously identical to US foregin policy 
mistakes.

Ho Chi Min, like Mao, would take guns from anybody in order to get the job 
done. If that meant wearing a Soviet uniform for 15 minutes, then sobeit. 
Don't mistake that for Eastern-European-style Soviet block "governments".

Was Ho Chi Min ultimately a dictator? Sure. A Soviet-style dictator? Well, 
I'd argue only nominally. I'd also argue that our post World War II betrayal 
of Ho had a lot to do with shoving him into the arms of the Soviets, just 
like with Mao. (But in neither case did the association stick.) The 
important notion is that, unlike in Europe, China and Vietnam never had 
anything resembling a democracy or Parliament or anything like that. They 
were still largely fuedal, agrarian societies that weren't really in a 
position to critically evaluate the implications of Soviet-style rulership 
(and in fact they probably viewed it as being merely a non-Monarchic version 
of what they'd always done). BUT...the Soviets were providing guns and money 
and we weren't.

That both countries were really only externally Stalinst for a brief while 
(ie, a couple of decades) is evidenced by the fact that both economies are 
as about, in SOME ways, as free-wheeling and as capitalistic as exists these 
days. Of course, both are still certainly authoritarian and, depending on 
the subject, oppressive, but this has nothing to do with their 
politico-economic stance per se, as is now obvious.

In other words, the moral of this story is that you can't merely graft on a 
western political philosophy--in this case Marxism--to cultures that have 
unbroken traditions dating back to the stone age. It may look 'Marxist' on 
the outside, but internally that transplant ain't going to take root.

That US foreign policy in the far east in in Indo-China during most decades 
of the 20th century was a complete disaster was precisely due to the views 
you seem to hold. It's why we didn't back Mao when even though it was 
obvious BILLIONS of dollars were being siphoned away by Soong Tse-Vung and 
the Chiang regime...it's why we backed Lon Nol to overthrow Sihounouk 
(bringing in the Khmer rouge), and it's why we didn't back Ho even though he 
fought with us against the Japanese.

Had we stood back from our prejudices, respected the soverignity of those 
nations, engaged and offered some guns in order for them to choose their OWN 
government, I'd bet the era of Soviet-style government in both China and 
Vietnam would have been much shorter, and in Cambodia it would have 
CERTAINLY never existed.

In other words, YOU (and people with beliefs just like yours in the US 
government) are responsible for the spread of communism in the far east. Now 
you and your friends (including, I suspect, the guy who signs your paycheck) 
are going to do the same thing in the near east: you're going to force many 
ostensibly neutral nations into the Fundamentalist Islamic camp, because you 
just don't get it, and think we have the right to interfere.

"Well, the Soviets did it and the liberal left said it was great, so that 
makes it right." Forget it. Stop saying this crap and use that brain. 9/11 
sucked enough in this town...we don't need another.
