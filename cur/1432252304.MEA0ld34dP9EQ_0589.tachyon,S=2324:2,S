I think I've been guilty of this too, but (as someone else in this thread
pointed out), it's not a terribly useful suggestion. The archives are
not well-organized, and a URL would be helpful.

Does anyone have a reasonably complete cypherpunks archive available
for FTP?  Perhaps I could host them on my server and let Google index
them. That might be useful.
