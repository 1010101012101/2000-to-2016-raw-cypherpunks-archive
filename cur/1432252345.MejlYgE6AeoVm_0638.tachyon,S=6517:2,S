And yet you have repeatedly blathered on about how "forging headers" 
is a good alternative to anonymous remailers. Your explanations 
indicate you just haven't grokked the level of misdirection and 
untraceability behind the use of N nested remailers, encrypted at 
each stage.

There has never been any doubt that some particular remailer may be 
logging and correlating: this is why N remailers are recommended, 
with the heuristics we've been discussing here since 1992. (For 
example: encrypt at every state, a la Mixmaster-type remailers, 
include one's _own_ remailer in the chain, loop multiple times, etc.)

You keep tossing about the "insecure remailer" claim, seemingly not 
knowing the implications of N-chained remailing. Hint: there is 
essentially nothing a particular remailer can do to such a chained 
message except see where he's being asked to send it and correlate 
this with where it came from. He can't see inside the packet (for 
obvious reasons), he can't alter the packet (because then later 
decryptions fail and the packet gets dumped), and he can't even 
change the remailer he is supposed to deliver to. All he can do is 
correlate, which is, of course, bad. Hence the role of multiple hops.

Still a far cry ahead of your oft-mentioned "mail header forgery" 
alleged solution.

"Somewhat civil fashion" and "a bit more level headed."

You're also a pompous ass. At least you called me "Tim." Most pompous 
asses here fall into the pseudo-Brit mode of calling me "Mr. May" 
when they are being pompous.

As for your comment that you have never used an anonymous remailer, I 
had already concluded as much.
