Don't count on it.  I know of a number of the type of machine you describe 
that shipped with default networking on NT 4 SP3, destined for some factory's 
LAN.  These are machine tool users, not IT grads.  Think they'll remember to 
air-gap the tooling?

They also shipped with explorer as the shell.  Guess they never heard of 
alt-tab.  Oh, and let's not forget... no virus scanner and no OS update 
policy.  "The old DOS system didn't need those extra costs!" ;)

The high point of one service call was catching the operator playing solitare 
on the control console of a very large and very dangerous machine.
