#   Privacy Journal, By Robert Ellis Smith, June 1994 issue
#
#   The American Textile Partnership, a research consortium linked to the U.S.
#   Department of Energy, is sponsoring a research called "Embedded Electronic
#   Fingerprint" to develop a transponder the size of a grain of wheat that
#   could be attached to a garment until the owner threw it out.
#
#   Heretofor, this application has been considered only for security purposes.
#
#   The definition of "security", according to the textile industry magazine
#   'Bobbin', has been expanded to include "anti-counterfeit" tracking after
#   purchase. [What???]
#
#   Could a machine-readable tag on a person's clothing serve many of the same
#   tracking purposes an one embedded in the body?
