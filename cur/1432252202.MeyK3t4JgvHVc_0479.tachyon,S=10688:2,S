Rush is clearly someone with too much time on his hands and too little
(demonstrated) ability to think things through. I apologize for being
uncharacteristically blunt, but the essay below is terribly
naive. You might as well try to draft C.J Parker for president.

First, political parties are not single-issue parties, at least not
right now. Education and taxes and health care will likely continue to
be more important in most people's lives than technology policy for
the foreseeable future.

Second, privacy is an amorphous issue. It's used by leftists to
regulate the private sector and outlaw transactions between consenting
adults. Liberals use it to talk about abortion. Conservatives link it
to everything from the FBI files under Clinton to Carnivore. What do
*you* mean? And why do you think everyone else is going to agree?

Third, there already is (as others have suggested) a party that's
concerned about personal freedom: the LP. If you mirror their
positions -- or even a substantial subset -- you will be similarly
marginalized. If not, don't look for support -- I humbly suggest --
on the cpunx list.

Fourth, nowadays it seems that political parties can be formed (Ross
Perot, Ralph Nader) or popularized only by a strong and well-known
personality. It will help if they're a billionaire. May I suggest a
recruiting trip to the Redmond suburbs?

Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, technology issues are an
outgrowth of a canadidates' general stand on regulation. If they don't
like taxes, you can bet they'll be against Internet taxes. If they're
a national security hawk, they'll probably like encryption and
supercomputer export regs. Etc.

Sixth, you don't seem to need a political party but a thinktank or
similar creature. Why not try that instead? I was thinking of starting
a nonproit group devoted to a subset of cypherpunkly topics; perhaps I
still will.
