Tasteless as it may sound (but this is home of cypherpranks anyway), it seems
that Sklyarov's arrest advanced the anti-DMCA case more than anything else.

And it will continue to advance it as long he remains in jail.

Almost as if the whole thing was a clever setup. And it works. If feds release
him they will prove that they are a corporate police in very clear terms. If
they do not release him DMCA is facing a very real challenge.

So I'd like to congratulate to whoever has masterminded this in Adobe.
Excellent job. And when DMCA collapses the author should get public
recognition.
