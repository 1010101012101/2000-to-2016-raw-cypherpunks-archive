Weinsteins proposal is DOA because of the centralized control and the
lack of anonymity (oh, but Pit issuers may issue special anonymous certs
to "applicants with special needs for identity protection (e.g., human
rights groups operating in "hostile" areas, etc.)".  Right.)
The people like us who would implement it won't.

But it's technically possible.  The technological issues are the
easy part.   Creating a new email system is one thing, getting people
to use it is another.  This idea is pretty unrealistic...  sort of the
Underpants Gnomes plan for ridding the world of spam:

1. create completely new parallel email system
2. ???
3. no more spam!

I read it as the Pit is a signature over the Pit contents
and the email.   It'd include the certs needed to authenticate
to the appropriate CA.  A PKCS#7 detached signature or
similar structure would work fine.

The crypto part is the one part that's easy.

See the 'getting people to use it' argument above.
Solve that and any of 20 different technical solutions would work.
