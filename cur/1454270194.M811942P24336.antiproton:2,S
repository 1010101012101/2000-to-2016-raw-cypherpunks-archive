ROTF! "There will be a formal dress code"

How "Back to the 50s"... Were you around for the 50s Zenaan?

A sick sick corrosion of conformity enveloped Western Industrial society
and it's satraps (ie. 1950s Australia) like automotive and industrial
effluvia envelop those nations today.

And what if, like more and more "Australians" everyday, your parents
find themselves jobless, homeless, and impoverished, and can't afford
'formal attire' to send the loinspawn off for their five day a week
orwellian programming regimen? Those kids going to get bullied,
ridiculed, with official sanction...

Listen, my mother, a New York City school teacher, was considering
emigrating to Australian in the early 60s when she found out Australia
was offering 'special deals' for immigrant teaching staff from certain
countries. Then she found out Australian schools were still segregated,
and worse.... Black teachers need not have applied.

Fuck your "Australia Nation". Fuck ALL 'nations'.

Kill your indoctrinators today kids!
