Alright then, since you're here, maybe you could answer a couple 
questions:

- If given a court order, would you be able to provide the FBI the same 
kind of information that Surfola did, which could be used to track down 
the customer in meatspace?  (From the article, we can assume it was his 
paypal email addx and/or the IP addx he was using, either one of which 
was probably sufficient).

- Assuming the answer is yes: from the customer's POV, in the end what 
does it matter whether you were given a court order or not... the 
result was the same, they were caught because they trusted your service 
(the fact that, in this case, the crime was despicable, is beside the 
point).

- Can you explain the contradictions inherent in the following excerpts 
from your user agreement?

"Usage logs are usually kept for forty-eight (48) hours for maintenance 
purposes, monitoring Spamming and monitoring abuses of netiquette. Any 
relevant portion(s) of such logs may be kept for as long as needed to 
stop the abuses."
"We maintain no information which would identify which user had sent a 
given message or visited a given site"
"Abusers of the Anonymizer can expect no anonymity. We regret the 
necessity of this policy, but without it abuse will force the shutdown 
of the Anonymizer."

Even if we leave aside the question of whether one should trust a 
service which /could/ betray you if it were run by an untrustworthy 
operator, you state openly in your policy that you're not to be 
trusted!
