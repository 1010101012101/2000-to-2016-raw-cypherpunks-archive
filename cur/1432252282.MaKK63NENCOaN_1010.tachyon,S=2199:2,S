Ken, Eh what?

Yes I've heard a lot of the Soviet union, however I don't see what you meant by that comment here.

What I was referring to was the winning powers' treatment of the Nazi war criminals after WWII, Nurnburg trials and so on. (Note the word "trials" here)

I don't think I've ever heard that the Nazi prisoners where drugged, abused or otherwice tortured or mistreated and humiliated. Feel free to enlighten me on this.
