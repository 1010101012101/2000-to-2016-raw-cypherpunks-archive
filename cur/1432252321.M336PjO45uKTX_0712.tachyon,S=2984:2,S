At the last go-around of this topic (how to reduce the spam problem)
I proposed appending CPUNK to messages. Appending a tag has much 
better properties than prepending. It doesn't break sorting by subject line,
it is automatically in the correct position in replies, and is generally
less
intrusive.

All tags are ugly, but some are worse than others.

I still occasionally add CPUNK to my subject lines (as I did in this
message) 

Have we finally beaten Mr. Assymetric into silence?
