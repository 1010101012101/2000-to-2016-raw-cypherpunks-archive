Not "just work" but "opt out" is what you are looking for. If there
are n posters to the list and m people signing, then their are only
n-m spoof targets. As m approaches n, the number of forgeries
rapidly approaches zero as there is no one left worth spoofing who
can be spoofed. But as each individuals chance of being spoofed
approaches zero, the benefit gained by signing also approaches
zero. Consequently unless there are additional costs to non-signing
above and beyond spoof protection there will always be a substantial
number of unsigned messages.
