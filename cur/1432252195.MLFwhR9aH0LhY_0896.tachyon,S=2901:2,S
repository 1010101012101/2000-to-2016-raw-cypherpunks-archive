It has been a while since Tempest has come up here. If you
haven't heard Joel McNamara's is closing his unique web site 
on TEMPEST in October, 2011. An archival pdf is available 
until then:


http://eskimo.com/~joelm/tempest.html

A lot secret and open research is still underway on compromising
emanations and inadvertent signals of humand innards, outwards
and behavior -- electonic, acoustic, visual, odor, taste, touch, 
multi-sensory, extrasensory, paranormal, stride, eye blink, arm 
swing, bodily excretions, crowding, solitude, sleep, grammar,
syntax, singing, math and coding skill, down the line of reading 
what you don't want read without getting bitcoins in return.

Much of Tempest discussion focuses on electronic emanations
but are there reports on non-electronic signal capture?

The report recently on big cavity resonators in Britain built before
radar to pick-up acoustics of distant aircraft reminds of the
non-electronic versions of Tempest popularized by the KGB's 
planting a device in the US Embassy residence in Moscow.

Passive bugs are not the question. Are dumb-looking objects
still being covertly planted in secure locations to transmit 
signals to the outside at imperceptible wave lengths or
stego-ed in the perceptible? Bypassing cutting-edge Tempest 
countermeasures which so enthrall technical surveillance 
inspectors blinded by e-gadgetry.

Are live skulls cavity resonators beyond pushing voice? 
Lot of cavities in most places where people go for privacy.
