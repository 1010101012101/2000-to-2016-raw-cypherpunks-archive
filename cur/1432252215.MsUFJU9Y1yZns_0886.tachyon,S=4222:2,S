<snip>
> The digital intercept system provides the capability to
> intercept any voice or digital data traffic between a
> subscriber and an associate and forward it to a central
> collector station for decoding and processing. The
> system is modular, consisting of one or more bridges
> (one for each subscriber line to be intercepted), and a
> central collector facility. The bridges intercept and
> forward all traffic from both directions on the
> subscriber's line to the central collector over leased
> forwarding facilities. At the central collector, a
> workstation for each monitored line provides an agent
> with control of the intercept process. 
<snip> 
> The standard was developed under the sponsorship of the
> National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The project began
> when NIST/OLES entered into an interagency agreement
> with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to provide
> technical guidance for developing ISDN intercept
> methodologies. After the technology was successfully
> demonstrated the preparation of the performance
> standard was undertaken. The standard is now available
> on a CD-ROM. 
<snip>
> The standard bears a FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
> classification, meaning it may be disclosed only to
> members of the law enforcement community and those in
> private industries supporting law enforcement
> activities. Please submit the request on your company
