>Pres. Bush to Head-Up National ID System
>
>As previously reported here, Congress has recently directed the US
>Department of Transportation to establish model guidelines for encoded data
>on driver's licenses issued by states as part of the 2002 transportation
>funding legislation.
>
>The Congressional directive also instructs federal agencies to work together
>towards development and installation of fingerprint or retinal scanners at
>airports which will read and verify data stored on the license documents.
>
>The directive constitutes formal establishment of a national ID system under
>the leadership of President George W. Bush as chief executive of his
>administration.
>
>According to the Congressional report the system will be used for national
>security and to prevent fraud. It will also be used to stop "underage
>drinking".
>
>The newly established Department of Transportation safety agency will manage
>a federal database linking state driver information.
>
>The 1993 Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), codified at Title 18,
>Section 2721, will serve as the authority for this program. The Act
>~requires~ states to release personal information from  motor vehicle
>records for purposes of national defense (security) and matters involving
>national or regional emergencies; all under direction of the President.
>
>The DPPA also authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to collect and
>collate transportation related information whenever the Secretary decides
>such collection will contribute to the improvement of the transportation
>system of the United States.
>
>The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) has already
>drafted a national ID standard. One of the required features of the AAMVA
>standard is digitally encoded inclusion of Social Security Numbers -- even
>though it is often claimed by proponents that SSNs would not be included.
>
>The AAMVA national ID standard also incorporates fingerprint and digital
>photo criteria.
>
>AAMVA's standards director, Nathan Root, was recently quoted -- in an effort
>to counter opposition to their national ID scheme -- saying, "they're giving
>these systems too much credit in even assuming that somebody would be able
>and interested to track everybody's whereabouts and
>doings."
>
>If you believe Nathan Root, you deserve a national ID.

>CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2299, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND
>RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002 (H.R. 2299)
>ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/cp107/hr308.txt
>Conference Report (H. Rept. 107-308)
>
>Model guidelines for encoded data on driver's licenses.--
>In light of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, it is clear that all
>levels of government need to work in concert to deter and prevent future
>attacks. One means of doing so is to ensure that individuals asked to
>identify themselves are not using false identities. The increasing
>availability through the internet of expertly crafted false identification
>makes the task very difficult. The conferees are aware of technology,
>existing today, that can quickly scan any encoded data on the reverse of a
>driver's license to validate the license as legitimately issued. By
>reviewing personal data encoded on the license, it can also be used to
>assist in making a quick determination that the person displaying the
>license is the person to whom it was issued. The conferees strongly
>encourage the department to consider the development of model guidelines
>specifying the types of encoded data that should be placed on driver's
>licenses for security purposes, and to work in concert with states and
>related licensing bodies toward the early implementation of such measures.
>This could benefit the nation's efforts to improve security as well as
>assist in reducing fraud and underage drinking.
>
>Document and biometric scanning technologies.--
>Document and biometric scanners linked to federal databases by computers and
>containing advanced authentication capabilities would facilitate the
>processing of background checks, provide fingerprint and additional
>biometric identification capabilities, and authenticate documents presented
>for identification. It is the conferees' understanding that such off the
>shelf, commercially available technology is in use or being tested by the
>Immigration and Naturalization Service. The conferees encourage FAA to
>assess such document and biometric scanning technologies for use at all
>commercial service airports. The conferees also recommend that the Secretary
>implement standards to make use of technologies that quickly and
>inexpensively assess the daily fitness-for- duty of airport security
>screeners with respect to impairment due to illegal drugs, sleep
>deprivation, legal medications, and alcohol.
>
>Fingerprint identification technologies.--
>The conferees are aware of the promise of forensic-quality fingerprint and
>palmprint identification technologies for the rapid verification of
>identities and employee background checks. The Aviation and Transportation
>Security Act requires the department to investigate the application of
>biometric technologies such as these off the shelf systems. The conferees
>encourage FAA and the Transportation Security Administration to evaluate
>these technologies for their immediate application to aviation security
>missions.
