So why the Nuremberg Files case?  A *civil* case not even criminal.  Jake 
Baker.  The "nazis" driving a fair housing activist out of Pennsylvania 
(again no charges brought).  the Cross Burning case.  Etc.

"Money is not speech." -- Campaign finance reform cliche.
Money may not be speech but the First Amendment also protects freedom of 
the press; and presses have always cost money (Ben Franklin's print shop 
cost him more than 100 pounds).  And freedom of the press belongs to 
everyone, not just the "official" media.
