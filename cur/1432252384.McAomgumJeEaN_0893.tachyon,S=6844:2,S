AN AMAZING 96,000 MEMBERS ENROLLED IN JUST 8 WEEKS!

IT HAS BEATEN EVERY PROGRAM LAUNCHED ON THE NET!

IT'S YOUR TURN TO SUCCEED! So, please take advantage NOW!

Hello,

My name is Nils Luyt and I have just come across an opportunity that is like 
finding a Huge Pot of Gold at the end of a Rainbow and quite frankly.....I wanted 
to share this with as many people as I can.

I want to tell you that I'm really excited and you probably will be too. I know 
you are looking to make a good income from your home based
business and I am confident THIS IS THE ONE! This program will have a
Major...Global Impact upon all of us.

This is proof that the GREAT POTENTIAL of this SENSATIONAL OPPORTUNITY has been 
widely acknowledged!

Everybody who enrolls will benefit from this UNIQUE NEW PAYMENT CONCEPT!

Have you ever heard of a system that pays you a commission check after
you've enrolledjust TWO people?  WELL, THIS COMPANY DOES!!!!

And after that, you receive commissions on ALL SALES the company makes! Not only 
on YOUR sales, but ON ALL SALES!

This company is rapidly becoming bigger than Skybiz and you can still join & 
get in at the top!

YOU WILL BE ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY WHEN YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE AWESOME PRODUCT AND COMPENSATION PLAN THIS COMPANY HAS
TO OFFER!

No products to stock - no meetings to attend - & it's GLOBAL.

You can make $5,000 per week in 30 - 45 days from now with very little
effort! THAT'S THE POWER OF THE INTERNET!

OUTSTANDING company backup and promotion!  They have a server 100 times stronger 
than Ebay!

NOW....how would you like to be in on the ground floor of a Dot Com Company that 
has combined the best of SkyBiz, Freenet, Km.Net,Evision,
BigSmart and Priceline.net (and an international long distance service as well 
as an E-Mall where you will be able to purchase Brand Name
Merchandise at a HUGE DISCOUNT)?

BUT LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE HYPE FOR A MOMENT.......and be realistic...

Would an extra $200 per week pay some bills?
An extra $500 per week could pay the mortgage!
And would an extra $1,000 per week change your lifestyle?

It is all possible. If you introduce only 2 members,
(your sister and your brother in law perhaps?)
you will qualify already for your first paycheck!

Here are some of the major selling points of this opportunity combining the major 
trends....

1. Low start up cost.
2. Unique marketing plan...A New Hybrid Plan.
     a. Straight-line
     b. Non Flushing Binary.
     c. 3 x 10 Matrix with matching bonus' (when you cycle in the straight line 
you are entered into the Non Flushing Binary (like SkyBiz) and then finally... 
into the 3 x 10 Matrix.
3. They are catching all the major, huge trends. Web sites & education, "tools 
for internet marketers, international Long Distance "Flat Rate," and a plan to 
offer ISP and DSL service (FREE).
4. They are doing everything they can to develop a formula to pay a matching 
bonus on the straight-line, as well as the Binary part of the
compensation plan! Think about that...has it hit you yet?
5. THIS COMPANY IS GLOBAL!

To find out more about this HOT, Dot-Com Opportunity, send me an email
with !!youre first + last name!! in the subject, to: ep1@soneramail.nl
and I'll rush you the URL of our web site. Do it NOW!

If you don't take a look you'll NEVER know what you are missing.

Sending an email to ep1@soneramail.nl will take you only 10 seconds......and it will be your best 
10 seconds ever spent.

YOU CAN FINALLY BE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT WORKS! GET READY TO BE
EXCITED!!!!! See you  AT THE TOP!!!  Have a great day.

Nils Luyt
