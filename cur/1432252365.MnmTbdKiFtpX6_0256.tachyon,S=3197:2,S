Hello My Friend,

I thought I would drop you a quick note to let you know that 
there is an exciting and very profitable SELF-RUN online business 
which is exploding in 2001.

It is truly the HOTTEST and the EASIEST home business today!
Voted as #1 online business TWICE in a major business magazine!

It is NOT a chain letter, NOT an illegal get-rich-quick scam.  It is a 
legitimate business which has been around for over FOUR YEARS!

Here are the monthly checks that I received.  I have check copies to prove!

  Month 1: $243.29
  Month 2: $408.72
  Month 3: $1094.41
  Month 4: $1436.84
  Month 5: $2256.88
  Month 6: $3067.02
  Month 7: $4767.50
