And let me play Devil's Advocate to this DA position:

Not to sound overly Choatian, but there is nothing in the First 
Amendment which says anything about government getting to decide when 
"enough" editorial processing has occurred so that First Amendment 
protections kick in.

A publisher who published a publication consisting of _all submissions_ 
would still be protected, even if he exercised _zero_ editorial 
discretion. In fact, such things exist: they are called "vanity 
presses." They publish for a fee, no differently than a paid remailer 
publishes for a fee.

Is a vanity press not protected by the First Amendment? There is no 
requirement in the First that a press prove that it altered or selected 
some threshold percentage of bits before First Amendment protections 
exist. In fact, the Bill of Rights is not about rights granted by 
government at all, it's about limits on what government may do.

And, as I will cover below, any kind of "know your customer" rules run 
into other problems.

(By they way, publishers of anonymous letters are not required to "know 
their customers." Ditto for collectors of anonymous suggestions, radio 
talk show hosts accepting calls from anonymous dialers, etc. These 
publishers and radio talk show hosts do _not_ have to "justify" their 
failure to collect taceability information, nor do they have to meet any 
threshold test for how much editorial control they exercised. The First 
simply does not give government the authority to restrict a publisher 
this way.)

Something I wrote about a very long time ago, before Cypherpunks even, 
was the "trick" (Happy Fun Court will not be amused) of using a 
"religious confessional" as a cover for remailers. Or of using an 
"anonymous tip line" as a cover. (This was discussed much in the first 
few years of remailer operation.)

If the government demands that remailer shut down, or somehow obtain 
meatspace identities, confessionals and anonymous pschiatric/sex 
hotlines will presumably also be shut down.

This was the motivation for much of the Kremvax early remailing service, 
which Julf later took over the code for. Sexual abuse, incest, rape, 
shame, etc., drove these early systems.

It may be time to dust off these services as "covers." Anyone now 
running a remailer could consider explicity announcing their religious 
or psychiatric motivations.

Melon traffickers --> Soul traffickers.

Happy Fun Court will not be amused that such "tricks" are being used to 
head off an outlawing of anonymity tools. Fuck 'em.
