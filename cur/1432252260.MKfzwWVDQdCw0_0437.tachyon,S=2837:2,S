Your claim was that the Vietnam war represented the US trying
to attack China.  In fact it represented the Soviet Union
trying to conquer Indochina, as was demonstrated in the bloody
and horrifying events that unfolded when the US fled.

In your version the war in Korea was a US attempt to attack
China, but in fact we know the war was ordered by Stalin to
expand communist domination - the records of his directives
came into our hands when the Soviet Union fell.

 When Pakistan creates the taliban, funds it, arms it, and
sends it from Pakistan to Afghanistan to attack Afghans, this
is non interference according to you, but when the US arms the
Northern Alliance and gives it air support, this is
interference.

Similarly, when the Soviet Union fell, it swiftly became
apparent who had been causing all that trouble in South
America.

> Doesn't that strike you as odd?

Yes, I find your delusions extremely odd.
