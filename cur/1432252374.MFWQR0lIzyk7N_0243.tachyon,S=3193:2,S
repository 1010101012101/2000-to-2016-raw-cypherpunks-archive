This was discussed on the cryptography@c2 list, 
though somebody did a nice job of putting the disjointed email
conversations into readable order for slashdot.

The key to the "new" method is solving to
	2**X == 1 mod N
which is the discrete log problem,
just like the previous "new" "crack" of RSA,
then using that answer to solve the factoring,
not necessarily that efficiently.
Since the discrete log problem is about as hard as factoring,
a not-blazingly-efficient solution to the discrete log part
is less efficient that the best factoring methods.
