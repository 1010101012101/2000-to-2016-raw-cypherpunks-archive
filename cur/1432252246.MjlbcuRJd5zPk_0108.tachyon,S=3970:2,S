Because it's funny, and one of the ways that humans deal with stressful
situations is through humor.

Having seen Linus give many talks through the years, I can assure you
that he might make such a joke regardless of the true situation.

Or it might indicate that he knew it would get a laugh from the
audience.  It's invalid to read detail into a single such comment.

It would seem logical, yes.  It would also seem logical for Them (tm) to
game-theory two more stages, and specifically avoid asking the most
prominent maintainers in favor of pressuring or encouraging lower-level
contributors to insert (or avoid fixing) bugdoors.  I don't think we
have enough information to make an informed judgement which scenario has
happened.
