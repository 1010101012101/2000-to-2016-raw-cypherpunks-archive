i'd be interested to know what you find out.

[[[
totally unrelated commentary:
i dreamed recently i was an old man with a failing liver
(E_TOO_MUCH_DEFCON)  performing one last bemused retrospective on life
before my session expired.  i chuckled over the use of public key
encryption in a world with common large qubit quantum computers: the
relative key strengths now in use were measured in killowatts of
computation sustained over a minimum time period for key pair
generation on dedicated hardware with open ended storage (meaning
whatever you could generate within a lifetime of key pair computation
could be stored reasonably on a common storage medium)

i recall a very strong key pair started at 64 kilowatts over 100 days
but was at least conjectured to require a coherent state (raw qubit
brute force) larger than anything possible to build in our solar
system.

nonces, digests, symmetric secrets and one time pads for key exchange
were all still measured in bytes though... *grin*

I know there has been some discussion on whether _strong_ primes are
needed for _RSA_.  The definition of a strong prime is a little more
involved; c.f. the paper by Rivest and Silverman
[http://eprint.iacr.org/2001/007/  and also available on Ron Rivest's
web page].  I was unaware, though, that there is a debate regarding the
use of safe primes for Diffie-Hellman.  My impression is that the use of
safe primes is generally accepted to be an important practice that
thwarts various attempts to compute a discrete log (e.g.
Pohlig-Hellman); also enough safe primes and generators are published --
one may utilize them in a protocol (assuming the people who published
the list are trusted not to have deliberately chosen prime groups for
which computing a discrete log is easier :)).
I'm also not sure how the choice of primes for Diffie-Hellman relates to
the complexity of factoring as you mentioned in your post.  As far as I
know, no one (in the open community at least) has discovered a
meaningful reduction in a standard model between the Diffie-Hellman
problem over a prime group and Factoring (nor has anyone proven that
such reductions cannot exist).  The closest thing I can think of is
trying to come up with the factorization of p-1 as you might want to do
in the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm -- but in that case, the complexity
would be prohibitive if p-1 had any large prime factors...
Are you referring to performing Diffie-Hellman over some other group?
Or is there a connection that you know of and can elaborate on?
Best Regards,
Zully
