Use PGP.

If you want to blab without being traced, go to the local public library
or netcafe. Some airports now have netcafe's that accept cash without
ID.

As a sysadmin, I often have to troubleshoot mail. That exposes me to
email. I try only to look at headers and ignore bodies, but I am
still exposed. I would much prefer to see PGP bodies.
