I didn't doubt that it was.  However, my caveat
remains true, and you haven't proved anything additional.

An entity claiming that name, and claiming to be
not-a-bot, and apparently controlling the DNS entry
at the server I checked today for fexl.com today,
has signed a message.  Yep, I believe [1] that.

I'm not picking on you.  Neither am I trying to be a dick;
skeptical socratics sometimes appear so.  Check the archives
for extended discussion as to what, exactly, signing proves.

On the other hand, *whatever* entity has been signing
these messages collects the reputations associated with
them *more reliably*[1] than merely posting under your
name.  Maybe you're a 14 year old girl pretending to
be an FBI agent pretending to be a cryptographer :-)

Making the leap from key-holder to meatspace
entity is unsound unless something in meatspace demonstrates
it.  You're all bits from here.

[1] Note that these beliefs are moderated by unfounded
trust in PGP implem & algs, that you've protected
your private key, etc.  But we'll grant that for now.
