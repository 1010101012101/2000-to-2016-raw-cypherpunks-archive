NATO, the finger of death
28.08.2014

Iraq: Chaos! Libya: Chaos! Syria: Chaos! Whatever NATO touches, turns
putrid, rots and dies. Three interventions by the Anglo-Saxon Alliance
(UK and US), two by the FUKUS Axis (add France), three interventions
by NATO, three destabilized States crawling with terrorists. The
responsibility lies at the feet of Washington and its poodle States
and the onus is on them to right the wrongs they willfully committed.
You messed up, now... Pay for it!

Are dogs Vegans? Do you feed goldfish chocolate? Common sense says no
in both cases. Common sense also dictates that you do not intervene in
highly complex societies with thousands of years of tradition and lore
intricately mixed up in a myriad of ethnic and religious mosaics
cemented together by a Governing body that understands where the point
of equilibrium is to be found and which is kept in its position by the
players in the society which it governs.

A company of the Portuguese Army was detailed to build a new village
for a community in the interior of Angola during the Colonial War*.
The company had been instructed to do so because the village had been
devastated. The architect based his idea on the downtown area of the
capital city of Portugal, Lisbon, reconstructed in straight parallel
lines after the earthquake and ensuing tsunami in 1755, which
destroyed the city. The community was transported to the village and
proudly shown their new home by the Portuguese captain. They ran away.
Asked why they didn't like their village, the community leader, or
soba, explained: "Our village is based on the circle. We eat sitting
in a circle, our homes are circular, we sit outside in a circle in the
evenings telling stories, laughing and singing. We take decisions
sitting in a circle, it has no head, no beginning and no end. And no
dark corners."

Can women in Saudi Arabia use forks when they eat? No, because it is
considered improper for a woman to put four long and hard prongs in
her mouth at the same time because when a man sees this, it gives him
unclean thoughts. For those western policy-makers chortling in mirth
as they read this, let us now come back to the point of this article,
the failed Western policy in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria.

Iraq: chaos! Libya: chaos! Syria: chaos! In all three cases, Western
politicians outdid one another in sheer arrogance, claiming (so
democratically) that "Saddam must go", "Gaddafy must go," and "Assad
must go". What we see in these three countries today is the direct
result of the criminal intervention by NATO, its two henchmen, the USA
and its poodle in chief, the UK and recently, France, which spends its
time subserviently crawling around the legs of its Anglo-Saxon NATO
masters across the Channel and across the Ocean, when it isn't
obediently obeying Germany's calls for austerity.

NATO destroyed Iraq, destroyed the State, destroyed the mechanisms of
control in a highly complex society whose many ethnic and religious
groups co-existed in peace until the West stepped in, after provoking
Iraq by getting Kuwait to steal oil in cross-drilling operations, then
demonizing the Iraqi Government, then directly interfering in the
internal affairs of a sovereign State by getting the Shiites in the
South to rebel, before the uprising was crushed. This criminally
irresponsible approach to foreign policy-making seems to be endemic in
the corridors of Whitehall, London and Washington DC, one of
Whitehall's most fetid and dysfunctional abortions over the years.

There ensued a decade of terrorist activity in Iraq between the First
and Second Gulf Wars, in which NATO aircraft strafed fields of cereals
and left the country strewn with Depleted Uranium, causing the deaths
and malformations of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, before
the outrage in 2003 when the Government was overthrown in an illegal
military invasion which resulted in around one million deaths
(murders) and today, the total destabilization of the State by ISIL, a
wonderful feather in the cap for Washington and its poodle in chief.
Yesterday they were full of bravado as they marched across the border
knowing Saddam Hussein (who was keeping al-Qaeda out of Iraq) had no
Weapons of Mass Destruction (his mistake was not to arm himself to the
hilt) and knowing the Iraqi Armed Forces would not fight back (in the
event the invasion was staged, with salvoes being fired over the
Iraqi's heads as they retreated to negotiated positions). Today
Washington and London are quivering in fear and are too scared to
fight ISIL, the monster they created.

This same criminal irresponsibility was demonstrated in Libya, where
they again intervened, this time joined by that sickening wannabe
Napoleon, France, this time not only creating but actively using
terrorists on their own lists of proscribed groups, which Muammar
al-Gaddafy (the first international leader to issue arrest warrants
against al-Qaeda) was fighting. Again, military equipment was deployed
against civilian structures, civilians were slaughtered by NATO
aircraft, the Libyan water supply system was targeted (war crime), the
electricity grid was destroyed (war crime) and the result, once again,
was the wholesale destruction of a State. Under the Geneva
Conventions, any military intervention must leave the area invaded
functioning properly attending to the needs of its citizens.

In not managing to guarantee this, the USA and its poodles in Europe
have failed miserably in their task and have shirked their
responsibilities. They are also responsible for criminal acts
breaching every fiber of international law. Their leaders are, in
plain English, war criminals and murderers.

And now for Syria. Just a few months ago that Nobel Peace Prizewinner
Obama in the USA was saying that Assad had to go, obediently parroted
by Cameron and Mr. 17 per cent popularity ratings, Hollande. Now, they
are considering sending military support to fight off ISIL in Syria,
after these very same Western/NATO powers armed, trained and aided
terrorists to fight the Government of President Assad, which has wide
approval across Syrian society.

If it was not so serious, it would be hilarious. But destroying
countries and societies has shocking social implications. What these
NATO countries deserve is for their boomerang to come back and smack
them square in the face, facing their own jihadis, to get a taste of
their own medicine, except for the fact that logic dictates that one
cannot attack their approach abroad and then wish the same thing on
them at home. What these criminally irresponsible powers must do is
man up, accept the responsibility for what they have done, and pay to
sort out the problems they created, keeping their unwanted troops at
home.

As those in Whitehall and Washington (let's be honest, Paris really
doesn't count, does it?) claim that we live in difficult times and
attack those who disagree with their criminal modus operandi, they
should be reminded that the evils they face are those of their own
creation. Instead of arrogantly ploughing ahead like modern-day
imperialists, they would do better to respect international law for
once, accept the responsibility for their actions, mind their own
business and start behaving with goodwill, instead of malevolence.

For those who have been involved in the political and military
processes in Iraq, Libya and Syria, they belong behind bars. The
mechanisms are already in place, the wheel is turning slowly, and most
of them will live long enough to cast looks of fear over their
shoulders wherever they may go. Blair already does, Rumsfeld dare not
step off an aircraft outside the USA, ditto Powell, Bush, Cheney and
Condoleezza Rice. The head of NATO is evil, psychopathic; the hand of
NATO is putrid, sociopathic and the finger of NATO is as icy as it is
satanic and demonic. It is the finger of death, contaminating
everything it touches.

NATO is the incarnation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse:
Conquest, War, Famine and Death. It is the Empire of Evil.



*The Colonial War was fought between Portugal and factions in its
former colonies Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, from 1961 to
1974; there was no war in Portugal's other African provinces, Cape
Verde and São Tomé and Principe Isles.
