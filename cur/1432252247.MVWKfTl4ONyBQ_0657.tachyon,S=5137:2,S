Why not read the judges rulling?

A payment into court of a derisory sum is a standard tactical legal
maneuver. It does not involve any admission of liability.

David Theroux began name calling, specifically everyone who does not accept
his theory must do so out of ignorance.

Matthew's selective editing of my posts deliberately misrepresents my
argument. I simply stated that the following argument is bogus:

   1) I am an expert on X
   2) The subject matter of X is so complex that nobody who is not an expert
can
	legitimately comment on it
   3) Therefore all assertions I make in the field of X MUST be considered
true
   4) Therefore all assertions you make in the field of X MUST be considered
false

Theroux did not even attempt to justify his argument, he merely restated it
and claimed that anyone who disagrees with his is a complete fool.

I don't think that any field has the right to such defference. I can explain
my argument to a lay audience. Theroux either cannot or will not.

I suggest that in either case his argument MUST be rejected.
