Anyone using USB headsets with speakfreely under Linux? I'm having trouble 
getting it to work.

SpeakFreely works "itself" very good. It is its interaction with the
drivers that is far from perfect. Unfortunately John is apparently busy
with other things and has no time for improving the program.

Neither me (who complained regularly and who read the source) have enough
time to contribute to SF.

Speak Freely for Unix needs a rewrite of logic when it outputs
sound. Your problems may be caused by very different matters, but anyway
if you feel motivated - figure out from the source what is supposed to
happen and then you may find why it breaks for you.

The current sound output design is old and made in different
circumstances than Linux computers are now. Hope somebody will redo it.
Native ALSA support may help in case OSS does not provide the necessary
hooks...

Best regards,
