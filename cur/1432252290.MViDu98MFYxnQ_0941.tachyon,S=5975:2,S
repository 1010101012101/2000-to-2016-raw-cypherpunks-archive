This has been SOP for the U.S. for a half century or more.

-- CIA training schools for torturers, assassins, death squads, etc.

-- "College of the Americas"

-- extremely "anti-constitutional" policies in countries the U.S. 
invades: confiscation of all privately-owned weapons, shutting down 
of newspapers and radio stations critical of the U.S. invasion, 
imposition of price controls...the U.S.G. treats moves into foreign 
countries as the chance to do everything it can't do inside the U.S.

-- did I mention training torturers and death squad members in 
Honduras, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Somalia (before the 
natives kicked out the U.S. soldiers via what the U.S.G. called 
"terrorism"), and numerous other countries

(The U.S. Army had developed the "Can you fly?" torture method, where 
a group of Viet Cong or NVA prisoners were loaded onto choppers and 
then, one by one, pushed out at a few thousand feet. The Argentinians 
modified this for their treatment of the students, union members, and 
political activists they arrested by the tens of thousands: they 
loaded them onto C-5 cargo planes and pushed them out over the ocean. 
No wonder they "disappeared." The CIA no doubt updated their training 
manuals accordingly.)

By the way, my best demolition manuals are from the U.S.G. (I picked 
up a set of four CD-ROMs with nearly all of the U.S.G. terrorism, 
assassination, mayhem, booby trap, and similar manuals. Precisely the 
kind of "bomb-making instructions" the criminals like Sen. Swinestein 
are trying to get banned.)

Cordesman is also, ironically, a journalist for audio and audiophile 
magazines, the kind of magazines ("Stereophile," "The Absolute 
Sound") which report on the Tice Clock, an LED alarm clock which when 
plugged into any outlet in the room of a stereo system results in "a 
delicate softening of the mid-range digital signals, enhancing the 
perceived dimensionality of the tonal experience. The fact that the 
Tice Clock was _advertised_ in these rags, er, journals, was 
unimportant.

(I'm not criticizing Cordesman for these audio things, just noting 
that I've been following his career since the Gulf War, when he was a 
daily commentator on CNN and similar networks. Yes, he's the same 
guy...no error.)
