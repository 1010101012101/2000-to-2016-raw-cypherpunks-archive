-------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE 8TH WORKSHOP ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC 2004)

Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany

September 20, 21 & 22, 2004

FOURTH ANNOUNCEMENT             27th  July , 2004

This announcement lists one more hotel. Note that meanwhile there are
more details available on the summer school.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECC 2004 is the eighth in a series of annual workshops dedicated
to the study of elliptic curve cryptography and related areas.
The main themes of ECC 2004 will be:
- The discrete logarithm problem.
- Efficient parameter generation and point counting.
- Provably secure cryptographic protocols.
- Efficient software and hardware implementation.
- Side-channel attacks.
- Deployment of elliptic curve cryptography.

It is hoped that the meeting will continue to encourage
and stimulate further research on the security and implementation
of elliptic curve cryptosystems and related areas, and encourage
collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists and
engineers in the academic, industry and government sectors.

There will be approximately 15 invited lectures (and no contributed
talks), with the remaining time used for informal discussions.
There will be both survey lectures as well as lectures on latest
research developments.

SUMMER SCHOOL ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY:

For the first time the ECC workshop will be held together with a
summer school on elliptic curve cryptography. This summer school is
organized by VAMPIRE, the Virtual Application and Implementation
Research Lab within the European project ECRYPT
www.ecrypt.eu.org

The school will take place September 13.-17.th in the Ruhr-University
Bochum. Our target audience are students, PhD students and
practitioners with background in applications and industry. It would
be nice if you could guide interested people to the summer school
