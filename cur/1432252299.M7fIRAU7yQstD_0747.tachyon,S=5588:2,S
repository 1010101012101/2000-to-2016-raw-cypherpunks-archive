If any of you get services from AT&T you might want to start looking for a
more ethical carrier (if one exists) - AT&T has been caught red handed
hosting spammers and promising not to terminate their services.

(just sent this to AT&T, thought SPAM-L would like a copy)

AT&T,

The Spamhaus Project has just received a fax copy of a Bu lk Hos ting
contract written and signed by AT&T and sent to a known spamhaus, NEVADA
HOSTING (aka spammers Ronnie Scelson and Bruce Connelly, in ATT.NET block
NETBLK-NEVADAHOSTING-242, 12.36.242.0 - 12.36.242.255) in which AT&T agrees
to provide NEVADA HOSTING with Bu lk Hos ting for spamming purposes.

A copy of this fax is now at http://spamhaus.org/rokso/nevadahosting.jpg

This fax proves that AT&T knowingly does business with spammers, and shows
that AT&T makes 'pink' contracts with known spammers to not terminate the
spammers services knowing full well that the only way it can provide this
service is to either ignore or bin spam complaints on such "bu lk hos ted"
web sites. Here is an extract from the pink contract which says this:

   "NevadaHosting wishes to operate Bu lk Host ed Web Sites. Bu lk Hos ting
    is defined as hosting a web site that is Spammed from other gateways.
    NevadaHosting only hosts the web site that is advertized in the Spam.

    AT&T Agrees that it will not terminate the provision of services to
    NevadaHosting because of NevadaHosting's operation of Bu lk Hos ted
    Web Sites"

AT&T Abuse will appreciate that I am now going to make this contract
public, and of course it will be passed to the MAPS RBL team. Therefore it
is very important that this communication is passed to AT&T Management now.
