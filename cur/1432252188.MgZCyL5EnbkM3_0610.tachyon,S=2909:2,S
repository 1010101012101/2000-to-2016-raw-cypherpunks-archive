   Not to mention all the CDs and movies available in libraries. What's the
difference in borrowing CDs from a library and taking them home and taping or
mp3ing them and getting them from the net?

   Or even worse the practice of Coke, Pepsi, et al paying money to the school
for exclusive rights to market their product. Also sort of like what M$ did in
schools and colleges -- gave them some free computers on the condition that all
competing software be removed from computer labs. Not surprising at all that
megacorps now want to buy teaching time in schools. In Japan the megacorp have
long run their own schools for workers kids to ensure the loyalty of their
future workers.
