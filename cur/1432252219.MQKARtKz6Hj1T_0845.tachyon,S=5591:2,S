Dave's right, Jim.  The NDTM obtains The Right Answer by using a process
you could call "guessing" or you could call "an oracle".  That's not
"Oracle" like "Larry Ellison telling you what you WILL buy next", it's
"Oracle" like "Stoned priestess telling you that if you attack today,
a great kingdom will fall", and the polynomial-time part is where
you crank that through and find out that yes, it's correct.
(Unfortunately it's *your* kingdom, but it's correct.)  

The reason the NDTM is hypothetical is because always guessing the
right answer isn't a technology that's really available,
unless quantum computers can do that with a sufficently useful precision.
(Looks like QCs will at best guess the right answer some of the time,
not all the time, and you'll still have to check it.)

The NDTM doesn't allow the state to be both 0 and 1, it tells you which.
The DTM part verifies that the answer from the oracle is correct,
even though obtained by non-deterministic magic.
