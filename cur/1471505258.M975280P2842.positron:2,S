"Tor is planning on having a "Community truth and reconciliation" moment
at the Seattle Meeting."
(Note: After expelling people without warning, unilaterally exercising
judge and jury power - by the accusers themselves, no genuine reach out
to "community" that the public can discern, and demonstrating plenty of
other ills and evils along the way (hypocrisy, lies, refusal to recant
lies, lack of display of any empathy, no genuine interest in any
potential "rape victims" of the alleged accused (Jacob Applebaum), etc,
etc.

Day by day, the picture becomes unmistakably clear:

Shari, Alison and Isis are evident sociopaths, feeding off the USA
government three letter agencies/ TLAs, in particular the CIA, and
abusing the community, abusing any righteous judicial or reconciliation
process, and doing all this entirely publicly.

Dingledine and Mathewson and any other behind the scenes "head honchos"
are evidently supporting the evident sociopathic behaviour.

Tor Inc has become, quite clearly, a microcosm of the behaviour of the
USA/ North Atlantic war machine system - sociopathicly feeding off the
rest of the world, which it abuses publicly and with impunity (at least
for now...)

The bunt hunt continues..
