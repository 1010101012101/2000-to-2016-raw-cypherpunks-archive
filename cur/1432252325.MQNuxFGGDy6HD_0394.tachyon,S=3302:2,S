The second beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.6a is now available from the
OpenSSL FTP site <URL: ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/>.

OpenSSL 0.9.6a is a bug-fix release of version 0.9.6, and currently
contains 43 documented changes.  Among others, this release should build
on all Windows platforms, which 0.9.6 failed to do.  Just as for version
0.9.6, this one comes in two variants, one containing the now well-known
ENGINE code and one that doesn't.  The tar files are:

	openssl-0.9.6a-beta2.tar.gz
	openssl-engine-0.9.6a-beta2.tar.gz

The changes since the first beta are:

	- made ms/32all.bat and ms/16all.bat to work.
	- a few warnings under WIN32 fixed.
	- a missing module in the VMS build system was added.
	- a memory leak in the error data code was plugged.
	- the support for shared libraries changed as in 0.9.7-dev.
	  [N.B.: shared library support is still *EXPERIMENTAL* and not
	  really supported considering the big number of changes that
	  are coming in future versions of OpenSSL]
	- a PKCS#12 key generation bug was fixed.
	- a few typos were corrected.
	- more configuration possibilities for Unixware were added.

If this beta is shown to build and test correctly on all reported platforms,
there will be no need for another beta.  Otherwise, there will be a third
beta.  In any case, that next release is scheduled for Tuesday 2001-03-27.  To
make sure that it will work correctly, please test this version (especially on
less common platforms), and report any problems to <openssl-bugs@openssl.org>.
