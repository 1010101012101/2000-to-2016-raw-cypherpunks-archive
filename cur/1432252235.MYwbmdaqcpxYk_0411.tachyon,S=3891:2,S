Why? They make 80G drives now for very cheap. Got a little pipe, get a
bigger one. The only persons who should shudder at 2M attachments are the
node operators. They have to deal with n*2M of traffic as compared to your
measly 2M.

Quite your whinning.

400000 bytes maximum. The current maximum that has been agreed too
informally (it's in the archives if you want to look) is 1M. SSZ is
currently set to bounce any emails over 1M (and it's detailed on the
homepage).
