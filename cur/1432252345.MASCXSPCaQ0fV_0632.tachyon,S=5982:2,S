                       PETITION:

Zimbabwe, "another  jewel of Africa" is dying.

Strangled by the corrupt forces,short sighted  self serving policies of the

ego-maniacal dictator Robert Mugabe. Freedom, human rights and sensibility

has been

extinguished. Zimbabwe is becoming an  unstabilising factor in the regional

politics.

Only drastic  measures by international democracies will  be able to save

Zimbabwe from  damnation and prevent long term

starvation and civil war in the region as experienced in the Congo.



We have to ensure responsible governance for the people of  Zimbabwe.

TheInternational community pleads for support to save Zimbabwe:



1. The resignation of Robert G. Mugabe

2. Free and Fair Parliamentary and Municipal Elections

3. Non interference or  escalation of regional conflicts. Removal of

Zimbabwean Troops from  the Congo

4. Restoration of Constitutional Law in Zimbabwe

5. Obedience by the  government of the day to the laws of the country.



We the undersigned support this petition
