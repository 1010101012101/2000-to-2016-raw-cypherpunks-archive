[ID experience at Jiffy-loob]

If you patronize only corporate mega-stores, this is what you get.
None of the (locally-owned) resturants I eat breakfast at do any
loyalty card bullshit, they happily accept anonymous cash and the food
is wonderful.  The vendors at the local farmer's market take cash too.
The local stores in the chain of bicycle stores I sometimes go to for
tires and parts do sometimes ask me if I want to be on their buyers club
thing, I just say no and that's fine with them.

You need to shop at stores run by humans. If you have to
patronize a mega-corp, stick up for yourself.  They insist
because it works on most people.  There is no
need to baaah along with the sheep.
