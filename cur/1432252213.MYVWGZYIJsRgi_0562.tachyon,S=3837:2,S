Yes, I think those are the essential questions.

Admittedly it would normally be quite difficult to eliminate any detectable 
trace...I'm assuming that a huge blast of heat should do it. Cooling can be 
done by liquid, for instance. The liquid could be programmed to flush at 
certain random intervals to cover correlation between operation and smokey 
interest. (But this probably eliminates dual-use arguments.)

Assuming it's doable then I'm as yet uncertain about the legal 
ramifications. Say the smokey's are stopping you for something "routine" and 
you burn your stash right there. Do they have the legal right to even 
mention the disposal operation? And if they do, is there any legal way to 
state what substance was destroyed? Perhaps it was pot (as opposed to 
something harder), or moonshine, or even some designer drug that's not yet 
technically illegal?
