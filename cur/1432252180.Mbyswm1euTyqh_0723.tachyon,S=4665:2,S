Well, you haven't given me a very convincing argument here. In most of his 
writings, Chomsky makes it clear that the deaths were not due to the bomb, 
but the loss of medicine (such as penecillin) in Sudan's only pharmecuetical 
factory.

"Or the fact that Nicaruaga brought  the

Uh...perhaps? That should be a very easy thing to find out, and as the 
accusation and conviction were quite damming, and as you claim Chomsky 
regularly "lies" on many of his citations, I would have thought that this at 
least would be one citation you'd check.

Got to say...I'm a busy man, and you haven't even said anything meriting 
even the investigaion of your dis-chomsky web page.
