Short notice, but maybe time enough to send informed hecklers?

> Title: Content Protection for Recordable Media

> Speaker: Jeffrey B. Lotspiech

>
> About the talk:
>
> Content Protection for Recordable Media, or CPRM, is a technology
> developed by IBM, Intel, Matsushita, and Toshiba to provide copy
> protection on portable media. The technology allows a recorder to
> record encrypted content, and a player to play it back, without
> having any keys in common. The media acts as a passive oracle to
> allow the different boxes to come to the same cryptographic key.
> In contrast, previous copy protection technologies like the one
> used for DVD video, depended on shared keys between the mastering
> studio and the players, with predictable results. As soon as a
> 16-year-old in Norway found one shared key, the system was
> effectively broken: there was no way to exclude the broken key
> from the system without hurting too many innocent consumers. In
> contrast, CPRM can survive thousands of independent attacks, and
> exclude millions of circumvention devices, without any chance of
> innocent consumers being affected.
>
> Recently, articles have appeared in the press that CPRM will be
> standardized on all PC hard drives. This has fueled Orwellian
> mages of a Big Brother chip on your PC that will decide whether
> your files are worthy of being copied. This is complete nonsense.
> CPRM would never be standardized, nor have we ever proposed such
> a thing. CPRM strength is portability and interchangeability and
> it is mismatch for fixed hard drive. It is completely passive,
> requires no hardware, and can only be exploited by newly-designed
> applications. It cannot possibly affect existing files or
> applications. How these myths came about, and persist, was an
> object lesson for a media-naive researcher.
>
> About the speaker:
>
> Jeff Lotspiech is the manager of the Content Protection
> Technology Group at the IBM Almaden Research Center. He has a BS
> and MS in Computer Science from MIT, 1972. He has been working on
> content protection technologies, both the Internet and media, for
> the last six years.
