ruled (US v. Jones) https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._jones_%282012%29 =
 that police could not place a GPS tracking device on a car without a warrant. =
 One argument that has been rejected in lower-court cases was the idea that =
in principle, a car's movements could be tracked with an army of police, one =
per street corner, so that a GPS tracking bug simply automated that process. =
 One problem that argument is that society not only doesn't have the resources =

society may not necessarily want such an intrusive system to exist.

installed a tracking device on a car I used, probably in about April 2000, =
without a warrant.  Presumably, if challenged they would have been claiming =
to follow a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 1999,  U.S. v. McIver, =
which had allowed the placement of a GPS tracking device on a truck seen at =
the location of a marijuana growing operation.  The problem with this justification, =
however, is that at least in McIver, there was an actual crime involved, and =
the truck was plausibly involved in that crime.  In my case, after my release =
from prison in April 2000, nobody alleged that I was engaging in any crime. =
 The McIver case didn't rule that police could simply choose to place a GPS =
tracking device on ANY car, for no reason, and even without 'probable cause' =
or 'reasonable suspicion'.

in October 2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant for the placement of =
ANOTHER tracking device on the same car (which, of course, may have ended up =
being the same device!) WITHOUT telling the judge that a tracking device was =
already on the car, and had been so since at least as early as April 2000. =
 Why the subterfuge?  They later used the result of the tracking device (at =
least, the portion taken after the October warrant) against me in court.  But =
they continued to conceal the fact that a GPS device had been placed since =
perhaps April 2000.  Presumably, they concealed that because they would have =

despite the fact that they had no 'probable cause' nor 'reasonable suspicion' =
to do so.  To conceal that, they obtained the warrant, making it appear that =
the GPS surveillance started in October 2000.  This was fraud, because in order =
to obtain a warrant, they have to explain WHY they need the GPS device installed. =
 Clearly, since a GPS device was already installed in the car, there was no =
need to place one.  THAT misrepresented the need to the judge.

the government.  What the average person doesn't understand is that a defense =

of that faked case until June 2003, when I first saw that case's docket.  The =

This 'extension' principle doesn't always work. &nbsp;In 2012, the Supreme =
Court ruled (US v. Jones)&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_states_v._jones_%282012%29" =

that police could not place a GPS tracking device on a car without a warrant. =
&nbsp;One argument that has been rejected in lower-court cases was the idea =
that in principle, a car's movements could be tracked with an army of police, =
one per street corner, so that a GPS tracking bug simply automated that process. =
&nbsp;One problem that argument is that society not only doesn't have the resources =
to accomplish such a blanket coverage of an area, and that even if practical, =
society may not necessarily want such an intrusive system to exist.</div>

issue was (secretly) quite relevant to me. &nbsp;Federal authorities apparently =
installed a tracking device on a car I used, probably in about April 2000, =
without a warrant. &nbsp;Presumably, if challenged they would have been claiming =
to follow a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 1999, &nbsp;U.S. v. =
McIver, which had allowed the placement of a GPS tracking device on a truck =
seen at the location of a marijuana growing operation. &nbsp;The problem with =
this justification, however, is that at least in McIver, there was an actual =
crime involved, and the truck was plausibly involved in that crime. &nbsp;In =
my case, after my release from prison in April 2000, nobody alleged that I =
was engaging in any crime. &nbsp;The McIver case didn't rule that police could =

even without 'probable cause' or 'reasonable suspicion'.</div>

was particularly devious (and I call illegal) was that later, probably in October =
2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant for the placement of ANOTHER tracking =
device on the same car (which, of course, may have ended up being the same =
device!) WITHOUT telling the judge that a tracking device was already on the =
car, and had been so since at least as early as April 2000. &nbsp;Why the subterfuge? =
&nbsp;They later used the result of the tracking device (at least, the portion =
taken after the October warrant) against me in court. &nbsp;But they continued =
to conceal the fact that a GPS device had been placed since perhaps April 2000. =
&nbsp;Presumably, they concealed that because they would have had to explain, =
in court, why they were tracking me, without a warrant, and despite the fact =
that they had no 'probable cause' nor 'reasonable suspicion' to do so. &nbsp;To =
conceal that, they obtained the warrant, making it appear that the GPS surveillance =
started in October 2000. &nbsp;This was fraud, because in order to obtain a =
warrant, they have to explain WHY they need the GPS device installed. &nbsp;Clearly, =
since a GPS device was already installed in the car, there was no need to place =
one. &nbsp;THAT misrepresented the need to the judge.</div>
