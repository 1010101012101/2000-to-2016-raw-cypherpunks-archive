I'll ignore the possibility that there is a racist implication behind
this....

Who said it had to be black, or be Silver Nitrate? The example I saw
used a purple dye. If you actually knew any blacks (I'm using that 
word instead of the currently PC 'African-American' because it's skin
color that's under discussion, and the discussion applies to people
outside the US as well), you'd know that the palmar side of the hand
and fingers are much lighter than the back.

Also, if you want to get high tech, use a fluorescent dye mixed 
with DMSO. It'll penetrate deep into the skin, and be visible under
UV (no cosmetic objections). I suspect it'd take weeks to wear off.

Sometimes crypto is not the best solution. The various 'Internet
voting at home' schemes bug the hell out of me.
