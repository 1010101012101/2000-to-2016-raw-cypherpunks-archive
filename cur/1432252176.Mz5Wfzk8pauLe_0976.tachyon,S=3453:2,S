It's not quite "amount of nodes" as "CPU capacity". You'd need to have
more than 50% of the processing capacity of the system to consistently
win the "races" to find the next block. Currently, the system is going
at about 1.5 trillion hashes per second (my macbook does about 1 million
per second, for comparison). So an attacker would need a
not-inconsiderable heap of real hardware, rather than just a load of
virtual nodes. Within their capacity for sure, but still not something
they'll do lightly.
