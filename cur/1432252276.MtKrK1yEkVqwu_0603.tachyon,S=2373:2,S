A few years ago I wrote a short paper looking at government-installed
snoopware in terms of the 3rd A. Given that the other BoR amendments
have been broadly interpreted in light of new technology, it's
reasonable to view software as "soldiers". In light of the Scarfo case
(keyboard sniffer software installed in a black-bag operation, ca. 1990)
I'd argue that the Fedz have violated the 3rd A. (My paper was before
Scarfo, so I claim some prescience. Alas.)
