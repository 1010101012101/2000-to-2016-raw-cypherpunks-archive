On CNN I watched the election results coming in. They always listed 
four candidates: Bush, Gore, Nader, and Hagelin. The usual format was 
Bush/Gore on the "crawl" at the bottom of the screen and then a 
second page with the crawl having Nader/Hagelin.

Sometimes Buchanan was listed.

It sure looked like Hagelin was doing better than Browne, the 
Libertarian Party candidate.

Well, here's what the "Washington Post" is reporting as the nearly 
final tally for the lesser candidates:

Harry Browne (Lib.) 	0 	373,109 	0 
Howard Phillips (CST) 	0 	98,224 	0 
John Hagelin (NLP) 	0 	87,914 	0 
James Harris (SWP) 	0 	11,190 	0 
L. Neil Smith (Lib.) 	0 	5,181 	0 
Monica Moorehead (WW) 	0 	4,245 	0 
David McReynolds (Soc.) 	0 	4,097 	0 



I guess it was "natural law" that caused CNN (and perhaps other 
networks) to report on Hagelin over Browne.

The Libertarian Party should request a "Do-over!" like the Palm Beach 
Jews are now demanding.
