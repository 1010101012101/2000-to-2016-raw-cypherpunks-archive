First, you mean "the Web PKI", not PKI in general.

The next part of this is circular reasoning.  We don't see network 
sniffing for credit card numbers *because* we have SSL.  Since many of 
the worm-spread pieces of spyware incorporate sniffers, I'd say that 
part of the threat model is correct.

As for DNS hijacking -- that's what's behind "pharming" attacks.  In 
other words, it's a real threat, too.
