i'm opposed to all government-funded health care;but, if we ARE stuck with
it, it ought to be for all, and, of course, no PRIVATE company should be
forced to discriminate on the basis of age.

Seems reasonable to me. Why not? A heterosexual is as likely to be a child

Government shouldn't be funding medical care at all. However, deciding what
to fund on the basis of some moral judgement is folly. Cancer, diabetes,
and strokes *ARE NOT CONTAGIOUS*;AIDS is. That makes it far more of a
'public' health threat, and thus, by the logic of 'public health care', the
most likely target.

Besides -- you get strokes from eating hamburgers, cancer from smoking, and
adult-onset diabetes from too much chocalte and not enough exercise. All of
these are sins (Gluttony, laziness, etc) in the Christian morality as well
-- shouldn't we be "punishing" those sinners as well as gay people?
