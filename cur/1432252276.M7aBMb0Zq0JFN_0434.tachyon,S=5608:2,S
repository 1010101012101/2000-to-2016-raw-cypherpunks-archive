In other words a cleaned-up version of the old Town Gas that provided
the original streetlighting for industrial cities in the C19 and used to
be made in the vast gasworks dotted around all over the place until
piped natural methane took over in the 1960s.

There's no news here (except for VW's stupid choice of brand name). 
We've always known we could replace petroleum and coal by agricultural
production, because oil and coal were themselves introduced as
replacements for the vegetable oils, whale oils, tallows,  alcohols and
charcoals that people used to burn before the oil industry got big in
the 1870s-1890s.

The reason we use mineral oils from the ground is that they are
*cheaper*.

If the price of a barrel of crude oil rises above somewhere between 30
and 60 dollars (depending on who you believe), then coal and  oilshale
become cheaper & we can switch to that. If the price of mineral fuels
rises above somewhere between 50 and 100 dollars per equivalent of a
barrel of oil, then using liquid fuel derived from agriculture becomes
cheaper. 

The only ways will will be using such fuels on a large scale in rich
countries in the near future is one of:

- we "run out of oil" a lot more spectacularly than looks likely now 

- or world regresses to impoverished autarkies with little trade between
them so industrialised countries with no oil have to make their own (cf.
South Africa in 1970s, or Germany during world wars)

- or governments tax oil so much that bio fuel is cheaper (in UK right
now industrial alcohol is cheaper than petrol because of tax - but
ordinary citizens aren't allowed to buy it in any quantity, and what we
can buy is also taxed)

- or global warming looks so bad that people are prepared to accept an
increase in their costs in order to avoid burning fossil fuel (and are
prepared to use legal or government or military constraints to prevent
others burning it as well)

Which do you prefer?

Of course it always was cheaper to use agricultural product  as solid
fuel, if you were near the farm and if you had an application that can
handle it. Which is  why, for example, sugar refineries in poor tropical
countries get their heat from burning waste from the cane. And there are
a few green-minded small-scale projects that burn coppiced wood they
grow themselves.   But the distribution and handling complexity of
moving millions of tons of solid waste around make that too expensive
for large scale use. Same as the poultry farm my sister lives on can
save money by burning methane given off from  duck shit. But not many of
us share our homes with a quarter of a million ducks.
