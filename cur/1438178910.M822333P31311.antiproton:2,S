You do it like this: The original 'Like':
+1
And then everyone is supposed to notice and mentally tabulate the results.  Or your mail reader could track posts and do it for you, 
but nobody ever did that.

I've run my own box on the Internet continuously since 1992.  But there is a payment history, it's been in the same location for 8 
years, etc.  When I imagine a more secure (in certain senses) alternative, as least as an individual, it usually involves public 
cloud services, perhaps in some ephemeral rotating basis way.  First you need to secure DNS, or some similar alternative, then...  
Tor or similar helps for a certain class of usage, but then you're outside the normal Internet world.  Without interesting goals, no 
point in interesting solutions other than knowing how to do interesting solutions and what their limitations are.  Which is a good 
thing in and of itself.

There is, as you state, a large difference between acknowledging these other options and their upsides/downsides, vs. simply not acknowledging their existence at all.
