There's nothing particularly unreasonable about this, from a risk 
persepctive. In fact, credit card companies already work like this more or 
less...they can afford to protect cardmembers from Fraud precisely because 
of the economies of scale. As for the card industry itself, it is already 
reputation based. People pay up not because they're afraid to get arrested 
or litigated against, but because they want to preserve their Reputation 
with the Rating agencies (real deadbeats don't care about their reputation, 
and most of the money they spend is never recovered.)
