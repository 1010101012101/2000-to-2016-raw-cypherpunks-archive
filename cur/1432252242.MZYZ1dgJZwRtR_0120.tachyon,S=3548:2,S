Subject: Nov-L: DOJ field guidance for new terrorism law

Friends:

In reaction to the events of 9/11 sweeping new powers were given to law
enforcement authorities. Below is a link to a pdf document the
Department of Justice has prepared for field guidance on use of the new
law. It provides a useful analysis of significantly expanded law
enforcement authority.
