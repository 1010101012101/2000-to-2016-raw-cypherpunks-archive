For background, I'm not anglo-saxon either. My grandparents were from
Bessarabia and Georgia region who fled the early 1900s pogroms to Ellis
Island. My grandfather sympathized with the Mensheveiks and was
vehemently anti-communist... a reform Jew who never gave one penny to
the settlers in Palestine.

I have a friend (a grateful deadhead friend fwiw) from South Africa, a
white man in his 60s whose father was a lawyer and had defended ANC
people during Apartheid days, was threatened, and had to flee with his
family.

One day a decade or so ago we were talking politics and he blurted out

    "I LOVE America! The walls are so much higher. The razer(sic) wire's
    so much sharper, and all that pesky police state apparatus... You
    don't see it!"


A few months ago we got to talking politics again and I reminded him of
that quote then I asked: "So can you see that police state apparatus
yet?" His reply was a vigorous nodding to the affirmative.

That apparatus YOU see also exists in the US, and now you CAN see it.
