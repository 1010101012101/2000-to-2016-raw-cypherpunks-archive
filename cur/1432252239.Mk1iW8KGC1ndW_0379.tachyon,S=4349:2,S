"National Security Agencies" of which Nation?

* Gamma Group have an origin in Germany.

* Then moved all the companies to UK (offshore or real moving of busines?)

* mail.gammagroup.com mailserver is in Beirut, Lebanon.

So it's interesting that it's not very clear "where they are based".
Also on Linkedin there is *not a single person* that worked for one of
their group company.

In any case as far as i know there's no "export version" of software
like this, not like it is for "crypto" if it reside under dual-use
wassenaar agreement.
The trojan producer just differentiate the products based on their
capabilities and feature, basing on that the pricing.

I also know of companies that asked for export permission (of monitoring
technologies) to national authorities (in italy) and just because it was
"difficult to understand what it is", the authorities are not able to
answer within 90days, and so it's "by default allowed" .

As an additional fun conspiracy theory, at 4.1km from their Munich
office there is SecurStar GmbH that in 2006 developed a mobile trojan:
