During my PreTrial InFarceRation, at a time when the Federal GovernMint =
was attempting to pressure me into giving up my right to an extradition =
hearing, Linda Lou informed me that Jeff Gordon had asked her to tell me =
that if I waived extradition, that I would be able to get proper medical =
treatment once I was extradited to Washington.
This, of course, turned out to be a BaldFacedLie, but regardless, one =
has to ask oneself what kind of LowLifeBottomSuckingScum would attempt =
to pressure a citizen into giving up one's legal rights by suggesting =
that relief from medical torture and abuse is conditional upon making =
one's prosecution, and unavoidable conviction, easier for the =
GooberMint.

There is a reason that the Feds object to the Citizens paying too close =
a scrutiny to them personally.  It is because Federal Employees who use =
their positions to ShitOnTheConstitution and commit Ethical Atrocities =
understandably live in Fear of the Citizens.
Jim Bell's prosecution did not reflect his danger to anybody, but his =
danger to the Fears of the Justice Criminals who recognize that, =
according to the Values&OR&Ethics of the Founding Fathers, THEY [TM] =
would be Targets...

In Reality, THEY [TM] Prosecute Only ThemSelves...
