Can't be done.  I don't have time to go into ALL the reasons.
Fortunately for me, any one reason is sufficient.  #1: it's all about
the economics.  You have failed to specify that the cost of breaking
into the data has to exceed the value of the data.  But even if you
did that, you'd have to assume that the data was never worth more than
that to *anyone*.  As soon as it was worth that, they could break into
the data, and data is, after all, just data.

Ignore economics at your peril.
