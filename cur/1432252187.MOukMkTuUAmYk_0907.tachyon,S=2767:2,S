What about Intel and Microsoft?  When the few microchip companies make a
deal with the copyright content cartels (RIAA and MPAA) and the desktop
operating system monopoly (MS), then gov't action isn't needed to restrict
the way we use our computers - and the flow of information.

Simply put, markets lead to consolidation.  Consolidation leads to monopoly.
Monopoly leads to control from above, with no accountability.  Is this
better than gov't?  I certainly see the dangers of gov't: state terrorism,
state ineptitude, state racism and xenophobia, but I see market control as
at least as dangerous since corporations are not accountable to any sort of
democratic control - and I don't think the people with the most capital
necessarily make the best decisions.
