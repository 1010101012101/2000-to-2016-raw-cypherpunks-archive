Because my 10 bucks can either buy some bloated nonprofiteer a
fraction of an expense account lunch, or it can get 20 hardcover books-worth
(100 10-cent paperbacks) of information in the hands of people who are hungry
for it, instantly.

Actually, I've spent quite a bit of time working for various nonprofit
pro-freedom "causes"-- the amount of sheer waste and fruitless blathering
would make you sick too. If you can see something to do that's more
direct and immediate, why not go for it when it hardly costs you anything?
It's certainly not enough, but at least it's something real.
