To John-

there are over 200 groups discussing the same issues, at least 2 got
nationalised aggressively, and there have been some tangential posts
on blogs or commercial forums mainly concerns about their datacenter
security not knowing who might attack them, but overall the same
concerns are expressed:

Can the data be spoofed? Not at this resolution without having a model
of everything at the same resolution...

Are the blocks secure? No. [...] But services are stable.

Exports to public? yes, p2p clusters loading, datacenters doing
preparation processing, packed table files are set up for distributed
search

How do *you* know? UHD/4k VNC video stream to one of the master
control servers handling the database import and text chat with 200
others, no direct access to data here, but certainty that the data is
distributing.

Involved how? rendering code to make GEO-TIFF map tiles and aggrigated
spline/curves to simplify snapshot data and level of detail pyramid
(multi-variate parametric search) index data.

Now we ask... If this was NATO-ish or any variety of US/UK system
built in the 1960s(?) can we solve for locations or viable downlink
targets to intercept? This hint at geo-magnetic shift is a huge
opportunity!

The coin data is ... glorious... but the other signals are no less
amusing, one set appears to be wired sigint in mhz carrier bands,
assumably urban analogue phone signals as recorded from the switch
routing system's ground or related wiretaps to rf via cable.

genome.gov had links to the various data formats that others
identified in the organics table.

X-Ray physics and detector materials need research, 1890s through
1970s was a huge ammount of X-Ray publicity, but NEVER EVER DID ANYONE
USE IT FOR SIGNALING??? BULLSHIT!

ALSO!!!

"is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?" YES.
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar
facilities, looks like it was isolated in the newer signal index, so
it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and
where! (and where else!)

more questions:

coins on boats? yes.
coins on submarines? YES. (with ghosting)

organic signals? wtf?

Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary
index is a SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC tree, the supporting block (large
bit scope number) is VERY SIMILAR to a genetic expression profile tree
such as genome.gov/ and many of the gene profiling standards.

Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the
primary groups have been preparing last few days... we need to get
physics and advanced crypto groups attention, if the signals are
encoded and that party broke through dense analogue crypto, it will
take a huge effort to solve for that (it may have been an analogue EM
field as well that performed the encoding or reference signals) to
make the same capability posible for others.

Staying alive!
