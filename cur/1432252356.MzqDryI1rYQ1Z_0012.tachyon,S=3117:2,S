Supreme Court Won't KO Airport ID Policy

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to
federal airport regulations requiring passengers to show
identification before they board planes.

The justices, without comment, let stand an appeals court ruling
against Libertarian activist and millionaire John Gilmore. Gilmore
wanted the court to force the federal government to disclose the
policy that requires passengers to produce identification.

Unless the regulations are made public, air travelers have no way to
determine if the regulations call for impermissible searches, Gilmore
said in court papers. The Justice Department has said that demanding
ID protects passengers' safety.

The case is Gilmore v. Gonzales, 06-211.
