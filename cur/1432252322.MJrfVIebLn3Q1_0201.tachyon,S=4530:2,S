 perfect. thank you

 (though assumption was more like MMORPG as
 distributed parallel network keying same space
 from many unique vantages, where environment*
 is of different structures and conceptualizations
 and parts do not necessarily align into a clear
 'whole' view, including if many-many exchanges
 function beyond limits of model or framework)

 i think i grasp a fundamental concept of crypto
 that relates size of message (message length)
 with design of algorithmic structure needed to
 successfully embed or hide the message else
 hidden order may be easily visible/discovered

 i still contend this is different for set theory and
 models of noise - yet assume equations in that
 space could function differently and could have
 other design requirements or crypto principles
 perhaps more shallow if hiding in massive noise
 or equations to nest data in higher-dimensional
 matrices or at various levels, presumably unlike
 what appears a more static, confined construct
 of linear equationspace and its requirements

 in that 'keys' could function differently in bit set
 approach though perhaps rekeying is universal
 as a security principle yet potentially flawed if
 it could reveal a particular structure leading
 to its compromise whereas reusing an 'infinity
 key' (regenerating keys or using same key in
 new instantiations, accessing different arbitrary
 structure as keychain multitool) may function
 in a different context than existing approaches,
 in some way- which relates to the dataspace;
 such that perhaps the key itself is noisy or
 indeterminate as to what exactly the key is

 though this speculation could all be false.

 *(though of cipher environment presumed 'outside'
  the capacity of computers to process, rationalize
  accurately, thus not contained in electronic boxes;
  thus beyond modeled computer space, infinitely so)
