Be careful using the phrase "have to" in any discussion of legal issues.

Does government force libraries to pay more for some subscriptions? Not 
to my knowledge.

Do some publishers have different rates for individuals versus 
libraries and other institutions? Yes.

Are libraries required by law to reimburse authors and publishers when 
they allow books and magazines to be looked at by patrons or checked 
out by them? No laws that I know of.


In short, some publishers charge some customers more, and others less. 
In this sense, an Intel or a Carnegie Public Library "has to" pay 
higher rates to these particular publishers, but this is certainly not 
germane to issues of legality of libraries.
