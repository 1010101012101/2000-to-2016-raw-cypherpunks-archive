While I agree with you in principal, it would not be an easy thing to do
under the [constituional] circumstances.  The problem is that the law is well
settled that a president may invoke these powers during times of _declared_
war.  Although congress declined a formal declaration, they did provide a
defacto one with their support and authorization of military force ditty.  It
is unlikely that *any* supreme court, much less the sitting one, would deny
Shrub the argument that the country is in a state of war, and therefore has
the requisite autority as the sitting CIC.

The more plausible avenue for legal attack on these two rodents would lie in
the 1200 or so persons detained without even the most basic of constitutional
protections, as well as the current "decision" to monitor [formerly]
privileged [attorney-client] communications.  Also look for legal fodder in
upcoming "anti-terror" legislation aimed at citizens, rather than at foreign
residents.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
