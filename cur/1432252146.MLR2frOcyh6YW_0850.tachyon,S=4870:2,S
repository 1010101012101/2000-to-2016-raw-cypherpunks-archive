Crime Subcommittee Hearing and Markup Wednesday on Terrorism-Related Bills

What:           Legislative hearing on: H.R. 3275, the "Implementation 
Legislation for the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of 
the Financing of Terrorism," followed immediately by Markup of H.R. 3275 
and H.R. 3209, the "Anti-Hoax Terrorism Act of 2001."
Who:            Subcommittee on Crime - Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), Chairman
When:   10:00 a.m., Wednesday, November 14, 2001
Where: 2237 Rayburn Building
H.R. 3275 is legislation implementing two international treaties cracking 
down on terrorism that have been signed by the United States and are 
expected to be ratified by the Senate in the very near future.
The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings 
requires parties to the treaty to criminalize the act of terrorist bombing 
aimed at public or governmental facilities, or public transportation or 
infrastructure facilities and to either prosecute or extradite any person 
within their jurisdiction who engages in these bombings.  Violators would 
be subject to up to life in prison, and if death results from the 
violation, up to life in prison or the death penalty.
The International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism 
requires nations to criminalize the act of collecting or providing funds 
with the intention that they will be used to support acts of international 
terrorists.  The Convention imposes binding legal obligations upon nations 
either to prosecute or extradite any person within their jurisdiction who 
unlawfully and willfully provides or collects funds with the intention that 
they should be used to carry out various terrorist activities.  H.R. 3275 
subjects violators to up to twenty years in prison and fines of at least 
$10,000.
Witnesses: Mr. Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, U.S. Justice Department; others TBA.
H.R. 3209 would make it a felony for an individual who engages in a hoax 
with the intent to convey false or misleading information that there is or 
will be a chemical, biological, nuclear or weapon of mass destruction 
attack.  Violators would be subject to up to five years in prison and a 
fine of up to $250,000.
