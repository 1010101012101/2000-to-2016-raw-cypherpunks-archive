Yep, it's not something for kiddies, old ladies, or the weak of heart.
It's corrosiveness (not to mention build of O2 as 2H202 breaks down into
02 + 2H20) can be problematic. Consider the reaction of say regular
mechanic rags and diesel and some grades of grease under enhanced O2
conditions. It's the reason I stated a few weeks was the maximum 'hold
time'. After that metals, plastics, rubbers, etc. start to come apart.

Actually you can make H2O2 using electricity also. It's a natural 
byproduct of the ionization of saturated air by lightning. Lab setups
could be built using Tesla types of technology. You also get a lot of
ozone. I don't know if anyone has ever worked with liquid ozone as an
oxidizer (hmmm????).

I'd probably use a more conventional, perhaps surplus, airframe as the
booster.

Of course another alternative is Liquid Oxygen and Gasoline/Diesel.
