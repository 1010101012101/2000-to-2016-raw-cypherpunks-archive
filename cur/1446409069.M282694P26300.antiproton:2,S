My question here is regarding the covert exfil of the hack.

Check out somebody like darktrace: https://www.darktrace.com/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Behavior_Anomaly_Detection

That egress would be a monumental NOC IDS trigger, especially for an
anomaly detection system. Have to imagine the database is big.
Especially if you do anomaly detection on the SIEM collecting things
like DNS, flow, etc.

Probably a pivot into the Oracle database. The coupling between
PeopleSoft and the backend is weird.

The question is whether this is everybody because agencies sponsor
clearance and may or may not partition their own records on the backend.

Something doesn't make sense here. If they can catch the white house
non-classified penetration with low traffic and no exfil the OPM hack
seems like it should have been detected easily. Moreover, there are
automatic kill-chains in a lot of this infrastructure:

ified-emails-officials-say.html?_r=0

== end white house ==

rsecurity/tradecraft/cyber-kill-chain.html

	http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/deconstructing-the-cyber-ki
ll-chain/a/d-id/1317542

I have to imagine they have a switch with inline and span analytics
and IDS/IPS, anomaly detection, and logging from multiple telemetry
sources. Grabbing that data from that network and running remotely
seems like a hefty attack without compromising the actual reporting
devices. Which has been done:

	^^ virtual networking

It would be interesting to know how much is virtual networking out
there these days in the government.
