The Hazelwoods Welcome You to Caruba International Partnership!
Education ~ Privacy ~ Protection ~ Profit

VISIT: http://www.trydigital.com/adventure.html

OBJECTIVE: 
The objective of Caruba International is to teach people all over the world 
how to manage their assets, build wealth and secure a strong financial 
future. Not only does Caruba teach you how, it also gives you the tools. 
Each partner can determine their own level of wealth based on their 
motivation.

LOCATION: 
We are located on the island of Aruba, which is a small island nation in the 
Caribbean, 15 miles off the northern coast of Venezuela. Aruba is an 
extremely stable country, which received its independence from Holland in 
1986. Our main bank in Aruba is one of the top 6 in the world. This is not a 
U.S. based company operating offshore, Caruba International was formed 
exclusively in Aruba.

EDUCATION: 
I just returned from Caruba's first Tradewinds Educational Summit in 
Aruba. I am no longer convinced that Disneyland is the happiest place on 
earth. So many wonderful lighthearted people make Aruba a delightful 
place to visit. While there, I toured the desert like interior and several other 
natural and historic attractions. But the main reason I went was to 
investigate the Caruba business opportunity. I spoke with the founders, Ivan 
Shew-A-Tjon, the President, is native to Aruba, educated in the U.S. and 
has traveled worldwide for the financial and investment industry. His 
expertise and global contacts make him the perfect person to oversee 
Caruba's investment portfolio. And Damon Westmoreland, Executive Vice 
President, who resides in San Diego, CA and has owned and operated 
several successful networking companies, which made him a millionaire by 
the age of 25. He’s responsible for the compensation plan, website and 
marketing the Caruba Partnership. The conference was well rounded, 
giving me the confidence I needed to invest and also recommend this 
opportunity to you. The conference included how the company was 
founded, what the objectives are and how they intend to reach those 
objectives. The partner compensation plan was explained in more detail, 
currently we have a little over 3,000 active partners. We heard from an 
estate planning tax attorney who shared some better ways to transfer 
assets during your lifetime and at death to avoid taxes. There was a very 
interesting presentation on peak performance discussing how exercise 
and nutrition helps athletes and business people reach their maximum 
potential. This special program has been created through many years of 
scientific research with top athletes and business people.

PRIVACY: 
People talk about the invasion of privacy, but I think this is really a 
misnomer, especially in the U.S. How can you have an invasion of privacy 
when you don't have any privacy to begin with. They know what you eat, 
drink, drive and buy, where you go and where you sleep. Every financial 
transaction is recorded and scrutinized by your government. Creditors, 
lenders, vendors, neighbors can all gain access to your records, so how 
can you keep anything private? By going offshore to a place called Aruba 
and becoming an anonymous partner in Caruba International. Your account 
remains private, your wealth accumulates secretly, far from the prying eyes 
of others.

PROTECTION:
If you have watched 60 Minutes often, then you know what can happen to 
you. Property sized, frivolous lawsuits, garnishments, liens against your 
property by creditors and/or your government. Many times it can be totally 
unjustified, and you're ruined just trying to defend yourself. Even though my 
family has Toll Free access to the best law firms in North America for $25 
per month (See http://www.trydigital.com/legal.html for details), until now my 
assets were all invested in the good old U.S.A. I'm not saying you can't find 
good investments in your country and many have, but it's hard to protect 
those assets in the event someone makes a claim against them. It makes 
a lot of sense to me to move some money offshore for protection and to 
take advantage of the greater global opportunities you don't have access 
to from home. Especially when a vehicle has been created for middle 
income individuals to participate in. Until now, only the very wealthy have 
been able to protect and grow their assets offshore.

PROFIT:
Here in the U.S. and many other countries there are all kinds of regulations 
that cut into your earning potential compared to some other places on 
earth. Caruba Partners have two ways to make money privately.

1) The Partnership Investment Fund - As a partner you can invest any 
amount at any time into our privately managed global investment pool. 
Earnings from this pool are added to your private partner account monthly.

2) Referring New Partners - Caruba will pay you for bringing in new 
partners. This is the Network Marketing aspect of the partnership and is 
totally optional. See http://www.trydigital.com/wealth.html for more details 
on this option.

OUR INVITATION TO YOU:
Gloria and I want to extend our personal invitation to you to become a 
Caruba Partner. We are here to help you in any way we can. As a partner 
you can have your own High-Tech Flash Website to present the Caruba 
opportunity worldwide 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This website 
provides on-line sign-up for interested parties and will automatically credit 
your on-line account for each new partner. And since the compensation 
plan rewards you for the efforts of others you refer, you can build a large 
residual income for the future.

We want to wish you the most success possible!
