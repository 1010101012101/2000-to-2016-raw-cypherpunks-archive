I can resume this fragmentation issue by a simple sentence that I'm=20
saying more and more these days : "If you have a problem, do not write=20
an API, write a protocol".

The social federation protocol is already here : it's XMPP. And yes it=20
can support everything a social network has to offer (feeds,=20
subscriptions, profiles, contact list=E2=80=A6). There is already millions =
of=20
users on the XMPP network, and you can easily find several clients on=20
all the plateforms for it.

I'm working since 2008 on the Movim project (https://movim.eu/), to=20
build a full, good looking, "decentralized" (federated) and open source=20
social network on XMPP. And believe me, yes it's possible.

I like the link that the guy made in the presentation with Firefox. Why=20
Firefox surpassed IE ? Because they just choose to implement the W3C=20
standards and try to improve it (and they offer some nice features too).

Diaspora, GNU Social, Friendica are not trying to do that, they create=20
their own "proprietary" protocol to talk between each other and after=20
that face the same issues than all the others network : "Hey, we are=20
not compatibles ! Lets create an API and the other networks will be=20
compatible with us".

So keep calm and implement XMPP ;)
