Another explanation: Could they be following a usual flight corridor
to deflect suspicion? I have no idea if this is the case, but it would
make sense to have such corridors above water, if only not to annoy
residents overmuch. That's what National does, more or less.

Agreed, if they were flying small one or two engine planes. Not sure
if that translates as well to a large, modern jet aircraft.

Maybe I'm being a little suspicious, but why in the world would a
terrorist who doesn't want to be caught and doesn't need the videotape
(can't watch it on the plane, realistically, I presume) any more take
it on the plane with him?
