That is quoting the biometric industry's policy position. When I ask that
question, most people usually turn to the question of 'what is personal
information,'or call it a "trick question." The comments are often
illuminating, in light of the fact this is the biometric industry's policy
statement. If I was to merely ask: "do you agree with the biometric industry
that...." I would not come by the insight I was after, or the analysis. It
"loads the question." So, I posed the question from an oblique.
