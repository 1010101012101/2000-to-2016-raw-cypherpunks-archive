Earlier I mentioned that I was having difficulty building the current 
Mixmaster on FreeBSD - I'm confident that I've identified the problem.

Specifically, the OpenSSL that's integrated into FreeBSD doesn't include 
IDEA, by default, because of patent concerns. To remedy that, one needs to 
change the line in /etc/defaults/make.conf so that it reads "MAKE_IDEA=YES".

Then - this is the part I missed before - it's necessary to recompile the 
system libraries, so that they're rebuilt with IDEA support included. It 
sounds simple in retrospect . . . go to /usr/src and run "make buildworld; 
make installworld", which may take 12 hours or so on a slow PC. There's got 
to be a better way to just rebuild the crypto parts, but I didn't stumble 
across it yet.

After those steps are completed, the Mixmaster stuff builds and runs 
happily. Mixmaster 2.9beta23 is available at 
<ftp://ftp.shinn.net/pub/remailer/mixmaster> or 
<ftp://mixmaster.anonymizer.com>.

I suspect that the OpenBSD fix will be similar, but it may take some time 
to track it all down.
