Bob,

Here's another of your alley cats....

>    *Title:* POTSHARDS: Secure Long-Term Archival Storage Without
>    Encryption

>    Modern archival storage systems either store data in the clear,
>    ignoring security, or rely on keyed encryption to ensure privacy.
>    However, the
>    use of encryption is a major concern when data must be stored an
>    indefinite period of time - key management becomes increasingly
>    difficult as file lifetimes increase, and data loss becomes
>    increasingly likely because keys are a single point of failure and
>    losing a key is
>    comparable to data deletion. Moreover, traditional systems are
>    subject to the obsolescence of encryption algorithms themselves,
>    which can
>    expose petabytes of data the instant a cryptographic algorithm is
>    broken.
>
>    To address these concerns, we developed POTSHARDS, an archival
>    storage system that addresses the long-term security needs of data
>    with very
>    long lifetimes without the use of encryption. POTSHARDS separates
>    security and redundancy by utilizing two levels of secret splitting
>    in a
>    way that allows the original data to be reconstructed from the
>    stored pieces. However, the data structures used in POTSHARDS are also
>    designed in such a way that an unauthorized user attempting to
>    collect sufficient shares to reconstruct any data will not go
>    unnoticed. An
>    evaluation of our POTSHARDS implementation shows that it stores and
>    retrieves data at 2.5-5 MB/s, demonstrates its ability to recover user
>    data given all of the pieces a user has stored across the archives,
>    and shows its ability to recover from the loss of an entire archive.
