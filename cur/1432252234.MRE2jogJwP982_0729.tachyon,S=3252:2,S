You're of course aware that even shallow textual analysis of list archives
allows good fingerprinting of even casual posters. Even if we all would
post anonymously you could still build reliable clusters. It is impossible
to scramble that signature as long as your posts are nontrivial in length
by pretending to be somebody else.

I'm not aware of a fully automated tool to reliably scramble that
fingerprint. (Pointers welcome). Doing it semimanually is prohibitively
expensive in a forum such as this.
