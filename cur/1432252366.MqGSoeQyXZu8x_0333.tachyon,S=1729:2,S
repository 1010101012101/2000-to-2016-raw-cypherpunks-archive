Jim has written voluminously on his inventions, and reportedly
sent copies to a slew of parties at gov, com, edu and others.

The feds severely limited Jim's contact with outsiders so who
knows what got past the censors, in its original form, as
entrapment, or at all.

The stuff on greenhouse vaporware is one of a bunch of other
apps.

It would seem Jim is building a foundation for being a constructive
member of society, not Associated Press.

No benefit to speaking about cutting edge jailhouse encoding and
obfuscation, nor subdermal RFID.
