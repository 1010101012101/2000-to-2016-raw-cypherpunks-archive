I'd say it's primarily about entertainment. Even if it's an intentional
social/technical commentary. There is also the point to be made that
society is effected more by those things which were unexpected (I don't
know if 'revolution' is the correct word here???) than evolutionary. The
change of electricity, the printing press, etc.

But 'self-referential' is by no means equivalent to 'absolute'. As to your
last statement, I see we agree. The concept of 'good and bad' and any
consequent 'definitions' are a function of 'people'. It IS a relative
issue and therefore open to debate. This is a clear indicator that this
particular issue is not axiomatic. It is clearly an affect, no more.

I've always considered 'communitarian' to be a branch of (wait for it),

socialism. It requires consistency of behaviour, down to the level of
trying to micro-manage individuals individual thoughts. Trying to reach
that utopian ESS of the human soul I suppose.

In defence of my criticism of ESS's applied to biology I offer (being a
dutiful Gaian Pantheist),

The cosmos is certainly neutral. But since 'technology' exists only within
the context of a human society (ie humans build technology) trying to cast
that as 'neutral' (eg government funding & corporate research) is either
naive enthusiasm for reductionism or else intentional misdirection. I've
alwasy rankled at the concept that 'technical' and 'social' are not sides
of the same n-sided die called human psychology. Reductionism has its
place, it is not however, everyplace.

<shrug> A lot of good questions I have no intention of answering :). Make

There is a certain level of paranoia (recognition of a real threat
certainly qualifies as paranoia in my book) required to even conjure up
the concept of security and crypto as an instance...

Actually I susepect that society will advance to impliment crypto in the
background. It will be used to enforce the bounds of each indviduals
social boundaries. Yes, it does embody 'web-of-trust' but not as the only
or primary mechanism for society as a whole.

This again, is the reason I believe that the Open Source movement within
the context of Lessig's book has an opportunity to build a much more
humane and reasonable society. I also believe the odds are very low it
will come to pass. Human sollipsism.

It'll work. But there are other factors which will be concommitent.
Consider the extension of the average human lifespan on insurance,
investment, business, etc. There are other factors at work which will
impact the society and the economy in a equally strong (potentialy much
stronger perhaps) but 'negative' way, and I don't mean bad, I mean in
opposite sign to way. These technologies are going to cause a period of
inflation, and that will cause various social and political changes, that
will be like nothing we've ever seen. This should limit the 'theoretical'
maximum change of technology over some reference (and arbitrary) period.
Once a new equilibrium is reached then there should be a rapid expansion
until the next 'big thing'. In our case the chance is there that we might
get to see it first person. It'd be like being alive when Guttenberg first
printed his book and surviving until today. What will be the effect on
'family' when 20 generations are alive and communicating at one time?
(coincidentally, there's a web-of-trust).

I'm trying to get a Plan 9 network up and running to do just that now for 
Plan 9 users here in Austin. Offer a 'virtual community' workspace that
users can map into their personal namespace (ooh, another web-of-trust ;).

In support I offer,

If you're interested in using a OS that embodies a lot of the basic
requirements for distributed communities, distributed processing,
distributed file spaces, low level network encryption, distributed
anonymous remailers, distributed data havens, communal workspaces, 
etc. then check out Plan 9.

I also have a mailing list that is available,

I believe the point would be that society would progress beyond the need
for such things. What this will engender will be a return to 'family' or
'zaibatsu' centered human societies. Economies based on competition won't
exist because each community will share the resources as required. It will
be a large barter commune. The interfaces between these 'arcologies' will
be very well defended and about the only place 'trade' will take place and
that will be through information exchange not the actual exchange of
goods. Why? Because each arcology will be self-suffient within the domain
of its ownings.

Remember you've got 20 generations alive at the same time. 'Family' is set
to return with a vengeance.

My guess is we've got a space of about 200 years to get off this mudball
and get out there. If we don't we'll drown in our own waste. The end
result will be that humans won't live on planets per se. And that's got
maybe 500 to a 1000 years to happen or else the proto-society will run out
of gas. The only real hope/good there is that pockets of humans will be
scattered about. That raises the odds of the phoenix arising.

But you're talking about developing a society, not a group of friends that
numbers in a few hundred...

I don't buy it.
