Y'all don't get it do you?  Tim's not a racist -- racists like 
race riots because they're about race, and they take sides.

As far as I can tell, what Tim is is an antisocial crank.  
Antisocial cranks like race riots because they're riots, and 
they really don't give a crap who wins, or whether there's a 
winner.  

I'm reasonably sure that a three-way shooting war between sports 
car enthusiasts, denture wearers, and shoe salesmen would make Tim 
just as happy as a race riot.  Almost anything that carries fear 
and confusion to the sheeple would get Tim's approval, I think.  

So don't bag on him for being a racist - that's a much too 
restrictive and imprecise term for what looks like a far more 
general philosophy.  

Insert absolutely straight faces where appropriate; decide 
for yourselves whether I'm joking or not.  While you're at 
it, try to figure out whether the bald-faced truth can ever 
also *be* a good-natured joke.
