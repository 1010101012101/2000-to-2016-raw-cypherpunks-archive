OK, granted, the government needs to be kept on a tight leash.  Most
people will not want the government breaking into their homes.
However, I think most people would be willing to vote for a bill that
would guarantee insurance for people with genetic abnormalities, even
if that does mean that some CEOs and stockholders will have less money
in their already-full pockets.  And if some insurance companies do
just pass the extra cost into higher premiums, some other insurance
company will keep premiums the same, and they will consequently get
more business.  Again, it is a tradeoff between helping provide
medical care for people who would not otherwise be able to afford it,
and allowing for insurance company stockholders to continue to make
huge profits.  Call me a bleeding-heart, but I vote for the medical care.

How does that logically follow?

We could easily provide healthcare for every American citizen.  Just
raise taxes a bit, and cut out most of our military spending.

I don't understand that statement.
