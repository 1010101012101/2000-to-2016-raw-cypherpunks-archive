ZKS did it and raised, we hear, something like $60 million. Quite a 
warchest for untraceability tools. ZKS has been much-discussed here.

How long before Mojo faces lawsuits analogous to what Napster faced?

Very unlikely unless it raises to challenge the current crop of Napster replacements.

instead release products untraceably...perhaps benefitting in other 
ways.)

Actually, I was referring to Steve Schear.  He worked at Citicorp for some time and attracted a number of former mid and senior VISA people, one help found Sonnet Financial an online foreign exchange service, to work for First eCache.

>I'm more impressed with what another person is actually doing: Orlin 
Grabbe. Do some Web searches. Orlin has good banking credentials himself 
(Wharton, coined the term "regulatory arbitrage"), good libertarian 
credentials (a powerful newsletter for many years), some technical 
abilities (writes code), has been willing to move to places like Costa 
Rica, and, most importantly, he UNDERSTANDS the "sweet spot" argument.

Steve has also argued these points.

The real bankers and the regulators won't allow such things into the 
official banking system. (Why do people think the banking system will 
embrace "digital bearer bonds" having untraceability features when true 
bearer bonds were eliminated years ago?)

I believe First eCache intended to be compliant with know your customer regs, depending upon independent market makers and money changers to provide the necessary indirection for unlinkability.  If so it would difficult for the banking system to easily exclude them.  In the same down.way the regulators have had a very difficult time bringing the Black Market Peso Exchange down.
