What about the possibility of doing encrypted telephony stuff in Java?
As many have pointed out, sound programming is highly non-portable
among Unices and Windows.  However, Java has standard ways of doing
that, so maybe it is an option.  I know that Java isn't fast, but
hardware is getting faster every day.  Also, the heavy-lifting stuff
(the compression and encryption) could all be written in C, which
would be completely portable, and linked in using JNI, right?  Java
also has all the powerful network libs already built in.  If there
were an app like SpeakFreely in Java, it would run on a lot of
different systems.
