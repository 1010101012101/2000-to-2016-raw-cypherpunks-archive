Yeah.  What we have to do for that is start thinking about ways
to apply Kerberos and similar technologies to real-world problems
besides the inside-an-organization ones they were originally designed for.

OTPs won't help a bit for that problem.
They're fine for transmitting new data if you've already sent a pad,
but they're useless for storing secrets, because you can only decrypt
something if you've got the pad around, and you have to burn the pad after 
use.
Storing the encrypted secret message on your regular computers
while keeping the pad locked up in the safe is unlikely to be
any more convenient than keeping the plaintext locked up in the safe.
I suppose you could secret-share a one-time-pad,
but you could just as easily secret-share the secret message.
