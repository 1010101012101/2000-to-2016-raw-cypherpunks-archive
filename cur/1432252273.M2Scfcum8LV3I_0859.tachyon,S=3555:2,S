Uh...I assume you're quoting somebody here?

The last point is actually a very good one, but getting there requires 
hacking through gobbledeegook. What's this "all businessmen" silliness? And 
using vpns WITHIN a company? As an employee of a major Wall Street firm, I 
can tell you that's completely wrong.

But the interesting thing, which again is "obvious" is, "How will P2P 
Networks morph into something like blacknet?"

I'm very interested in hearing about whether any P2P networks support 
encrypted transactions of any sort yet (ie, can one yet pay for some files 
via P2P)? Are there any P2P Networks being designed deliberately to support 
anything/everything, including peered IP Telephony?
