To me, it seems quite consistent with the way the DMCA is crafted and
currently applied. If you look at who's likely to present the most trouble
with circumvention, it's all the individual coders out there, mostly open
source people and recreational hackers, putting together decryption programs
for fun/compatibility/fame. If you want to "send a clear signal" to these
people, you bust one of their kind, not the head of the corporation.

This would be another reasonable guess, of course. Who knows?
