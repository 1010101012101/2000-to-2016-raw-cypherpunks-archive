It seems the 'terrorists' have moved from symbolic activities to actual
damage, though it'll take more than 4 cuts (as of last count) to start having
an impact on western economies.

On the other hand, if and when they can provide material evidence of their
ability to take out practically any set of cables at any time, they may get a
fairly significant reaction from financial markets. Of course, there will be
be a strong desire to paint this episode as a series of coincidences, but I
think the cat may be rapidly emerging from the bag.
