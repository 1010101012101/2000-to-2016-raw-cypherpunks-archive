Not necessarily... he doesn't indicate being detained (per RS) and subsequently
asked, so he has no obligation (in US) to respond in confirmation. And
unbelievably,
he keeps on talking. He even lets them engineer themselves into becoming his
'friends' and talking yet more... "A notable thing that kept coming up was an
incredulity...". The blog is probably not the full recount and this
guy should review
situation with a lawyer. Always good to discern who's knocking and why though.
And there's always a careful and amiable balance to be made, but
still, trolls at
your door be trolling...

With so many bitcoin ventures, players and events... probably much
longer than can be fit within time limits.
