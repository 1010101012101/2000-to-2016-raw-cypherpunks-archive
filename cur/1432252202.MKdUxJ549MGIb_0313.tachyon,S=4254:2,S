Perhaps Google is blocking you, as I was able to find more recent 
pages, including:

http://www.obscura.com/~loki/remailer/mixmaster-faq.html

http://anon.efga.org/~rlist/

http://www.skuz.net/potatoware/reli/OperMan.htm

(This last one is a detailed page on setting up a client.)

I agree that there seem to be fewer, proportionately, articles than 
in the heyday of remailers, circa 1994-5. Why there are not more "How 
to Set Up a Remailer" current FAQs and pages is unclear.

Making remailers easy to set up, especially in this era of Linux and 
DSL/cable modems, would seem to be a big win.

As Declan said, find the Remailer Operators list.
