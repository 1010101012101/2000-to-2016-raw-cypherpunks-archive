It seems that there is a solution Out There already, in the form of EncFS. 
See http://arg0.net/users/vgough/encfs.html

Mount the GmailFS as eg. /mnt/gmail, and then mount encfs to eg. 
/mnt/gmailsec with /mnt/gmail as its root.

Voila, problem solved! (At least theoretically. I didn't test it.)

What are your thoughts on EncFS, please?

Related note: Is there a way to encrypt a removable medium, eg. a CD or 
DVD disk, in a way that makes it readable under all major OSs (with the 
required add-ons installed), namely Linux, BSD, and Windows 98/2000/XP? 
The appeal (and a certain disadvantage) of EncFS is its file-oriented 
approach, making it easy to have a portable userspace decoding utility, 
for data access anywhere if you got the password.
