You are incorrect. As I said, I read the article. It was reposted from
another site and it is anything but clear when it was filed. The New York
Times has a timestamp and datestamp; the reposted one did not. 

Perhaps I'm missing something obvious here, but I'm not interested in
defending this fellow further. My only points, which I trust has been
made emphatically enough at this point, are: Don't attribute to malice
what can be explained by honest mistakes; and journalists rarely have
the full story at the best of times.
