200 MHz ought to be plenty for a typical home connection.
The FreeSWAN folks found that a 150 MHz Pentium Doorstop was
enough to keep a T1 line busy with 3DES - presumably AES is much faster.
So either one should be good enough for most US DSL or cable modem
connections, and they'll at least handle an 802.11b 2 MHz channel
(yeah, the stuff says 10 Mbps, but you either need 802.11g or .11a or
really good tuning to actually get that), and they'll probably go faster.
