There are times when I wish I had enough money to hire the lawyers it
would take to initiate a false advertising suit against the United States
for billing itself as a "Free country". 

For a country that bills itself as a champion of Freedom and Liberty(tm)
throughout the world, they sure seem to enact alot of laws treating
freedom as something that should be stamped out wherever it is found.

Kind of like Government laws on privacy.  Privacy from everyone but the
Government.
