Well, best of luck to them. any scheme where they *have* to give you the 
decryption key before you can use the product is doomed from the start, 
its just a matter of how long it takes. The satellite/cable companies 
are fighting hard to stay ahead of the game with their live-to-view 
product - by frequently changing the crypto whenever it is broken; no 
recorded product can possibly hold out more than a few months after launch.
