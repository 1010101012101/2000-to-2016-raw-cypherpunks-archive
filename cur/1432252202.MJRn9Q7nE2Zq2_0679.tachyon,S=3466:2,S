Actual cases of what? Remialers win very few cases. Ask the remailer operators 
how many complaints they handle per day and how much money and time comes
out of their pocket with little hope of recovery.

You can't 'claim' commen carrier, that must be earned by going through a
long difficult process of vetting through the government. Besides, commen
carrier status brings with it lots of other aspects such as covert
regulation by your 'public utility commission' or whatever they call it
that reduce your freedom.

You should talk to a real lawyer about the various aspects of remailer
operation. I did several years ago when the Austin Cypherpunks was running
kourier.ssz.com. It was clear that to do it right was going to be very
expensive.

It isn't a technical issue that makes remailers hard, it's the people side
of thing.

You really should have a lawyer look this over, especialy your ISP
contract.
