[Note that the Harvard Club is now "business casual". No more jackets
and ties -- while it lasts, anyway :-)... --RAH]


          The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                         Presents
                       Steven Levy,
                          Author,
             Senior Editor, _Newsweek_ Magazine


                "How the Crypto Rebels Won"

                 Tuesday, March 6th, 2000
                         12 - 2 PM
              The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                One Federal Street, Boston, MA



How a group of outsiders envisioned a need for wide-spread
cryptography and then took on two daunting missions: providing
unprecedented tools to make this happen, and fighting the government
for the right to distribute the tools.


Steven Levy is a senior editor at Newsweek and author of CRYPTO: HOW
THE CODE REBELS BEAT THE GOVERNMENT, SAVING PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL
AGE. He is also author of four other books including HACKERS,
ARTIFICIAL LIFE, INSANELY GREAT, and THE UNICORN'S SECRET, and have
contributed to many other publications.



This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held
on Tuesday, March 6th, 2000, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch
of the Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for
lunch is $35.00. This price includes lunch, room rental, A/V hardware
if necessary, and the speakers' lunch. The Harvard Club has relaxed
its dress code, which is now "business casual", meaning no sneakers
or jeans. Fair warning: since we purchase these luncheons in advance,
we will be unable to refund the price of your meal if the Club finds
you in violation of what's left of its dress code.


We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we
*really* know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of
Boston", by Saturday, March 3rd, or you won't be on the list for
lunch. Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston
will have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The
Harvard Club of Boston", in the amount of $35.00. Please include your
e-mail address so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements
(we've had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for
instance), please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can
work something out.


Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

April 3  Scott Moskowitz  Watermarking and Bluespike


As you can see, :-), we are actively searching for future speakers.
If you are in Boston on the first Tuesday of the month, are a
principal in digital commerce, and would like to make a presentation
to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Committee,
care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com>.
