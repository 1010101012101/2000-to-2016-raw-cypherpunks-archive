I am simply reporting what any fool can see.  Where do we see mass 
starvation?  today we see it in North Korea, where the government has 
charge of food production and distribution, and a little earlier we saw it 
in Ethiopia where the same system applied.  All the big famines were 
created by governments.

Similarly, where do we see homelessness?  Most of it is in San Francisco, 
half jokingly known as the people's republic as San Francisco, because of 
its drastic governmental management of housing.
