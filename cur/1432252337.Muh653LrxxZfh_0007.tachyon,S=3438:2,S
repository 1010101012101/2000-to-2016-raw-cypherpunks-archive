Terrorists 'use child porn' to exchange information

Terrorists may be using child pornography websites to exchange data,
according to anti-terror experts.

It is thought Islamist extremists are concealing messages in digital images
and audio, video or other files.

Police are now investigating the link between terrorists and paedophilia in
an attempt to unravel the system.

It could lead to the training of child welfare experts to identify signs of
terrorist involvement as they monitor pornographic websites.

The move follows the discovery of sex abuse material during investigations
into a number of advanced suspected plots.

It is not clear yet whether the terrorists chose child pornography because of
a personal interest or merely because it represents a useful medium for
disseminating information.

Security officials have been puzzled at the use of such offensive material by
people claiming to be devoted to the teachings of Islam.

"It shows that these people are very confused. Here they are hating Western
decadence but actually making use of it and finding that they enjoy this
stuff," a source told the Times.

British police were first alerted to the link in 2006 when they investigated
the possible terror links of a former Mujahideen fighter who preached at a
London mosque. They discovered computerised images of child abuse.

Five years earlier an investigation of a mosque run by an al-Qaeda recruiter
in Milan found child pornography that police believe contained encoded
messages.

Baroness Neville-Jones, Conservative security spokesman and former chairman
of the Joint Intelligence Committee, said: "The information about a possible
link between extremism and child pornography potentially provides useful
insight into three things: the methods that extremists use to communicate;
the methods they use to target vulnerable people in society; and the
techniques they seek to use to conceal their online activities."

Andrew Dismore, Labour MP and chairman of the parliamentary Joint Committee
on Human Rights, said: "This is an important development. We have to do more
than just the police work. It needs child protection, criminological and
psychological work.

"It could become a very important weapon in the fight against terrorism."
