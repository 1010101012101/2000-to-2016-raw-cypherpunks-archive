Exactly, although this rule doesn’t just apply to “small companies”.   Big companies have shown to just roll over and give up the customer’s data.

So asking the question is stupid(*), because a lie is indistinguishable from the truth.

No, the NSA hasn’t approached us about pfSense, or adding a “back door”, or anything similar.  Nor has anyone else.

The next step is yours.


I am told that the NSA did review a version of pfSense that was made for a customer which would filter SCADA protocols.  I can’t verify that or not.

Note also that someone DID once accuse OpenBSD of having a problem with it’s IPSEC processing, which Theo *vehemently* denied.

Sam Leffler, about four years earlier, found a bug in the AH processing, which he fixed (in FreeBSD) and handed back to the OpenBSD.  They patched same, but never gave any acknowledgement to Sam.

So, maybe you should run OpenBSD.
