Then kill yourself and be done with it.  If the "idiots" get quoted
by the "important" people, some number of the quoted texts may be
of insignificant value, but if they all were, none of the "idiots"
would be quoted because all the "important" people would be filtering
the "idiots" also.  Gee, that isn't even pretzel logic.  Not very,
anyway.
