My fellow Cypherpunks, The following is interesting.


http://www.albany.net/~rwcecot/iraap/Quinn/phoenix1.htm

find string: Connie Chung


A good example of the tremendous degree to which the major news media 
organizations are called to heel is seen in the facts surrounding the two 
year hiatus in the professional career of CBS broadcaster Connie Chung, who 
had the misfortune to have ended up being paired with Dan Rather several 
years ago.

On a live call-in TV talk show some two years ago, Ms. Chung responded with 
a bit too much candor to a question as to what actually gets reported 
publicly by the major news media, given the great number of stories and 
items which come from the numerous sources of "raw" information. How are the 
stories which get the attention of the media chosen and by whom?

Connie Chung replied to the effect that it wasn't too hard to decide what 
stories get aired--they just checked with Washington D.C. to see what had 
been cleared for publication by the government.

As a result of her being foolish enough to tell the truth in what was likely 
just a naive, probably unintentional and inadvertent slip, within no more 
than a few hours Ms. Chung was out of a job and remained blacklisted in the 
industry for a good two years, only resurfacing in 1998 with a position at 
ABC--sufficiently chastened, some no doubt believe, to allow her to grace 
the public airwaves once again.

Yours Truly,
Gary Jeffers

BEAT STATE!!!
