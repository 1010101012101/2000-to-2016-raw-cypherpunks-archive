A typical microwave oven is a 1-kilowatt source of 2.45 GHz radio signals, =
generated by a device called a "magnetron tube", which is itself fed from a=
 source of about 4000 volts and 0.3 amps, stepped up by a transformer from =
the AC supply. =C2=A0Usually, the =C2=A0power is fed into a box with metal =
walls, which is easy, but has a front door which is easily closeable yet ha=
s excellent shielding ability when closed. =C2=A0Such microwave ovens are c=
arefully designed so that they will not generate microwaves when the door i=
s open: =C2=A0To do so would expose the user to microwaves far above the sa=
fe level. =C2=A0Now, if your intent is to do damage, you could bypass the s=
afety features of the door, and partly disassemble the oven so as to feed t=
he as-generated microwaves into a waveguide (sometimes it's a hollow rectan=
gular tube) which proceeds to the antenna, which is often at the focus of a=
 parabolic dish. =C2=A0Generally, the rule is the larger the dish, the more=
 focussed the microwaves will be. =C2=A0An 8-foot diameter dish would be ex=
cellent, perhaps giving 30 db of gain over an isotropic. =C2=A0There are fo=
rmulae for calculating gain vs. dish size vs. wavelength easily found on th=
e web. =C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna=C2=A0 =C2=A0or=
 the Radio Amateur's Handbook.
However, for REAL damage, it would be useful to pulse the kilovolts into th=
e magnetron: =C2=A0Generally if you increase the voltage by 10, the power i=
ncreases by 100. =C2=A0Feed that microwave magnetron with brief (microsecon=
ds) pulses of 40,000 volts, rather than 4000, and it will probably generate=
 close to 100 kilowatts. =C2=A0It would be necessary to establish that such=
 a system will not arc with over-voltage, either within the waveguide or th=
e associated high-voltage wiring. =C2=A0Much of the electronics within a bu=
ilding would be fried if such a beam is pointed at it.
