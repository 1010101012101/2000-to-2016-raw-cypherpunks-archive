Since MP3 and JPG are lossy compression you don't want to use them in
any case - you really screw up the image if you attach random data
to the compressed values, and you lose the data completely if you
try to compress the stegonagraphic info.  So it's not useful for more
basic reasons.

It doesn't have to be random, it has to be complete.  Random is definitly
better, but it's unlikely that steganography would be needed if one could
send random data for any reason to begin with.  You want the message to be
invisible, and anyone looking for hidden messages is certain to scan
"random" data and check it for statistics.  The power of statistics makes
steganography really hard.
