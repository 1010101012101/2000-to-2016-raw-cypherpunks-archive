"...Sure, AP requires anonymous digital cash, ..." 'nomen nescio'

Luckily operation soft drill doesnt.

"AP is part of the dark side of the cypherpunk dream and it must be faced 
rather than evaded"

OSD,the 'open source' AP is the light,bright shining star of the cypherpunk 
dream,think about it.

." The people involved with the digital cash would be targets "

Yes,by tax collectors who would then be nominated for OSD.If they come in 
tanks,we target any federal employee,an advance on AP imho.

"With crypto anarchy you have to take the bad with the good. "

Agreed,we have to listen to you,measl,honig,james and tim crap 
on.(sometimes tims good though)

"John Young's dissembling "

If jya were japanese he'd be a living national treasure.He also is pioneer 
of info compression on a truly mindbending scale.A cypherpunk giant,show 
some respect.
