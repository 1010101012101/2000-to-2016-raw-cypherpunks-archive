Hand-waving. Get some numbers and crunch them. (No, I don't have them at
hand, either, but I'm not making claims about the ability of any
corporation to profit under any arbitrary rules I wish to set.)

This is the only thing you've written with which I agree. But it's an
argument for _less_ government intervention rather than more.

Eh? I've been uninsured for maybe half of my adult life. On such
occasions as I need medical care, I simply pay for it. Cash or check,
they'll take it all.

Of course you said "coverage", not "care", but the alleged problem is
that people can't get medical _care_. Who cares if they have _coverage_,
so long as their medical needs are taken care of?

As I wrote before (like, a couple of hours ago), most of the people who
insist on a right to "affordable" medical insurance seem to expect to
get a lot more out of the insurance company than they put into it. They
should just be honest and go on welfare if they're looking for a
handout, rather than attempt to claim the moral high ground.
