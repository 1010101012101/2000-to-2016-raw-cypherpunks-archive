OK, so we have some video. If that video was taken from within an app on =
a mobile device, it may be somewhat tamper resistant.

Some external cameras have GPS, but certainly not all, and any meta-data =
could be changed before importing.

In terms of location, we have device GPS, cell tower location, nearby =
WiFi based location, IP address, Internet network topology and timing. =
Any of those could be spoofed with some effort. Signing content with =
location information before uploading might bring reputation into the =
equation, and give some more trust in the information.

I assume your binning concept (100,000 or 2^32) is to give "I was there" =
without saying "here is exactly how to find and kill me". Is that =
correct? We might achieve the same by simply rounding Lat Long at some =
level of granularity.

We could lock down the time of publication to the system using hash =
chain type structures. The hash, location, time, and document could all =
be signed by the hashing server. This could be distributed and =
redundant.

Just some quick thoughts.=20
