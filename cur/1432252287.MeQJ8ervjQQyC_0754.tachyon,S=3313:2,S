Cpunks, what are your ideas on this:

.  What would be an acceptable way for the U.S. government to handle the
current problem of terrorists in the U.S. in order to "catch" the ones
already here and to prevent future attacks (acknowledged, they will do what
they are prepared to do, given their mind-set)?

	- undesireable:  national ID cards, home & computer intrusions,
wiretapping, increased surveillance as in England



.  What would be a practical way for those in the U.S. to handle there now
being trained terrorists in the midst, in consideration the fact that:

	- there could be other surprise attacks in the future

	- terrorist activities could escalate as a result of the bombing of
Afhanistan, that this could set off the other "cells" and gain supporters,
especially if Bin Laden were killed

	   (already noted:  stay away from "soft-targets", stock up on basics
(though not a terrorist deterrent), get a gun and/or other defense means, be
alert)

	- at this time, those not resembling Arabs won't have as much of a problem
of arousing suspicion and investigation, but as "civil liberties" are being
adversely affected, everyone must consider how they will deal with these
developments - how they will fight them or live with them in the interim
