Those same bureaucrats previously ruled (through the IRS tax code) that 
employees would be taxed at their normal tax rates on the putative 
market value of any "air miles" their employers allowed them to keep.

Seem the various equal protection laws would forbid any special tax 
benefits for "military and federal" employees.

However, since we are now an adhocracy, nothing more will be heard of 
this argument, least of all in the courts.
