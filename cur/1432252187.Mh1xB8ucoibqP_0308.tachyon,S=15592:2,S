About the CBCF:
www.cbcfonline.org <http://www.cbcfonline.org> 


It is the mission of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF) to
engage in nonpolitical, nonpartison research and policy analysis on
issues of concern to African Americans and the underserved population.
To that end the CBCF has worked to broaden and elevate the influence of
African Americans in the political, legislative and public policy
arenas. The Annual Conference brings together people of diverse
perspectives and backgrounds to explore and formulate solutions to
critical domestic and foreign policy issues confronting the Black
community. The Diversity Job Fair is an "Official" part of the
Conference and is featured on the floor of the CBCF Annual Conference. 

Attendees: 

The CBCF 2002 Annual Legislative Conference is attended by affluent and
politically involved African Americans from throughout the USA. The
Conference provides a national forum for developing strategies and
viable solutions for the public policies facing Black America. Everyone
from college students to Corporate CEO's all interact to explore both an
influence and an understanding of the legislative process. Over 30,000
are expected to attend the 2002 Conference.
