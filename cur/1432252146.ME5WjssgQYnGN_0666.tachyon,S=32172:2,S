cypherpunks

I visited my former phd student sobolewski for advice this afternoon.

http://www.mhpcc.edu/general/john.html

On leaving his home - with three of his issues of the Minerological
Record - Sobolewki said

Did you know that Lewis [another of my phd students
http://www.friction-free-economy.com/]  is no longer with Daimler-Benz?

He is now a vp with Kodak.

But that won't help Kodak.

Then I asked Sobolewski, "How do I get into these messes?"

Sobolewki responded, "Don't ask that.  Ask how do you get out of them!"

We are, of course, living on the wild side.
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/8327/load1.html

Please read about geronimo and victorio.

And pass the link along.

Morales and I did it.  We filed on Friday afernoon.  I attach and will
post.

None of us could have done this alone.

Keep up-wind

wages without due process.   Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M. 
  
	ARTICLE 11   
  
            Magistrate Court; Replevin   
  
	Sec.  
	35-11-1. Replevin; grounds.  
	35-11-2. Replevin; special provisions.   
	35-11-3. Judgment.   
  
	35-11-1. Replevin; grounds.   
  
	Whenever any personal property is wrongfully taken or detained, the person  
	having a right to  immediate possession may bring a civil action of replevin for  
	recovery of the property and for damages sustained from the wrongful taking or  
	detention. However, in replevin actions,  magistrate courts shall not issue any writs  
	of replevin or any other orders providing for a seizure of property before  
	judgment.  
 
  
19 	Citizens Robert J Gorence harassed William Payne by Sending FBI agents to 

Payne's  home to deliver threatening letter in Exhibit A. 
 
Don F Svet, John J Kelly, and  Manuel Lucero harassed Arthur Morales by attempting to  
 
garnish $1,793.56 from Morales wages when there was no legal cause of action for such  
 
writ.  Exhibit J. 
 
	ARTICLE 3A  
                
            Harassment and Stalking   
  
	 30-3A-2. Harassment; penalties.   
  
	 A.  Harassment consists of knowingly pursuing a pattern of conduct that is  
	intended to annoy,  seriously alarm or terrorize another person and which serves  
	no lawful purpose. The conduct  must be such that it would cause a reasonable  
	person to suffer substantial emotional distress.   
  
	 B.   Whoever commits harassment is guilty of a misdemeanor.  
  
WHEREFORE   
  
20	Morales and Payne ask for their $625 taken from them without due process.  
  
21	Morales and Payne ask for the $1,793.56 since this can be taken from Morales  
 
wages or file an property lien at any time.  
  
22	Payne asks for punitive damages $300,000 from Gorence for harassment for  
 
illegally sending FBI agents to  family residence to deliver harassment letter.  
  
23	Illegal garnishment of Morales' salary jeopardized Morales' security clearance and  
 
employment at Sandia National Laboratories. 
 
Morales and Payne ask for punitive damages from citizens John  J Kelly  $300,000, Don F  
 
Svet $300,000, Manuel  Lucero $100,000, Jan Elizabeth Mitchell $100,000 , and so that 

citizens and federal  employees  are sent a message to obey the laws they are tasked to 

upheld rather than abuse.  
 
24	No one in the United States of America must be permitted to be above the law. 

Forward complaint to New Mexico Attorney General with recommendation for  
 
prosecution of citizens Robert J  Gorence, John J Kelly, Manuel Lucero, Jan Elizabeth  
 
Mitchell, and Don F Svet for violation of New  Mexico state laws.  
  
25	Grant other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.   
 
  
  


I certify that I mailed a copy of this pleading to all defendants by certified - return receipt 
requested mail.

Further,   =20

	The Privacy Act provides a civil remedy whenever an agency denies access=

	EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES  =20
  =20
  	I. Generally  =20
  =20
	In recent years the trend has become for employers not to give detailed =
or even   =20

ay   =20
	either give no employment reference information or merely confirm that t=
he   =20
	(former) employee worked for the employer during  specified dates and at=
 a certain   =20
	rank or position. The rationale for the unwillingness to provide more co=
mplete or   =20
	specific information is that employers must minimize their risk of  expo=
sure to    =20
	workplace defamation liability.  =20
  =20
	Generally, an employer is liable to an employee for defamation if the em=
ployer   =20
	publishes a false statement about the employee that harms the employee's=
   =20
	reputation and that is not privileged.  =20
    =20
	Each element of a defamation action is examined briefly below.  =20
  =20
	First, employers cannot make false statements about an employee. Employe=
rs can   =20
	now be held liable for false statements only if they are responsible for=
 the falsity.   =20
	This means that the employer can be held liable for a false statements o=
nly if they   =20
	were negligent in attempting to ensure the truthfulness of the statement=
. In other   =20
	words, employers are not liable for a false statement if  they were not =
negligent in   =20

  =20
	7-1	Defamation Defined  =20
  =20
	The test for defamation is not merely a statement that hurts one's reput=
ation.   =20
	Defamation is the publication of a defamatory statement of  fact. When d=
efamation   =20
	occurs in written form it is called libel. When the defamation is an ora=
l   =20
	communication, it is called slander.  In order to prove that one has bee=
n defamed,   =20
	the New Mexico courts rely on proof of the  following facts:  =20
  =20
  	1. that there was a defamatory statement of fact concerning  another (=
i.e. a   =20
	statement, as opposed to an opinion, that tends to lower the employee in=
 the   =20
	esteem of the community or other respectable individuals);  =20
    =20
 	 2. the statement must be published; that is it must be spoken or  othe=
rwise   =20
	communicated to at least one person, usually a "third party," other than=
 the   =20
	complaining party;  =20
    =20
  	3. fault amounting at least to negligence (should have known it  was f=
alse) on part   =20
	of the publisher, or, if the employer is a public official, the statemen=
t must have   =20
	been made with the knowledge  that it was false or with reckless disrega=
rd for the   =20
	truth; and  =20
  =20
  	4. that the statement was the proximate cause of actual injury to the =
employee.  =20
  =20
	It is imperative that employers take action to stop all defamatory  acti=
ons by their   =20
	employees, even in the realm of horseplay, since there exists in New Mex=
ico both   =20
	criminal, and civil liability for such actions.  =20
