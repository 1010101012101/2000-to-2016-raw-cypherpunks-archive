And Heroin. Yes, British music in general has a different 'timbre' to it.

Yawn.

Anarchy in the UK!, if don't mind the puke in the pocket...

You should listen to Social D's last live album. There's a comment in
there about the Whiskey's parking lot and pussie piercings that's
hilarious. Describes my experience in S. Texas in Houston to a T.

So, you're the one who stole my Orgone Accumulator? You know they started
out as a front band for a sci-fi writer?

> which, how come you Americans still pay money to listen to that stuff ?

I don't listen to the old stuff as much as the new stuff, Mindless Self
Indulgence, DRI, CoC, Butthole Surfers (from here in Austin!), The
Exploited (speaking of England), The Union Underground (though this is
very industrial), or Mephisto Odyssey (ditto), Surf Punks, Sex Gang
Children, Fugazi, Newlydeads, Napalm Death, The Cramps, Bush Tetra's, or
GWAR for example. I also like Cirith Ungol but they're more head-banging.
Though I still do have all those albums and break 'em out at parties. I
find a lot of the under 25's have never heard this stuff (though they've
heard of it).

My fucking favorite punk band bar none is, Plastmatics. Wendy O. takes no 
prisoners (and clearly won't become one). May 'Rauls' rest in peace'.

Americans are pack-rat's.

As to The Boss and southern rock bands of any sort, I'll keep my peace. :)

Tres Hombres.
