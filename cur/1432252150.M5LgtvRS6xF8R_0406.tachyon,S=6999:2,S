Of course, I would do the same if so asked.  But there are lots of people on
the list who have not obtained information indirectly, with confidentiality
assurances offered, and for them remailers exist.

personally I'd like to know who is doing this and at what scale.

I do not think its what you'd expect.  A CA should issue certificates only
to the holders of certificates.  It should NOT issue sub-CA certifactes to
third parties who will then issue certs to domains they dont own.  Not even
on the fly inside a "packet inspection" box.

If someone wants to inspect packets on a corporate lan they can issue their
own self-signed cert, and install that in their users browsers in their OS
install image.

Then if I go on their LAN with my own equipment, I'll get a warning.

I think its unacceptable to have CAs issuing such certs.

No.  Also IANAL but there were several cases where employees did have an
expectation of privacy upheld even in the US.  Certainly you cant do that in
the EU legally either.

I dont view this as business as usual.  If I am on a public hotspot, 3g or
my own DSL/cable I do ABSOLUTELY NOT expect the ISP to be getting inside my
SSL connection to my bank, my gmail account etc.  Whether I paid or not.  
For any reason at all (not to do advert analysis, not to do anti-virus, not
to re-write pages etc).  I use airport/hotel wifi a lot and I've never seen
it and I am suspicious enough to use cert patrol etc.

Well yes I know the hardware exists.  I even helped design and implement a
software-only MitM at ZKS.  Before you get alarmed the cert it created was
known only to the user, generated on the machine, and its purpose was to
protect the user via a cookie manager protecting their privacy.

If you read the sonic wall stuff its fairly clear the model that they talk
about at least is that you do not have a sub-CA key.  You generate a
self-signed CA key, and install it in your corporate LAN browsers trusted CA
dbs.  Clearly it would also work with such a cert.

Similarly their doco about server SSL shows they dont expect you to have a
proper sub-CA key.  (scenario where the web server for public access is
behind the sonicwall) you are expected to import your server SSL certs
mapped per IP address into the box.  (Otherwise the public would see
self-signed MitM notices when they browse the site.  Or the sub-CA cert.

Well people were complaining about the "WAP gap" a long time ago.  I thought
this was more about the phones at the time being not CPU powerful enough to
terminate SSL.  The idea that a gap exists somewhere where your traffic is
decrypted was viewed as a significant security limitation people were
pleased to see go a way with phones fast enough to terminate their own SSL.

That is bad.  Are you saying there is anyone doing SSL mitm for stream
compression reasons?  Who?
