Be fair.  I rewrote much of the PGP functionality in Mutt just so I
could send PGP-signed messages to this list without pissing people
off.  Never mind that I was subsequently convinced that doing so is
not useful, just as I'm sure this person soon will be.  :-)

In any case, if anyone wants my patch for Mutt that will give you the
option to keep it from including the "MIME encrustations" (in the
words of Tim May), just ask and I'll send it to you.
