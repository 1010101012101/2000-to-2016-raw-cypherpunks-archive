Subject: Photograph alteration CPUNK

Last week a <NOECHELON>cannabis legalisation activist</NOECHELON> 
handed a posy of said plant, wrapped as if it had been bought in a 
florists' shop to Her Majesty the Queen.  HRH accepted it as just 
another bunch of flowers, and the photographs hit the newsstands 
the next morning.

As expected, all the papers had a different spin.  However, none of the 
front page photographs showed a plant with flower.  It would make no 
sense to hand HRH a handful of ugly weeds, and the guy who claimed 
responsibility referred to it as 'a pretty yellow flower'.

This sent my bullshit meter into overdrive.  Had the photos been 
doctored to distort the message of the <NOECHELON>activist?</NOECHELON> 
or merely "pruned" by the editor for one that doesn't advertise 
such horticulture to the masses?

Is there anyone on the internet who is actively tracking forged/spun 
photographs, Photopunks if you will?  I remember the storm here over 
*that* Elian pic.

Perhaps this is in Declan's sphere of interest?
