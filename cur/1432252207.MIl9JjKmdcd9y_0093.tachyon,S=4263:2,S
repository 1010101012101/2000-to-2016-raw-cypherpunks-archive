And to make sure that Ray Dillinger is not confused, let me point out 
that my "credit rating data haven" is not necessarily for cyberspace 
nyms. Rather, it's for the meatspace world of credit evaluation.

The point of moving it outside a jurisdiction like the U.S., and 
perhaps beyond _any_ physical jurisdiction, is because meatspace 
credit data bases and reporting services are heavily regulated.

(Also a good reason why seller-untraceability is as important as 
buyer-untraceability.)
