Hmmm...

I'll stipulate that the common citizen, when faced with a tirade about
killing those who perform abortions and a list of names and addresses of
offenders, would not immediately put 2 and 2 together to make 3 and
start killing doctors. Now put yourself in the position of an average
citizen who sees his own name in the list following a tirade about
killing those who drive gasoline-guzzling, polluting, Corolla-crushing
SUVs. I'm sure he would feel threatened. So the site in question is not
the same as a site that simply expresses a political opinion or
distributes instructions on how to create dangerous devices. It is more
like a site that distributes this info and then list specific targets
that should be considered as applications. The site owners took a
concrete step towards carrying out a threat : they gathered and
published personal information. I'm sure the appeal to the jury was
along these lines.

OTOH perhaps you're right that speech of all sorts should have the
highest of protections regardless of how it is perceived by a
vanishingly small number of persons in the audience be they potential
agents or targets. In which case the choice of methods for dealing with
threats would be left solely to the individuals who perceive them.

I suppose there's a downside either way. Can't win. Best you can do is
break even. And you can't even do that.
