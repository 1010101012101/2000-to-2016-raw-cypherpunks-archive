You see, I didn't know what ad hominem mean't so I had a choice, I could
wait for someone to explain it all to me or I could go and find out the
meaning for myself - which I did :P

Skype: centralized authentication by a third party corporation - you
don't have to do any authentication for yourself, you just have to trust
that Microsoft will never act in a way inconsistent with your privacy or
freedom.

PGP: decentralized authentication where the amount of trust you have in
the certificates is fully under your control. But with this control
comes complexity because you don't have some benevolent overlord taking
care of your every need.

Take your pick, personally I don't trust big corporations and for that
reason will accept the extra complexity.

If he has little interest in protecting his privacy why would he even
bother with any encryption no matter whether it's easy to use or not?

Yep, use stereotypes and you get what you deserve :P

You can drive a car mostly successfully without too much information but
if it stops at the side of the road and the limited info from your dials
doesn't tell you what's wrong then a bit more knowledge might just get
you home.
If anything, this matches the Enigmail model more than the invisible
crypto model.
