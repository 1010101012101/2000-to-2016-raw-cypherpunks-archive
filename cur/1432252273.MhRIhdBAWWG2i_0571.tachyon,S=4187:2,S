#    Cypherpunks,
#
#    I've been getting anywhere from 10 to 30 "SirCam" worm messages a
#    day. The volume is now declining. Most have attached files containing
#    fragments of Microsoft Word documents, apparently extracted from the

Tim's request for help was an elaborately detailed lie. 

I presumed he had the non-forgeable IP [extremely hard
to forge] recorded by his ISP to backup receipt of the
email from an appropriate .gov address. 

Politech will do for me from now on, anything really
important will be echoed there. 

 ---- 

Tim didn't post for a couple weeks. 

When he was back, it was a new Tim. 

One who: 

   o said the FBI wasn't malevolent in the Weaver case 

   o acted like a wimp regarding saying Adobe would
     suffer recruiting problems despite having
     extensively posted "needs killing" before 

   [
     Adobe will be suffering for a long time to come. 

     (Note to our FBI monitors: This is NOT a
     threat against Adobe. Note to Cypherpunks:
     With feebs like the Feebs out there, one
     can never assume that ordinary figures of
     speech will be understood.)
   ] 

   o posted an elaborate "Agent Provocateur" lie
     regarding receipt of NIPC traffic 

I can handle all the Choate crap. 

I can't handle a cypherpunks list without the real Tim May. 

Let Dmitry rot in jail with a lightbulb on 24/7, I no longer care. 

I'm unsubscriving, don't let the door hit
me in the ass and all that. 

Enjoy your Choate, y'all, that's all that's left.
