The point of using cryptography such purposes is to make ones non compliance undetectable, or at least unprovable.  Trusts and the like raise a red flag.  You are generating legal documents that advertise your intended non compliance and explain how you intend to do it.

Further, if authorities really have the hots for you, they can apply pressure to the trust authority is all sorts of ways.  They do not have to comply with the law -- you do.   For example they could kidnap the child of the person holding the trust, and hint that in return for cooperation they 
will overlook the crack they planted on him, carrying a twenty year prison sentence.

Encrypted data with a long passphrase will resist any amount of pressure.  Legal solutions will not.
