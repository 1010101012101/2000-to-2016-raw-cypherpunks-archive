(What, you mean like using the US police to deprive us of life, liberty,
and the
pursuit of happiness?)

My neighbors subject their offspring to a kind of abuse commonly called
religion.  Do I have a right to intercede?   They are not harming *me*.

Stay out of others family spats.  Or as Gen'l W said,
Trade with all, make treaties with none, and beware of foreign
entanglements.

(Mind you, as an reformed Objectivist, I do believe in absolute right
and
wrong; but does this give me the right to initiate force to clue you in?

When do we start bombing Berlin?)
