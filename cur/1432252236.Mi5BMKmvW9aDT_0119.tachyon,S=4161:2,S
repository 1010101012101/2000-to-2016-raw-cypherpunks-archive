I don't see what the big concern is here. Just stand there and say 
nothing. They're going to go through the bags as they wish anyway.

The nitrogen connection has been known for many years, too. I remember 
hearing that _marzipan_ candy tends to set off the detectors, something 
to do with the almonds and nitrates and all.

Big deal. Just stand there and let them search. Using your range bag for 
carryone luggage is perfectly legal, providing you haven't left any 
shells inside, or any bore cleaning brushes which might be used as 
Assault Brushes.
