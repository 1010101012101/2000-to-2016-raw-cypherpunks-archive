I recently downloaded potato for remailers including Mixmaster among =

the how-to & help pages, and I still can't figure out how this program =
"works" let alone how to "use" it. I can't figure out where to compose =
the text body, where to save it to, what to call it, how to send it, etc =
etc etc etc....... Is there a place that offers instructions for the =
"instructions"???   It appears that all the text support is geared to =
those who really don't need it. Any help would greatly be appreciated. =
