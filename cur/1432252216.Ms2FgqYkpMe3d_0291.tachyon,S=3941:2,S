Especially so since, in the absence of law enforcement interference, a
limited online supply can serve a huge body of viewers. This makes the
problem impossible to solve on the demand side. The rational response would
be to go back to plain old police work for those few producers that actually
harm kids, treat the cases without explicit regard for the sexual nature of
the deeds (if there is physical violence, that's punishable quite without
specialized KP statutes), and let the images stay online to satisfy what
demand there is. In fact it might not be a bad idea to saturate the market
by putting the stuff in the public domain and allocating some of the
considerable law enforcement anti-KP budgets to run the servers. At least
the financial incentive to produce more KP would come down considerably.
