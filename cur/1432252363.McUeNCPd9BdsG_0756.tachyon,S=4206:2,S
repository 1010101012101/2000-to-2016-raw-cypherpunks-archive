The British can own single and double barrel shotguns, but only if 
they're licensed and registered and they can only use birdshot.  If 
you take a look at British gun magazines, you'll see advertisements 
for really good replica firearms-  They're kind of expensive though.

An unintended consequence to all of this prohibitionist activity, and 
a not altogether harmful one IMHO, is that the average citizen is 
losing more and more respect for the government.  And the ultimate 
unintended consequence is the logical choice between violating the 
law by owning an illegal fake firearm or by violating the law owning 
a real one.  Most people will choose owning a real one-
