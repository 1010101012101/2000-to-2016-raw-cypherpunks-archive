Devil's Dictionary, 2005 edition:

"Butterfly Effect: Wherein the use of a "butterfly ballot" having 
candidates listed on either side of a central column was claimed to 
have confused some elderly Jewish voters in Palm County, Florida and 
thus was used by lawyers as an excuse to take full control of the 
American election process."
