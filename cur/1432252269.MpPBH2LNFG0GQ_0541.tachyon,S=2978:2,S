Sorry to contradict you, but I recall cases (up to the level of the US 
Supreme Court) allowing this.  How 'difficult' it is, I don't recall.  
Problem is, I don't have access to the Lexis system that I used while 
stuck in the Fed's "gated communities".  But at least at the Federal 
level, such a mechanism exists.  I wish I could be more specific.   I'll 
check  www.law.cornell.edu.                Jim Bell

You are looking for "Declaratory Judgments".
