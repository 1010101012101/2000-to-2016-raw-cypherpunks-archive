Lets look at that for a second.

"A few years ago".  Lets call it two years ago.  That would make the
average hi-cap drive around 30gb.  We'll have to assume they want these to
be fault-tolerant and with host stanbys, since this *is* the standard
implementation, so:

	250,000 drives
	divie by 5 to get RAID groups = 50K groups of 90gb each, or
	~4.6 petabytes for this one order.

4.6pb may be a lot, but it wouldn't hold much of the worlds traffic -
there's a hell of a lot of filtering going on.
