Over 40 companies in the United States (covering 20 states)
have had their Online Banking and E-Commerce applications
compromised. We have no idea how many companies have been
affected internationally. The Secret Service Field Offices
and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have been investigating
this here in the States, and are also coordinating efforts
with foreign law enforcement authorities to track down the
perpetrators.  Over 1,000,000 accounts, including credit
cards, user IDs and passwords, and personal data (e.g. -
whatever contents the compromised businesses kept in their
online databases) were stolen.
