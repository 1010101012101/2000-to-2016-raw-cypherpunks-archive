Tim, you haven't been to that many commercial conferences recently. I
spoke at Internet World last month, and that's exactly how much it is.
Even given the economic downturn, they haven't dropped the price.
It's still $1,500 for the fall IW:

Maybe. But here in DC, there are scores of such conferences each year,
and I could easily go to one or two a week. Some of my colleagues at
other news organizations, like National Journal Tech Daily, do that.

Even "nonprofit" conferences are still pricey:

$650.00

$685

Probably. Usually there are only a few (~20) journalists who are actually
going to cover the event.
