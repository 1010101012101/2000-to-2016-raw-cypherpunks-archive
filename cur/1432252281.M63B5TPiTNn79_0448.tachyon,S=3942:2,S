Your business about MACS and stuff was to prevent the 
adversary guessing the users session ID.  With "session 
fixation", the adversary does not try to guess the 
legitimate users session ID, instead he fools the 
browser of the legitimate user into using the 
adversary's session ID.

Adversary accesses web site as if about to log in, gets
a session ID.  Then supplies false information to 
someone else's browser, causes that browser on some one 
else's computer to use that session ID.  Someone else 
logs in with hacker's session ID, and now the adversary
is logged in.
