Is anyone disappointed?  Is anyone surprised?

FreeS/WAN garroted itself by refusing to take code contributions from
people inside the U.S., out of fear that the BXA would retroactively
change export policy and render those contributions poisonous.

FreeS/WAN made no serious attempt to integrate with the linux kernel's
routing infrastructure, no doubt due in part to the first issue above.

FreeS/WAN configuration was, and probably still is, not very intuitive;
diagnostics were and probably are similarly poor.

Corporations, the major users of VPNs, usually use dedicated vpn boxes
with support from a commercial VPN provider.  If any such providers base
their VPN products on FreeS/WAN, it's probably heavily modified.
