For whatever part of your threat models above includes global passive
adversary watching the input and output points of your network
of choice and lining up traffic observations... there is little defense
to be taken other than filling your unused capacity with fill traffic.
No network to date appears to be developing or using that defense.
There have been threads on that within the last year, and even one on
making such background fill a part of IEEE for fiber and copper physical links.
