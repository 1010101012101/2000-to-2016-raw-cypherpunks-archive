I don't know if anyone here is a member of the IEEE, but here's a couple
of interesting comments that came in my mail box this morning.  Seems
like the IEEE isn't interested in crypto research?

Patience, persistence, truth,

This morning, i noticed that the IEEE copyright form
(that authors must sign when they publish papers with the IEEE),
the signer must warrant that "publication or dissemination of the work"
will not violate the DMCA.

I suggest that we ask the IEEE to include with the form their
definitive interpretation of the DMCA and spell out specifically what
the signer is warranting.  Without such a statement limiting the
warranty to what the signer can reasonably interpret, I would
certainly not feel confortable granting such a warranty.
