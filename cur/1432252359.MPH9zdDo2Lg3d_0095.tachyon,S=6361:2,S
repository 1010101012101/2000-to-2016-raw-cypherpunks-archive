Florida governor defends measure requiring drug tests for welfare

(CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Sunday defended recent legislation that
requires adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screenings,
saying the law provides "personal accountability."

"It's not right for taxpayer money to be paying for somebody's drug
addiction," Scott told CNN's T.J. Holmes on Sunday. "On top of that, this is
going to increase personal responsibility, personal accountability. We
shouldn't be subsidizing people's addiction."

But the ACLU of Florida, which has already filed suit against Scott over a
measure requiring government employees to undergo random drug testing,
disagrees, and may sue over the welfare law as well.

"What (Scott) is doing is giving ugly legitimacy to an unfortunate
stereotype that has been in this country for a couple of decades -- that all
welfare recipients are a bunch of drug abusers," said Howard Simon,
executive director of the ACLU of Florida.

Scott told CNN he wants to ensure that welfare funds go to their primary
target -- to disadvantaged children -- and provide people with an incentive
not to use drugs. He signed the measure on June 1, calling it "the right
thing for taxpayers."

Under the law, which takes effect on July 1, the Florida Department of
Children and Family Services will be required to conduct the drug tests on
adults applying to the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
program. The aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the
screening, which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify.

Those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to
receive the benefits on behalf of their children, and do not receive a
refund for the test.

Shortly after the bill was signed, five Democrats from the state's
congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation,
one calling it "downright unconstitutional."

"Governor Scott's new drug testing law is not only an affront to families in
need and detrimental to our nation's ongoing economic recovery, it is
downright unconstitutional," said Rep. Alcee Hastings. "If Governor Scott
wants to drug test recipients of TANF benefits, where does he draw the line?
Are families receiving Medicaid, state emergency relief, or educational
grants and loans next?"

"I work for the ACLU, and it's our job to prevent trampling on the
constitutional rights of people," Simon said. The Constitution mandates that
searches cannot be conducted without probable cause, he said.

Controversy over the measure was heightened by Scott's past association with
a company he co-founded that operates walk-in urgent care clinics in Florida
and counts drug screening among the services it provides. In April, Scott,
who had transferred his ownership interest in Solantic Corp. to a trust in
his wife's name, said the company would not contract for state business,
according to local media reports.

Asked about the company Sunday, Scott said he is in the process of selling
his family's interest in the company and "it will be sold in a couple of
weeks." There is no conflict of interest, he said.

On May 18, the Florida Ethics Commission ruled that two conflict-of-interest
complaints against Scott were legally insufficient to warrant investigation,
and adopted an opinion that no "prohibited conflict of interest" existed.

On the measure requiring public employees to undergo drug testing, Simon
noted that public employees -- workers in city, county, state and federal
government -- are protected by the Constitution and should not undergo
"intrusive" drug testing without probable cause to believe a person is using
drugs.
