First case of inhalational anthrax reported in the U.S. in over 25 
years, CNN reported, and yet it is happening NOW?

The news reports are that the man may have been exposed during a visit 
to North Carolina...they're checking on it. However, consider the

(Lantana, or somesuch) that the WTC pilots were training at.

One coincidence is just that. Two...
