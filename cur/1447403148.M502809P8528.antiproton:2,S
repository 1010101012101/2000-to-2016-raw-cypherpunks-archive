An admittedly very brief reading, site verbage, including trademark,
patent and copyright claims leaves question as to commitment to
fully decentralized p2p model and opensource. If true, you might find
quite limited interest here and more interest by banks, govts, and
commercial. If untrue and misread, please address.

And details on "directory servers", "witnesses", "trusted party
transaction servers".

What is your .onion?
What networks besides Tor do you have as pluggable
(or even multihome) options for when Tor is or becomes
incapacitated or unreachable or users simply prefer other?
