Oxymoron, eh?

Pseudonymity has many socially acceptable features. Anonymity has all of 
the practical benefits of pseudonymity and no additional advantages in 
a conversational forum such as cpunks. Anonymous persons (or 
dumbassbots; it's hard to tell sometimes) who snipe from behind the 
veil may be assumed to be cowardly jackasses.
