Sigh, I should fucking charge you labor for this...

Then you have no clue how to search 'in document' or you're being
intentionaly obtuse.

1. If you go to google and use 'mediterranean gibralter waterfall' note
   very first item and note the comment about 'final waterfall'.

2. Get off your lazy butt and actualy execute a search on this document.
   You'll find commentary on,

   "Summary of Lecture - GY 308 (Southampton University)

    Read the course description carefully. Note terminology like
    'gigantic waterfall', comparison to Victoria and Niagra, etc.

You should really learn how to fish.

Signing off.
