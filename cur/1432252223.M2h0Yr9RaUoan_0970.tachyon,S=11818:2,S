Threat to Internet freedom posed by new security law
RSF has expressed its serious concern further to the French government's=20
introduction of a bill concerning the general direction and programme=20
planning of internal security (Loi d'orientation et de programmation sur la=
=20
s=E9curit=E9 int=E9rieure, LOPSI). The National Assembly adopted the bill at=
 the=20
first reading on 17 July 2002. It outlines the present and future security=
=20
policies of the Interior Ministry and government as a whole. The Senate=20
will examine the bill on 30 and 31 July.
In a 29 July letter to French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, the=20
organisation denounced "the latest step to be taken concerning security=20
matters. [The organisation is] alarmed by the setback for civil, collective=
=20
and individual rights brought on by this bill."
"It is generally recognised that the Assembly's adoption of the very=20
controversial Law on Daily Security (Loi sur la s=E9curit=E9 quotidienne,=
 LSQ)=20
in November 2001, and the European Parliament's 30 May adoption of the=20
disturbing amendment to the Directive on the Protection of=20
Telecommunications Data and Information have already restricted these=20
fundamental constitutional liberties. This bill threatens to simply erase=20
decades of struggle for their establishment and preservation," stated RSF=20
Secretary-General Robert M=E9nard.
"We deplore the general climate of surveillance that is introduced by the=20
new measures submitted to the legislature ; the universal climate of=20
suspicion that is encouraged by the fact that, henceforth, each citizen is=
=20
considered a possible offender or terrorist, and the serious attacks on=20
freedom of expression and the confidentiality of work-related and private=20
correspondence. Our organisation specifically questions the possibility of=
=20
guaranteeing the confidentiality of journalists' sources, to the extent=20
that data from Internet connections and e-mail exchanges (Internet=20
connection logs) could be requisitioned and examined with disconcerting=20
ease by police officers," underlined M=E9nard.
These concerns are amplified by the objective outlined in the bill to=20
allow, "judicial police officers, acting in the context of an official=20
investigation, and with a magistrate's authorisation, to gain direct access=
=20
to computer files and enable the long-distance seizure, via telematic or=20
electronic means, of information that appears necessary to the=20
establishment of the truth". This excerpt refers to the authorities'=20
licence to carry out off-property "searches" of Internet service providers'=
=20
computer servers, which store logs of users' online activity, and=20
automatically seize the information stored therein.
RSF has, therefore, asked the interior minister :

to specify the exact details of implementation under which the authorities=
=20
will have access to data from Internet connections, sent and received=20
e-mails and specify the policies governing the "seizure" of personal=20
information ;

to reaffirm his commitment to the protection of the confidentiality of=20
professional exchanges, and especially the basic principle of=20
confidentiality of journalists' sources
to ensure, together with the Justice Ministry, that a sufficient number of=
=20
magistrates who are experienced with these issues are given the means to=20
deal calmly and impartially with police officers' requests for examination=
=20
and seizure.
RSF also renewed its 6 June appeal to Internet service providers, asking=20
them not to retain user data, and urged Internet users in general, and=20
journalists in particular, to use cryptography software in order to=20
preserve the confidentiality of their exchanges.
