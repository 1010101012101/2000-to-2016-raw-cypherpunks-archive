Not to mention the obvious problems with letting government agents bid 
on things like when various unwanted foreign leaders would be 
assassinated. Gee, maybe SEAL Team 6 can do an office bid, using 
anonymous cutouts of course, on when SEALs will go ashore at Bandar 
Abbas to liquidate the Iranian prime minister? Or maybe a CIA wet work 
guy can make a few extra bucks in the dead pool by correctly predicting 
the death of the next Vince Foster?

Besides being problematic in its own right, it also leaks information, 
a kind of covert covert channel, ironically. If the bids are truly 
untraceable (fat chance--the password scheme looked like a trival, 
breakable Gen 1 security system) then those with knowledge of 
operations can make money by using their knowledge, all untraceably.

This was obvious long before Jim Bell became infamous. Check out 
writings by some of us dating back to 1988.

Once again, government sets itself up as being outside the law. If I 
were to even make a snide remark about the assassination of You Know 
Who, I'd get a visit from the SS.

Fucking proof that D.C. needs to be obliterated in an act of freedom 
fighting. Gets rid of a passal of welfare addicts, too.
