   If gamergaters spent half as much time trying to fix systemic problems 
that they claim to care about as they do correcting "misconceptions" 
about gamergate, I *might* start to take them seriously.

   Want to fix games journalism?  Why not start with the large 
corporations that bribe their way into getting good reviews at large 
publications that lead to millions of dollars in sales.  Target EA, who 
just this week went to court to defend against a class-action lawsuit 
filed by gamers.  While the court found in their favor, they *also* 
determined that the statements put out by EA were "puffery" and did not 
reflect reality.  How will this impact the industry going forward?  Does 
#GamerGate bother having an opinion on this?

   Targeting female indie developers is complete weaksauce.  And the fact 
that this comprises the vast majority of #GamerGate's "activism" proves 
the allegation that it's filled with whiny man-babies.

   You know what I *don't* care about?  People I don't know who 
supposedly shagged other people I don't know.  No one whose opinion 
matters cares about this hypothetical scandal.  It's all a 
pseudo-intellectual circlejerk.

   You either care about journalistic ethics enough to target large 
corporations and key players, or you're just fucking around.  Seriously. 
  This is as true for you (yes, you personally) as it is for the #NSA 
#GCHQ crowd.
