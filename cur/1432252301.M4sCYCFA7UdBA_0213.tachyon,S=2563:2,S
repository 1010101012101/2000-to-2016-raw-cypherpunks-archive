high power works great to confuse these location tracking heuristics;
a 1W* shows up as 'right next to AP' on all radios in the vicinity.

a number of access point makers include this kind of location tracking
capability, for example Newbury Networks 'locale points':
http://www.newburynetworks.com/products/coretech.php?localepoints so
this applies to more than just the cisco/Airespace products.

there are tricks to work around high powered clients / rogue AP
signals but i haven't seen vendors implement them yet and exactly what
these workarounds are is left as an exercise for the reader. :)

best regards,

* this probably exceeds FCC EIRP limits but no one cares about the FCC
anymore right?
