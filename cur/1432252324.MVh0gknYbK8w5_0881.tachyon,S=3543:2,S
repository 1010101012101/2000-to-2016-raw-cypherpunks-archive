Probably not.  I haven't seen the spec so I'm not 100% sure, but
this is the info I dug up after 10 minutes of googling.


http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-9904.html

"And the Mobitex protocol used by ARDIS and RAM mobile for wireless email
is another example of something that is complex for error correction and
robustness but has essentially no security. And software for monitoring
this circulates around the net as well. ARDIS does use XORing with a
32 bit constant of the day to provide some fig leaf of security, but
obviously determining the constant is trivial..."


Sad, isn't it?
