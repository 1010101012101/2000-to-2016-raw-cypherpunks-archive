  Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2007 (FC07) is the eleventh
  edition of a well established and major international forum for research,
  advanced development, education, exploration, and debate regarding security
  in the context of finance and commerce, covering all aspects of securing
  transactions and systems. These aspects include a range of technical areas
  such as: cryptography, payment systems, secure transaction architectures,
  software systems and tools, user and operator interfaces, fraud prevention,
  secure IT infrastructure, and analysis methodologies. The focus will also
  encompass financial, legal, business and policy aspects. Material both on
  theoretical (fundamental) aspects of securing systems and on secure
  applications and real-world deployments will be considered.

  The conference goal is to bring together top cryptographers, data-security
  specialists, and scientists with economists, bankers, implementers, and
  policy makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC07 program will
  feature invited talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations,
  and panel discussions.

  FC07 will take place at the Hilton Tobago Resort in Tobago, West Indies
  from February 12th to 15th, 2007. Please see the conference call for papers
  and the other pages of this website for details on conference coverage,
  submission, and logistical information. A workshop on Usable Security will
  be held in conjunction with FC07 immediately following the conference.





  This conference is organized annually by the International Financial
  Cryptography Association.
