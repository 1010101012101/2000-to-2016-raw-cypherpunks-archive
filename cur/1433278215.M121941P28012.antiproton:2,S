You're just assuming that the generic parental threat isn't omnipotent?
Employees of the military industrial complex are parents too. There is no
'generic parental threat model.'

What more do you want? What outputs are you expecting here? A flow-chart?
Graphs & diagrams?

The advice is the same as any other scenario:

Threat Intelligence to figure out what the motivations and capabilities
are.
Standard opsec advice, such as compartmentalize as best as possible.
Employ techniques and technologies used to achieve resilience in the face
of generic nation-state attackers.
Pursue externally mediated resolution [invoke the State's controls or
employ physical manipulation] where it is merited.

-Travis
