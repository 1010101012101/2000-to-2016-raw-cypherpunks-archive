I suppose that my question, (assuming what Anonymous described is the
actual behavior of Freedom 3.0), would now be: "who cares?" What is left
in the Freedom product that this would matter?

Your ISP and the world are not likely to care that you're using an
glorified cookie-manager, and it's my impression that that is what Freedom
has now become.

However, for the sake of clarity, it would indeed be nice to know what
the information those HTTP requests actually means, and for what purpose
it is being generated.

Also, are there any threats created by such information leakage? How could
Freedom 3.0 users be harmed by this?

(If the same behavior was present in Freedom 2.0, I can imagine some more
obvious immediate threats. If what Dov says is true, it's remarkable that
ZKS hadn't been called on this previously. But now that Freedom is no
longer an anonymity service, what are the concerns?)
