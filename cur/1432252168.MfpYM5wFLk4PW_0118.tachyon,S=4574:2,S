Wait, what? Where the hell did you get *that* bullshit. MIT network was=

fine, the pissed people were at JSTOR, and they were pissed not because=
 "the=20
network was brought down to its knees", but because somebody was gettin=
g a lot=20
of articles "without paying".

MIT *never even made clear* whether or not Aaron was *authorized* to ac=
cess=20
MIT network:
http://ur1.ca/gd3z7

And as *every* user of MIT network had access to JSTOR, it's also hard =
to=20
claim that Aaron accessed JSTOR in an "unauthorized" manner. The only p=
roblem=20
was the amount of articles Aaron was downloading, and the manner he was=
 doing=20
that (a laptop in a closet).

Whether or not he was authorized to access them is unclear, however the=
re is=20
strong evidence suggesting he was indeed authorized to access MIT netwo=
rk, and=20
hence, through it, JSTOR.

So please, get your facts straight.

Oh, oh, right, so as long as somebody disagrees with you, they are "dis=
playing=20
the attitude of the ruling class". Wow, you actually took the effort to=
 move a=20
bit from "YOU'RE STUPID!!1!" ad hominem, but just this tiny bit. Hence,=
 no=20
extra credit. :)
