Hi again, Boyce.

I will re-subscribe and be on topic now.  You can moderate my messages to
be sure I will be strictly on topic, if you want.

I am humbly asking to return because there are some interesting subjects
there, about Tor Project in general.

Sorry for being deeply sincere, but mentioning "ludicrous rape apologetics"
makes really clear your beliefs and preferences.

Hope to be accepted again.

Cecilia
