The Tor Project doesn't claim that Tor protects against targeted attack
by global adversaries. I could go on at length. But instead, please see
<https://www.ivpn.net/privacy-guides/adversaries-and-anonymity-systems-the-basics>.

I don't doubt that.

It's possible.

Maybe, but different goals. Me, I like Dissent. See Feigenbaum and Ford
(2015) Seeking Anonymity in an Internet Panopticon. Communications of
the ACM 58:10, 58-69. Preprint at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5307>.
