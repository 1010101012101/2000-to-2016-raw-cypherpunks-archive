Sounds like libel to me.

So there's a published list, even if it's only published to cops,
saying "This person is likely to commit a crime".
Leave aside the obvious civil liberties issues for the moment -
this seems like simple libel to me.  At least for the Usual Suspects
who haven't yet been arrested for things, this doesn't sound like
investigation of a crime or other legitimate police function that's
protected by laws protecting government officials doing their official jobs.
Of course, most of the people on the list probably don't have the
resources to fight that kind of libel suit, but it'd be fun to get
the ACLU or some other pro bono support for it.
