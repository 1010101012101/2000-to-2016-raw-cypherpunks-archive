No, in case of Cthulhu attacks, you can call me too.  Monsters always love
lawyers.  Professional courtesy, dear!  :)

I think Justin will receive more Brazilian crazy doubts than us, because I
shared this project.  Hmm, need to do the same with rysiek's project too.
:P

I wrote 1/3 of an answer to you about time management in case of studies
and projects, talking about Pomodoro and other methods.  I am horrible with
scheduling.  I need to answer to, at least, five private messages from
people here and I think they will kick me soon, but their answers are 3/4
ready only.  Or a little less, uh!  :P

Well, if my answer becomes too bizarre, I will send it in private.  Kisses,
take care!  :*
