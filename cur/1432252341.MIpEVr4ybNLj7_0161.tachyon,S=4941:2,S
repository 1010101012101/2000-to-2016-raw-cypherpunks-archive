Nader lives in a Dupont Circle townhouse owned by his sister and
reportedly worth millions. (Given land prices in that area of DC, it
has to be worth at least $1 million.)

Ironically, Cisco has been targeted by the Feds for antitrust

though he's happy to do it to nearly every other high tech firm.
