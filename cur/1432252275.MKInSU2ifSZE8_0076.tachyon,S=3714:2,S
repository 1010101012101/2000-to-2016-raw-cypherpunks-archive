I once spoke with some engineers who built and run one of those high-speed 
electronic trading networks/exchanges. Their time to match trades was 
something like 50 microseconds. Their serious members colocated their 
trading systems in their datacenter because it was so critical to eliminate 
the propagation delay.

I guess I don't see the need to do bitcoin crypto transactions at that  
speed any more than the other high-speed exchanges need to rapidly move  
stock certificates, hard cash, or perform ACH/EFTs.

Maybe you could be the next Certicom!   ^_^

But the term "high speed electronic exchange" seems to mean exactly this, 
almost by definition.
