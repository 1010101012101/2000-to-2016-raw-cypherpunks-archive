 >>Compared to giants like Brookings? Not well-funded, well-known, big, nor 
powerful. Few folks even in DC have heard of it. $1M in grants over a 
period of years is not much by Washington policy group standards. -Declan

Compared to so called "libertarian" institute,Cato,that comps our resident 
bottom feeding scribbler this is low?high?middling?
Right wing conservative 'think tanks' serve a useful purpose for the 
fascist corporate state.Corporations need manufactured
consent as much as Govt.Especially when so many of them are so much bigger 
than many Govts.Ive made several posts
re.the notorious cato institute,the most damaging linking declan through it 
to the murder of george harrison.As I said to
agent faustine,declan,silence speaks volumes in this house.
