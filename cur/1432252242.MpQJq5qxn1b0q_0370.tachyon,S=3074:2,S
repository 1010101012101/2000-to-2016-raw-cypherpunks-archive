Kill every sitting politician and bureaucrat tonight, and tomorrow
their hundred million constituents would be stumbling over each other
in their haste to erect new ones in place of those killed.

Kill the hundred million, and government would dry up and blow away,
but it ain't gonna happen.

Who are the hundred million?  Start with Social Security recipients
and go from there.

Compiling a list of a few hundred is tilting at windmills.
