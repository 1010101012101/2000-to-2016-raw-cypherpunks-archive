>From Tim May:

:The USA/PATRIOT bill was hastily put together, with most
:Congresscritters have essentially no idea of its implications for
:building a police state. The U.S. Congress wastes more than a year
:debating the impeachment issue over the Lewinsky affair, blah blah blah,
:then races to construct an American Reich with barely any discussion.
:
:Disgusting. The nation is beyond salvation. America is preterite.

But you never did have any hopes or great expectations from it, anyway, did
you.  I mean, you're of the mind to take up the responsibility for your own
existence regardless of what national borders you're living within, and
hardly waiting for or dependent upon their generosity.

Speaking of taking up full responsibility for one's preferred lifestyle, it
makes me think that it will be an oddly strange, science-fiction kind of
existence that some of us will be operating in, in the future, trying to
survive and achieve our ambitions in between weasels, dogs of war, and
missile fire.  Something between "A Boy and his Dog", "Mad Max", and
"Neuromancer".
