Sure you have to "ground out" into something tangible, or at least a fiat
currency ;-), sooner or later.

Someday, of course, you won't need the fiat bit, but pure commodities
aren't the end-state. You probably need a mix of stuff, including financial
proxies like debt and equity indices, and so on. But the core problem is
measuring inflation. Fortunately, :-), Paul Harrison and I have this giant
rant in the can about non-state bearer synthetic numeraires, using things
like digital bearer warehouse receipts for the hard stuff, a proxy for the
CPI...

Cheers,
RAH
