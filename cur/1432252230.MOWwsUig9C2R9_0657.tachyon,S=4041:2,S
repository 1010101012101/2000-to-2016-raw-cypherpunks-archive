I gave a presentation at a conference a few years back in which I raised 
the idea that since Intellectual Property (e.g., trademarks) isn't, its 
really a lease, that our society should consider setting limits on the 
market penetration (say 50%, which is already in excess of the what many 
economists call the "friction free" point wherein companies can continue to 
gain market share merely by dint of their already considerable presence) of 
single companies in markets whose size (the therefore probably importance) 
exceeds some minimum threshold of the GDP.  However, instead of enforcing 
these limits via the Department of Justice, they would become a civil 
matter and one's competitors can use the courts to strip a company of its 
sole lease on a trademark or patent applied to this market.

I guess then the many science (especially theoretical) and technology 
developments by "amateurs" over the past three were just a fluke?

An excellent treatise on this can be found in Leonard Peikoffs' "The 
Ominous Parallels," 1982.  The author dissects many of the parallels 
between the raise of Nazism and the then current situation in the U.S.  He 
lays much of the cause for its raise and our "ominous" future in a lack of 
development in individual thinking, especially philosophical, the kind that 
launched America.
