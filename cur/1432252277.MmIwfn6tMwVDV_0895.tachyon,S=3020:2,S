Love that story.  But the self-watermarking you later mention is a
problem.
Even if you map a particular hash into one of a million known-benign
values, which takes work, there are multiple orthagonal hash algorithms
included on the NIST CD.  (Eg good luck finding values that collide in
MD5 & SHA-1 & SHA-256 simultaneously!)

In that case, yes, although ultimately the RIAA could hire offshore
Indians to listen
to your stego'd/uniquified Madonna song and identify it.  (Of course,
they don't
know if you own the vinyl for it... and software can be sold by the
original purchaser, too, right?)

Yes something like a Tomlinson (_Big Breach_) sleight of hand with a
Psion
card is a good idea, as is the microwave oven trash can next to your
machine :-)

And a larger segment which will stick any CD they get in the mail into
their
bootable drive.. LOL

Sorta like the National Forests... resource of many uses... may as well
include a mixmaster payload in that worm :-) which also provides some
other
overt free benefit like antivirus or anti-helmetic or defrag or game or
bayesian spamfilter
or chat or screensaver or anon remailing client or free ringtone :-)
