That's why the governments cooperate even though it would seem they sho=

"radio links", "WiFi" (WIreless FluorIde!), "bluetooth" (obvious link t=

lightbulbs? MIND CONTROL, that's why. My wolfram filament works just fi=

thak you very much! Go, look it up![1]

The "global warming" stuff? All bollocks, a way to make us suffer, a wa=

REPTILIANS! THANKS, PUTINBAMA!

While we're taking about Obama (if that is his real name!), notice how =

self-agrandeurising! FIRST STEP FOR DICTATORSHIP! Along with "Obamacare=

Want proof that Putin is in there by the way? Easy -- he was trying to =
