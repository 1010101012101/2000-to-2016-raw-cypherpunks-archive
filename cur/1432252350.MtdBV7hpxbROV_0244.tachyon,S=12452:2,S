One woman undergoing treatment for back pain may have discovered a cure =
for the thousands of woman frustrated by the inability to achieve =
orgasm.=20

While Dr. Stuart Meloy was putting an electrode into the woman's spine =
in an attempt to ease her chronic pain, he not only reduced her back =
pain, but gave her an unexpected -- but delightful -- side-effect.=20

"She said, 'You're going to have to teach my husband how to do that'," =
Meloy, an anesthesiologist and pain specialist in Winston-Salem, North =
Carolina, said. The discovery is published in Wednesday's issue of New =
Scientist.=20

Unexpectedly, Meloy had stumbled onto a solution that could help =
thousands of women who can't achieve orgasm. Recognizing the =
opportunity, he patented this use of the device, and is trying to work =
with Medtronic, a Minneapolis company that makes the spinal cord =
stimulator, to market it as a remote-control orgasm machine.=20

Meloy hopes human clinical trials will begin later this year.=20

An Orgasmatron like in the movie Sleeper is probably not around the =
corner, however. Even for back pain, the device is used only after all =
other possibilities are exhausted. The procedure is about as invasive as =
a pacemaker, Meloy said.=20

Still, Meloy hopes the effect is reproducible. He's witnessed induced =
orgasms twice so far, he said.=20

To treat back pain the surgeon places an electrode in a precise spot in =
the patient's spine in order to find the specific nerves carrying his or =
her pain signals to the brain.=20

Meloy said that to induce orgasm, the stimulating wires could connect to =
a signal generator smaller than a packet of cigarettes implanted under =
the skin of a patient's buttocks.=20

"Then you'd have a hand-held remote control to trigger it," he said.=20

Various issues can cause a woman to have difficulty achieving orgasm, =
said Jim Pfaus, who studies the neurobiology of sexual behavior at =
Concordia University in Montreal.=20

"Some women confuse what's called sympathetic arousal (in orgasm) -- =
like increased heart rate, clammy hands, nerves and so on -- with fear," =
he said in a statement. "That makes them want to get out of the =
situation."=20

The problem is often treated with psychotherapy or Valium, but the drug =
can also delay orgasm, Pfaus said.=20

Meloy said he hopes the device will help couples overcome problems =
associated with orgasmic dysfunction. "If you've got a couple who've =
been together for a while and it's just not happening anymore, maybe =
they'll get through it a bit easier with this," he said.=20

He added that the device could be programmed to limit its use. "But =
whether it's once a day, four times a week -- who am I to say?"=20
