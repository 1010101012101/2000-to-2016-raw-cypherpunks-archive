(You left out cancer, AIDS, and supersized happy meals)

    Intolerant hate filled christian mind set?  How does this differentiate
christians from the muslims, jews, native americans (I can't believe you
were so insensitive as to call them Indians) or even atheists?

    Perhaps we should all give in to the fun-loving stalinist's.  They got
rid of God, and it worked out well for them (and for human rights,
economics, etc etc).
