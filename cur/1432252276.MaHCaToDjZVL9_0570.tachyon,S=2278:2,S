Burka Bandit Hits Hiddenite Bank

POSTED: 12:36 pm EDT October 17, 2007

UPDATED: 5:34 pm EDT October 17, 2007


HIDDENITE, N.C. -- Police are investigating an unusual robbery in Hiddenite.

Someone dressed in a burgundy burka walked into the People's Bank at 3:45
p.m. Tuesday, showed the teller a handgun and demanded money.

The robber then took off down N.C. 90 in a burgundy sport utility vehicle.

Authorities are looking into whether this bank robbery can be connected to
one in Morganton.

An androgynously dressed person held up a bank there last week.

Officers aren't sure whether they're looking for a man or a woman in either
case.

Police also think there is a good chance the burka burglar is working with
at least one other person, a getaway driver.
