dude, you are a Class A asshole.
first you accuse someone of being a 
faggot. thats real nice, and endearing 
to the collective 'libertarian' 
standpoint.

does his manliness offend you? 
knowing that he has enough for the 
both of you sorta makes things bad 
for you, i know. so buck up, little 
camper. some day you will even get 
'pubes', and the guys in the shower
wont laugh at you anymore.

oh, then you accuse someone of being 
LEO. no he isnt. even if he was, he 
certainly would not last long with 
this attitude.

because he wouldnt take any shit from 
mealy mouth sumbitches like yourself
and his itchy trigger finger would just
be shit hot to TCOB, know what i mean?
if you had the choice to remove him 
from the planet... would ya do it?
sure... we all know you would.

with that in mind...
lets get back to the pertinent subject
matter, and not be hypocritical about
what we think liberty is, ok?
