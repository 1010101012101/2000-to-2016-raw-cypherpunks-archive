It was more of an educated guess. =C2=A0I knew that I hadn't been promoting=
 AP, yetsomebody was seemingly trying to bring it into reality, or saying t=
hey were. =C2=A0Themost likely scenario, given that this person had contact=

that happening, and to 'kill two birds withone stone', I threw that hot pot=
ato to Andy Greenberg. =C2=A0(I was not at all happy with=C2=A0Greenberg, w=
ho greatly misrepresented 'facts' about me in his book). =C2=A0 I figuredth=
at Greenberg wouldn't do anything with this contact, which would allow me t=

in hours, many dozen other=C2=A0articles appeared in other media, and in th=

I expected to, within a few weeks or months, read many articles publishing =
