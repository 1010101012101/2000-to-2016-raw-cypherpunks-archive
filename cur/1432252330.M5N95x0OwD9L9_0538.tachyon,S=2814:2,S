(Could be a lot of groups in the US.)  The best way to interactively
surf anonymously
is to find an unsecured WiFi net and kick back.   Use a forged MAC, and
watch your
driving habits.  The walls have eyes.

Stego is ok if the site is word of mouth (no DNS, no port 80) anyway,
kind of a
secret knock to get in the speakeasy.  But humans get compromised and
the B34ST
logs the site's traffic.

Stego is fine for placing an order with a dissident vendor for a few
drams, but a dissident wanting
mass meme infection needs to anonymously broadcast, and to everyone.
That SMS/ Sprint hack recently
posted strikes me as appealing...

(And we don't need no ex-navy dolphin to jack the bandwidth...)

Three minutes. This is it - ground zero.

the occasion?
