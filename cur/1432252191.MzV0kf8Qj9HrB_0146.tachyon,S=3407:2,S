Maybe not; the arousal mechanisms they're measuring may be too automatic,
not subject to conscious control.  Then again, there are yogis who can
run their intestinal peristalsis backwards supposedly, and methods
to subvert the visceral reactions that polygraphs measure.

Its well known that pupils dilate in response to thing you like
and contract when thinking or seeing something you don't.  You
can try this in a mirror.
