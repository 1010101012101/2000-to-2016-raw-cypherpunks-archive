We are grateful to agent faustine for her list of collaborators,copies of 
"assassination politics' and possibly(not by me)
anthrax/plutonium/unabombs will be in the post,soon,real soon.Females 
working in these places may have their heads shaved.The males will all 
die.Have a very carlyle christmas.Santa's INSLAW way.I PROMIS 
you.Halliburton new year.

"Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.TM.
