Yes; for naif readers note that the "grid" means that you don't worry
about wind as much
as a solid dish.  (The uwaves see the screen as solid, however.)  With
that much gain
(ie directionality) wind could mess with your (albeit brief) connection.

Its very important that you go *away* from your normal haunts if you use

this (esp. more than once) for attention-receiving activities.   (Any
mailbomber
would know this.)  And best to piggyback on a commercial AP, unless you
dislike
the individuals you are implicating...

Apologies for the pedanticism to regular opsec-clued readers.
