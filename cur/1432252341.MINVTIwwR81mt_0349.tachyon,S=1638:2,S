Researchers at the MIT Media Lab unveiled the Government Information
Awareness, or GIA, website
Friday. Using applications developed at the Media Lab, GIA collects and
collates information about
government programs, plans and politicians from the general public and
numerous online sources.
Currently the database contains information on more than 3,000 public
figures.

The premise of GIA is that if the government has a right to know
personal details about citizens, then
citizens have a right to similar information about the government.
