Has 'haven' for questionable sites sunk?

LAS VEGAS--A widely publicized 
project to transform a platform in 
the English Channel into a "safe 
haven" for controversial Web 
businesses has failed due to 
political, technical and management 
problems, one of the company's 
founders said.

Ryan Lackey, former chief technology 
officer of HavenCo, said on Sunday 
afternoon that he left the project 
because his business partners 
had become nervous about 
hosting objectionable material 
and were leading the company 
toward financial ruin, with only 
about six customers remaining.
