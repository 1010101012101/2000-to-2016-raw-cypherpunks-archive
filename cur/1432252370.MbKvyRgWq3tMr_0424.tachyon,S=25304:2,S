But without salting the hash it's more reversible than it has to be.
Another issue is the ignoring of proxy settings and therefore collection of
IP addresses either by Armory or by other actors.

Of course people are still hating. I think it's possible that the
overcollection was accidental. It is somewhat odd that the reason for the
accident was commercialism.
