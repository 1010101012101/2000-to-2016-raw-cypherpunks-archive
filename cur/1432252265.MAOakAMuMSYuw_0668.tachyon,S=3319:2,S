Ideally, we should organize an election so that the illiterate, the stupid, 
and the drunk will generally fail to vote correctly.  Unfortunately someone 
would then issue the handy dandy automatic party vote generator, and hand 
it out to the illiterate, the stupid, and the drunk, adding a bottle of 
cheap wine when handing it out to the drunk.
