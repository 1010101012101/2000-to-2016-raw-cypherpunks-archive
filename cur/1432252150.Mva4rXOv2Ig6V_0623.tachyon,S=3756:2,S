A high quality, very high velocity military plastic explosive.

Our C4 is supplied in bulk drums, in a slightly powdery form. Upon 
manipulation the material immediately consolidates into a rubbery 
fully plasticised mass which may be kneaded and pressed into any 
shape. The material has excellent mechanical and adhesive 
properties, and may be stretched into long strands without 
breakage.

In its original powdery form the explosive may be poured into 
charge containers, then pressed into intimate contact with the 
liner.

Substantial price discounts are available on full shipping 
containers (16 tonnes plus). Please enquire.
