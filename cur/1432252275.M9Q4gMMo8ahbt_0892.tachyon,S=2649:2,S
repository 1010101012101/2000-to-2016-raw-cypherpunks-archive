If you do not require interoperability with SMTP, cables communication
[1] does what you require b encryption and authentication are
transparent, and server issues can be ignored, since there are no
servers. Cables communication also has delivery verification and other
features. Note that PGP / S/MIME-type encryption is undesirable for
most users, since it ties authentication to non-repudiability [2].
