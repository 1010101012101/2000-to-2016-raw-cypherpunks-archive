Well put!

In fact, Macrovision creates problems for people, does very 
little to stop "theft of intellectual property". But what
it does do is negatively impact the base product, share out
a piece of the profits to an otherwise non-player, add
a layer of annoyance, and accomplish nothing of benefit
for the target, the end user, the one who pays the money.
