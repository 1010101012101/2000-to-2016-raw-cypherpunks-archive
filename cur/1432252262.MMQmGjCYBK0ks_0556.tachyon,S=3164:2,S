    Fuck that noise. If this is war it means I get to blow your stupid
ass away if you blow smoke in my direction.

   Fuck that shit too -- you really are showing your age, aren't you
old folks? You got a problem with archaic revival? As this little ditty
plays out, you will see (if you survive at all in your solitude, which
isn't too likely) that "society" will re-group into tribes (what you
call gangs, old man) and all that jive will be everywhere for tribal
identification, rank, or just plain beauty. 
   Where do you people get this weird crap from anyway?
