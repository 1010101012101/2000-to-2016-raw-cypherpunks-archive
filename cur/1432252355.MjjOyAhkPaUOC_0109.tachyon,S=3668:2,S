'Twisted reasoning' could lead to anything, so its not too useful
to use it as a constraint.  A stray bayonet-mount could
turn your code into assault software...

That being said: 

There are *no* tools which are useful *only* for powering down
government.  

File sharing tools are useful; that they also erode copyright is
collateral damage.  Anonymous systems are useful.
That you can build AP systems, or worse, spam with them, is collateral
damage.  
'Damage' of course implies a value system where copyright is good and AP is
bad.  
Side-effect is a more neutral term.

Besides, code *is* speech.  Though some men who wear black dresses
during office hours have trouble digesting that.
