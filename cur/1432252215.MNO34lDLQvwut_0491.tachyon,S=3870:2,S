 >>I'll know I'll regret responding to the mattdproffraptroll,

I hope not,it took long enough to lever you out from under your 
bridge.Sorry it took the flamethrower.

 >>but briefly: I am not affiliated in any way with the Cato Institute. I 
don't believe I've ever written anything for them; I am not an adjunct 
scholar/policy analyst for them; I've been in their building just once in 
the last five months or so. Most importantly, they say things with which I 
do not agree.<<

You plugged that appearance here,thats my beef with you declan.I think you 
should be blasted on this list for aligning in any way shape or form to a 
twisted conservative mob that manufacture consent for corporate 
polluters.We are cypher-PUNKS,not cypher shills.Its crypto-ANARCHY,not 
crypto-libertarianism.

 >>That said, they are a worthy, respectable, valuable, and valued think 
tank, and I always enjoy reading what they write.<<

They are worthless,low, liars for money,its enjoyable tracing their 
profoundly corrupt sources of finance.If you enjoy their literature theres 
something seriously wrong with you,declan,I thought you were an intelligent 
person.How DO you sleep?

 >>As for a "damming exposure," it's just another screed. Yawn<<

You are getting sleepy? WAKE UP AND SMELL WHAT YOUR SHOVELLING,SPORT! I 
wrote several posts to this list that you ducked liked a coward then when I 
shout to get your attention,this is the thanks I get.FUCK DECLAN,Im just 
telling you these things so you don't keep kidding yourself. WAKE UP! You 
are either with us or with them.

Your fellow PUNK for ANARCHY,mattd.
