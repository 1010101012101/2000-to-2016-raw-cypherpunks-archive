This is not meaningful speculation since the main point is of the story 
is not finding out who to blame, it is spreading FUD about the fallout 
of Ed's actions by spreading blatant lies. Which basically derails a 
developing dialog: Ed was right, there /was/ overreach/abuse and 
accounts of premeditated lying attributable to our Government(s) fine 
agencies.

It's fun to watch the government losing face by trying to cover it up.

What I saw was a five year old with his hand stuck in the cookie jar. 
Only the cookie jar is actually the privacy of my own home. No matter 
the fact that I extend my presence to locations around the globe by way 
of internets. I am not forgoing my rights to privacy when I directly 
communicate with others. The very same way I find those rights in the 
confines of my home.

If Snowden had zero copies and Greenwald/Poitras had the originals,
then any Russo-Chinese fiddling with those originals was the result
of having stolen them from Greenwald/Poitras, not Snowden.
