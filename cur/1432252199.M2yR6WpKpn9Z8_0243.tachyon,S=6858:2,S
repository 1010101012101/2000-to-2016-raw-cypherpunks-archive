I have to agree that these days I don't see elections, as currently 
performed, as being effective at representing the population.

Case in point, here in Ireland we have Proportional Representation, 
which helps to prevent a two-party system and means that we are more 
likely to achieve a voting outcome that satisfies (or dissatisfies) the 
most people; a compromise, instead of a strategically voted least-worst.

However, we still have the problem that only a wealthy person can run 
for office, in the same way that only a wealthy person can take the risk 
of "boot-strapping" a company or take any comparable risk. So, only 
wealthy people get represented, and thus regular or disadvantaged people 
get little representation.

Far better, I think, to take a statistically relevant sample of the 
population on a rolling basis: Liquid Sortition.

If I had my way, one of our houses of government would be pure liquid 
sortition, the other would be a form of liquid democracy, and instead of 
a president we'd call a large jury for each legislative change that 
might require constitutional oversight.

But I won't get my way. :)
