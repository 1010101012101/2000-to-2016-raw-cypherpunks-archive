There were actually TWO appeal filings by me; I perhaps got them out of order in my last note here, a moment ago.  This might have been the second one of them filing around the time of the "sentencing".  Because the District Court had ignored its loss of jurisdiction, I felt it appropriate to yet again appeal the "sentencing".
