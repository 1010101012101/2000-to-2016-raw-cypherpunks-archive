It sounds a bit like snake oil, especially since "nano" was mentioned.
I can't imagine this would do anything other than vanilla ferrite paint
on metal foil.

It is reasonably difficult (and expensive) to shield whole rooms though
(I've worked in one). Grounded chickenwire in walls doesn't even
begin to approach it.

If it has to be switchable, it has to be active. Sounds improbably
expensive and finicky, at least with today's technology.
