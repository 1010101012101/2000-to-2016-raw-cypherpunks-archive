You're assuming an offline cash system with embedded identity.  It is
more likely that initial digital cash implementations will be online.
By the time such systems come into widespread use (if ever) wireless
connectivity will be ubiquitous.  Offline cash really can't compete.
Attempting to trace, identify, catch and punish double spenders will
be overwhelmingly more expensive than simply checking directly that the
cash hasn't been spent before.

There are far more efficient offline systems than cut and choose.
You need to get past the A's and into the B's and C's in your protocol
list.  Check more recent work from Brands and Chaum.
