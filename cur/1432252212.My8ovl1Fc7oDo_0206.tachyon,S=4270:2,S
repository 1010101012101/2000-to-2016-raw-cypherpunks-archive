Ask that headless arab about the impermeability of handset-style
devices.   "MossadBell --reach out and touch someone"

If you want, epoxy the case closed.  Voila, instant embedded system.

[You can build the same amount of trust using a COTS pocket pc
as you can with a slicker dedicated gizmo.  Its easier to prototype
starting with COTS if you don't have an industrial design lab
at your disposal.]

Yep, ease of use is a real problem.

Getting anything into a cell handset is the Big Win, yep.

Heh, he wants a *disposable* secure cellphone sold from vending machines
on the street.  So do the chip makers ;-)
