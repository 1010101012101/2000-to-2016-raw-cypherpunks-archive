Um, just to point out the absolute obvious, if you're >DRIVING< you already 
have a power source, even if you have to use an inverter to power your 
notebook.  At that point you're not worried about worrying about spending a 
few miliamps on transmission here and there.  It doesn't matter at all 
whether or not there's a string of other "you's" ahead of you.   Having 
already paid for the tank of gas, the juice is free, and so should 
transmission - even routing of other users' data.

If you're in the woods, or at the beach, that's a different story.  :)
Ok, well, if you're at the beach, you could get a solar cell and geek away.

Yup, can't have a network without nodes.

In which case, you won't be to willing to transmit either since receiving 
costs you far less battery than transmitting.  In this case you're far more 
likely to store whatever you want to transmit for later - same as working 
"offline" with a mail user agent.
