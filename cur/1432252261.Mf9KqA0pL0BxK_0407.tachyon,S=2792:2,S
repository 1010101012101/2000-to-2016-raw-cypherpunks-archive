Unfortunate?  I don't know.  Tim's gone a little whacko over the last few
years, and it doesn't look like his meds are doing crap for him:

"Nigger, or Thief?"

Is there really a difference?

Thirty years ago, even more, I was prepared to give the negro a chance.
Now, so many years later, so many excuses later, so many crimes later,
I say we ought to either give passage back to Biafra and Ruwanda and
other hellholes for those negroes who request it, or charge those who
remain for the benefits of white civilization we gave them over the
past few hundred years.

And for those who have been on welfare, or AFDC, or WICC, or any of the
giveaway subsidies to the negro, they must pay back what they took from
working people, with interest, or be sent up the chimneys. Their
choice.

The negro has stolen from the European for way too long.
