Which is precisely why there is no reason these people should not have their
insurance at precisely the same rate as everybody else - you cannot foresee
whether any particular individual will get the disease. What can you say,
it's unfair and I hold fairness in high regard. In addition, I'm certainly
not saying we should make this happen legislatively. I just think people
should boycott unfair insurance companies and perhaps shun their clientele
and employees for behaving badly. Maybe refuse to treat them when they have
a stroke...

Here the concept of variable rates based on belonging to risk groups is, if
not unheard of, nevertheless much rarer than in the States. Hence, I see no
value in the parallel.

And my counter is, why do you think equal cost of health care is in any way
'additional'? I do think the end justifies the means.

It's really too bad they didn't know what sort of business they were getting
into when they started...

They should have made damn sure genetic defects are rare...

Not true, if the company only controls part of the market - in this case the
added expense can easily exceed the benefit. Consider the case with market
taken as the globe.

Who said anything about governments?

In the context of genetic defects, eugenics is pretty effective. If it can
be detected, it can be aborted.

Which is pretty much feel good medicine - in a couple of decades, constant
vaccination of people against flu may cause it to start killing people.
