This is a case of letting the perfect be an enemy of the good: it
ain't ever gonna happen.  People that write MUAs or word processors
or spread sheet programs or web browsers are good at and want to
write those programs. They aren't going to have the time or interest
in becoming expert enough in crypto to use it wisely.  So, with a few
exceptions, crypto is (and probably ought to be) done by wrapping the
application, or putting a new front-end (or back-end on it) or
encrypting the drive at the OS level.

Crypto and key management is hard (particularly if you do it well);
it just isn't realistic to expect that it will *ever* be designed in
as a matter of course.
