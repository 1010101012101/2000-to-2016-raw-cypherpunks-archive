There's a problem with this view...

It already does (TANSTAAFL), what you seem to be missing is WHO is doing
the paying. When the postman drops that mail in my mailbox it costs me
nothing. When they drop it in my email box it causts me cycles, and their
my cycles not the person sending the spam. When they send their probe out
to my mailer to determine it's configuration without permission that is
trespassing. It is the same as if they came onto my property to determine
how I configure my VCR. That the computer is accessible through a public
channel is as irrelevant to the issue as the fact that the street in front
of my house that connects with my driveway is public as well.

Then again, you may not mind people whom you don't know camping out in
your living room and knowing what sorts of video tapes you have and who
you watch them with.

Access <> Ownership
