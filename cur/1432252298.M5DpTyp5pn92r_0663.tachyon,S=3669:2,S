Folks,

Here's a Swiss military museum site:

http://www.cybershooters.org/morges_museum.htm

Here's what they say about Swiss firearms ownership:

One of the most common things you will find in Swiss homes, the SIG 90
assault rifle.  The Swiss Army comprises 450,000 men who are given their
service rifles and who have to complete a minimum of two weeks service each
year, serving from the age of 18 until they are 50 (this age will be dropped
to 45 soon).  After completing their service, the fully-automatic capability
of the rifle is permanently disabled, and the rifle is given back to the
former soldier who may keep it.  Soldiers are also issued a comprehensive
cleaning kit, three 20-round magazines, and a "corn-beef can" of 50 rounds
of 5.6mm ammunition, as well as a bayonet.  Swiss soldiers must practice
their marksmanship regularly under the terms of the Obligatory Rifle
Shooting Programme.  Switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun
ownership in the world, yet maintains a remarkably low homicide and armed
crime rate.

The part I like is that the wording suggests that the writer is surprises
that a population can have a lot of guns and "yet maintains a remarkably low
homicide and armed crime rate."  Duh.
