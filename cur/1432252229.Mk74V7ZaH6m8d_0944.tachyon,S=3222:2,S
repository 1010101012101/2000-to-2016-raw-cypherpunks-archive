I have a question for you c'punks.  If you wanted to generate some
bitmaps of text which would be difficult or impossible to OCR, but not
too difficult for humans to read, how would you do that?  Basically, I
want to create GIFs of text which can't be OCRed in a reliable way.
I've thought about some things: I can put in noise pixels, I can blur
the text, I can rotate, shear, and otherwise distort it.  Anything
else I should do?  Will these tricks work?

Thanks
