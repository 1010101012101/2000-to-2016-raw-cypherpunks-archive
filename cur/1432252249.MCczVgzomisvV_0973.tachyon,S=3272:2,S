As a business, you want to get paid.  As long as you are
sure of your money, what the hell business is it of yours
where I live, what name I'm currently registered under, or
who I'm screwing?

When I buy things with cash or silver, if they ask for ID
I leave or lie.  I think that people should be free to use
a pseudo for any non-fraudulent purposes.
