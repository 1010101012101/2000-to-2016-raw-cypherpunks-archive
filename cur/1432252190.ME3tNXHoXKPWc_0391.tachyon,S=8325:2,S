Here's what Wendy from California had to say about this remarkable pain
relieving product:

"My mom bought Super Blue Stuff and loves it. I have also used it and it
is pretty amazing. We have been in several car accidents and I have a
slightly crushed vertebrae in my neck and it the super blue stuff does
work after about five minutes. It gets kind of warm, has a nice smell, and
is very smoothing, nothing like over the counter creams. We have given it
to several friends and they use it regularly too. I would recommend it to
anyone!"
