4 hours later, this hasn't gotten back to me, my guess is that lne
didn't accept because I'm not subscribed to that node - there went
the neighborhood.  Apologies if lne is having a problem and this
hits the list twice - I couldn't resist adding to it a little.

Even more peculiar, the wrong turns taken when responding to an out-
of-context quote.  Just as an aside, didn't you find it ironic that
Tim told me of all people, to "Fuck Off"???

Why look at a utilization issue as an engineering problem?  Unless your
object is fitting square pegs to round holes.  Do you have pointy hair?

Behold my complete post (less .sig), and what I replied to:

     Including the "I have friends who want to kill all the Jews" type
     of remarks?  GIGO, yada.

     It's easy to stay on topic, or on a topic, it's another thing to be
     appropriate.  Tim is good, but easy improvement is within reach, as
     you sort of noted.

Perhaps it was Anonymous you should've referred to, instead of me.

Regardless,

Fuck Off.

Reeza!
