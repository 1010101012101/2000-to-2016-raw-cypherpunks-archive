As I said earlier, a court may very well find some Constitutional
issue or something else very serious about the appointment.  But
I would think that, in that event, there will be some other way
found to work around the necessity for an appointment.  Special
bill passed in the state legislature?  Who knows.

My original point still stands.  The voters should get what they
want, unless they want something clearly illegal.  That's a clear
principle in our pseudo-democracy.  Every principle has a point
where it must be compromised to appropriately coexist with other
principles.  But it is clear that if the voters have spoken,
there has to be a strong counter argument before their wishes can
be voided in effect (not just in procedure).

I am quite certain this principle will have a strong impact on
the outcome, should should the issue go to trial.

Well, if it is an unconstitutional election-appointment combination,
then technicalities *do* count, if only to keep some respect for that
tattered document alive.

I don't care much about that election, and it is big of Ashcroft to
step aside, but the law turns on what you dismiss as mere
"technicalities."
