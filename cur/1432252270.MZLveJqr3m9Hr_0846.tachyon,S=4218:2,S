Who's desirable effects? The 'market' is a statistical beast, it breaths
and lives on groups of individuals doing basically the same thing, only
with different colors or shapes. Why? Because people share many, many,
common needs and drives. The 'guiding hand' is human group psychology.
People are strange, and there are a lot of them. It is better that they
each be allowed to find their own way, than to make them all use one way.
At least then each has a hope of better times. The alternative is a 3 hour
symphony in G above Middle C for about 75 years.

You can until they create a strategy that is hyperbolic with respect to
competitors. Then the market monopolizes. The reality is that a market of
two choices is only marginaly better than a market of one choice. It does
not have the ecological variety that a more diverse atmosphere would
create.
