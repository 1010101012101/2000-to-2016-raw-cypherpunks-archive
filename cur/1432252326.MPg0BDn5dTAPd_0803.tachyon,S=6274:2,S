Explained it already 2 times, if anybody else asks, I'll be happy to do=

This matter is very relevant to me. I believe if somebody is saying "we=
 offer=20
encryption", the encryption should be actually, you know, protecting th=
e data.=20
As it stands now, the GCS encryptions doesn't protect the data from gov=
ernment=20
snooping, from a rogue admin that has access to the master key, and pro=
bably=20
from several other scenarios.

And the Google's rep saying "we do not provide the keys to the governme=
nt"=20
reeks of PR-speak and deception. Of course they do not provide the keys=
, they=20
can simply provide the cleartext, de-ciphered first via the master key.=

They are saying they use encryption, and with several keys/levels. They=
 are=20
saying that during the whole PRISM debate heating up, a debate mind you=
 that=20
has Google among the NSA cooperators. They are even claiming they are n=
ot=20
providing the keys to the government, so as to suggest even more strong=
ly that=20
they have cleaned up their act:

"A Google spokeswoman said via email the company does not provide encry=
ption
 keys to any government and provides user data only in accordance with =
the
 law."

When in fact -- as far as PRISM-related stuff is concerned -- they have=
 done=20
anything but.

No. Google SHOULD provide safe, privacy-aware services and encryption t=
hat=20
actually truly protects the data, or at least not claim to do so if the=
y have=20
no intention to.

Or, using your "let's turn the tables and see where that goes" method:
So Google CAN lie and deceive the users by claiming or suggesting to pr=
ovide a=20
level of service they have no intention of providing?

Nicely done. I see we have a Schopenhauer admirer. "The Art of Being Ri=
ght" is=20
a great little book indeed:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Being_Right

I'm just not sure if that's #8, #12 or #32. I'd go for #32, I guess.
