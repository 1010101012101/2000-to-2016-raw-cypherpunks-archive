And where is John Young? His last post I can find was on 11/2. 
Nothing since about the time the Bell raid happened.

(And his posting statistics were fairly uniform prior to this: a post 
or two every day, with very few long gaps.)

I was only half-joking that maybe Bell's and Young's work on tracing 
down those CIA safe houses in Bend, Oregon were getting him in 
trouble.

John, say it ain't so.
