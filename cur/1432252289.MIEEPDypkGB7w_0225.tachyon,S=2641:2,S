4 Jewish Web sites deemed 'terrorist'
By Jerry Seper
THE WASHINGTON TIMES

Four Internet Web sites operated by two extremist Jewish groups have
been
included by the State Department on its list of "foreign terrorist
organizations"  the first time the list has been extended to include
Internet sites.

     The four Web sites are: www.newkach.org, www.Kahane.org,
www.Kahane.net
and www.Kahanetzadak.com, the department said in a notice in the Federal

Register. They offer news, commentary and links to other sites of
interest to
followers of Meir Kahane.

The impact of the listing was not immediately clear, since all four
sites
exist in cyberspace.

The designation makes it illegal for persons in the United States to
donate
money or other material support to the Web sites. The three accessible
sites
yesterday included information on where contributions could be sent,
what
items could be donated and offered a number items for sale, including
pendants and books.
