Subject: [gsc] Trubanc Web Client Public Beta

I've been working since late July on Trubanc, an anonymous,
digitally-signed vault and trading system. Inspired by Patrick
Chkeroff's Loom.cc, but with digital signatures for security. The
first version of a web client is available for beta testing. Check it
out. Send me email to get a coupon with the usage tokens you need to
register.

Technical stuff

Protocol description: http://trubanc.com/plain-english.html

Client database details: http://trubanc.com/viewtext.php?file=doc/client.txt
Source viewer: http://trubanc.com/viewtext.php
Git archive: http://repo.or.cz/w/Trubanc.git

It's open source. Please review for security if you're inclined and  
able.

Mine is a US-based testing and development server only. Hopefully,
servers with real assets, hosted in financial-privacy-respecting
countries, will follow shortly, maybe run by some of you.
