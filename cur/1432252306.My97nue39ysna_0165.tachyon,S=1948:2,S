Well, no. This kind of commentary made folks on mailing lists like
these feel warm and fuzzy and made some other tech types realize what
was at stake. But Sen. Judd Gregg's proposal failed because of lack of
support from his colleagues and opposition from well-connected
industry lobbyists, not people writing about "GNU-Darwin" (probably
not one congresscritter knows what that means anyway, or cares).
