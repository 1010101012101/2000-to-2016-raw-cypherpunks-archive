No, I believe only one of the following situations can occur:

* Your laptop see and uses the name "yahoo.com", and the DNS server
  translate them into yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com.  If your laptop
  knows the DNSSEC root key, the attacker cannot spoof yahoo.com since
  it doesn't know the yahoo.com key.  This attack is essentially a
  man-in-the-middle attack between you and your recursive DNS server.

* Your laptop see and uses the name "yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com".
  You may be able to verify this using your DNSSEC root key, if the
  attackersdomain.com people have set up DNSSEC for their spoofed
  entries, but unless you are using bad software or judgment, you will
  not confuse this for the real "yahoo.com".

Of course, everything fails if you ALSO get your DNSSEC root key from
the DHCP server, but in this case you shouldn't expect to be secure.
I wouldn't be surprised if some people suggest pushing the DNSSEC root
key via DHCP though, because alas, getting the right key into the
laptop in the first place is a difficult problem.
