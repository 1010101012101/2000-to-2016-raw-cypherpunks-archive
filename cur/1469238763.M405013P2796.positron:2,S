I once read an article somewhere about the notion of the modern day ‘job’ and how they didn’t (all) exist in order to get actual ‘work’ done, but instead existed to prove ones ‘worth’ to society, in the form of what we call money.

Perhaps you have a link or title to this article? I’ve completely spaced the author, title, location of this piece, but i’ve mentioned it to friends a million times over, and am simply unable to locate…

Cheers,
Benjamin
