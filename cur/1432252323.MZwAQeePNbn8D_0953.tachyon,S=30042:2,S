              <p>Imagis has received preliminary acceptance to the Private Placement 
                from the TSX Venture Exchange. The net proceeds of the financing 
                will be used to strengthen Imagis' working capital position and 
                to carry out its strategic alliance with OSI Systems. Upon closing 
                the Private Placement, OSI Systems will own approximately 6% of 
                Imagis.</p>
              <p>OSI Systems, located in Hawthorne, California is a worldwide 
                leader in providing security solutions to airports, customs agencies, 
                correctional facilities, and governments. Under the terms of the 
                investment, OSI Systems and Imagis will develop and market biometric 
                and imaging hardware solutions for passenger and package screening 
                applications. The companies will leverage OSI Systems manufacturing 
                capabilities, global distribution channels, service organization, 
                and significant installed base of walk-through metal gates and 
                baggage x-ray systems at screening locations worldwide. Imagis 
                will contribute its considerable software expertise in facial 
                and image recognition technologies.</p>
              <p>&quot;We have selected Imagis as a strategic partner after an 
                extensive review of competitive technologies,&quot; said Deepak 
                Chopra, OSI Systems Chairman and CEO. &quot;Aside from the merits 
                of their system, they have made significant advancements both 
                in developing customer relationships as well as partnering with 
                Sanyo Semiconductor of Japan, to develop embedded systems utilizing 
                their advanced facial feature encoding. Walk-through metal gates 
                may represent a key location for facial recognition systems. All 
                passengers at an airport are required to pass through one and 
                capturing a consistent facial image is thus facilitated.&quot;</p>
              <p>Iain Drummond, Imagis' President and CEO, said &quot;Metal detectors 
                are the ideal location in an airport environment to detect undesirables 
                attempting to board airplanes. We believe this investment by OSI 
                Systems clearly supports Imagis leading position in the biometric 
                and imaging sector. OSI Systems' international presence and its 
                position as a leading supplier of metal detectors and x-ray scanning 
                systems worldwide will accelerate the integration of biometrics 
                as a tool in the battle against terrorism.&quot;<br>
