Hrm. Perhaps I should rephrase -- it's not not-viable because people
aren't so cold blooded that they'd use their own children as a sheild,
because the people in question can use other people's children, instead. 

And thanks, running a 7 sysadmin department was quite enough for me. I
already know humans are stupid.

I'm not completely sure, however, that the difficulties of getting things
done in large organizations kills the possibility of putting child care
centers in places that are likely terrorist targets as human sheilds. It
strikes me as a rather hard thing to argue either way -- organizations
vary as much as individuals do, in my experience.

Well, I suppose if a bunch of unionized employees there wanted a daycare,
this could be the case -- I think it would be doubtful that the union
would want a daycare for human shield purposes...maybe I'm
misunderstanding you, though...

You mean, you haven't noticed that this list *is* inhabited by a bunch of
loonies. Largely because insanity is the only sane reaction to an insane
world, I suspect.

You know, other than a somewhat vague 'try running a large organization
sometime' you never did explain why it wasn't viable.


Ph.(still not saying it is or was going on, just arguing the
possibility..hmmph, I need [another] hobby or something)
