There's a lot to be said for "simple", especially when it would 
require invasive (and expensive) monitoring to implement a per-
song download fee. 

BTW; I don't generally download music: I tried it and the sound 
quality of MP3 is crap.  I don't use windows; the engineering 
quality of the product is crap.  But I'd still rather pay taxes 
on hard drives than have snooping software installed in Windows. 
See, given the choice, I'd rather have taxes rather than snooping 
software accepted as "normal". -- At least for now.
