I think much more interesting is the question of government funded
anonymity tools.  The paranoid might think they're trying to drive
others out of business.

Is it even legal (in the US) to refuse to sell to the feds?  I know
that many companies have seperate entities (ie, Sun Federal Systems)
to avoid some of the more onerous restrictions, like needing to give
your best deal to the feds.
