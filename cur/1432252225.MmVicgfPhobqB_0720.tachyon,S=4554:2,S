True, but I'll bet almost anything that none of the plugins were written
by corporations expecting to get a return on their investment.

Some forms of creation require little in the way of up-front investment.
Others do. Consider movies. While some of the people involved get
to do creative work that they love, many don't, and they all have
to make a living somehow. Would the Key Grip, the Focus
Puller, or the Greensmen be willing to do their work for the sheer 
creativity of it all? I don't think so. The principle shooting for the
LOTR trilogy took over 18 months, in New Zealand. Do you think
they did it (just) for love?

Art forms which require large prior investments need some
form of remuneration beyond egoboo. Otherwise, they just won't
happen.
