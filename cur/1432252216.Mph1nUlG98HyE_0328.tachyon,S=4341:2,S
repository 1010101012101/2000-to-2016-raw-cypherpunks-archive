Saturday April 7 Cypherpunks Meeting in San Francisco.
The meeting will be at Moscone Center North,
The room number will be finalized in a couple of hours,
and we'll post signs at the door as well as sending out mail.

This is the FIRST Saturday of the month, because the RSA conference will be
the following week and many usual suspects from out of town will be around.
The meeting will start at 1pm, and will be followed by dinner afterwards.

Agenda: The primary agenda is discussion of the work people are doing,
projects, things you're playing with, current events in crypto and privacy.
If you'd like to give a talk, please contact Bill or DDT.

Directions:
	747 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103

 From BART or MUNI:
	Go to Powell Street station. Exit to 4th and Market Streets.
	Turn right on 4th Street. Walk two blocks south to Howard Street.
	Turn left, Moscone North will be on your left.
	For BART fare and schedule information, call the BART Hotline at 415.989.2278.
	Muni has multiple busses on 4th St, and the N-Judah on Market.

 From Caltrain:
	The San Francisco station is at 4th and King.
	You can take MUNI busses #15, #30, or #45 to 3rd and Howard,
	walk left on Howard, and Moscone North is on your right,
	or walk 1km north on 4th Street and turn right.

Driving: 4th st goes South, 3rd goes North, Howard goes West.

	hunt for parking on Folsom.

Parking: Official Parking Map http://www.moscone.com/images/misc/map.htm
	Parking in San Francisco is usually evil, and most former parking lots
	are now construction sites for over-priced dot-com offices.
	The most convenient parking is on Folsom between 5th and 4th,
	and there are in-building on Folsom between 4th and 3rd that are
	usually less expensive on weekends.




	Thanks! Bill Stewart,  bill.stewart@pobox.com, Cell +1-415-307-7119.
