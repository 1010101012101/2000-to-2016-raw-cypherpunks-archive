$5000 to just enter not guilty and likely pay an attorney to defend
it / accept dismissal may seem realistic. Thing is, that doesn't
leave much payout to defendant. And a fair number of those pleas
will be going to trial. That entails conviction risk, and regardless
of time dealt, that risk will carry a higher price.

Nonprofits, NGO's and crowdfunding appear to be a hot ticket these
days. Set one up, pick some jurisdiction somewhere, camp out on the
courthouse steps with your cash and attorneys in hand and see what
works.

Also, no figures were presented regarding cost per case in court
system. That matters too. You might be initially faster to jam it,
but don't be too sure they won't deputize and set up courts on the
front lawn in response.

You might have better success paying that $5k to vote however you
want them to for the next decade (say defunding things) after their
case/time as it might currently go is up. Or as someone said, run
nullification TV ads and mailing campaigns. Etc.

Not sure what this has to do with cypherpunks, unless you count
anonymous bitcoin donations from these CEO's, etc to your project.

Last, Joe crack dealer isn't newsworthy or profitable and will be
let go to make a docket slot for Joe CEO. So you might have trouble
getting funded from that sector without some rethink.
