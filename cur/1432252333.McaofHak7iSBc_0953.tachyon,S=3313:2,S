James F. CHOATE Jr. was interviewed regarding his knowledge and 
relationships with [...] "CYPHERPUNKS". CHOATE provided the following 
information: [...] Potentially dangerous or radical individuals known to 
CHOATE include: Jim MAY of California, who owns many guns and has lots of 
money; Jim BELL, known for his assassination politics and arrested for 
dumping a smelly chemical on an IRS office in California: and Greg Boils or 
Broils, known for his non-violent assassination politics.
Trei probably thought it must be OK then,if he thought at all...bring back 
necklacing.
