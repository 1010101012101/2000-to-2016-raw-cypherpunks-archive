Though NIST is being very secretive regarding the AES announcement,
they let the following rumors leak:

1. There is a single winner.
2. It is not an American design.

If so, this rules out MARS, RC6, and Twofish. But now comes the
third rumor:

3. The winner is not covered by any patent or patent claim
identified or disclosed to NIST by interested parties.

Assuming this is true, there is only one algorithm that is not
explicitly mentioned in Hitachi's claim: Rijndael.
