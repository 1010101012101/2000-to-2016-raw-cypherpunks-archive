Machines under *others* control?  I think we have different ideas of 
what "filters" mean.  I support the right of people to not see what 
they don't want to see, provided they can do it without restricting 
what the rest of us see.  If they can buy software that blocks out 
the things they don't want to see, and run it, good for them and 
good for the software provider.  

Ditto Privately owned libraries - but probably not public ones, at 
least not unless they also maintain an *UN*censored connection.

The v-chip does *not* prevent programming from reaching my home - 
it doesn't even prevent programming from reaching the homes of 
those who've willingly purchased and installed it, but it prevents 
stuff they'd find objectionable from being displayed on their 
screens.  This is their right.  After all, we're talking about 
*their* screens.
