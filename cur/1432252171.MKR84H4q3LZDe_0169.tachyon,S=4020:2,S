   Unless I am mistaken as to the Quantum Key Exchange process, only one
photon is ever transmitted, with a known orientation; the system doesn't
use entanglement AFAIK.
   I note also that, as QKE is *extremely* vulnerable to MitM attacks, a
hybrid system (which need only be tactically secure, not strategically
secure) can be used to "lock out" a MitM attacker for long enough that
his presence can be detected, without having to resort to a classical
but unblockable out of band data stream.  I think this is part of the
purpose behind the following paper:
http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/229.pdf
which I am currently trying to understand and failing miserably at *sigh*

I have yet to see an advantage to QKE that even mildly justifies the
limitations and cost over anything more than a trivial link (two
buildings within easy walking distance, sending high volumes of
extremely sensitive material between them)
