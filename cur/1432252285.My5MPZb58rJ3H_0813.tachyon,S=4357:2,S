There's a map in the URL in the original message. If that doesn't work, try:

http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=3915+Alpine+Road&city=Portola+Valley&state=CA&slt=37.380900&sln=-122.193900&name=&zip=94028-8001&country=us&BFCat=&BFClient=&mag=8&desc=&cs=9&newmag=7&poititle=&poi=


I make it to be about 2 miles south of the Stanford campus, along 
Alpine Road of course. The Stanford campus is itself quite large, and 
the walk from either the train station or the bus stop on El Camino 
Real is probably 30 minutes just by itself. Probably 4 miles on foot, 
total.

I would offer to give you a lift from either the train station or the 
bus stop, if you could say fairly precisely when you would arrive, 
except that I have no idea who you are. The nym "Lucky Green" I would 
make a point to pick up, but the nym
"alphabeta121@hotmail.com" will have to make other arrangements.

No offense intended.

I've been to Rossotti's, aka Zott's, aka the Alpine Inn many times. A 
real slice of collegiana.

(This should not be a promise that I will be at Zott's, aka the 
Alpine Inn, tomorrow. I may cancel, given the narcing that is 
becoming more the norm lately. Wouldn't want the expression of my 
opinions to result in a royal command to appear for incrimination at 
a show trial. Some country this has become, eh?)
