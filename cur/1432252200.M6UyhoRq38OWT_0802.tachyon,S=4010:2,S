Interesting that a friend at work asked the very same question 
when I made that assertion.  My answer:  They don't, but their 
handlers certainly do.

Your piece eloquently supports my opinion that this was a large-
scale, well-planned operation.  It was not planned solely by the 
perps who carried out the missions.  Their handlers will not want to 
be easily identified, lest they draw nuclear fire.  Therefore, all the 
easily discovered clues will doubtless be diversionary.
