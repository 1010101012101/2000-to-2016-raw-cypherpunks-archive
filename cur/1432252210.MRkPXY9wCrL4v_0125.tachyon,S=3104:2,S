I have two questions:

1) Does anyone have actual performance measurements of ZKS from when
it was operational/at peak, in terms of bandwidth, MTU, latency, and
jitter?  Is there a good way to quantify just how far from
"acceptable" it was?

2) Does anyone know of any existing reviews of bandwidth cost in
multiple jurisdictions (say, per 1Mbps CIR international terrestrial),
as well as electricity (per-Kwh)?

I'm working on a research report which shows the 5-10 year costs for a
few specific businesses in as many different locations and
jurisdictions as possible, since otherwise it's almost impossible to
quantify how much "better" a jurisdiction is than any other.

I know bandwidth costs for all the markets I actually care about, but
I'd like to flesh this out to account for more individual countries.
The problem is the bandwidth numbers I have are public as well as very
aggressively negotiated, and there's usually a spread of 3-10x between
them, so I'd rather not have to go through that level of negotiation
for any additional data points.

(some people have been sending to cypherpunks@metacolo.com
vs. cypherpunks@cypherpunks.metacolo.com, which was causing a bunch of
cypherpunks mail to accumulate in the catchall spool for
metacolo.com.  I just added cypherpunks and cypherpunks-* aliases in
the metacolo domain as well, so it should work, of which this is a
test)

(I also subscribed the al-qaeda node, and will probably finish setting
up the spamfiltered version of the list, as well as passing the back
archives through the same archiving software as current archives, and
search-indexing them, next time I get bored)
