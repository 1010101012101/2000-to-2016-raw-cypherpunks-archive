Yes, let's build FreedomBox 1.0 before we build FreedomBox 2.0.

In my mind, FreedomBox 1.0 is *boring* - it contains no new inventions, 
only oldfashioned Debian mechanisms served user-friendly boxed.  That in 
itself is a *big* milestone for FreedomBox.

FreedomBox 2.0 is *interesting* - it contains improved ways of doing 
stuff classic among geeks, and still does it user-friendly boxed.

FreedomBox 3.0 is *exciting* - it contains new inventions that have 
happened in parallel to our "boring" work, inspired by similar events 
that triggered the FreedomBox project but without that tough contraint 
of being user-friendly.  Of course when those inventions reach 
FreedomBox they _are_ provided user-friendly boxed - because that is a 
fundamental requirement of FreedomBox.

We (as in the developers on FreedomBox) HAVE to integrate everything 
needed for serving privacy-aware functionality in a user-friendly way. 
If we don't, we don't have a FreedomBox, but some other Debian-related 
tool or toy.

True that the web is about tying many systems together.

FreedomBox, however, is about protecting privacy, and here it does 
matter crucially to have enough functionality locally so as to not leak 
privacy when doing said hyperlinking.

FreedomBox is also about serving non-geeks, and here it is crucial that 
all interaction is user-friendly.  *ALL* interaction!  There is *no* 
admin, beyond the user herself/himself!

If you mean postponing user-friendliness till later, then it sounds to 
me like you are talking about something (quite exciting and worthwhile 
to try reach but) different from Freedombox.
