Ah, that's an excellent data point. Thanks! Yeah, multi-introducers are
a bit like RAID: you have more time to respond to a failure before the
whole system starts having problems.

Yeah, I think the worst-case attack is a DoS, where somebody floods
useless information into the system. The key is the signed
announcements: you may hear about all sorts of garbage, but you'll only
pay attention to announcements that are signed by someone you've
Invited, or who Invited you, or to whom you're transitively connected by
Invitations.

Ideally we can use that same criteria to limit how Announcements are
flooded, so unrecognized garbage (i.e. "a stranger") doesn't travel
further than a single node.

cheers,
 -Brian
