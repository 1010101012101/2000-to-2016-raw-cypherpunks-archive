Kansas City, Missouri, actually (IIRC, natch).

The whole point, really, isn't so much about the Presidential race as it
is to try to elect the dead guy to Congress.

I can only wonder at the logic of this whole charade -- yeah, the lines
were a little long (I'm in a St. Louis 'burb, and I voted at 8 a.m.), but
that's pretty much par for the course.

(The ridiculous can o' worms that one opens up, if it turns out the late
Mel Carnahan wins his election, is one that I'd rather not deal with at
one in the morning. :)
