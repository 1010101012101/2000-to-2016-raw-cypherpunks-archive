Then how come 84 unarmed people could not take aproximatly 4 people armed 
with razor blades.
Agh, I see it, they didn't have guns.  Shit 10 kids could probably rush and 
take an adult
armed with a knife, if they rushed him.  At least one terrorist was flying, 
so what thats
84 people against 3 armed with exacto razor blades?


Bullshit, they had knives and sharp instruments.  No matter how well
>trained a killer is, he is no match for odds like 120 to 4 against.

How about odds of 20 to 1 with the one having a knife....
