No, the threat model was outlined in a previous post. Consider some "agency" 
that has lots of resources and technologies, but also doesn't particularly 
want local authorities or (for instance) hotmail to know what they are 
doing. In general, this is going to make their operation much less 
intrusive, lower cost (ie, due to not having to physically send people) as 
well as avoiding a lot of legal hassles due to paper trails.

So I guess what I'm looking for is  way to be quite certain that someone 
(aside from Hotmail admin) is opening, reading, and closing my email 
'unobtrusively'.

Of course, once such an effort is detected, said agency may decide to follow 
a more intrusive investigative path, but this has practical consequences.

My home alarm system is probably a better example. If NSA, for instance, is 
going to bother entering your house and setting up whatever, I'd bet they'd 
LOVE to not bother with the local security/alarm company, because then 
there's a paper trail, people who might be a friend of the surveilled, and 
other 'local' issues. They're definitely going to use their fancy gadgets, 
etc..., to bypass the alarm system while making the alarm company 
everything's going just fine, or perhaps a battery has expired. In this case 
there'd be nothing to subpeona.

Therefore, if you suspect you're being surveilled, even if you can't secure 
anything you want might want to secure, you can at least force them to 
commit legally actionable acts, or else force them to give up their 
'phishing' expeditions.
