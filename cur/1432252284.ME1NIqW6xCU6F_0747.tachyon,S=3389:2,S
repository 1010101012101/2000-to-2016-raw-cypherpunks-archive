Nor did ORBS block you and your friends from sending or recieving 
email.  However you got on his list, he had no authority over 
anyone.  He just published it.  It was *other people* -- the ones 
running mail relays -- who chose to pick it up and use it as an 
information resource. 

If you are arguing against someone's right to configure their mail 
system to block a list of suspect domains, or their right to form 
a list of suspect domains in any damn way they choose including going 
out and reading the ORBS database, you are just wrong.
