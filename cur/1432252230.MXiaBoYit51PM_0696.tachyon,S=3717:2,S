That's simply a result of the dim-bulb "first past the post" voting system
that the US (and apparently you) endure. In countries with electorates that
are expected to be able to count past 1 (eg Australia) they have 
preferential voting and you can express your preferences from 1 to N
(the number of candidates).

This allows you to express your preference for libertarian drug-taking
pornographers and still have an equal impact on the outcome.
