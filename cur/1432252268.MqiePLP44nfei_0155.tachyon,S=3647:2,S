Some options:
- Bob is running the "We Mirror Everything" site
- "We Mirror Things for Politically Sympathetic People"
- "We Mirror Things Unless we sent you a rejection notice"
- (back when Cypherpunks believed there would be digicash Real Soon)
  Alice sent Bob some anonymous digicash to pay for storage
- Alice sent Bob some non-anonymous payment outside your threat model
- Bob is a random user running a Napster-like space-sharing protocol,
	and Alice sent mail to Bob1, Bob2, Bob3, etc. hoping one will work
- Bob used a non-direct response method, like posting a receipt
	to Bob's web site or some random free web site or Usenet
	acknowledging receipt of "Some-Package-ID" which isn't
	easily identifiable as being Alice's.  Maybe the Package-ID
	is a token sent along with the package, or a timestamp,
	or maybe your threat model doesn't mind the receipt being
	hash(hash(hash(hash(Package)))), which is some hash of the
	package-retrieval token.
