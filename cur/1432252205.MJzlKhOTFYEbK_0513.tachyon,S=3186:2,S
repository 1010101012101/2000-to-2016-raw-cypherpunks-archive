I noticed the guy down on his knees...was he expecting the 
Republicans to give him a bullet to the base of the neck?

Frankly, I think much of Al Gore's desperation comes from his 
realization that if he loses, he'll face prosecution for his treason 
vis-a-vis the Chinese. And, as someone pointed out to me recently, if 
Al Gore has no power, the Chinese won't need him around. In fact, he 
becomes a positive liability for them, in terms of testimony, plea 
bargains, memoirs, careless comments. They may choose to retire him 
with extreme prejudice.
