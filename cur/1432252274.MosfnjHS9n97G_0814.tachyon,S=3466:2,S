Interesting changes in this case means executive orders and increasing
harassment of individuals by financial institutions, which are
simultaneously forced to comply with continuously constricting
regulations and rules, not to mention a vague and exploding "watchlist"
of restricted entities and individuals.  To wit

a brief/pedantic overview of the first part of the second realmedia file
above:

If you transact with a major financial institution and the transaction
looks suspicious to them, SARs (Suspicious Activity Report) and CTRs
(Currency Transaction Report) can now be filed online (theoretically
meaning instantaneously) with FinCEN and Treasury's OFAC via forms
signed/encrypted with certificates issued by http://www.aces.att.com/.
It's called PACS (Patriot Act Communication System - isn't it cute -
http://pacs.treas.gov/index.jsp), and those reports are analyzed by the
Detroit data processing center of, you guessed it, the IRS.  Fun for the
whole family.  (incidental industry note for terms in the videos: BSA =
banking secrecy act, AML = Anti-Money Laundering)
