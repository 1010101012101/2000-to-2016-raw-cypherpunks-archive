BACKGROUND.LONGISH.The Best Enemies Money Can Buy
by Michael C. Ruppert 3:25am Wed Dec 19 '01

 From Hitler To Saddam Hussein to Osama bin Laden  Insider Connections and 
the Bush Familys Partnership with Killers of Americans
The article is very well researched and highly recommended, although a 
little too long in my opinion. I've read the book referred to in the 
article below, George Bush, The Unauthorized Biography by Webster G. 
Tarpley & Anton Chaitkin, and recommend it for anybody who wants to know 
the truth about George Bush senior.

Please read my published article about the cancer indu$try

Thank you and merry Christmas. Gavin Phillips.

FTW, Oct. 9, 2001 - Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center 
and the Pentagon, major media powerhouses and the increasingly influential 
alternative media alike have begun to focus attention on Bush family 
connections and a long history of arming and financing Americas attackers 
in the months and years prior to the outbreak of war. Recent stories in the 
Wall Street Journal (Sept. 27 & 28, 2001), ABC News (Oct. 1, 2001), as well 
as a host of reports from so-called alternative news sources have begun to 
focus attention on the Bush familys proffr-making role in creating and 
arming our enemies.

The following is a more comprehensive look at the documented history of 
these relationships that will also open some new avenues of inquiry for the 
press, Congress and the American people.

In a world now filled with biowarfare agents, backpack nuclear devices, and 
chemical weapons like Sarin gas -- where there are people in many countries 
with reasons to oppose the United States -- the Bush Administration is 
following predictable strategies in a way that redefines the concept of 
brinksmanship. Human survival may depend upon the will and the ability of 
both the Congress and the press to focus on these relationships and to take 
appropriate action. Moreover  and I am not the first to say this  if a 
national security priority is to seize the financial assets of those who 
support terrorists, then perhaps we should start right here at home.

--- Adolph Hitler Meticulous research, including U.S. government records 
from the era, along with contemporaneous news stories from the New York 
Times and other papers is presented in the 1992 book entitled, George 
Bush, The Unauthorized Biography by Webster G. Tarpley & Anton Chaitkin, 
Published by The Executive Intelligence Review and located at 
http://www.tarpley.net/bushb.htm. The following is sourced entirely from 
Chapter II of this essential work. [Note: Although FTW does not always 
agree with conclusions reached by the Executive Intelligence Review, or its 
founder Lyndon La Rouche, we have never found a single flaw in any of their 
factual research. History is history, no matter who presents it. And this 
history is essential to understanding our era.]

George W. Bushs grandfather, Prescott Bush, was the Managing Director of 
the investment bank Brown Brothers, Harriman from the 1920s through the 
1940s. It was Brown Brothers, in conjunction with Averell Harriman, the 
Rockefeller family, Standard Oil, the DuPonts, the Morgans and the Fords 
who served as the principal funding arm in helping to finance Adolph 
Hitlers rise to power starting in 1923. This included direct funding for 
the SS and SA channeled through a variety of German firms. Prescott Bush, 
through associations with the Hamburg-Amerika Steamship line, Nazi banker 
Fritz Thyssen (pronounced Tee-sen), Standard Oil of Germany, The German 
Steel Trust (founded by Dillon Read founder, Clarence Dillon), and I.G. 
Farben, used the Union Bank Corporation to funnel vast quantities of money 
to the Nazis and to manage their American interests. The profits from those 
investments came back to Bush allies on Wall Street. Thyssen is universally 
regarded as having been Hitlers private banker and ultimate owner of the 
Union Bank Corporation.

Early support for Hitler came from Prescott Bush through the 
Hamburg-Amerika Steamship line -- also funded by Brown Bothers -- that 
funneled large sums of money and weapons to Hitlers storm troopers in the 
1920s.

According to Tarpley and Chaitkin, In May 1933, just after the Hitler 
regime was consolidated, an agreement was reached in Berlin for the 
coordination of all Nazi commerce with the U.S.A. The Harriman 
International Company was to head a syndicate of 150 firms and 
individuals, to conduct all exports from Hitler Germany to the United States.

Furthermore, a 1942 U.S. government investigative report that surfaced 
during 1945 Senate hearings found that the Union Bank, with Prescott Bush 
on the board, was an interlocking concern with the German Steel Trust 
that had produced:

- 50.8% of Nazi Germanys pig iron

- 41.4% of Nazi Germanys universal plate

- 36% of Nazi Germanys heavy plate

- 38.5% of Nazi Germanys galvanized sheet

- 45.5% of Nazi Germanys pipes and tubes

- 22.1% of Nazi Germanys wire

- 35% of Nazi Germanys explosives

The business relationships established by Bush in 1923 continued even after 
the war started until they became so offensive and overt as to warrant 
seizure by the U.S. government under the Trading with the Enemy Act in 1942.

In 1942, Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the government took over 
Union Banking Corporation, in which Bush was a director. The U.S. Alien 
Property Custodian seized Union Banking Corp.s stock shares

 all of which shares are held for the benefit of members of the Thyssen 
family, [and] is property of nationals of a designated enemy country.

On October 28, the government issued orders seizing two Nazi front 
organizations run by the Bush-Harriman bank: the Holland-American Trading 
Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation.

Nazi interests in the Silesian-American Corporation, long managed by 
Prescott Bush and his father in law George Herbert Walker, were seized 
under the Trading with the Enemy Act on Nov. 17, 1942 These seizures of 
Bush businesses were reported in a number of American papers including The 
New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

Prescott Bush went on to become an influential Republican Senator from 
Connecticut who went on to be a regular golfing partner of President Dwight 
Eisenhower. His attorneys were the lawyers John Foster and Allen Dulles, 
the later became the CIA Director under Eisenhower.

Saddam Hussein

After becoming President in January 1989, Prescott Bushs son, George 
Herbert Walker Bush  father of our current President  authorized a series 
of programs that not only armed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein but also 
provided him with technology that assisted in his development of chemical 
weapons like Sarin gas, and biological weapons, which he still possesses. 
Apologists for Bush (the elder) say that, after the Iran-Iraq War of the 
1980s left the region unstable, he was just trying to establish a new 
balance of power. Not so. Bush directives and policies, including 
relationships with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), 
and the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) were directly and deliberately 
responsible for creating the army the U.S. fought in 1991.

A story by Russ W. Baker, in the March/April issue the Colombia Journalism 
Review (CJR), provided the most compelling overview of Iraqgate that I have 
seen.

ABC News Nightline opened last June 9 with words to make the heart stop 
It is becoming increasingly clear, said a grave Ted Koppel, that George 
Bush, operating largely behind the scenes throughout the 1980s, initiated 
and supported much of the financing, intelligence, and military help that 
built Saddams Iraq into the aggressive power that the United States 
ultimately had to destroy

Why, then, have some of our top papers provided so little coverage? Baker 
poignantly asks.

 The result: readers who neither grasp nor care about the facts behind 
facile imagery like The Butcher of Baghdad and Operation Desert Storm. In 
particular, readers who do not follow the story of the Banca Nazionale del 
Lavoro, which apparently served as a paymaster for Saddams arms buildup, 
and thus became a player in the largest bank-fraud case in U.S. history.

Complex, challenging, mind-boggling stories (from Iran-Contra to the S&L 
crisis to BCCI) increasingly define our times: yet we dont appear to be 
getting any better at telling them

Much of what Saddam received from the West was not arms per se, but 
so-called dual-use technology -- ultra sophisticated computers, armored 
ambulances, helicopters, chemicals, and the like, with potential civilian 
uses as well as military applications. Weve learned that a vast network of 
companies, based in the U.S. and abroad, eagerly fed the Iraqi war machine 
right up until August 1990, when Saddam invaded Kuwait.

And weve learned that the obscure Atlanta Branch of Italys largest bank, 
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, relying partly on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed 
loans, funneled $5 billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. Some 
government-backed loans were supposed to be for agricultural purposes, but 
were used to facilitate the purchase of stronger stuff than wheat. Federal 
Reserve and Agriculture department memos warned of suspected abuses by 
Iraq, which apparently took advantage of the loans to free up funds for 
munitions. U.S. taxpayers have been left holding the bag for what looks 
like $2 billion in defaulted loans to Iraq.

 In fact, we now know that in February 1990, then Attorney General Dick 
Thornburgh [appointed by George H.W. Bush] blocked U.S. investigators from 
traveling to Rome and Istanbul to pursue the case

 As New York Times columnist William Safire argued last December 7, 
Iraqgate is uniquely horrendous: a scandal about the Systematic abuse of 
power by misguided leaders of three democratic nations [The U.S., Britain, 
and Italy] to secretly finance the arms buildup of a dictator.

While Democrat Henry Gonzales, Chairman of the House Banking Committee 
during the period, stood as the lone voice from the wilderness in raising 
alarms about Bushs obvious corruption, the rest of the Congress sheepishly 
ignored all the signs demanding immediate action. Gonzales voice 
reportedly fell silent after his empty car was machine-gunned in a 
Washington suburb in what passed for a drive-by shooting.

The CJR continues: Meanwhile, The Village Voice published a major 
investigation by free-lancer Murray Waas in its December 18, 1990 issue 
That American troops could be killed or maimed because of a covert 
decision to arm Iraq, Waas wrote, is the most serious consequence of a 
U.S. foreign policy formulated and executed in secret, without the advice 
and consent of the American public

The L.A. Times, on Feb 23, 1992, dug deep enough to find secret National 
Security Decision Directives by the Bush Administration in 1989 ordering 
closer ties with Baghdad and paving the way for $1 billion in new aid. The 
Times series, co-authored with Waas, emphasized that, buried deep in a 
1991 Washington Press piece  that Secretary of State James Baker, after 
meeting with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz in October 1989, intervened 
personally to support U.S. government loans guarantees to Iraq.

Bakers CJR report also noted, On October 3, the [Wall Street] Journal 
reported [BNL official Christopher] Drogouls assertion that the director 
general of Iraqs Ministry of Industry and Military Production had told 
him, We are all in this together. The intelligence service of the U.S. 
government works very closely with the intelligence service of the Iraqi 
government. Three weeks later, the Journal reported that [Henry] Gonzales 
produced a phone-book-sized packet of documents showing the involvement 
of U.S. exporting firms The documents mentioned one which designed parts 
for Iraqs howitzers and was financed through BNL

In the wake of highly suspicious anthrax outbreaks in Florida, just miles 
from where several of the WTC suicides pilots trained, we add one final 
note. In his 1998 book "Bringing the War Home" author William Thomas 
writes,  Under that same [weapons transfer] program, 19 containers of 
Anthrax bacteria were supplied to Iraq in 1988 by the American Type Culture 
Collection company, located near Fort Detrick, MD, the site of the US 
Army's high security germ warfare labs.

The Carlyle Group, the Bushes and bin Laden

The warnings about the Carlyle Group, the nations 11th largest defense 
contractor, and the Bushes came long before the World Trade Center attacks. 
The Carlyle Group is a closely held corporation, exempt, for that reason, 
from reporting its affairs to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Little is known of what it actually does except that it buys and sells 
defense contractors. As of October 4, 2001, it has removed its corporate 
web site from the World Wide Web making further investigation through that 
channel impossible. Its Directors include Frank Carlucci, former Reagan 
Secretary of Defense; James Baker, former Bush Secretary of State; and 
Richard Darman, a former White House aide to Ronald Reagan and Republican 
Party operative.

On March 3, 2001, just weeks after George W Bushs inauguration, the 
conservative Washington lobbying group Judicial Watch issued a press 
release. It said:

(Washington, D.C.) Judicial Watch, the public interest law firm that 
investigates and prosecutes government abuse and corruption, called on 
former President George Herbert Walker Bush to resign immediately from the 
Carlyle Group, a private investment firm, while his son President George W. 
Bush is in office. Today's New York Times reported that the elder Bush is 
an "ambassador" for the $12 billion private investment firm and last year 
traveled to the Middle East on its behalf. The former president also helped 
the firm in South Korea.

The New York Times reported that as compensation, the elder Bush is 
allowed to buy a stake in the Carlyle Group's investments, which include 
ownership in at least 164 companies throughout the world (thereby by giving 
the current president an indirect benefit). James Baker, the former 
Secretary of State who served as President George W. Bush's point man in 
Florida's election dispute, is a partner in the firm. The firm also gave 
George W. Bush help in the early 1990's when it placed him on one of its 
subsidiary's board of directors.

"This is simply inappropriate. Former President Bush should immediately 
resign from the Carlyle Group because it is an obvious conflict of 
interest. Any foreign government or foreign investor trying to curry favor 
with the current Bush Administration is sure to throw business to the 
Carlyle Group. And with the former President Bush promoting the firm's 
investments abroad, foreign nationals could understandably confuse the 
Carlyle Group's interests with the interests of the United States 
government," stated Larry Klayman, Judicial Watch Chairman and General 
Counsel.

"Questions are now bound to be raised if the recent Bush Administration 
change in policy towards Iraq has the fingerprints of the Carlyle Group, 
which is trying to gain investments from other Arab countries who [sic] 
would presumably benefit from the new policy," stated Judicial Watch 
President Tom Fitton.

Judicial Watch noted that even the Clinton Administration called on the 
Rodham brothers to stop their business dealings in [The former Soviet 
Republic of] Georgia because those dealings started to destabilize that 
country.

Since the WTC attacks the Wall Street Journal has reported (Sept. 28, 2001) 
that, George H.W. Bush, the father of President Bush, works for the bin 
Laden family business in Saudi Arabia through the Carlyle Group, an 
international consulting firm. The senior Bush had met with the bin Laden 
family at least twice in the last three years  1998 and 2000 -- as a 
representative of Carlyle, seeking to expand business dealings with one of 
the wealthiest Saudi families, which some experts argue, has never fully 
severed its ties with black sheep Osama in spite of current reports in a 
mainstream press that is afraid of offending the current administration.

The Nation, on March 27, 2000  in a story co-authored by David Corn and 
Paul Lashmar  wrote, In January former President George Bush and former 
British Prime Minister John Major paid a social call on Saudi Arabian Crown 
Prince Abdullah This story confirms at least one meeting between the 
elder Bush and Saudi leaders, including the bin Ladens. That the bin Ladens 
attended this meeting was confirmed in a subsequent September 27, 2001 Wall 
Street Journal (WSJ) story. The January 2000 meeting with the bin Ladens 
was also later confirmed by Bush (the elders) Chief of Staff Jean Becker, 
only after the WSJ presented her with a thank you note sent by Bush to the 
bin Ladens after that meeting.

James Baker visited the bin Ladens in 1998 and 1999 with Carlyle CEO Frank 
Carlucci.

The WSJ story went on to note, A Carlyle executive said that the bin Laden 
family committed $2 million through a London investment arm in 1995 in 
Carlyle Partners II Fund, which raised $1.3 billion overall. The fund has 
purchased several aerospace companies among 29 deals. So far, the family 
has received $1.3 million back in completed investments and should 
ultimately realize a 40% annualized rate of return, the Carlyle executive 
said.

But a foreign financier with ties to the bin Laden family says the 
familys overall investment with Carlyle is considerably larger

In other words, Osama bin Ladens attacks on the WTC and Pentagon, with the 
resulting massive increase in the U.S. defense budget have just made his 
family a great big pile of money.

More Bush connections appear in relation to the bin Ladens. The WSJ story 
also notes that, During the past several years, the [bin Laden] familys 
close ties to the Saudi royal family prompted executives and staff from 
closely held New York publisher Forbes, Inc. to make two trips to the 
family headquarters, according to Forbes Chairman Caspar Weinberger, a 
former U.S. Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration. We would 
call on them to get their view of the country and what would be of interest 
to investors.

President G.H.W. Bush pardoned Weinberger for his criminal conduct in the 
Iran-Contra scandal in 1989.

Our current President, George W. Bush has also had -- at minimum -- 
indirect dealings with Carlyle and the bin Ladens. In 1976 his firm Arbusto 
Energy was funded with $50,000 from Texas investment banker James R. Bath 
who was also the U.S. investment counselor for the bin Laden family. In his 
watershed 1992 book, The Mafia, The CIA and George Bush, award winning 
Texas investigative journalist Pete Brewton dug deeply into Baths 
background, revealing connections with the CIA and major fraudulent 
activities connected with the Savings & Loan scandal that took $500 billion 
out of the pockets of American taxpayers. A long-time friend of George W. 
Bush, Bath was connected to a number of covert financing operations in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, which also linked to bin Laden friend Adnan Khashoggi. 
One of the richest men in the world, Khashoggi was the arms merchant at the 
center of the whole Iran-Contra scandal. Khashoggi, whose connections to 
the bin Ladens is more than superficial, got his first business break by 
acting as middle-man for a large truck purchase by Osama bin Ladens older 
brother, Salem.

Another key player in the Bush Administration, Deputy Secretary of Defense 
Richard Armitage, left his post as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the 
Reagan Administration after a series of scandals connected to CIA 
operatives Ed Wilson, Ted Shackley, Richard Secord and Tom Clines placed 
him at the brink of criminal indictment and jail. Shackley and Secord are 
veterans of Vietnam operations and have long been linked to opium/heroin 
smuggling. The Armitage scandals all focused on the illegal provision of 
weapons and war materiel to potential or actual enemies of the U.S. and to 
the Contras in Central America.

Armitage, a former Navy SEAL, who reportedly enjoyed combat missions and 
killing during covert operations in Laos during the Vietnam War, has never 
been far from the Bush familys side. Throughout his career, both in and 
out of government, he has been perpetually connected to CIA drug smuggling 
operations. Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a 1995 Washington Post 
story, called Armitage, my white son. In 1990, then President Bush 
dispatched Armitage to Russia to aid in its transition to capitalism. 
Armitages Russian work for Bush has been frequently connected to the 
explosion of drug trafficking under the Russian Mafias, which became 
virtual rulers of the nation afterwards. In the early 1990s Armitage had 
extensive involvement in Albania at the same time that the Albanian ally, 
Kosovo Liberation Army was coming to power and consolidating its grip, 
according to The Christian Science Monitor, on 70% of the heroin entering 
western Europe. [See FTW Vol. II, No 2  April 24, 1999]

Armitage and Carlucci are both Board Members of the influential Washington 
think tank, the Middle East Policy Council.

The connections continue with Vice President Dick Cheney. Amongst the 
multitude of oil pipeline construction running through the new war zone is 
one project  according to a Sept. 19, 2001 Wall Street Journal story  a 
joint venture in which the bin Laden family joined with the construction 
firm H.C. Price. A researcher named Phoenix, writing for the Internet 
news site Rumor Mills News Agency located at www.rumormillnews.com, 
reported that Price subsequently changed its name to Bredero Shaw, Inc. and 
is now owned by a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corporation, Dresser 
Industries. It was Dresser industries that gave George H.W. Bush his first 
post war job in 1948. A check of the relevant corporate web sites has 
confirmed this.

Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as Secretary of Defense during 
Desert Storm, directing the campaign against Saddam Hussein, was 
Halliburtons CEO until last years election.

And, according to a 2000 story from Harpers Magazine, in 1990 our current 
President, through a position as a corporate director of Caterair, owned by 
the Carlyle Group  at a time when the bin Ladens were invested in Carlyle 
 had additional connections to the bin Laden family. In addition, on March 
1, 1995, when George W. Bush was Texas governor and a senior Trustee of the 
university, the University of Texas Endowment voted to place $10 million in 
investments with the Carlyle Group. As to how much of that money went to 
the bin Ladens we can only guess. But we do know that there is a long 
tradition in the Bush family of giving money to those who kill Americans.

Now, as the people of America are beginning to awaken to what is really 
being unleashed upon them, as a few brave souls are asking whos going to 
get all the money the Bush Administration is borrowing from government 
coffers and whos going to pay for it - the above history is more than 
ominous.

Considering that during the 1980s, under the pretext of fighting a 
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua that never once launched an attack on the 
U.S., these same people oversaw an explosion in U.S. cocaine consumption 
that went from 80 metric tons in 1979 to 600 metric tons in 1989 - 
considering that the CIA trained and equipped death squads that tortured 
and murdered hundreds of thousands of people from Guatemala to Panama  
considering that these same people have brutalized Iraq, leaving portions 
of it radioactively contaminated by depleted uranium for the next 4 billion 
years and causing a fivefold increase in the number of childhood leukemia 
cases amidst a starving population, one can only wonder what they will 
produce for the world now given the context of the World Trade Center attacks.
