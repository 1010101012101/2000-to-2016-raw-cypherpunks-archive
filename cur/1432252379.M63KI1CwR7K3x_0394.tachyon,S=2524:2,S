There are Castor plants on the Central Expresway
north of Santa Clara.  Clearly within your grasp.
And that lye you supposedly use to clear your
drains, yeah right.

So, that tin-flouride in your so-called toothpaste is for
apatite-strengthening?  Yeah, right.  This boy was
on the same terrorist mailing list as a known
chem-terrorist, and IRS-unslave JBell.  And
known antisocialite, JY.

And you probably have isopropanol in your
so-called "bathroom".  Lithium metal in so-called
"batteries".  Speed-precursors in so-called
"decongestants".  Radioisotopes in so-called
"salt-substitutes".   And allah knows how many
Ca-illegal rice flails.
