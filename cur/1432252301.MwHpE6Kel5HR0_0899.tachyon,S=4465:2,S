I'm not sure what you mean when you put person in quotes like that.

Yes, there have been some successful criminal cases against copyright 
infringers - the legislation of particular interest was called the "No 
Electronic Theft Act" (UCITA is mostly concerned with licensing details, 
not piracy per se).

A self-congratulatory press release from the US DOJ after the first NETA 
prosecution in 1999 can be found at 
<http://www.cybercrime.gov/netconv.htm>; there have been other arrests, 
which, like most federal prosecutions (and, indeed, most prosecutions) were 
resolved with guilty pleas, not trials, so there weren't exciting Slashdot 
stories to read.

Yes. See

<http://www.techtv.com/news/hackingandsecurity/story/0,24195,3341992,00.html>
<http://www.bsa.org/usa/press/newsreleases/2000-02-08.196.phtml>

for examples if you're talking about professional pirates - if what you 
mean is "Will I get arrested if I install the same copy of Microsoft Office 
on 3 or 4 computers?" the answer is "No", but if those 3 or 4 computers are 
at a workplace, and employees learn of the copying and are later laid off 
or fired or otherwise become disgruntled, there's a modest chance that 
they'll exact some revenge by reporting the company to the SPA/BSA, who 
send grouchy letters and threaten audits, and actually do them once in 
awhile, which tend to be embarassing and disruptive and expensive.

5000 dead in NYC? National tragedy.
1000 detained incommunicado without trial, expanded surveillance? National 
disgrace.
