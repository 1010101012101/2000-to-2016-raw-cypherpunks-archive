Any paper that seriously quotes the Rimm "study" and R.U. Siris is suspect.

OTOH, there certainly has been another attempt by government
to villify crypto users with the recent spate of articles on Osama
bin Oceania and other terrorists supposed use of crypto and stego.
The Red scare of the 50s was also to a large extent promoted and fanned
into flame by elements of the government.  While there isn't a "moral
boundary crisis" amongst the general public about crypto, there is an
attempt at "vilification" and "patterned labelling" of crypto users by
the government.  And many cypherpunks have predicted the government causing
events similar to "crystallization of the crisis through a dramatic act"
and "appropriation of the appropriate social apparatus and suppression
of critique" of crypto users by the government.
(However, few of those beleive that "and finally restoration of a normal
situation" would then occur.)

The paper doesn't mention the political aspects of either of its
examples (another of it's flaws).  If you can think of "mass hate"
as a politically-motivated inflaming of the masses fears, then
the steps that it describes are remarkably similar to the expected
political response to crypto-anarchy.
