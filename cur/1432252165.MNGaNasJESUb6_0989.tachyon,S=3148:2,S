It was in decline for years before it was taken over by Murdoch and
the circulation has increased greatly under his ownership.

Murdoch revitalised the entire UK newspaper industry by destroying the
stranglehold of the print unions who had prevented the production of
The Times for several months in the late 1970s.

Print unions also at this time had censored newspapers by refusing to
print articles they didn't like.

The Times behaved poorly in this matter but I don't think it is an
instrument of government propaganda.  

Not in the sense the BBC is.
