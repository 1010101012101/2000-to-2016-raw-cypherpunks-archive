Who is providing the javascript? The site? The NSA? Then it can send a
NIL-cipher that effectively transmits the single password in a
recoverable way to the server. It would be unnoticable to the user.

Don't assume people will do anything intelligent. Tehy won't! We should
protect people even when they try to do stupid things. Security and
privacy must be standard and be reliable to be trusted upon.

You hit the nail on the head. A reliable syncing agent provides the
seamless user experience and protects against a loss of a private key
(that's needed to prove ownership of the certificate).

Browsers that don't support this syncing will find themselves as
roadkill of the ubiquitous encryption age. They will adapt or die.
