Methinks you are conflating "elected representation" with "democracy". Election of tenured representatives is only one (failure) mode of democracy, one so terrible the old Athenians likened to oligarchy.

Other modes exist: some have been extensively stress tested, such as sortition (Athens). Others haven't seen as much testing because they aren't really possible to implement without modern networking, and even so require very careful implementation, such as liquid/direct democracy without tenure.

Saying "democracy doesn't work" is meaningless. Democracy means, in ideal, "rule by the governed". If your examples don't fit that criteria, they're not really democracies, just as the USSR wasn't really socialism, England isn't really monarchism, and The Republic of Ireland (not currently concerning itself with matters of the res publica/ public interest) isn't really a Republic.
