Spam.

people are continually abandoning old addresses.

Of course it does not help that the cypherpunks list itself under 
permanent massive spam attack from two hostile subscribers.

I have found a wonderful free, highly effective, spam filter   K9, 
from Keir.net.  Everyone should use it,  I expect the medium will 
recover, when everyone uses it or something similar.
