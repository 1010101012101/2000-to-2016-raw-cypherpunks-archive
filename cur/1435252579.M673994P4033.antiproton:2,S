I was at the international open data conference a few weeks ago, and caught
something similar coming out of Edmonton, AB, Canada. They basically feed a
bunch of data sets into the system, and over the course of a few days, a
"rule inducer" generates a bunch of interesting geographic rules that
correllate with certain types of crime. Then the city tries to make sense
of the complex rules and tease apart correlation and causation.
