And what will happen if and when TLAs decide the best way to undermine 
confidence in upstart, anarchic extra-governmental banks who haven't 
been paying bribes and taxes for generations, like some Swiss banks, 
etc. is to hack them, drain the accounts, or at least shut them down for 
distressing amounts of time?

Will Interpol do anything when HMRG or POTUS was behind the attack?

And considering that CERT wants to be notified first of any identified 
weaknesses, and presumably they and others in HomeSec and other BlackOps 
TLAs know weaknesses not yet publicized or fixed, wanna bet whether they 
could attack many of the upstart offshore banks?

You have just now realized that the Sealand platform is minimally 
staffed?  We heard this a couple of years ago, straight from people who 
ought to know. Seems to me that you have not done due diligence....

(I mean, how can Ryan be on the platform and also be on his way to 
Burning Man? (As an example...I haven't heard from Ryan in a long while, 
but I know that at one time he was administering the Sealand routers and 
boxes remotely.)

This will not be the last such attack. Nor could it be expected to be.

Banks have been robbed, blackmailed, threatened, and even burned for 
thousands of years. If digital banking (in its various forms) is 
successful at all, it will be attacked.

Some will try to attack these banks because that's where the money is, 
as Willie Sutton used to say. Others will attack because of the threat 
the digital banks pose, to other banks, to tax collectors, to the status 
quo. For this second class of attackers, disrupting or tarnishing the 
reputation of the operation is enough.

Much more could be said on this.
