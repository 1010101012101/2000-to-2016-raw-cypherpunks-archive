Are you sure about that?  (*.com and *. being valid).  I thought the MITM
boxes were loaded with a sub-CA cert - a cert with a bit set authorizing it
to generate certs for sites, some of the smaller CAs are not directly in the
trusted browser databases, and have bought sub-CA certs from CAs that are.

Then what actually happens in the MITM box is to load a fake cert for a
domain (issued by its sub-CA cert), or to generate fake certs on the fly for
any targetted domains (or all domains) again issued by its sub-CA cert.  So
I thought the CA that got warned by mozilla had issued a sub-CA cert for
MITM purposes.

(I really dont think a browser vendor would accept *.com nor especially *.
as a valid site cert wildcard.  It does get fiddly because you also want
*.co.uk etc to be invalid but they have some built in tables of such things
to differentiate a TLD from a domain).
