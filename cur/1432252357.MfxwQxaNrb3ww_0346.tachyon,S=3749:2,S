Tarzan is a peer-to-peer anonymous IP network layer.
Many P2P systems try to implement anonymity at the application layer, 
instead of at a lower-level network layer. A robust free infrastructure 
which can anonymize any Internet traffic would benefit a wide array of 
existing protocols and current p2p systems, since the anonymous connection 
could seamlessly replace the current connection.
Main designs goals of Tarzan, ordered by priority:
7	Application independence: Tarzan should provide the abstraction of an IP 
tunnel and perform transparently to user applications.
7	Anonymity against malicious nodes: Tarzan should ensure that colluding 
nodes cannot link a participating host as the sender (or recipient) of any 
message.
7	Fault-tolerance and availability: Tarzan should resist an adversary's 
attempts to overload the system or to block system entry or exit points. 
Tarzan should minimize the damage any one adversary can cause by running a 
few compromised machines.
7	Performance: Tarzan should maximize the performance of tunnel 
transmission, subject to our anonymity requirements.
7	Anonymity against a global eavesdropper: An adversary observing the 
entire network should be unable to determine which Tarzan relay initiates a 
particular message.
