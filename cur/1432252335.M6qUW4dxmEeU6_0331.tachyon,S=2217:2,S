Your postal mail forwards from your old address, doesn't it?
And your old driver's license is still valid,
though the state you moved to wants to hit you up for a new one of theirs.

Alternatively,  if you prefer the Two From Column B menu,
it should be easy to get a letter from a government agency -
just get a traffic ticket (:-) or write them about something bureaucratic,
like how to get a driver's license, or a complaint to your State 
Assemblycritter,
and Bob oughta be your uncle.
