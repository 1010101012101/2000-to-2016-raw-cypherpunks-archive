The risk is not one "terrorists" have to fear. The biggest problem with
the librarian narc program is the same as most of these anti-terrorism
measures: completely innocent people are harassed, arrested, or placed
under suspicion.

You won't catch a terrorist learning to be evil at a library, but you
might wrongfully snare an innocent citizen who happens to have an interest
in "bad" books.

How long until this program is extended to include anyone checking out any
book that some part of the US law enforcement body deems bad? If you read
Pikhal, do you end up on a watch list?
