Nice repetition of crypto deniers in the affirmation by Tor faithful that
Tor was not the weakness it was the implementation, the sysadministration,
the victims' stupidity, the wily use of informants, another unfair accusation
against Tor, a need for PR announcement that Tor was not at fault, get
right on it before the latest lie spreads.

Sure there are bugs to worked out, file this one as ticket number 38,458,
or as an update of a ticket long ago which pointed to this little problem 
being worked on by valiant, dedicated, secret service coders, but do 
not lose faith in what is good overall, re-read our statements:

A few errors does not mean the whole apparatus is not a good thing for
its believers, only that the MSM is clueless. And relentless detractors, 
what can be done about the pests with their puny ignorant agendas going 
up against those who know reputation capital is the fountainhead of moola.

Code, motherfuckers, more code to mark-up.
