                 Ybor police cameras go spy-tech

                  If there is a resemblance, the computer will rate it
from 1 to
                  10, giving out an audible "whoop whoop!" alarm for 8.5
and
                  above.

                  The officer will then contact others on the street by
radio,
                  Todd said, who will stop the person and determine
their
                  identity. If they are wanted, they will be arrested.
If they are
                  not, the situation will be explained to them and they
are free
                  to go.

Since when can cops stop you on the street, when you're not committing a
crime, and ask for ID?
Because a computer gave them "probable cause"???


And in the 'needs organ harvesting' dept, from the same article

                 "That's awesome," said Souders, 35, a caterer. "If you
don't
                  have anything to worry about, it won't bother you. As
far as
                  any invasion of rights -- if you're breaking the law,
your
                  rights are kind of dissolved."
