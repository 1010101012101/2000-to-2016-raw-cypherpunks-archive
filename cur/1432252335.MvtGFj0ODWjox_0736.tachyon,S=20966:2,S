be nice, but I haven't yet tried to run it, will do that someday. It looks
like you haven't really marketed it good enough because this is first time
I hear about it despite it being an somewhat old project. For example Tox
is pretty new but it's already quite popular and I keep hearing about it
every few months. I would suggest to post more on various social sites,
forums and just let people know it exists (eg. post to Reddit) Another
thing I would suggest is add a video to website of example usage so people
could see how it is actually used, explain various features and such as
users might not immediately discover some features.

Now I'll tell a few things, but that's only my personal opinion and most
likely a lot of people won't agree with it. So anyway firstly I'm not a fan
of PHP, it's just generally awful language (see http://phpsadness.com/ and
look at PHP src :D), I know it because I've been writing it for like 7+
years but now 2-3 years I'm PHP-less and happy about it :) Next it looks
like you aren't using any PHP framework but self-developed one which gives
you more work than is needed and obviously it's less battletested. But
overall code itself is nice and pretty, correctly uses MVC pattern. Bad
things are that you don't have separate public directory for frontend and
anyone can access PHP files directly, view templates for example (
https://pod.movim.eu/app/views/admin.tpl) it's not a big deal, but still
not good idea (running version https://pod.movim.eu/VERSION). Then in some
places HTML tags and entities are used directly rather than proper Unicode
which isn't a good idea and it means that string isn't later escaped and if
it gets mixed together with user-input or translation strings there's a
place for XSS. The worse thing probably is that sanitization is based on
regexp blacklists/filters, I'm talking about StringHelper.php, I didn't
look how it's actually used, but still even without trying I'm pretty sure
it would be possible to find XSS there, why? because Rails framework over 5
years have had ~20 XSS vulnerabilities and it's extremely good framework
used by dozens of projects and reviewed regularly, and it's even based on
whitelists, but still uses regexps for that which isn't good and I wonder
why no one does proper SGML parsing which they should. Just take a look at
sanitizer.rb
<https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionview/lib/action_view/vend=
or/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb#L72>
to see how non-trivial it is. Anyway the whole idea of sanitization is
wrong, you should just escape all text and don't try to guess which tags
you should render. I suggest any web developer to read OWASP
<https://www.owasp.org> from A to Z it's a must for any web developer. Then
there's `?>` PHP end tags used at end of various files which are useless
and can introduce problems like famous "headers already sent" warning. So
seems that's about it with my quick look, but I might have forgotten to
mention some things. Another thing I don't like is that AGPL is used, I
really dislike all GPL family, but that's just me and I rather prefer
copyfree <http://copyfree.org> so if there's similar projects then I'll
rather contribute to MIT than any GPL variant :P And I'm not a fan of
Bazaar nor LaunchPad but that's not the worst thing (someone should ban CVS
and SVN :D)

So to sum up about Movim, good parts:

   - Good idea
   - Quite decent code, MVC used correctly
   - Localization support
   - Pretty website
   - Open Source
   - Active development
   - SCM is used

and bad:

   - Not enough known, marketed
   - PHP is used
   - No PHP framework used but self-developed one
   - Some questionable and potentially vulnerable code in some places
   - Scripts and files accessible directly
   - Not my favorite (un)license


But yeah keep it up and continue developing it ;) I might use it some day..=
