I am enjoying, in a macabre sense, watching the great Rorschach Test that events have turned out to be, where everyone's own impression of the world is reflected in their interpretations to a much greater degree than usual.

Everyone is acting like a bunch of assholes, snotty know-it-alls, children, and infantile technoids. And most of us are ostensibly more on the same side than not.  It gives one pause with regard to the behavior between people who DISagree about these and similar kinds of issues. 

Aimee - is this predicted in your worldview?

I've seen Declan and Tim doing this even more so, but there are deep issues regarding the clash behind the theory of Reputation Capital and the Cypherpunk mandate that anonymity is an essential component of privacy.
