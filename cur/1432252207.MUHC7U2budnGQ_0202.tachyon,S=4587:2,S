As a recent article on Posse Comitatus pointed out, P.C. is just a law,
not a Constitutional requirement, so it can be changed any time the
politicians feel like it, and since the War On Drugs militarization,
it's basically become a requirement that if the Law Enforcers want
military assistance, they have to fill out the right forms in triplicate,
but it's just a procedural separation, not a church-and-state kind of thing.

The correct punctuation is "What, were those congresscritters 
<i>thinking</i>?".
Gotta get those commas in the right place...
