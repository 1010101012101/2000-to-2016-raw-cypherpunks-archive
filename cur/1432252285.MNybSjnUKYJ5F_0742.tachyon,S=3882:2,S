Simply wire some wire behind the keys and heat them in irregular patterns,
also make them run quite hot. Don't make the wires to small to produce an
IDable pattern upon the keys. Never let them cool to close to room
temperature. That way whatever pattern there is in the heating (now cooling)
of the buttons cannot be the buttons pressed.

Also it keeps the snow of the board.
