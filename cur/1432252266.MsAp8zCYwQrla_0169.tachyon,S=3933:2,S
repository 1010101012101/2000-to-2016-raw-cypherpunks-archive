It would seem that once GNURadio comes to fruition that many devices, 
including those the FCC would like to regulate, could be built from its 
generic, non-video, architecture.  In that case, wouldn't FCC mandates 
applied to end-users (since end users will be the only ones who will 
configure the SW, FW and HW for an application the FCC would like to 
regulate, be a 3rd Amend. issue?
