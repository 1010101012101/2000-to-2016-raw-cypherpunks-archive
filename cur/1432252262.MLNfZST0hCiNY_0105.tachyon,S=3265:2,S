Accuris - Challenges Facing You

The current situation has left operators facing a considerable list of challenges: 

As the services you offer your customers increase so too do the number of Interception services and therefore the workload on your company should a manual approach continue to be adopted. 

The EU law imposes a legal duty on all operators to meet many standards in the Interception network including: 

7 Integrity - The target must not be able to detect that the traffic is being intercepted. 
7 Quality - The quality of the real-time Interception delivered to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) must be of the same level as that delivered to the target. 
7 Performance - The operator must be able to implement urgent requests within minutes. 
7 Lawful - Interceptions must commence and terminate at the exact start/end date and time referred to on the Interception warrant. 
7 Security - Only individuals who have been appropriately screened and require access to Interception data should have this ability. 

In an increasingly global economy LEAs are increasingly requesting Interceptions from operators outside their home county. It is important to ensure that the handover interface you use to an LEMF is based on a commonly used standard.  In the telecommunications business this usually means compliance to either ETSI or CALEA. 

Potential Implications 
7Interception warrants are issued by the courts and need to be complied with exactly in order to ensure that the Interceptions carried out are in fact lawful rather than unlawful. 
7Manual processes are costly, inefficient and prone to error. 
7Provision of Interception on any service you offer may be required under the terms of your license.
