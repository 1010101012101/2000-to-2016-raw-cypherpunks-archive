(1) You'll never eliminate cheating.

(2) Making the size of the history file a secret is probably unworkable. 
Better to make deletion from the history non-deterministic, so the longer a 
record has been been in the list the more likely it is to get dropped. A 
potential cheater would never be certain when the incriminating evidence 
would be gone. 

If which records were disreputable was known then their lifetime could be 
extended.

cheers,
Tim
