Faustine, you will not be billed for this, this time:

A fair number of posters here attempt to speak for those who
cannot communicate coherently, as well as for those who
speak badly, wrongly, misguidely, stupidly, ungrammatically,
and ebonically -- and more lilies than I got the brain to
contain.

I like those sheep doggie dogs and you will too if you learn
that they know where the master whistling their behavior
keeps the club to the head they bark earnestly to avoid.

Remember the dogs can keep you from being served as
dinner, and being regularly fleeced aint half bad compared
to having to put up with the master's lonely proclivities.

It's all about money and the crippling drug of it, forget the 
vain parables of reputation deployed to sneakthief your 
savings. Anybody tell you how to behave and speak and
think got one thing only on its fevered mind.

There, for free, one time only.
