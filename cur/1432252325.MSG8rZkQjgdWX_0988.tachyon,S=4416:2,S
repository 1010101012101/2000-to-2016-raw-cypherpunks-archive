Your information is almost staggeringly out of date. Even in the late 1980s 
when I lived in China it was easy to move about freely (well, easy isn't 
quite the right word when you couldn't book any rail tickets remotely or in 
advance!).

Now of course, things are even more "free". As for "totalitarian communist 
state", there's not much communist left about it, except for the name of the 
ruling party. Right now, most of mainland China is about as capitalist as 
you can get, with the Army one of the biggest capitalist enterprises around 
(in the early 90s the central government informed the army they were going 
to have to find a way to raise money to pay a lot of their own bills!).

As for the totalitarianism part,as long as you don't complain too loudly 
about the government, you're fine for the most part (particularly if you 
have lots of $$$). (Although every now and then Jong Nan Hai will decide to 
crack down on something and you may come under fire.)

If you want to call it "totalitarian", fine. But like all western terms 
applied to China, its relevance only has a very limited meaning.
