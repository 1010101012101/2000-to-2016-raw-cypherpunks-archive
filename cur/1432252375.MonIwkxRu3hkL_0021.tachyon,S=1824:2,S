Thus spake Tyler Durden (camera_lumina@hotmail.com) [02/05/05 10:18]:
: yes, this reminded me of another brilliant idea.
: 
: Why don't some cars have a little tiny furnace for stash destruction?
: 
: If you've got an on-board stash and some Alabama hillbilly with a badge 
: pulls you over, you just hit the button and have you're little stashed 
: incinerated. Who cares if the badge knows you USED TO have something on 
: board? Too late now if any trace of evidence is gone.
: 
: What's wrong with this idea?
