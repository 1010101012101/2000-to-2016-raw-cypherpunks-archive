that you think there is 'evil' is anti-arrow let alone 'arrow to progress'

islam is a small section of time within arab culture look to zarathustra

plus muhammad was basically a resistance fighter - anti capitalist like
jesus or so the story goes...

these are stories read or look into joseph campbell - nietzsche ...
buckminster fuller if you are interested

your frames are anti arrow ... your frames are fiction


and john young arabs did not invent 0 indians did - the 'arab' - actually
they say he was persian which is very different - wrote about it was
muhammad ibn musa alKhwarizmi

they say though that he invented algebra/trig but probably also it is a
build - arabs did a lot of astronomy invented tools for calculations etc
... would be nice to know more about what the chinese where doing then too
