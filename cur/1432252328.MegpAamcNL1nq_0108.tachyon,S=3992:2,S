This can be shifted to the information theory terrain.

It's not _just_ about using the straight and prescribed language and
constructs. It is about predictability in general. Most posters that I filter
out are predictable to the point where I can, with decent accuracy, guess what
they will say on any given subject. They can be described (scripted) as finite
automata. And they have enormous integrity that they are proud of.

Bricks also have integrity, but I always failed to find them entertaining -
except maybe when they disintegrate on high impact. Then you get to see many
irregular and unpredictable pieces.

Some aspiring student of AI may find it an interesting exercise to customize
alicebot to emulate some of the most integral cpunk posters (think timbots,
mattbots, etc.) Frankly, I think that it's already been done. Sometimes I think
that there are already alicebot implants.

So it's all about entropy. Low entropy dwellers perceive high entropy ("high on
entropy" ?) runners as danger that needs cooling. Or should I say kooling ?

Why is that stupid ?

Because we will all end up as cold iron, and it doesn't matter who gets there
first. The last one wins.
