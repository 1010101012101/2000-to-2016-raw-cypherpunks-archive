There is no such thing as "automatic security." That's an oxymoron.

Any system that is "secure" without the ongoing burn of end-user brain cycles
is subject to more-or-less easy subversion [a corollary of this is that
"masses" will never be in situation to be both (1) end users and (2) secure.
One can be a product and secure at the same time without effort, though.]

And any system that (in theory) makes DNS foolproof will inevitably exclude any
parallel name services.
