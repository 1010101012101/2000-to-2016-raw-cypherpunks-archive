Because you have been justifying his actions, denying his 
crimes, and calling for his release.

It was an unwise war fought by unjust means.  The cause of 
saving the Vietnamese from Soviet domination was a just cause, 
as the terror and the flood of refugees that followed the 
defeat of the west in Indochina proved.   However, "just cause" 
is only one of the several criteria needed for a just war.
(And the Iraqi war does not satisfy all the criteria of just
war either, though hanging Saddam is surely a just cause.)

> Why does the "american way of life" have to win?

The world cannot remain half slave and half free.  We must 
become slaves, or they must become free.
