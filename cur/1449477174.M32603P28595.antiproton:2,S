<p>The film is entitled &quot;From DeadDrop to SecureDrop,&quot; and provid=
es a historical account of how the &quot;SecureDrop&quot; open source anony=
mous whistleblowing submission platform was originally prototyped by Kevin =
Poulsen and Aaron Swartz, and later, after Aaron&#39;s death, how it made i=
ts way its current home at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>
<p>People in the film (so far) include: Wired&#39;s Kevin Poulsen (how he w=
as inspired by WikiLeaks and then convinced Aaron to work with him on the p=
roject), Trevor Timm and John Perry Barlow (of the Freedom of the Press Fou=
ndation), who sought out the DeadDrop prototype, Garrett Robinson (SecureDr=
op&#39;s current Development Lead) and Bill Budington (an EFF engineer who =
worked directly on the early codebase), and some influential figures famili=
ar with the issues, such as Brewster Kahle (Founder of the Internet Archive=
 and co-founder, with myself, of Aaron Swartz Day) and Cindy Cohn (Executiv=
e Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation). I also interviewed Virgi=
l Griffith (Tor2Web and Wikiscanner), as he and Aaron were good friends and=
 worked on Tor2Web together.</p>
<p>Jacob Applebaum has agreed to be interviewed for the film. (Besides bein=

son, who stood by Edward Snowden&#39;s side in Hong Kong and the Moscow air=
port, and assisted with getting him safe asylum in Russia, has agreed to be=
 in the film!</p>
<p>After learning more about whistleblower Chelsea Manning (in the course o=

<p>I came to realize that the film really needs to expand beyond the subjec=
t of the SecureDrop technology itself, to attempt to explain *why* these wh=
istleblowers might decide to use WikiLeaks or SecureDrop to expose corrupti=
on in the first place: To inform the public and make the world a better pla=

<p>A third theme of the movie deals directly with an observation made by mo=

ly (so no one will have to go through what he went through, just to get a s=

<p>The film suggests that SecureDrop could potentially usher in a new gener=
