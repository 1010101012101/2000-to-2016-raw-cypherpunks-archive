Perhaps some Black Block types and other Seattlish protesters do have
such gear and training, but the ones I've run across
(http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/2001-bush-inauguration-highlights.html) 
do not.

Besides, the police will always have more resources and will probably
be able to stop you from legally possessing the cooler gear you really
need (http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/dem-protests-00.html).
