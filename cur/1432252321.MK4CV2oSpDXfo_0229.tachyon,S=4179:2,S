Hmmm. What would happen if every "legitimate" cryptography researcher 
routinely transmitted an announcement to every vendor of copy protection 
telling them that the researcher was going to be 'researching' the vendor's 
products?

Research is such a wonderful term. I suppose I'm doing some sort of 
"cryptography research" just by looking at the bits that encode some sort 
of protected content. I must guiltily confess that I've been doing security 
long enough that I look with a skeptical eye at every "security 
implementation" I see, even if it's just a security camera or a string of 
barbed wire.

There are probably enough "cryptography researchers" out there that even a 
large vendor won't feel tempted to harass them all proactively.

Rick.
