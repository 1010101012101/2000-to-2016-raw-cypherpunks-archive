ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A freight train derailed Sunday afternoon, spilling 
thousands of gallons of chemicals that ignited in a fireball, authorities 
said. Two nearby houses were heavily damaged.
At least seven of the 42 cars of the CSX Corp. jumped the rails around 3:30 
p.m. in Charlotte, a suburb north of Rochester. Two tankers containing 
methylene chloride and acetone leaked and caught fire, said Fire Capt. Dan 
McBride.
Part of the train crashed into a house, and another nearby house caught 
fire soon afterward. No one in the homes was hurt, McBride said.
There was no immediate word whether the chemicals posed environmental or 
health dangers. No one had been evacuated as of 5 p.m., but officials 
opened a school for residents unable to get to their homes.
Plumes of black smoke could be seen more than 10 miles away, and witness 
Sharon Connolly said she saw a huge ball of flame.
"I saw the cars fly in the air. There was an explosion," she told the 
Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester.
Officials said the fire had been contained by early evening.
The train originated from Rochester, said CSX spokesman Bob Sullivan. The 
chemicals, used in making photographic film, were being delivered to an 
Eastman Kodak plant.
"We're working with local authorities to make sure this thing gets resolved 
safely and quickly," Sullivan said.
An engineer, who was not immediately identified, jumped from the train as 
it tipped, McBride said. The engineer was treated at a hospital for minor 
injuries.
The conductor, the only other person on board, was not injured.
Meanwhile on the west coast,Tim May,disguised as a militia warrior,got back 
from a weekend of rolfing and high colonics at a famous North Cali health 
retreat.Quoted as "trying to eliminate all free radicals."May did not look well.
