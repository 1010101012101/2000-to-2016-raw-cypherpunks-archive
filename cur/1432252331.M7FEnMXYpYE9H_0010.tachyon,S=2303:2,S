Why not? while Miller could well be prosecuted for revealing the identity, had
she done so - she didn't. Why should *anyone* be jailed for failing to reveal
who they had talked to in confidence? I am all in favour of people being tried
for their actions, but not for thoughtcrimes.

And yet Novak is the one who purportedly committed a crime - revealing the
identity of an agent and thus endangering them. So the actual crime (of
revealing) isn't important, but talking to a reporter is?
