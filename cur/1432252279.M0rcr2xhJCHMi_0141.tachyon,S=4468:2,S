Banal, actually.

A platitude which misses the point of modern PK and DC-Net sort sorts 
of approaches. The "security" of chained remailers is of course not 
perfect, but it does not depend on the naive attacks which Ray 
Dillnger claims make the security as bad as he claims. Nor is his 
"stegoized mailing list" even the slightest bit interesting.

Well-trod ground. What is it about some of you people who don't even 
bother to learn the basics?

IP addresses have nothing to do with attacks on remailers and DC-Nets.

Do some reading. Start with Chaum's 1981 paper on untraceable e-mail, 
read at least the first 5 or 7 pages of his 1988 paper on dining 
cryptographers nets, and then move on to the other list-related 
sources.
