Not a joke:  I was dead serious.  Windows/Outlook is the preferred 
platform for viruses.  If he wants to run a virus free system, he 
should get a system that is not the preferred platform for viruses.

Windows is also built to be insecure; there are backdoor keys for 
law-enforcement types to stick "trusted" trojans on the system, 
broken security programs that leave unencrypted temp files lying 
around, "encrypted" systems that just XOR the plaintext with a 
short repeating key, etc ad nauseam.  And this is just the stuff 
that auditors have been able to find without recourse to source 
code. If you want secure systems, get a system that you can read 
the source code for and *see* what the hell is going on -- or *fix* 
it if you find something broken.

Finally, it's really nice to have a comprehensive system of permissions, 
etc -- that way some idiot running zork can't trash out anything that 
the system actually depends on, even if he runs a virus-infected zork.

And let's not forget the "autoregister" feature in Whistler.  Isn't 
it nice that I'll be able to upgrade hardware without buying a new 
operating system?

The last downtime, a month and a half ago, was for a hard drive upgrade.
The one before that was four months prior, and that was for physically 
relocating the machine.  I don't even remember the last time it crashed; 
I don't think it ever has in the five years I've been using it.
