You do raise a valid point (and I enjoy "explain it like I'm five!")  It's 
an angle I hadn't considered; I should wait to reply until I'm not in the 
throes of insomnia ;)

The larger points, which occurred after I'd already hit 'send':  where did 
they get this 'cache'?  (Snowden insists he released what he had to 
Greenwald/Poitras et al in HK, and until proven otherwise I choose to 
believe him.)  Sure, I guess he could have been blackmailed / rubberhosed...

And the TLAs whine loudly about being thwarted by encryption, when they 
themselves have weakened EC anyway, and Russia/China have decrypted it but 
not the US?!  Why would they even admit to that...

I can't put my finger on it, and I'll readily admit I'm biased in that I 
don't trust the five eyes or their propaganda at all, but there is just 
something "off" about this whole thing.
