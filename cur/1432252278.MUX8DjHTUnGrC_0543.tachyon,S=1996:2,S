I'm familiar with 100 Mhz 32b MIPS cores that cost about $10 and include
2 ethernet i/faces.
Intended for cheap SOHO routers, etc.  Newer variants include IPsec
support
(e.g., a DES engine) for the same price.  They'll run Linux.

ARM's advantage is in power consumption, AFAIK, which doesn't always
matter.

I can see other reasons for hacking an answering machine ---encrypting
stored messages,
implementing/augmenting your own DTMF decision tree, allowing some to
leave longer messages than others, even
machines that call another number to forward.    (I once worked on a
commercial
system that implemented a POTS i/f as boards in a Wintel machine, its
(perhaps
now extinct) niche was cheapening international phone calls.)  Cheapo
fax/soundcards
are able to do ring detection, pick up, etc.  Probably a fun project,
the POTS i/f
won't go away soon.
