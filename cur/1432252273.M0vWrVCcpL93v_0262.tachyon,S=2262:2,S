Well, sure.  At least 1-3% of the people in the country
work for town governments and/or shopping mall developers
who get to benefit from this kind of abuse.

It's really strange to have a week where not only does the
Supreme Court make a bunch of rabidly evil decisions,
but Rehnquist and Thomas are on the correct side of several of them.
Hope the old bastard can hang on long enough until either
Bush is out of office or at least the Senate gets a few more Democrats,
because Bush is unlikely to propose somebody even as principled
as these right-wing zealots.
