The difference between killing people and setting them free 
doubtless seems trivial to the fans of slavery and terror.

More likely they will dance in the streets.  Observe what 
happened in Afghanistan.

Probably we would not be in the Iraq war, but the fans of 
tyranny, yourself among them, would still be seeking to enslave 
us, which leads to events such as 9/11

It really is that they hate us for our (relative) freedom.   I 
can see that on this list with all the big salt tears wept for 
poor little victimized Saddam, and the outraged indignation 
that various third worlders have been cruelly deprived of the 
wonderful socialism so generously bestowed upon them by various 
bloodstained, but nonetheless benevolent and popular,
dictators.
