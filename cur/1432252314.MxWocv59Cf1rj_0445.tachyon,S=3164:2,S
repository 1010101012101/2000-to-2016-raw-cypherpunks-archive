Telecom-grade laser packages (and the lasers inside them) not only do not 
have a monitoring diode, they are designed very carefully to prevent the 
kind of feedback you're talking about (it destabilizes the laser and causes 
a power penalty).

However, there's no real reason not to be able just to splice into the 
fiber. Hell, you don't even need a splice if you have access to the FDF 
(Fiber Distributing Frame, or fiber patch panel).
