Words depend greatly on context.  The meaning of words here on the 
Cypherpunks list, is different than their meaning in the New York Times. 

If someone said "up the chimneys with the inner-city welfare mutants" in 
the New York Times, there would be mass rioting in the streets.

I find this with a lot of my stuff that gets taken from this list and
posted in places that I would have written it much differently for, had
those places been its original destination.

So - what happened to Tim?  Can I be the list's new Crusty Retired 
Engineer now?
