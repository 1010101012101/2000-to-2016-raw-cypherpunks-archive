The Washington Post finally catches on to the fact that the Scarfo case 
exists, a few weeks after everyone else wrote about the hearing in Newark. 
The front-page story today by Jonathan Krim contains this memorable passage:

http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55606-2001Aug9.html
"Encryption is virtually unbreakable by police today, with programs that 
can be bought for $15," said Stewart Baker, former general counsel of the 
National Security Agency and now partner at the Washington law firm Steptoe 
& Johnson. Although agreeing that surveillance should be done under strict 
guidelines, Baker said that "to a degree, the privacy groups got us into 
this by arguing that there should be no limits on encryption, and the 
police have to deal with it."
