Gene: Do you do anal.
Jessie: Yes I do.
Gene: You just raised the value of your real estate. When was the first 
time you tried it.
Jessie: It was with my ex fiance in Texas. You know that old saying- 
everything's big in Texas.
Gene: Yeah and how was that steer going in your ass.
Jessie: Real well. I like it. If the guy knows how to do it, it feels 
really good. I'll orgasm if I'm really attracted to the guy. I can get off 
ten or fifteen times.
