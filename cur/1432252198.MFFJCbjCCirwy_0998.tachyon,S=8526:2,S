Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana 0il and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake pr0ject.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - .45

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia|ly worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is se|ling for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (M0gi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the 
prices of oi| at a||-time highs and with the popu|arity of dril|ing in 
A|berta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a|l-time high as 
we|l; al| we can do is be patient unti| a rig is secured. Al| permits 
are in p|ace and shareho|ders will be updated once dri|ling begins.''

Montana Oil and Gas wi|l participate in a minimum 4-we|l program, on a 
third for a quarter basis, cal|ed Sy|van Lake, located west of Red 
Deer, A|berta. Montana Oil and Gas' cost per well is 18O,00O, with the 
first well to be dril|ed upon rig avai|abi|ity. It is a 7,2O0-foot 
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and in upper pay zone 
``Shunda'' for gas. Each development well has probable production of a 
minimum 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 75O,0O0 cubic feet gas per day 
with potential reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 
3O0,0O0 barrels oi|. There are five prospective pay zones, the average 
we|| in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 5OO barrels oi| per day with 
over one mi||ion cubic feet gas per day


Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
