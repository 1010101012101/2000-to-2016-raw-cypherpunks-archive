So why not institute mandatory education before people can go online?
After all, motorists must obtain licenses before they can legally hit
the road, and computers are much more complicated.

"It could be a four-year college degree, a one-month course. It might be
a good idea," said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer for
Counterpane Internet Security Inc.

Or it might be a bad idea.

"The downside is everybody you know won't be able to have a computer
anymore, and I like being able to send e-mail to friends," Schneier
said.
