Yes, I've wondered about that too. What dooes it look like when the NSA tell 
you to turn over records? Do they do so verbally? Is there a document? Is 
there anything made to look like you "have to turn over the records by law"?

And when the individuals in AT&T, etc...agreed, didn't they have some kind 
of documentation to show that "They told us to turn over the records and we 
thought we were required to".

What I suspect is that they don't have anything that looks like anything 
more than a request.

Someone "Needs killin"...
