Abdullah Farraj Al-Sharif/Al-Madinah

Freedom of expression has long been absent in the Arab world. While all=20
Arab intellectuals emphasize the need for it, they do not accept the wild=20
lies and prevarications dished out regularly by the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera=
=20
on a round-the-clock basis. The station chooses guests with dubious=20
qualifications to participate in what is arguably the worst kind of talk=
 show.
Guests rant and rave, reminding viewers of a brawl. The participants are=20
never concerned with the authenticity of evidence used to support their=20
arguments. Such shows, which are not often broadcast by other stations in=20
other parts of the world, spew hatred and hostility all around.
Viewers wonder at the apparent contradiction in the way the station=20
presents programs and in what its goals really are. Its motto is =91Opinion=
=20
and the Other Opinion=92 but the station=92s performance has proved that the=
=20
=91other opinion=92 has no place in its broadcasts. When a topic is=
 discussed =97=20
Iraq, for example =97 the discussion rambles on interminably. Viewers who=
 may=20
or may not know anything about the topic participate by telephone. The=20
moderator puts questions to them but they are not allowed to express a=20
dissenting opinion. Questions are phrased in such a way that the desired=20
answer is implied and it is thus clear what the participants are expected=20
to say. The trick usually works as unsuspecting participants initially=20
agree with the moderator and later when the trap has become obvious, the=20
participant protests that he or she has not been allowed to state his=20
views. At this point the moderator jumps in to say angrily, =93We are=20
discussing the likelihood of America=92s attacking Iraq and not the=
 station=92s=20
style of presentation.=94
The station=92s objective becomes quite clear to those who watches it for=20
some time. It aims at the total surrender of all Arab interests to American=
=20
policies. The station seems to follow a skillfully-devised scheme, which is=
=20
much worse than either covert or overt Zionist schemes, to deprive Arabs of=
=20
all their legitimate rights. The viewers, who see through the station=92s=20
evil designs, are at a loss to explain why a Gulf country continues to=20
finance a station which has ruined good relations with a number of Arab=20
countries because of its baseless criticisms and allegations. If the=20
station is impartial in its treatment, one wonders why it never discusses=20
the state of affairs in Qatar. Is Qatar an ideal and infallible state while=
=20
all other Arab states and governments and countries deserve to be condemned?
Though I have been frank in my opinions about the way the station operates,=
=20
I want to stress my keenness to maintain our close family and cultural ties=
=20
with our brothers in Qatar despite the efforts of the TV station to ruin=
 them.
