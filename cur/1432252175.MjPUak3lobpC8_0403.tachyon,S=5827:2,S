Where does the desire for "a relationship" translate into the desire to
"change the other party"?

Then I guess we're down the minutae of "what is "a relationship", and what is
"change"...

The American colloquialism "Golddigger" != "Relationship participant who
would like to effect changes in the other engaging party(s)".  The Goldigger
term commonly refers to a woman who marries or engages in highly personal
(not _necessarily_ sexual, but the inference is a common one) long term
"relationships" for the accrual of cash and property, rather than any actual
interest in the partner(s).  Think long-term hookers.  Think Mary Elizabeth
Terranson :-)

<chuckles>

	Because Jim's comment specifically referred to women.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
