New FBI man,darwin John...At the FBI, John will lead development of IT 
strategies and work with the Laboratory, Criminal Justice Information 
Services and Information Resources divisions, which handle forensic 
technologies, law enforcement services, and investigative and 
administrative support.
John brings a "demonstrated capability to achieve broad-based results in an 
area critical to the FBI's success, particularly at a time when the bureau 
is modernizing its information technologies--while reorganizing and 
re-engineering--and undergoing unprecedented change in its investigative 
mission and priorities," Mueller said in a statement.
John formerly served as managing director of information and communications 
systems for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake 
City, where he oversaw the creation of the Family Search site. The Web 
site, launched in 1999, links people to a database of 900 million names and 
averages 7 to 8 million hits per day.
