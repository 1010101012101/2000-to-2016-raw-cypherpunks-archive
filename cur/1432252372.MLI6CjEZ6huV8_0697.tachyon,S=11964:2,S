Most people I've noticed prefer to avoid the "and then he goes to
jail" step because it invites regulation and government involvement,
is expensive and unappealing.  It also involves a identifying
registration step to participate which is a barrier to entry.

I think the controversy surrounding political friendliness was
centered on properties which are not intrinsic but apparently selected
by implementors or proponents:

- there are five schemes we can look at:

- chaum online (CON), chaum/ferguson offline (CFOFF), brands online
(BON), brands offline (BOFF), brands p2p offline (BP2P), and wagner
online (WON)

  - offline means payees can receive funds without connecting to the
    bank immediately to check validity; their remaining assurance of
    not accepting double-spent coins is that if a coin they receive is
    double spent the bank will learn who is responsible; all offline
    schemes also have an online deposit protocol for when the money is
    paid into the bank.

  - in fact offline coins generally can not be respent without
    exchanging for a fresh coin at the bank, so the offline function is
    perhaps better described as "delayed deposit".

    - for why this is the case consider bank -> U1 -> U2 -> U3 -> bank
      with 3 payer/payees U1, U2, U3; bank->U1 is withdrawal, U3->
      bank is deposit, U1->U2 is pay, but U2->U3 isn't safe and here's why:

      - U2 can't convince U3 that he knows the private key for the
        coin because U2 does not have it to give him (U3 needs that
        proof to know that U2s identity is in the coin and will be
        revealed to the bank in case of double spending)

      - if U1 did give U2 his private key, so that U2 could convince
        U3 to accept his coin, then U2 could double spend
        and U1 would get blamed, so it is not in U1's interests to
        give U2 the coin private key

  - but in the special case of Brands offline, there is a peer-to-peer
    offline (which I called BP2P) which is a respendable offline
    option which allows safe offline peer-to-peer transfers.  (The
    trick is in fact to cryptographically bind peer2peer coins (which
    grow at each exchange) to 0-value coins with the p2p recipient's
    identity in them.  This trick only works with Brands offline I
    think, because CFOFF doesn't have a private key to bind with).

- all of the systems provide unconditional payer anonymity (CON, COFF,
BON, BOFF, BP2P, WON)

And collusion proof robust payee and payer anonymity is inherently
possible with all the systems by using accountless operation - this
works generically on all systems.  Basically the bank provides an
interface to allow deposit of coins and getting back fresh blind
coins.  

In fact for this Brands has an extra protocol option to allow this to
be done in a single operation (so-called re-freshed coin -- same
attributes, new blinding factors).  This is not just an efficiency
win, it has important privacy value: with this protocol the bank does
not learn the coin attributes.  In particular this means the bank
would not learn the amount of the transaction, as one of the
attributes will be the transaction value (ie it can not distinguish 1c
from $1000).  This I'd argue makes the Brands protocol much more
pragmatically secure against flow analysis.  (With Chaum the bank has
a separate public key per coin denomination, and could to some extent
statistically trace groups of coin denominations).

Chosing not to offer accountless operation is a policy decision by
implementors and proponents (the usual argument is to avoid the
"blackmail attack" -- ie so an unwilling payer extorted can later
collude with the bank to identify the extorter).  However the
side-effect (which is bad) is to make sting operations possible
against anonymous sellers who are politicaly unpopular.  As Tim has
articulated before there are lots of good reasons a seller should be
able to be robustly anonymous.

Then are two approaches to extracting payee anonymity even if the bank
makes the political decision to not support accountless operation
which due to the math work as follows:

1. money changers - this works generically on all schemes -- basically
an entity launders the money handing out fresh coins for used coins,
optionally depositing the coins at the bank before handing out fresh
coins.  Typically it is supposed that the money changer would charge a
commission.  You do not have to trust the money changer with your
privacy because you chose your own blinding factors.

2. payer cooperation -- this also works (to varying extents) with all
schemes.  

  - one approach to getting payee privacy is if the payer cooperates
    with the payee in an online fashion so that only the payee knows
    the blinding factors (essentially the payee acts as the withdrawer
    also, and the payer acts as a bit pipe).  This protects the payee
    as the payer no longer has information allowing him to collude
    with the bank

    - the other side of adding payee privacy with this approach
      is presumably the payer would also like to retain his privacy 
 
    - with Chaum's online protocol double blinding works because of
      the math, so the payer and payee can both be private without
      needing to trust the other party not to collude with the bank

    - with the other schemes the double blinding trick does not work
      which creates a privacy risk for the payer -- the payee can
      collude with the bank and identify the payer -- this essentially
      means that only one of the payer or payee can be robustly
      private at a time (if the bank refuses to offer accounless
      operation)

So in summary the best and simplest way to generically get robust
payer and payee privacy is accountless operation.

If bank chooses to not offer this option, then Chaum online protocol
has the best workaround (retaining payer privacy); however even it is
quite inconvenient requiring both parties to be simultaneously online.
This requires non-standard software, and interferes with usage pattern
-- many normal uses may not require the online aspect -- eg email your
payment.  Forced to be online also practically reduces the privacy of
both payer and payee against observers as interactive connections tend
to offer less robust privacy.

The money changer approach works also, but the bank may be able to
recognize money changers by their high turn over and cancel their
accounts, which you'd have to presume they would do if they
intentionally did not offer accounless operation.

Not satisfying in that there are no equi-functional work-arounds to
the bank not offering accountless operation.

The protocols which offer the offline option where identity is
revealed to bank if you double spend model do have more complex math.

However you do get other extra features (in the case of Brands) such
as single operation coin-refresh which has significant privacy value,
and offer extra attributes which are useful for digital bearer bonds
to convey information, and better efficiency, and you don't have to
use the offline or p2p offline options -- they are just options.  So
I'd argue that Brands is just a more flexible, private and efficient
system.  Granted actually using the identity embedding offline option
has problems -- but the lesson there is just don't use that option.


Re. the side discussion about whether it's fair to call these tokens
coins as the value lies in the double spend database rather than the
coin, I had the same discussion with Bob some time ago, and I concur.

I'd argue the p2p offline Brands option is more "coin" like in that
you (personally) can spend the coin without relying on the
double-spend database (providing the payee doesn't do an online
deposit before accepting your payment).

Another bad aspect of identity is that it afects usability -- everyone
has to be a registered and identified user at the bank to participate,
even if they allow accountless operation just to meet the offline
double-spending system.

This is bad for functionality as you'd like to be able to fully
participate without ever registering with or identifying yourself to
the bank.


I suppose the argument for the offline p2p systems and why people find
them tempting is that aside from the identity registration issue, it
works much better with intermittently connected devices like PDAs etc,
which may not at all times have TCP/IP connectivity.

But if you were using offline p2p I'd think you'd only want to accept
low value payments, or have a good reason to want the added privacy of
high latency deposit to the extent that you'd be willing to accept the
risk, and you'd think the bank would not want to accept liability
unless they had really good identity verification if the coins were
going to circulate for weeks before mass double spending might be
noticed.  (Though the higher the double-spending multiple, the sooner
it will be noticed as on average someone will deposit two of them
sooner.)  The problem for the bank would be people who either managed
to fake the identity system, or the odd nutter who comits identity
suicide for a brief burst of unlimited credit -- such people could do
a lot of damage.
