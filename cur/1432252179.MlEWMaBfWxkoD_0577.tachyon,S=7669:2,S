There is an event in DC about the Freedom of Information Act on March
13, 2015.  There is also supposed to be a livestream of the conference
for anyone to watch online.

The Freedom of Information Act can be used by anyone to request records
from the US federal government. Many states and countries also have
their own public records laws which can be very useful for journalists
and researchers.
