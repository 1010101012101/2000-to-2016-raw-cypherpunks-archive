I encourage you to offer your design services, for sale of course, to 
Eric Blossom and Starium. They have been working on this issue for a 
number of years and don't seem to be close to the PDA yet. The 
"small PC" has more bandwidth, but mobile Pentiums and suchlike are 
not there yet. (Pablo Escobar will not likely become a gargoyle and 
wear a hip PC and glasses, at least not anytime soon.)

Indeed. And harder to show tampering with.

I encourage you. But it won't be a weekend hack. I doubt even an iPAQ 
has the horsepower, and certainly the Dragonball PDAs don't.

Yes, it was. IIRC, Hugh Daniel did most of the legwork to get it set 
up and running.
