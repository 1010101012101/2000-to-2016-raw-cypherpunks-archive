<http://villagevoice.com/issues/0230/baard.php>Buying Trouble

In which the Village Voice discusses the use of commercial databases 
including supermarket discount cards in hunting terrorists.

One useful piece of advice:

Don't but pizza with a credit card:
Oddly enough, "one of the factors was if you were a person who frequently 
ordered pizza and paid with a credit card," Ponemon says, describing the 
buying habits of a nation of college students. "Sometimes data leads to an 
empirical inference when you add it to other variables. Whether this one is 
relevant or completely spurious remains to be seen, but those kinds of 
weird things happen with data."

Course all those terrorists buying their pizzas with cash get away clean.
