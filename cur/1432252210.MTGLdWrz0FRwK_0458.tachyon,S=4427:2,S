 >>So, in 1990, he launched DigiCash b.v., a subsidiary of the US company 
DigiCash Inc., with his own capital and a contract from the Dutch 
government to build and test technology to support anonymous toll payments 
on highways. Chaum developed a prototype by which smart cards holding a 
certain amount of verified cash value could be slipped into a gadget 
affixed to the windshield, and high-speed scanning devices would subtract 
the tolls as the cars whizzed by. The cards could also be used to pay for 
public transportation and eventually other items. Of course, the payments 
would be anonymous. After completing that contract (the system has not yet 
been implemented), << Know then...

Transfield-Obayashi operates a system like this in Melbourne,au.Ratlines of 
diverted traffic instantly sprung up.Motorcycles go through the system of 
segmented superhighways and tunnels free,as no way could be found to attach 
the 'gadget'.No cards are used though they are in the train and tram 
system.Anarchists and old ladies have been blamed by the privatized mass 
transport companies for a steep decline in revenues since conductors were 
made redundant.Many ticket machines are inoperable for various.) 
reasons.Stillsuits are essential and planetary ecologist Keynes tells me 
that the last 9 out of 10 years were hottest on record.Over harvesting and 
Harkkkonen activity are adding to a dangerous build up of Co2 that 
threatens the very existence of the spice.The worms the Harkkkonen are 
attempting to breed are so far producing only the most distilled 
poison.Fremen on the planet are waging guerrilla war and are being 
vigorously suppressed by the rabid beast,Abbott,using scorched earth 
tactics.The Pareto Emperors call for complete genocide were almost totally 
successful in the deep south.
The fremen are said to have an undisclosed weapon and are being led by 
someone called muad Dip.More Sardauker legions may be required to eliminate 
these rebels who also seem to be drawing on house Anerres remnants.Also 
notify choate Prime that more hunter-seekers are needed.Keep this message
