Wow, the propaganda in the .ppt was effective on SOMEONE anyhow.  Give that PR
guy a cigar, or a raise.

Bottom line, never, ever, ever, mess with armed thugs- in whatever form.  Not
only will you die or be otherwise grievously injured but you will get zero
sympathy from anyone with a brain.  Do, however, expect to be featured in
excellent propaganda- your consolation prize for being under 30 and dead
(brain-dead or deaddead).  It may even sway the occasional Mr. "Armchair
Anarchist" Woods.  Who knows, perhaps so much that he sends an e-mail, if he
manages to finish it before the evening stock reports come on and distract
him, or before the phone rings with some 20something begging him to switch to
AT&T because he can get $0.07 a minute on his long distance right this second
and at the station he's gotten to in life how could he deny that to himself?

In the end it's evolution in action.  And good evolution at that.

Using any old excuse to pound on some armed Italian para-military types seems
more a demonstration to me that these people have nothing real to do than
anything else.

Mother: "Where ya going Flavio?"
Son: "Oh, out with Juliano and Francisco.  We're going to go to the mall,
maybe catch a movie and then try and catch the last couple hours of the
protests and pound on some pigs while we can before the Gwhatever summit
leaves."
Francisco: "Yeah, don't forget to bring your mask cause I want to smash that
damn Starbucks that Sylvia works at too, the one on the corner!"
Mom: "That's nice dear.  Be home for supper."

Many tears shed, many pictures taken, much hand wringing, then, in a month,
life goes on.  Deal or don't protest violently near armed thugs.  "C'mon,
shoot me, shoot me, I dare you, pig.  Shoot me.  Whatcha gonna do?  C'mon, you
can't do it can you?  Can you?"  *Bang*  -Surprised Look-

What a worthless exercise.  What a dumbass.

The only thing that really upsets me to any degree is that most of the
protestors have come into town with the express intent of causing trouble.
This means they are generally burning down someone else's neighborhood, not
their own.  Ah well.  Can't have everything.
