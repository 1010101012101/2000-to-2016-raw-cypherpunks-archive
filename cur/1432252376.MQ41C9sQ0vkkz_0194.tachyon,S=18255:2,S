  Voting Machines Vulnerable to "Serious" Vote-Flipping Attack

  Monday 16 April 2007

    Scientific report finds "serious security vulnerability" similar to
    "Princeton Diebold virus hack" in widely used iVotronic system,
    allowing a single person to change election results across entire
    county without detection. Despite GAO confirmed mandate to serve as
    info "clearinghouse," embattled EAC says they will take no action
    to alert elections officials, public.

    While revelations surrounding the mysterious 18,000 "undervotes" in the 
November 2006 U.S. House election between Christine Jennings and Vern 
Buchanan in Florida's 13th Congressional district continue to inform the 
nation about the dangers of electronic voting machines, new information has 
recently come to light exposing a shocking lack of responsible oversight by 
those entrusted with overseeing the certification of electronic voting 
systems at the federal level.

    An investigation into what may have gone wrong in that election has 
revealed a serious security vulnerability on some, and possibly all, 
versions of the iVotronic touch-screen voting system widely used across the 
country. The iVotronic is a Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) touch-screen 
voting machine manufactured by Elections Systems & Software, Inc. (ES&S), 
the nation's largest distributor of such systems.

    The vulnerability is said to allow for a single malicious user to 
introduce a virus into the system which "could potentially steal all the 
votes in that county, without being detected," according to a noted computer 
scientist and voting system expert who has reviewed the findings.

    And yet, despite their federal mandate to serve as a "clearinghouse" to 
the nation for such information, a series of email exchanges between an 
Election Integrity advocate and officials at the U.S. Elections Assistance 
Commission (EAC) has revealed that the federal oversight body is refusing to 
notify states of the alarming security issue.

    The recent email conversation shows that even in light of the EAC's 
review of the warning from the computer scientist who characterized the 
"security hole" as severe, needing to be "taken very seriously," and among 
the most serious ever discovered in a voting system, the EAC is unwilling to 
take action.

    Recent reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have taken 
the EAC to task for a failure to meet their legislated mandate for informing 
the public and elections officials about such matters. However, a review of 
the email communications to and from the EAC's Jeannie Layson shows that the 
federal body is steadfast in their refusal to take action to alert either 
elections officials or the public about the security risk recently 
discovered by a team of eight noted computer scientists.

    The EAC's current Chairwoman, Executive Director, Director of Voting 
System Certification, and other top officials at both the National 
Association of State Election Directors (NASED), and even the GAO, were 
included in the series of email communications, The BRAD BLOG has learned.

    The vulnerability was initially discovered by a panel of scientists 
convened by the State of Florida to study the possible causes for the FL-13 
election debacle. The team's discovery revealed that a design issue in the 
widely used iVotronic system could allow for a viral attack, by a single 
individual, which could then spread unnoticed throughout the electronic 
election infrastructure of an entire county.

    A similar vulnerability was found in DRE touch-screen system made by 
Diebold last Summer by a team of computer scientists at Princeton University.

    Attempts to seek information about EAC plans to notify other states and 
local jurisdictions that use the same vulnerable voting systems as the one 
in FL-13 have been met with an astounding refusal, troubling denial, 
buck-passing, and a lack of accountability by the federal commission of 
Presidential-appointees. The agency has also come under fire in recent weeks 
for a number of questionably partisan decisions and other failures to 
perform as mandated by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002.

    Of late, the EAC has been forced to respond to a great deal of 
controversy, on a number of different operational matters and policies, as 
revealed by a series of articles on this site and in mainstream outlets such 
as the New York Times and USA Today. Several of those matters have drawn 
Congressional notice, questioning of EAC officials, and letters of inquiry. 
Thus, this latest revelation is likely to add to the rising concern of 
Congress members as new federal legislation introduced by Rep. Rush Holt 
(D-NJ), currently facing mark-up by a Congressional committee, would 
permanently fund the now-embattled EAC. Funding for the agency was 
originally mandated by HAVA only through 2005.

    The new ES&S iVotronic vulnerability first emerged on February 23, 2007, 
when the Florida Dept. of State released a report detailing their findings 
from the investigation into what happened in Sarasota's still-contested 
Jennings/Buchanan race. That election was ultimately decided by just 369 
votes. The state's official findings included a report [PDF] [2] conducted 
by an eight-member computer science and technology team under the auspices 
of Florida State University (FSU). The report sought, unsuccessfully, to 
determine the cause of the unexplained "undervotes" reported by the 
iVotronic touch-screen voting systems used in Sarasota's portion of the 
FL-13 race on Election Day and in early voting.

    Although the reason thousands of votes turned up missing from those 
systems remained unknown, the study team did discover a serious security 
flaw in the iVotronic system that is used in Sarasota and many other 
jurisdictions across the country (and even the world, as France is set to 
use the same systems in their upcoming Presidential Election.)

    Election integrity watchdog John Gideon, a frequent BRAD BLOG 
    contributer and the Co-Director and Information Manager for VotersUnite.org, 
says that the security flaw may pertain to "every ES&S iVotronic voting 
machine used in the US and overseas." A total of eight separate versions of 
the system - without and without so-called "voter verified paper audit 
trail" (VVPAT)" printers - are currently approved as qualified at the 
federal level, he explained. Three of those are definitely affected and it 
is likely that the others are as well.

    The details, the dangers, and the denials are all described below...

    *"It Needs to Be Taken Very Seriously"...*

    As detailed by information in the FSU report, the ES&S iVotronic is 
vulnerable to a very dangerous attack by a single person which could result 
in an election, across an entire county, being flipped without notice.

    One computer scientist who has closely reviewed the team's findings 
warned via email, "The FSU report revealed a serious security vulnerability 
in the iVotronic: it is vulnerable to viruses that could be introduced by a 
single outsider and that could spread throughout a county. This means that a 
single outsider in a county that uses the iVotronic Firmware version 8 could 
potentially steal all the votes in that county, without being detected."

    "In my opinion," the scientist warned, "the severity of this security 
hole is roughly comparable to that of the Hursti II / Princeton virus-which 
is to say it needs to be taken very seriously." Though the scientist asked 
not to be identified publicly, his warning was shared with the EAC and is 
now posted online in full at VotersUnite.org.

    Both the so-called "Hursti II" report and the Princeton discovery, as 
first reported by The BRAD BLOG, rocked the nation's voting system 
manufacturers and election officials alike when they revealed extraordinary 
vulnerabilities in touch-screen electronic voting systems made by Diebold, 
Inc., last year during, and just prior to, the nation's primary election 
cycle.

    "This is further evidence that it's not just one vendor who has serious 
security problems; it's a second instance [of] this sort of virus 
vulnerability," the scientist writes.

    "Don't let anyone tell you that if we just 'kick Diebold off the island' 
all of the security problems will go away."

    The scientific warning includes detailed steps on how to mitigate the 
problem for several different versions of the ES&S iVotronic, all of which 
are vulnerable to the attack.

    Gideon took the warning to heart and forwarded it to the EAC with a 
request that the important e-voting security issue be shared with other 
states under the EAC's "clearinghouse" mandate. But the EAC has refused.

    The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires the EAC to act as a national 
"clearinghouse" for election administration and voting system information. 
As stated on the EAC website:

	The Election Assistance Commission is designed to serve as a
	national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of
	information and review of procedures by.... Maintaining a
	clearinghouse of information on the experiences of State and
	local governments in implementing the guidelines and in
	operating voting systems in general.

    Despite their mandate, and admission of same, EAC spokeswoman Jeannie 
Layson replied to Gideon that the iVotronic was qualified by the National 
Association of State Election Directors [9] (NASED) and thus was not the 
responsibility of the EAC. NASED was the body which oversaw federal testing 
of systems until the EAC took over the process fully earlier this year.

    *Not the EAC's Problem...*

    In the EAC's refusal to take accountability for warning states of the 
newly discovered danger, along with the buck passing over to NASED, Layson 
failed to recognize that current EAC Executive Director Tom Wilkey [10] was 
the chair of the NASED committee at the time they federally qualified 
several of the virus-prone ES&S voting machines.

    Nonetheless, whoever gave federal qualification to the system in the 
past, it is now clearly the responsibility of the EAC to inform states about 
the issue now that it has become known, Gideon argues, echoing the 
sentiments of the GAO in two different reports.

    Dumbfounded at the EAC response, Gideon wrote back expressing his dismay 
to Layson:

	My concern is NOT whether the system was NASED qualified
	or EAC certified. My concern is a problem was found with
	two versions of a voting system and there are mitigating
	solutions to these problems. The EAC is supposed to be a
	"clearinghouse" of information. Ms. Davidson [EAC Chair
	Donetta Davidson - also a former member of NASED's Voting
	Systems Board when it was chaired by Wilkey] - pointed
	out recently that the EAC's middle name is "Assistance."
	It seems like the EAC is neither acting as a "clearinghouse"
	nor "assisting" when it ignores reports from prominent
	computer scientists about a large security issue with a
	voting system that is being used in many, many
	jurisdictions around the country.

    Layson responded that the "clearinghouse" only applied to studies 
conducted by the EAC - like a recent bi-partisan "voter fraud" study and 
another on "Voter ID." The commission is currently under fire for its 
partisan rewrite of the former, and the "Voter ID" study which, though 
commissioned by the EAC as well, was similarly dismissed by the agency after 
the team of presidential appointees were unhappy with its reported findings.

    As for warning states and voters of voting machine problems, Layson 
refused to take responsibility. She maintained, in defense of the EAC, that 
their new program for voting system certification is just now being put into 
place, and thus they won't act on problems found in systems approved 
previously by NASED.

    "The EAC['s new] certification program will collect anomaly reports," 
Layson wrote in an email to Gideon, "which we will then investigate and 
share with election officials and the public."

    Gideon expressed his amazement in his next email response, and attempted 
again to encourage the EAC to do their HAVA-mandated duty. Responding to the 
EAC's communications director, he wrote:

	I'm amazed that instead of answering the questions you
	conflate the certification of voting systems with a
	security vulnerability that is in existence across the
	country. This issue has nothing to do with the EAC
	certification program. It has to do with the EAC
	recognizing that there may be a problem and then taking
	action to ensure states and local jurisdictions are
	aware of that problem.

    Layson held her "not-our-problem" ground, stating in reply that 
shortcomings of NASED testing and qualification were, incredibly, not the 
business of the EAC.

    "Again, as we have discussed many times, we did not certify this voting 
system," Layson responded, deflecting Gideon's written concerns once again.

    "If [the ES&S iVotronic system] successfully completes EAC's 
certification program in the future, then it would be subject to our rules 
and conditions, and if a problem occurs we would notify the election 
community and the public," she reiterated in the follow-up reply.

    *The GAO Disagrees...*

    Layson's denial of EAC responsibility in warning the public of the 
serious Florida findings is also in sharp contrast with a recent finding by 
the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

    In a 2005 report [PDF], requested by Congress on "Federal Efforts to 
Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems," the GAO was 
critical of the EAC's failure to inform the public of such concerns about 
vulnerabilities in voting systems:

	The continued absence of a national clearinghouse
	for voting system problems means that segments of
	the election community may continue to acquire and
	operate their systems without benefit of critical
	information learned by others regarding the security
	and reliability of those systems.

    The 2005 GAO report recommended the EAC, "Improve management support to 
state and local election officials ... for sharing information on the 
problems and vulnerabilities of voting systems."

    A follow-up GAO report [PDF] submitted to Congress last month, stated 
that the EAC had allocated some $3.5 million - twenty-five percent of its 
total budget - to establish themselves as "a national clearinghouse of 
election administration information."

    However, two years and $3.5 million later the "clearinghouse" is still 
not operational, as confirmed by the 2007 GAO report:

	[W]e have recommended that the EAC develop a process and
	associated time frames for sharing information on voting
	system problems and vulnerabilities across the election
	community.... Not yet defined are the mechanisms to collect
	and disseminate information on problems and vulnerabilities
	that are identified by voting system vendors and independent
	groups outside of the national certification process.

    Meanwhile, the newly-identified security flaw in ES&S voting machines, 
all over the country, is like a hidden time bomb about which the EAC refuses 
even to post an advisory on their website. The hidden flaw awaits 
exploitation in a viral strike - if such an attack has not already occurred 
- and yet the EAC has expressed a complete unwillingness to even alert state 
and local officials.

    The future of the EAC itself is now very much in play. Federal 
legislation - the "Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act" 
(HR811), as proposed by Rep. Rush Holt, will for the first time remove 
HAVA's previous 2005 funding "sunset." The act would make the EAC a 
permanently funded federal body under the control of the White House.

    And yet, the EAC's "clearinghouse" is beginning to smell like an 
    outhouse.

    Gideon, who has spent years trying to effect positive change at the EAC 
in attempts to hold them accountable for their mandate as the sole federal 
oversight body for voting systems, told The BRAD BLOG recently in 
frustration, "They just don't care."
