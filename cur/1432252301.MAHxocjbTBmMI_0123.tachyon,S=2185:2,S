There is a constant 20 years lag between a crack and public awareness of the
same. We'll know in 2016.

But you are reasonably safe in the meantime - remember, during WW2 Germans
submarines were allowed to sink many ships in order to mask breaking of Enigma.
The tactic for others was to send planes to 'accidentally' spot the submarine.
All analogies are perfectly valid today. To maintain the potential crack
technology an asset, they will have to use plausible classical means of
discovering the plaintext.
