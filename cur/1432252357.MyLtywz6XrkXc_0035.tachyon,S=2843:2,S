The cypherpunk's grip on reality has long been tenuous, but the reality
distortion field has now been tuned to maximum.  The plain language of
printed text is now apparently invisible to the cypherpunk eye:

> Notice how its not an evil "assault rifle" but a "combat rifle" now...

> http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-000079569oct05.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dcalifornia

> National Guard troops with M-16 assault rifles are to report for guard
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> The harder bullet used by the assault rifle is more likely to ricochet
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
