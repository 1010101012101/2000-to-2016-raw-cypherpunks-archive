Let me give you a hint: a tree is an acyclic graph.

The Internet shown in Eugen's pretty pictures is defined by BGP4 peerings
between autonomous systems.  It is highly cyclic, because everyone wants
it that way.

As a network, a tree is a delicate structure: any break in links fragments
the network.

Network engineers spend a lot of time making sure that their networks, and
the Internet, are not trees.  Multiple peering and transit relationships
make the network robust - and cyclic.
