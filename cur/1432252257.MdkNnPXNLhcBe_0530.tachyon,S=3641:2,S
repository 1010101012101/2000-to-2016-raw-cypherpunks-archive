Whoever it is you are quoting (I can't tell), this is nonsense.

Bunker busters were used in the Gulf War...are you too young to recall

None of these bunker busters were nukes. Some were already-developed 
earth-burrowing warheads. Some were quickly-developed weapons based on 
converting large gun barrels (used on ships) into bombs.
