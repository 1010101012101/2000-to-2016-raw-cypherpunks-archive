What's the deal with the FCC fining (censoring) a Colorado radio
station for playing the _censored_ version of one of his songs?

#    SHADY MOVES LEAD TO FINE FOR RADIO STATION
#    
#    A radio station in the US has been fined $7,000 for playing 
#    EMINEM's 'THE REAL SLIM SHADY', even though the tune had been 
#    edited for broadcast.
#    
#    The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) slapped the fine 
#    on KKMG-FM of Colorado Springs because, it said, the station 
#    had be censured despite the edit, because of the tone of the 
#    tune.
#    
#    "The edited version of the song contains unmistakable offensive 
#    sexual references. In this regard, portions of the lyrics contain 
#    sexual references in conjunction with sexual expletives that 
#    appear intended to pander and shock," they said in a statement.
#    
#    Two months ago, the FCC issued new guidelines to be used when 
#    determining what is obscene and what is decent and made it clear 
#    that innuendo was a factor, even if specific expletives were 
#    missing.
#    
#    The fine has been roundly condemned. Hilary Rosen, chief of the 
#    RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) told Variety 
#    magazine that: "It would be a disgrace if the FCC were to impose 
#    a violation on a radio station because they didn't like the 
#    'suggestive' nature of a song. That goes right to the heart of 
#    idea-based censorship."
#    
#    A spokesperson for Citadel Communications, KKMG-FM's parent 
#    company, said the fine set a dangerous precedent.
#    
#    "The danger involved is that folks at the station level can't 
#    take comfort in the fact that something labelled 'radio edit 
#    version' is in compliance with the FCC's rules," he said
