   Generally, at StockNight we tend to feature financial news items
   that have come out after market but sometimes news falls into our
   hands that is of such significance that we distribute to our
   members as soon as possible. We just received authorization
   moments ago to send this news to our members. Read on!

   Elast Technologies Inc.                                    [Image]

   Elast Technologies Inc. (OTCBB: ELTI) is presently engaged in two
   unique industries using applications of its patented technology.
   The first, the innovative Electronic Allergo Sensitivity Test, is
   an instrument with which allergies and food and chemical
   sensitivities may be detected without invading the body. Another
   application, the Bio-Potential Instrument, allows chiropractors
   the means with which to gauge the benefit of chiropractic care.
   The merger with PTS Inc. today brings yet another unique body of
   technology under the ELTI listing, some of whch could be affected
   dramatically by Chinese admission to the World Trade
   Organization.  Click here to read CNN's take on China, Technology
   & the WTO.

                ELAST Technologies Merges with PTS, Inc.

   LAS VEGAS-- ELAST Technologies, Inc. ( OTCBB: ELTI ) announced it
   has merged with PTS, Inc., a Nevada corporation organized in 1999.

   PTS is committed to the development of a truly global trading
   platform to facilitate everyday business transactions. Through its
   pending joint venture with a major Shanghai information technology
   firm and the venture's forthcoming launch of a China based
   business-to-business platform PTS will take a major step towards
   this goal. PTS' China platform will permit real time business
   transactions such as electronic payments, contract fulfillment and
   the dissemination of financial information in China. Upon China's
   accession to the World Trade Organization PTS will be uniquely
   positioned to expand its platform globally conducting transactions
   of any size, anywhere, across multiple currencies.

   Through this merger ELAST Technologies will be favorably
   positioned in two important and emerging fields, electronic
   payment and electronic medicine, and the potential presented by
   each is limitless. Moreover, ``ELAST's merger with PTS should
   assure early perfection and delivery of ELAST's diagnostic tools,
   as well as reduced engineering and production costs,'' predicts
   Thomas F. Krucker, President and CEO.

   Currently, ELAST is engaged in the development of two separate
   diagnostic tools: its allergy testing device and its chiropractic
   outcome-measuring instrument. These instruments stem from the
   Company's identification of commercial applications for worldwide
   patents secured by its founder, Robert D. Milne, MD. A primary
   application is the innovative Electronic Allergo Sensitivity Test
   or the ELAST Device(TM). The ELAST Device(TM) is a non-invasive
   medical tool that is being designed to accurately diagnose
   allergies, as well as food and chemical sensitivities. ELAST
   Technologies holds the patents, trademarks and legal rights to
   manufacture, sell and lease its electronic allergy-testing device
   and is making great strides in refining the prototype.

   A second application of ELAST's technologies is ELAST's
   Bio-Potential Instrument. The Bio-Potential Instrument can provide
   doctors of chiropractic with the means to measure the damage of
   vertebral subluxations, as well as the normalizing effect of
   chiropractic adjustments. ELAST plans initial delivery of its
   Bio-Potential Instrument shortly.
