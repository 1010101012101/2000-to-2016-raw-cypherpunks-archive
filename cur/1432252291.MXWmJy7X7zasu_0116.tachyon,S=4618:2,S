This is one area where I think Microsoft worked around the export control
problem in a nice way.  By keeping the more secure keys available as a
separate download (via rsaenh.dll i believe), and isolating the key strength
.dll from the csp api .dll, they've managed to keep a simple and consistent
csp api.  If a customer needs a stronger key he/she can simply download the
stronger rsaenh.dll to get it -- without mucking around with the entire
crypto service.  Apple could have easily implemented a similar concept.

Apple is a pretty computer and everything, but there's so much to be desired
from their os programmers (not saying microsoft is the best, just saying the
mac os really stinks.)
