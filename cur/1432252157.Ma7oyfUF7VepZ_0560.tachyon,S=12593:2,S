Well, IAAL and today seems to be legal terminology 101 day.  If only I billed
for these hours...

I can only assume you pulled this from some odd orifice or Perry Mason re-run
because it bears little relation to fact.

Obstruction of Justice- Impeding or obstructing those who seek justice in a
court, or those who have duties or powers of administering justice therein.
The act by which one or more persons attempt to prevent, or do prevent, _the
execution of lawful process_.  The term applies also to obstructing the
administration of justice in any way- as by hindering witnesses for appearing,
assaulting process servers, influencing jurors, _obstructing court orders_ or
criminal investigations...  (emphasis mine).

In this case, such of it that I know, it's going to be contempt of court
that's going to be more onerous in any event, but if you have been irritating
enough you can probably expect an obstruction charge too, particularly as your
refusals begin to look more like actions and not mere inaction.

Also remember the recourse of the unjustly incarcerated contempt sufferer- an
expensive, slow and usually useless appeal.

I suppose if I wanted to stifle it as a judge I'd also order the production of
all "media, machinery, computer equipment or other tangibles containing the
content.... blah blah blah."  Again, it's all evidence.  It's all within the
court's power to grab.  It's an entirely legitimate act of the court to
attempt to control and otherwise restrict the distribution of evidence or to
protect it from destruction or distribution (such as in a libel case).
Remember the mystery implement inside the envelope in the OJ case and all the
expert imagery wonks analyzing the shadows and contours of the envelope to
determine that it might be a big knife?
By involving third party system administrators you've done nothing but make it
more expensive for third parties who are going to lose the stuff if its seized
or otherwise subject to discovery.

There are a few cypherpunks probably listening to this who've been smacked
with subpoenas for running remailers.  I think you'll find that the government
is pretty persuasive to third parties like these.  The only defense (which one
administrator of a remailer I won't name was clever enough to set himself up
with) is to say (my paraphrasing) "I don't have access to those logs or any of
that data.  I don't keep such logs and I never have because it's too much
overhead and work."

You miss the point.  They don't have to do diddily.  By this point you've been
ordered by the court to produce such documents.  So produce them or direct the
court to them or pay the price and have the court get them anyhow.

The difference is that in #3 the witness does not have physical or logical
control of the evidence and cannot, even if she or he wanted to, produce it or
otherwise allow the court to put its hands on it or prevent its distribution.
I disagree that the data is "out of her control" in example #2.  Courts aren't
fond of leaks.

Ask the question: Can the witness produce the document?  If the answer is yes,
then the witness will have to.  Ask the question: Can the court prevent the
distribution of the data (via gag order).  If the answer is yes then you can
expect it to be prevented.

The time of the mailing is unimportant.  If the data is known or should have
been known to be the probable subject of an investigation you're still on the
hook.

That's implicit in the "all copies and reproductions" language.  Ask yourself
how amused the court is going to be with your clever arguments.  (Jim Bell
transcripts are probably a good indication of how courts are going to treat
mouthy geeks).

Totally false.  The court has made an order.  It involved the production of
documents or other potentially exculpatory and material evidence.  You pretty
much have to comply because the court says so.  Well, let me rephrase that.
You can refuse and spend some time in lockup until you decide maybe you want
to comply.  (That can be a long wait.  Years is not unheard of).

That person is pretty clearly obstructing justice.  I'd suggest they not hang
about the U.S. if they decide to knowingly distribute material that is under
subpoena or a gag order or somesuch.  Very naughty.  If I were a judge I'd
certainly encourage the prosecutor to order marshals to apprehend that
individual and bring them before me for some special attention.

> Mike

I do wish people would just do their homework before making these kinds of
assertions.  There is a wealth of information on gag orders, restriction of
publication, court ordered seizures of manuscripts and etc.  Just spend some
time on your own rather than being lazy enough to have someone else explain it
all to you.  (I suppose I encourage this behavior by responding to this
silliness).

Really the acronym "IANAL" bothers me because it's effectively a stone cold
certainty that the author is about to render some legal advice and expects to
be taken seriously.  Like some kind of magic talisman for people to be stupid
and still contribute their blather to the conversation.  A certain blowhard
used ascii "smileys" to do the same thing, as if the magic effect of a :)
allowed him blanket license to be a complete wad of ear cheese whenever he
liked.

No one would take "I am not a doctor but if you whack that lump down with the
claw side of a hammer a few times it should go right away" seriously, why does
IANAL seem to give carte blanche to armchair members of the Court TV Bar?
