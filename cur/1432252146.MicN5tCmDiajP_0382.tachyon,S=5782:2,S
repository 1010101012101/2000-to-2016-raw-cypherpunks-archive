Yes. People keep claiming that it is just too hard to encrypt email. =
There are plugins for all platforms. If you can=92t send encrypted =

that if it can=92t be done in just a few keystrokes (content included) =
then it is too hard or tl;dr.

Remember the old days when there wasn=92t PPP and SLIP connections? =
Before broadband. When a conversation on IRC was enjoyable, the right =

#unix on efnet.

No, everyone can afford a smartfone now a days.

broken?

Life is full of levels of grey, and so is security. That password you =
use on new sites you don=92t trust vs your gpg/pgp passphrase. The =
sheeple don=92t have levels of grey with regards to security, either =
take it to their grave or everyone can see.

Chatting with someone who was looking to start his own desktop Linux =
distro. I suggested an encrypted messaging platform over the =
security-hole-riddled platform he was using and he told me he had =
nothing to hide. I told him he wasn=92t the kind of person who should be =
developing anything security related.

Security takes effort that people are not will to expend.
