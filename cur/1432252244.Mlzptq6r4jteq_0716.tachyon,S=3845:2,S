Indeed. The frog has been adjusting to the heating water rather too 
well. It's time to flash cook the frog.

I'm watching a "Nightline" report on the growing anger over how the 
ubermensch elite in Congress were fawned over and given Cipro while the 
untermensch lumpenproletariat postal workers were told "Don't worry, be 
happy!"

Now, with no Congressvarmints sick, but with two mail sorters having 
gone postal to the max, with dozens of others sick or diagnosed with 
inhalation anthrax, the anger is building.
