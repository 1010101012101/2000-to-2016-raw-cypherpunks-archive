Communism can't be a form of Capitalism. In fact they are the anti-thesis.

Actually capitalism is the belief that it's the ONLY mechanism to solve
problems.

That IS the problem, that is also the difference between 'commerce' and
'capitalism'.

In commerce, trade is the means that people use to protect themselves and
provide for themselves. Capitalism is the use of money to manage the
society. Not the same thing at all. 'commerce' is a means, 'capitalism' is
an end.
