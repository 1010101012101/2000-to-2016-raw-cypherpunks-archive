It's all equally important, although I intend to identify nodes or peers
rather than people (who may operate many nodes).

Can you elaborate on this? By metadata I was thinking of things like

I was thinking of a log of how much data was transferred and the transfer
rate. The type of metadata you're describing is kept secret in my system.

The point of doing this is so both ends can authenticate the other party as
the same party who signed data they're interested in. CurveCP still uses DH
to generate an ephemeral session key.

I was to CodesInChaos earlier on about this approach on the CurveCP and he
said he looked into it before and thought it seemed sound.

I ran across CurveCP before and had forgotten about it. Embedding and

Yeah, uTP is definitely nice in that it has the congestion part licked
(perhaps too well). It would be neat to try to take the CurveCP encryption
protocol design and sort of layer it on top of uTP.

Yeah, this is definitely something else I am extremely interested in. I
have been looking at a friend's capabilities-based JavaScript wrapper
around <iframe sandbox> which seemed like it'd be an interesting way to
sandbox web applications being loaded from a system like the Cryptosphere.
They could talk back to a parent iframe via postMessages and request
various services from the system. See:
