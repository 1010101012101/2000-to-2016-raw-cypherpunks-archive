I went. It was a good talk. The room was jam packed. Brian is very 
forthright and sincere. After he finished speaking, Richard Stallman 
gave an uninvited rebuttal speech,  saying Palladium was very 
dangerous and ought to be banned.  His concerns are legitimate, but 
the net effect, I think, was to make the Q&A session that followed 
less hostile.

Palladium sets up a separate trusted virtual computer inside the PC 
processor, with its own OS, called Nexus, and it own applications, 
called agents. The trusted computer communicates with a security 
co-processor on the mother board,  and has a secure channel to your 
keyboard and mouse and to a selected window on your CRT screen.

How to prevent the secure channel to the on-screen window from being 
spoofed is still an open problem. Brian suggested a secure mode LED 
that lights when that window has focus or having the secure window 
display a mother's-maden-name type code word that you only tell 
Nexus.  Of course this doesn't matter for DRM since *your* trusting 
the window is not the issue.

All disk and network I/O is done thru the untrusted Windows OS on the 
theory that the trusted machine will encrypt anything it wants to 
keep private. Windows even takes care of Nexus scheduling.

A major design goal is that all existing software must run without 
change. Users are not required to boot Palladium at all, and are to 
be able to boot it long after Windows has booted.

The specific question never came up. As Brain did say, Palladium is 
just a platform. People can built whatever they want on top of it. 
It seemed clear to me that the primary goal is DRM, but as someone 
else in the audience said (approximate quote) "We always hear that 
you can't do this or that without trusted hardware. Well, this is 
trusted hardware."  I don't see why anyone would think protecting 
software copyright could not be done.

No. The SCP is based on a smart card core and is to be a "light 
weight, low pin count chip" with a target cost of $1 in volume.  I 
presume future deals between MS and Intel are always possible.

The SCP will support several algorithms, including 2048-bit RSA, 
128-bit AES, SHA1, an HMAC. They may include another cipher and 
another hash. There will also be a FIPS140-2 Random Number Generator 
and several monotonic counters, but no time of day clock. Each chip 
will have a unique RSA key pair, an AES key and a HMAC key. The only 
key that the SCP will reveal to the outside is the RSA public key and 
it will only do that once per power up cycle.

There is also a change to the PC memory management to support a 
trusted bit for memory segments. Programs not in trusted mode can't 
access trusted memory. Also there will be three additional x86 
instructions (in microcode) to support secure boot of the trusted 
kernel and present a SHA1 hash of the kernel code in a read only 
register.  There may be a hole somewhere, but Microsoft is trying 
hard to get it right and Brian seemed quite competent.

Near as I can see, the real trust comes from the RSA key pair stored 
in the SCP and a cert on that key from the SCP manufacturer.  There 
is no command to obtain the private key from the SCP.  Presumably 
they leverage smart card technology plus what ever tricks they think 
of to make it hard to get that key.   Differential power analysis or 
HNO3 might do the trick. We'll have to wait and see.

The real question from Microsoft's stand point is will the 
entertainment industry be satisfied with Palladium's level of 
security and release content that can play on Palladium equipped PCs? 
DVDs aren't Hollywood's main problem.  Movies are becoming available 
online long before the DVD is released.  Hollywood probably wants 
something that monitors ALL content for watermarks. Palladium as 
presented doesn't do this.  But again it is a platform. Once it 
exists, a later version of Windows might require it to be up and 
would then verify all content displayed.  If Hollywood doesn't 
convince Microsoft to do this, Sen. Hollings will be more than glad 
to introduce the necessary legislation. To paraphrase Stallman's 
rant, in the Palladium context Alice and Bob are corporations and 
Mallory is the PC owner.
