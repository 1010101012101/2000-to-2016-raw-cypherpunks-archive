"So far, U.S. and European authorities battling terrorism and cybercrime
have apparently focused their surveillance elsewhere. The FBI and the
National Security Agency, which monitors international telecommunications,
declined to comment on what strategy, if any, they have for dealing with
remailers."

That would have made the article much more interesting..

What *is* the FBI/etc.'s strategy on dealing with remailers, other than
ignoring them (and hoping that anti-spam/anti-terror legislation will make
them illegal?)
