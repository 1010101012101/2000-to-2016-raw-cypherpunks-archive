Apparently, yes:

It's nice that war on drugs, fighting terrorists and pedophiles have become
great markers for rabid anti-freedom campaigns.

In other news, over two days 800 individual homes in Germany were searched for
the crime of
media and program "piracy", culminating 2-year criminal investigation, a
service publishing
just p2p links (no content hosted) to moviez was shut down in
Switzerland, the 25-year-old operator quite likely to be issued a stiff
criminal penalty, digital smartcard ID is about to be issued for 2006 to any
employed warm body (very likely with a RFID as well) in Germany, and
biometrics (EU-wide, but
quite likely to interoperate with NA and other usual suspects).

Business as usual, in other words, with zero awareness on the side of the
governed.
