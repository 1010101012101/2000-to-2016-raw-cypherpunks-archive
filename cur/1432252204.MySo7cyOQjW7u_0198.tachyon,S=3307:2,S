Russians are usually skinnier.  You think DS won't have post-traumatic
fun?

Nice of Chuckie to jail a guy with two small kids.  Guess he didn't
learn much about the
appropriate use of force.

Obviously protesters doing anything *physically* threatening is just
stupid,
opposite to the 'appropriate use of force' principle, and generally
harmful
for getting this engineer out of immediate  hassle.  As stupid as trying
to
toss a heavy metal cylinder at a riot cop who'se got a head shot at
close range.
