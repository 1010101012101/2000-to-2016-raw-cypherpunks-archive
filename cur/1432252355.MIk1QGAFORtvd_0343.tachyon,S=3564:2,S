There already are options on bitcoins. #bitcoin-otc [1] nominally
supports them in its order book, though I see little use so far [2].
Apparently someone wrote a put for 100BTC at a strike price of
$0.75/BTC with a 1.50BTC premium two months ago, maturing 31 May 2011
[3]; the option did in fact sell but I have no idea whether it was
exercised. Bitcoin calls have been around on the forum since at least
January [4], complete with risk reversal strategies ([5] is a textbook
example of a collar though not a zero-premium one).
