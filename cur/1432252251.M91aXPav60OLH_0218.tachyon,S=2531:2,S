Actually that's so much whaledreck. They in fact are -not- related at all.

In fact if one talks of 'individuals' then -no- concept of 'property'
-ever- arises. It is only until one brings in two or more than -any-
concept of 'property' has any meaning at all.

The connection between 'private freedom' and 'property' is really a
strawman. What matters is life, liberty, and the -pursuit of hapiness-
and not collecting more 'stuff' than your neighbor. If anything it
demonstrates an exception lack of maturity and excessive insecurity.
