I read the article (thanks for the URL).

Nothing new, and, in fact, several of the old chestnuts about why 
regulation is needed.

The author also mentions that consumers dislike (so?) tracking of 
their purchases...and then in the next paragraphs cites the Firestone 
tire recall as an example of better policy than most Web sites have 
(or something like this...I re-read his analogy several times and 
still wasn't sure what his claim was). But the irony of juxtaposing 
Firestone and "customers dislike tracking" is delicious indeed! It is 
the existence of customer records--generally voluntarily provided by 
the customer--that allowed Firestone and Ford to contact hundreds of 
thousands of Explorer owners.

I wonder if the author appreciates the irony here?

All of this folderol about laws being needed to control privacy must 
be fought at every stage.
