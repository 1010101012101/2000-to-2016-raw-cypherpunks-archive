I was thinking of those boxes with viewing ports that you look into to get 
your eyes tested when you renew your drivers license. You could have those 
out in the open, that way you'd have the privacy (only turn the display on if 
the viewing port is completely covered), but if you tried to use a camera it 
would be pretty obvious (or you could design the lens of the port to make it 
impossible to discern the ballot except with the human eye(s)).

Here in the sticks we just use the ole' number two pencil to fill in the oval. 
Some fancy polling places run the ballot through a reader to verify that 
there aren't any problems (missing ovals, multiple votes, etc.). They'll let 
you have three tries  at it.

However, there doesn't seem to be anything to stop me from going back in a few 
hours later and claiming to be someone else at a different address other than 
the if the person has already voted or by relying on steel-trap memory of the 
volunteer elderly ladies than man the poll (of course in  our small town that 
can be pretty effective) :) .
