I think it's silly.

here we have a government which claims some understanding of the net yet
most of their network infrastructure is insecure.  and this open smtp
relay is just the tip of the iceburg.

a few years ago i scanned all military domain name servers for
vulnerabilities under the old buggy bind4.  A large number of military dns
were found to be insecure.

i then proceeded to contact these administrator to have them upgrade their
servers in order to secure them.  a handful did the rest just ignored the
warnings.

and i doubt much has changed today.

silly happy government
