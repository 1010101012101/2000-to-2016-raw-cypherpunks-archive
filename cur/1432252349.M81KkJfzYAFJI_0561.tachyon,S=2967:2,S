Why the BedSty student Tim?

This is where your arguments - which on shallow inspection may attempt
to lay claim to honest thought - fall down.  Why only the inner city black
schools?  I grew up in New York.  I am intimately familiar with BedSty, Red
Hook, etc.  But I am also familiar with at least two schools in white ghettos
(PS87/HS44), and I'm here to tell you from very personal experience, that
there is no significant difference.

You have some incredible moments of lucidity and insight, and occasionally,
we are the lucky recipients of these fleeting events - but then, just as sure
as the sun coming over the horizon every morning of every day, you slip back
into the pseudo-intellectual racist crap.  What's wit dat?

Even the Great Tim May cannot be taken seriously with the kind of
non-thought that has been coming out of your hermithole the last few years.
