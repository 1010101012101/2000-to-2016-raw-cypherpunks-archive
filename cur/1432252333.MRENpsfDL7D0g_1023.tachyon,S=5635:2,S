OHAI,

As somebody noted in some other thread here lately, "well, that escalated 
quickly".

1. I am "indigenous Polish", how does that make me worse or better than you?
2. I am not censoring anything, simply noting that you have already remarked
   on you being a "native American" and that I think we all got that.

I have no idea why you find it necessary to underline that fact so much, but 
hey, be my guest. You have the full right to do so -- as I have the right to 
remark on how unnecessary and completely unrelated to anything discussed in 
this thread it actually is (I'm sure there are better places to discuss this 
particular topic).

M'kay, thanks for sharing.

Okay, so the party responsible for the road. Fine by me -- in the case of 
software that would be the party that sub-licenses/sells it further. So not 
the guy who wrote the code for Microsoft, but Microsoft as the vendor (at 
least from the end-user perspective).

On the other hand, requiring the other party to an argument to formulate their 
thoughts clearly and intelligibly helps the discussion and allows for better 
understanding, and better argumentation. I fail to see how asking you to write 
in a more clear manner, especially on a list many subscribers of which are not 
native English speakers, is an "attack on a form".

Can we now please leave the linguistics and nationalities behind us and focus 
on what could be more aptly considered on-topic here?
