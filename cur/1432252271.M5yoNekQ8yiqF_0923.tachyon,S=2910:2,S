Without wanting to sound too facetious, and mostly out of curiosity, what does
FIPS 140 have to do with the threat modelling you've done?  It doesn't address
the vast majority of the stuff you've listed, so the threat-modelling is kind
of a non-sequitur to "starting with FIPS 140".  If you wanted to deal with
this through a certification process you'd have to go with something like the
CC (and an appropriate PP), assuming the sheer suckage of working with the CC
doesn't tear a hole in the fabric of space-time in the process.

Peter.
