Actually, the state legislature passed it, twice, and 
State Reptile\\\\\\\Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, twice.
So we had to do an initiative, which Wilson politicked against,
but it passed, so State Atty. General Dan Lundgen and the Feds
tried to gut it.   The new Democrat Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's
not helping any.

If you read the Federal drug laws, they start out by bald-facedly 
asserting that since it's hard to tell where a particular bunch of drugs 
comes from, Congress presumes that they may have originated in or 
be destined for interstate commerce, so they have jurisdiction.

(Even if it's a marijuana plant still attached to the ground....)


				Thanks!
