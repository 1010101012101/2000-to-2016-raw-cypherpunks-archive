There are several possible answers to what you have written.  First, at
least theoretically, your "'globalization' people" were elected to represent
the people.  In a democratic system, the people's "input" into the process
is the ballot box choice of their representatives.

That's theory.  Personally, I think the problem is the idea that we need
laws (i.e., the threat of violence) to address the problems in question.

I'm not sure what you are talking about.  What are the "forces of
capitalism" to which you refer?  Personally, I try to avoid the word
"capitalism" at all.  First, it's a pejorative Marxist term.  Second,
everybody seems to have a different definition.

If you mean "free market economics" I totally disagree with you.  If you
mean government welfare for favored businesses, well, we might have some
common ground there.  Clear definitions make all the difference in the
world.

I'm sorry, the Furby definition of capitalism isn't very cogent or helpful.

Why don't they know why?  Can't they read?  I have so sympathy for militant
ignorance when the world is awash in information about how things work.

Which issues are those?  So far, I haven't heard of ANY issues raised by the
rioters that are being ignored.  Controversial/unproven issues such as
"global warming" are being discussed ad nausea.  The main reason the
governments of the world aren't "doing something" is because no one knows
what really needs to be done.  Ignorant rioters THINK they know what needs
to be done, but there is no reason to believe they know squat about the
subject for which they claim to have such passion about.  Opinions--and
that's all we're talking about here--are like assholes; everyone has one.
