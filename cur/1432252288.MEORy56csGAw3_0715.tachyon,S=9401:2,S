Yes.  I know what a tree is, and I am quite familiar with structure of
the Internet.  These very pretty pictures certainly look like the Internet
I am familiar with, but don't resemble trees.

Over the last 30 years or so, various people have hypothesized about what
the "killer requirement" might be.  To the best of my knowledge, all have
been wrong.

The Internet is quite obviously optimizing along certain lines.  However,
these lines don't follow any geographical geodesic, which was my point.
And it is only obvious what the lines of optimization are in hindsight ;-)

If you try to replace observations with theories, the most important thing
is to verify that your theory corresponds with reality right now.  If your
theories aren't correct "currently", it is very unlikely that they will be
a better fit tomorrow.

It isn't a minor point that the Internet is fractal.  This is in fact
what is consistent everywhere and has been, to the best of my knowledge,
throughout the history of the Internet.  If you go back to your pretty
pictures and look, you will see fractal structures.

A geodesic is a minimal path in whatever geometry you are talking about.
If you looked carefully at traffic between European countries around
1999, it turned out that the minimal cost path between say German and
France was in fact through Virginia.  Traffic was following a geodesic --
but not a geographic geodesic.

As I recall, a 2 Mbps E1 between most major European cities and Virginia
was about $30,000 a month, but an E1 across the English Channel was around
$45,000 a month - 50% more to go 30 miles than to go 6,000.  We had
customers in Northern Ireland whose traffic to Dublin went first to
London, then to our PoP in California, then to Virginia, and from there
back to Ireland.  This was our financial geodesic.

I have spent time in both cities and am familiar with their layouts, but
really can't see how this relates to how fiber is laid out in Europe and
America.

Indeed.  But the point is that things tend _not_ to be optimized at the
macro level; what happens is the opposite, micro-optimization around the
results of previous decisions (some of which will have been just plain
wrong).  Roman engineers built roads a couple of thousand years ago,
optimizing things according to then-current theories and strategies.  We
lay down rivers of fiber along those roads, reenforcing those ancient
decisions, because the cost of reversing those ancient decisions, and all
of the incalculable number of micro-decisions that followed, would be
truly enormous.

You can see the same pattern working itself out now.  A group of Japanese
banks invested in a building in Docklands, Telehouse, to act as a backup
facility in case of a disaster in the City of London.  This turned out to
be a loser, in financial terms.  The Japanese had misjudged the market
demand for this kind of facility.

Some telcos had put a few racks in the building.  The first UK ISPs
followed them there, because the facility was cheap.  More ISPs followed.
Some decided to build an exchange point there, the LINX, following
somewhat misunderstood US models.  Things mushroomed; the building, which
had been quiet and empty, rapidly filled up with racks.  The owners built
another building across the street; investors built competing facilities a
short distance away, to be close to the action. All of these were
interconnected with more and more fiber.

The end result is that most UK Internet traffic, and a large part of
European traffic, passes through what used to be a more or less derelict
area of East London, all because of a planning error on the part of some
Tokyo-based banks.

Not at all.  Everywhere we see the same pattern of pearl-like growth:
someone makes a decision, and those that follow build around the first
decision, micro-optimizing as they go along, creating the odd fractal
shapes that are all around us.

This isn't physics.  It's much more like biology.
