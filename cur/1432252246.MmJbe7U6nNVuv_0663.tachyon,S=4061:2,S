I agree to some extent, but my assessment of the probabilities is still
that using Tor unencrypted is going to cause you new and interesting
security problems.

Privacy and anonymity are different things, and actually I am more
worried about privacy first.  There's no point using Tor to access a
cloud-based email service.  I want to focus on getting everyone's data
decentralized, and their communications encrypted.

Grugq's writing is very interesting: http://grugq.github.io/

He recommends using a VPN over Tor to avoid monitoring by malicious exit
nodes (which of course won't avoid monitoring by the VPN provider):
