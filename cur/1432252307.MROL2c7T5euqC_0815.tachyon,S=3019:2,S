I think this is far too complicated.  You just add your state PKI to
the browsers, and the CPS does not require any checks on the Common
Name, to verify it's actually somehow controlled by the certificate
holder.  Curiously, such CAs can pass Webtrust audits.

Now I'm a realist and assume that the bureaucrats involved are just
too incompetent to write a proper CPS (and the auditors to lazy to
notice).  Authoring policies and paying attention to detail, should be
second nature to them, but somehow I doubt that the FPKI (say) issues
certificates for non-federal entities to help with ongoing FBI
investigations.  (Same for the German government agencies who actually
managed to get Mozilla approval for their non-CN-checking CAs.)
