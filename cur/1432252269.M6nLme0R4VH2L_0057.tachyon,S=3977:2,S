Yes, this will turn out to be an incorrect prediction. Not one country
has taken serious steps to ban or limit crypto; in the U.S., even Gregg
never introduced his bill.

Tim does not equal cypherpunks, and not all of his predictions turn
out to be so off. It's difficult to predict the future accurately --
what would be more interesting is to compare relvant predictions made
by cypherpunks against predictions made by, say, groups of
politicians, academics, think tank types, and so on. Go for it.

This is actually partly true -- even Freenet, perhaps the most
promising cypherpunkly project with live code right now, barely gets a
mention on the list.
