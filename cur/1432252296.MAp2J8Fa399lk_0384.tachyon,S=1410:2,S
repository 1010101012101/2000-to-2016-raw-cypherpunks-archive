They need to be driving around in more heavily armored vehicles.
All the toys in the world won't help your Toyota repel an RPG.
Rather hard not to look obviously military in an APC though.

Next time the corpses won't be so roasted, perhaps, which
makes for much better video.  Also should leave the dogtags
(and head, limbs) on the meat.  Mmm, I love the smell of
merc-jerky in the morning, it smells like self-determination.
