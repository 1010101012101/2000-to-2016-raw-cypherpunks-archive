For the GNU/Linux and free 'Nix users in the crowd, I've got my own set
of reviews (about four months stale, update kinda in progress) at

    http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Linux/FAQs/browsers.html

My personal graphical pick:  Galeon.  Konqeror and Mozilla aren't too
far behind.  w3m and lynx are great for quick text browsing.  Dillo's a
blazingly fast, lightweight graphical browser, if you don't mind the odd
rough edge (no cookies, frames, animated gifs, cut'n'paste,
Java/Javascript -- most of which is IMVA a Good Thing(tm)).  Other
clients reviewed as well.  Netscape?  It sucks, blows, bites, and loses.

Peace.
