#    Autodesk to Market Location-Detection Software for Cellphones
#    
#    Autodesk Inc., a San Rafael, Calif., software company, created 
#    a new division to market location-detection software for use 
#    with wireless telephones. The software will allow wireless-te
#    lephone carriers to determine a cellphone's location and transmit 
#    information targeted to the phone's user, such as driving 
#    directions. The software is aimed at a new generation of 
#    cellphones being introduced this year and next in Europe and, 
#    in a few years, in the U.S. Autodesk said its customers include 
#    Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the Swedish mobile-phone maker,
#    Fiat SpA, the Italian car maker, and John Young Associates.
