More precisely its the exposed meta-data in the SMTP.  But why would you use
meta-data rich transport for silent circle internal-mail?  (Internal-mail I
mean silent circle user to silent circle user vs external mail being smtp
mail to silent circle user or silent circle user to smtp mail user).

I said it before, but again: why not cancel external mail, and leave the
internal mail working - silent circle obviously have the tech for that
because they have SMS equivalent in-mail.  Good for you: users who want to
continue to communicate will encourage the people they are communicating
with to also pay for subscriptions.  Maybe you could allow people to give
each other gifts of 1month membership, which you hope they extend
themselves; or some referal system with a bonus free month to the existing
user etc.

Now there might be some software legacy, but that seems straight forward
enough.  The crypto gap is purely the in and out mail.  (Other than forced
software changes, but others have discussed how to combat that issue, and
some claim legal advice is that its harder for the mil-int community to
legally force companies to change their software.  (Hushmail saga not
withstanding!)

We understand integer-based public-key cryptography well enough that it gives us the creeps. We kinda sorta understand ECC, but not as well as we think we do. I think our understanding of ECC is like our understanding of hash functions in 2003. Meow.

Look at things like Fishbowl, even. It's easy to get dazzled by the fact that Fishbowl is double encryption to miss that it's really double *implementations*.

Once you start buying 'sploits, why not build your own team to do them yourself, and cut out the middleman? Every other part of the tech world has seen disintermediation, what makes you think this is different.

You're trying to figure out who all is doing what to what parts of the music and it's horribly complex. And then accidentally one day, you lose the audio feed and then realize that it's *easier* to tell what the band is doing when the sound is off.

With the other hand, you revel in the glory of silence. In silence you can think. You watch the band, you watch square dance. You just watch who is pairing with whom, where the lines cross and the beats are. Sometimes you can even guess the tune by watching the dance (which is also cryptanalysis).
