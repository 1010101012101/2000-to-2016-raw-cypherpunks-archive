I can't say I'm surprised.  A decade or so ago, I went to an anarchist 
convention in Philly that was being watched by guys in suits in 
a big American car, who were identified as the Philly Police Red Squad.
I'd been surprised such things still existed.  We moved from the Quaker
school 
where the main convention was to an anarchist coffeeshop, and they reappeared.
(A Quaker friend of mine said "It's not a *real* anarchist meeting unless 
somebody brings them coffee and doughnuts." 
"Yeah, I offered to do that, but they'd brought their own thermos" :-)

That sounds like a clear case of libel.

Any chance of the ECPA applying to this surveillance?

Yup.  Red squads.  Nice that they can occasionally find a *real* Red to
be paranoid about, though I'm not sure where they can find a Communist
party with any funding.

PGP was of course designed for environments similar to this - 
people you've met in person introducing other people they've met in person,
particularly in the heavily infiltrated anti-nuke movement.
On the other hand, it was oriented towards True Names, where you're
usually pretty sure that if Bob signs a key for Carol who signs for Dave,
that you're really sending email to the Dave you thought you were sending
it to, 
though Dave may or may not be a Fed.
				Thanks!
