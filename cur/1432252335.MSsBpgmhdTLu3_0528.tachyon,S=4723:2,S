That makes the claim a might weak, at least in my perspective.

Is the Hollings bill you refer to S.2048?  In S.2048 they want to "plug
the analog hole".  It's far worse both econmicly and "big brother" wise.

How are they going to deal with all the processors now running that don't
have this "fritz" chip?  Deny them access to data?  Won't win over a whole
lot of votes that way, pissing off every grandfather in the country.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
