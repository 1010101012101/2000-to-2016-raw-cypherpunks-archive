Dear Snap Member,

We're excited to let you know that Snap.com is being enhanced and renamed 
to provide everything you need on the Web in one fantastic new site

we'll continue to improve and fine-tune our services in the coming weeks 
and months.

To create NBCi.com, we have taken the best features from Snap.com, 
combined them with the best features from our sister site XOOM.com and 
added hot information & entertainment content from NBC.  

How does this affect you?


If you have personalized services under MySnap  (stock portfolio, 
horoscope, weather, etc), all of your information is still available via 
the same member name and password.  This area is now called MyNBCi.

Some of NBCi's offerings will be new, and you'll see them rolling out in 
the weeks and months ahead.  However, we'll still offer our best-known 
services and continue to improve upon them.

What you will find on NBCi:

*	Fresh and relevant information on the subjects that interest 
	you most:  News, Personal Finance, Travel, Shopping, Health, 
	Technology, Entertainment and more!
