CYBER TERRORISM: Panel Releases Guidelines For Battling Cyber
Terrorism

A congressionally-mandated panel that has the ear of the Bush
administration and key lawmakers detailed its anti-terrorism
recommendations on Monday, offering its thoughts on cyber
security, the use of the military in response to terrorist
threats, border security, and the national health and medical
networks.

The Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for
Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction expedited the
release of its third and final report -- originally scheduled
for December -- after the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks in the
United States. It expects to forward its recommendations to the
White House and Capitol Hill within a "couple of weeks."
In an effort to combat cyber terrorism, the panel -- known as
the Gilmore Commission after its chairman, Virginia Gov. James
Gilmore -- recommended that any entity advising the president
have "broad representation" from state and local governments and
private industries that depend on information security. The
panel noted that the advisory group proposed by the Bush
administration to examine critical infrastructure includes only
senior national security officials.

The Gilmore Commission also recommended the establishment of a
government-funded group representing all stakeholders --
including law enforcement and private business -- to provide
cyber-security alerts and functions.

The panel found "major shortcomings" in the FBI's National
Infrastructure Protection Center, RAND project director Michael
Wermuth said at the panel's meeting.

The commission also suggested that Congress and the executive
branch hold a summit to address what changes in current law will
be necessary to address cyber-security issues. A "cyber court"
also should be created for U.S. attorneys, according to the
final report.

"This is the best way to be effective while at the same time
protect civil rights," Wermuth said, stressing that the panel
repeatedly emphasized that national security should not come at
the expense of civil rights.

The group recommended the creation of a federally funded
consortium for cyber security. Its task would be to develop a
plan for testing and evaluating cyber-security research.

The panel also said the federal government should reestablish
the operational capabilities of its effort to combat the Year
2000 computer bug as a way to combat cyber terrorism.

Gilmore said President Bush is "aware" of the report because
Vice President Richard Cheney met with the group in May. Gilmore
also said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge -- who will head the newly
created Office of Homeland Security -- told Gilmore on Friday
that he "wants very much" to get input from the Gilmore
Commission.

The commission also is getting more attention on Capitol Hill.
Gilmore told National Journal's Technology Daily that he spoke
with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
over the weekend, and Graham was "very interested in the entire
range and array" of the recommendations.

He said Graham is considering legislation on the issue. So far,
Graham is working on legislation that would expand the length of
some court orders to a year, and he supports efforts to give law
enforcement broader powers to track e-mail and Web-surfing
activities.
