     Sex is like fixing your '69 Corvette--you better use the right tool for the job or it'll be a disastor! The genetic lottery determines your penis size the instant your conceived-- *POOF* that's all you're getting!  But that's all about to change, thanks to modern science! Finally, a real formula has been designed to make IT bigger... FOREVER! No painful pumps or exercises are required! Just take a "Maxaman" pill with meals and watch it grow to amazing dimensions!

     * No more sighs of dissatisfaction from your woman, only cries of delight!
     * Stronger and longer orgasms for you and your partner!
     * No painful pumps, exercises, or dangerous surgery!
     * Results start in 2 weeks or less!
     * No side effects, 100% safe to use!
     * Gain atleast 2 inches or your money back!

     Size does matter. Be it too small or too large it still matters. The size of your penis is on a woman's mind. Women know what they like and are aware of the size and shape of the penises they've had.

	Listen to what a few of our previous customers have to say:

"Dear Sirs, Thanks for offering this formula. Me and my wife are having the best sex of our lives. I wake up in the morning knowing 	she's fully satisfied, and thats a great feeling. Thanks guys!" 
	- Jim from Carson City 

"Hi, I just wanted to let you know this formula is working wonders for me. I've gained 1.5 inches in just 3 weeks. I've tried the pumps and exercises and nothing worked. This was my last resort! Thanks guys!"
	- Art C. from Los Angeles

"Hello! Just wanted to thank you for offering such a great product. My boyfriend started taking the Maxaman pills while I was on 	vacation with my family.  When I got back a week and a half later, he told me he had a surprise for me. And boy what a surprise it was! Thanks again!"
	- Lauren from Newark, NJ

     
     Think about how you'll feel when she cries out your name during sex, or after it's over and she hugs you like she's never hugged you before. So place your order now! She will love you for it.
