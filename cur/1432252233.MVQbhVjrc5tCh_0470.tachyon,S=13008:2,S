Then, too bad.  They haven't *done* anything to you.

It has everything to do with liberty.  The kind of society you
envision is nightmarish: where everyone is required by law to act
in certain defined ways (not merely to refrain from acts which harm
others).

Indeed, you seem to be quite comfortable with police-state tactics so
long as the particular set of rules being enforced are those that you
approve of.

It seems that you're really not at all interested in freedom of any
kind.  Indeed, you share much with the so-called "liberal" elements
of US society.  Lots of lip service to compassion for other people,
equality and brotherhood, all enforced at the point of a gun.

Go to a dictionary and look up the several meanings of "freedom".
Then come back and tell me which one of those squares with your
notion of people being forced to do things they don't wish to do.

A complete non sequitur.  Indeed diametrically opposed to anything
I have said.  A lynch mob, almost by definition, is an imposition of
brute force against others.  (It must have been a tortured mental path
indeed that led from the exercising of one's rights to association and
enjoyment of one's own property to lynch mobs.  Someday maybe you'll
take the rest of us along for the ride, eh?)

I reject the premise as ridiculous and contrived.  But in a word, no,
I wouldn't say it is fair.  (Nor am I interested in striving for
"fairness", about which more below.)

It's quite apparent you have no trouble giving up your freedoms.
Worse, you have no trouble giving up mine too.

"When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean.  Neither
more, nor less." said Humpty Dumpty.

However, for the rest of us, "freedom" has a certain meaning which
you are not "free" to redefine.  In Sampo's Orwellian world, "freedom"
apparently means something else.

Absent a clearly established obligation or responsibility to perform
some action, it is quite easy to justify differential treatment.  And
our legal system at least has always done so.

I don't consider the radio spectrum to be particularly scarce, nor
do I support the necessity for it to be government-controlled.
Nonetheless, such a shared resource is not at all the subject that
was being discussed.

In other words, the shop owner *has* no rights.  Only responsibilities.
And if he behaves well, Sampo's world will let him keep some of the
benefits of his property and his labor.  (Not too much though!  He
might start to think he has a right to it!)

Your answer is already quite clear.

"Oppress"?  Where did that come from?  Again, your words are slippery
and seem to mean whatever you want them to mean from moment to moment.
I don't consider my failure to do as you wish I would "oppression".

First "oppress", now "exploit".  You've been reading your Marx again,
haven't you?  Again, my failure to satisfy your every whim does not
constitute "exploitation".

Fascism?  I don't see the relationship.  Indeed, it is your notion
that people must be forced to act in certain ways by an all-powerful
government, not mine.

Certainly not I.  Liberty is another word you could stand to look up.

Liberty does not equal equality.  Nor is equality a goal I would
espouse for the kind of society I believe in, since that inevitably
means taking from those who have more and giving to those who have
less (without regard to whether they "deserve" it or not).
