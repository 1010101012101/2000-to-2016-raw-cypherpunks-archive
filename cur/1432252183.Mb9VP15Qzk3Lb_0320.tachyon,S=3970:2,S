Believe it or not, I still have one mail route that travels over UUCP 
for the last link.  For the past 4 or 5 years, I've done UUCP over 
TCP/IP.  I'd think that one could tunnel that through SSL, though 
I've never tried to do it.

Heh... 19,200 was blazingly fast in those days, and the Telebit was 
set up for UUCP spoofing (the local modem faked the ACK packets 
to save turnaround time) to get better throughput.  Still, I think a 
56K modem could outpull a Telebit.
