i really can't emphasize this enough:

robust defense is based on realistic threats,
 and realistic threats are identified via attackers' perspective.

i've been diving down this rabbit hole since before i challenged
covert FLTINFOWARCEN members* to "get as blackhat on this motherfucker
as you can" during an ad hoc challenge at DEF CON 13.

i started down this path when i realized that robust peer to peer
systems must protect each node to the highest degree required by any
participant. it's the opposite of pandering to the "lowest common
denominator".

on the plus side, once you have addressed security for the "most
stringent requirement" all other systems and peers enjoy the benefit
of this elevated level of protection.

the bad news is that attacks continue to improve, and i'm no where
near satisfied in my ability to protect my own systems against the
capabilities myself and my peers have at their disposal.

the vast majority of infosec is useless bullshit, the vast majority of
infosec conferences are pandering crap; the whole industry
(educational/professional/military) is shit, if we're being honest.

there is a great talk, fuck you to thinkst.com for blocking it, which
covers these failings at just a conference level, with parallels to
the industry as a whole:
  http://207.198.103.187:8081/infosuck-talk_about_talks.pdf
  sha256: ce836410fdc638066bf6aedec0e1d6f2ce66fb46329c5f92336e42a671272e55

i've never taken an infosec position, for these reasons, among others,
and i don't plan to start.  quality (and by extension, information
security) should be a given, a "built-in" feature of any product, with
the investment necessary to achieve it.

anything less is bullshit; infosec should not exist!


my $0.02

best regards,



* hacker friends and i ran a challenge: here's the root password.
we're running unencrypted 802.11b wifi, there's a $100 bill in the
case. get in - you get money and the hardware!

everyone failed, despite two interesting 0day attacks. (we ran IPsec
with custom out-of-band keying seeded by VIA C5P hardware entropy
generators with our own custom rngd.)

after being unable to compromise our setup, $fed handed me a card. i
still remember the latin translation adorning his card, which seems
particular appropos given revelations this year:
  "let them hate us, so long as they fear us."
