re:    99% wrong  ---> judgement ---> 0.01% wrong

this is also how 'masters of the drug war' convict
entire generations to subservience and obeyance via

mass surveillance, a threat of pending prosecution
by the very people who engineered the war of drugs
against their own populations to gain total power
via cutting off, neutralizing generations below them

and using a false and unreal ethical framework to
then judge and prosecute political enemies lists

thus solidifying the ruling dictatorship, OOSOOM


(i.e. drug lord determines drug user bad for society

if they challenge authority, use legal rights, etc)
