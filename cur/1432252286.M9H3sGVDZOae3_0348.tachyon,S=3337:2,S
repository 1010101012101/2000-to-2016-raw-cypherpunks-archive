I'd prefer if people talked about PipeNet style traffic scheduling
instead of PipeNet style traffic padding. What's really important to
PipeNet security is that the timing of packets don't leak information,
and padding is just a part of what's necessary to achieve that kind
of timing. So I'd agree with you that padding by itself isn't sufficient,
but I'd be interested in hearing more if you think PipeNet as a whole
isn't sufficient.
