  Judge: Firm not negligent in failure to encrypt data

  A federal court has thrown out a lawsuit that accused a student-loan
  provider of negligence in failing to encrypt a customer database that was
  subsequently stolen.

  Stacy Lawton Guin, a customer of Brazos Higher Education Service, sued the
  corporation on the grounds that encryption should be used as a routine
  security precaution.

  But U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle in Minnesota dismissed the case last
  week, saying Brazos had a written security policy and other "proper
  safeguards" for customers' information and that it acted "with reasonable
  care" even without encrypting the database.

  ID fraud help

  Identity fraud isn't that likely to happen to you, but it does occur. CNET
  News.com has compiled a resource center with background information,
  statistics, and tips. A recent debit-card theft case has also drawn
  attention, and in response we've created a list of frequently-asked
  questions. Security protection is also being discussed at this week's RSA
  Conference.

  The case arose as a result of a burglary at the Silver Spring, Md., home of
  John Wright, a Brazos financial analyst who worked remotely and analyzed
  loan portfolios. During that September 2004 burglary, a laptop with
  personal information about Brazos customers was stolen.

  Brazos hired a private investigative firm, Global Options, to recover the
  laptop, but this was unsuccessful. The judge noted that there was no
  evidence that the database on the stolen laptop was used for identity
  fraud. After the theft, Brazos contacted approximately 550,000 of its
  customers to let them know of the situation and to suggest they place a
  security alert on their credit bureau files.

  Even though he had not actually been harmed as a result of the theft, Guin
  argued, Brazos was required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to encrypt
  personal information and limit its disclosure. The 1999 law requires
  financial service companies "to protect the security and confidentiality of
  customers' nonpublic personal information."

  Judge Kyle disagreed, saying that the house was in a relatively low-crime
  neighborhood and that the law does not specifically mandate encryption.
  "The GLB Act does not prohibit someone from working with sensitive data on
  a laptop computer in a home office," Kyle wrote. "Despite Guin's persistent
  argument that any nonpublic personal information stored on a laptop
  computer should be encrypted, the GLB Act does not contain any such
  requirement."
