   Collecting of Details on Travelers Documented
   U.S. Effort More Extensive Than Previously Known
   By [2]Ellen Nakashima

   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Saturday, September 22, 2007; Page A01

   The U.S. government is collecting electronic records on the travel
   habits of millions of Americans who fly, drive or take cruises abroad,
   retaining data on the persons with whom they travel or plan to stay,
   the personal items they carry during their journeys, and even the
   books that travelers have carried, according to documents obtained by
   a group of civil liberties advocates and statements by government
   officials.

   The personal travel records are meant to be stored for as long as 15
   years, as part of the [3]Department of Homeland Security's effort to
   assess the security threat posed by all travelers entering the
   country. Officials say the records, which are analyzed by the
   department's Automated Targeting System, help border officials
   distinguish potential terrorists from innocent people entering the
   country.
