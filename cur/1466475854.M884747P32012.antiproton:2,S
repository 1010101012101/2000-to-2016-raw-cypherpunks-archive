0. Thank you for being light hearted, friendly, public and clear with this
communication - it truly is a breath of fresh air compared to what some of
us have experienced on the interweb "Communities".

1. Juan accidentally sent an email intended to me privately, to the list.

2. Juan was referring to tor-talk in recent emails, not cp, and there have
been actual notification to that list that tor-talk may soon be moderated,
and the authorities over that list are discussing such presently.

3. Like giving thanks and +1s, giving a "whoops, that was intended to a
single offlist recipient, apologies" can be considered to add to the noise
of a list. Sometimes, a "sorry, brown paper bag moment" email may curtail
further noise. It's evidently a judgement call.

Again, thank you so much for being so grounded in your communication.

Best regards all,
