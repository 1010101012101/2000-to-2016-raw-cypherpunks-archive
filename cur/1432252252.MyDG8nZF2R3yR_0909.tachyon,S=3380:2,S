These super peers are known as Rendezvous peers in the
Jxta world.  They are as reliable and non-vulnerable
as one could hope for, though I doubt they are
perfect; I am building above the existing Jxta
infrastructure for these.  "Everyone" knows about them
by using a common boostrap server to bootstrap into
the Jxta network to gain the addresses of a few
Rendezvous nodes.  Rendezvous nodes then propagate
information about their existence to other Rendezvous
nodes at various times.  Network partitions are
certainly possible, and the requirement for a common
bootstrap server is fragile.  Jxta, and therefore P2P
Sockets, currently has no protections against
malicious/byzantine peers; it has relatively good
protections against peers that fail non-maliciously.
