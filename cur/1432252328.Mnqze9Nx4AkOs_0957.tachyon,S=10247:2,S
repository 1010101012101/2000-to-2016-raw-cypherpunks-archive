"And I don't usually get quite this MAD, but such ignorance, such blindness, 
is the reason we are in this mess. "

I'm not so sure Mr Donald is ignorant OR blind. He seems to be something 
I've never seen in real life before: Completely aligned with US foreign

I'm starting to think that Mr Donald's contributions to Cypherpunks may be 
part of his job description.
