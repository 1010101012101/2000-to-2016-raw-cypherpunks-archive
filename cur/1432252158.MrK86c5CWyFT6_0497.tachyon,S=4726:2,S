For me the description of an ideal movie is "A series of gunshots and 
explosions strung together by one liners". I go to the movies for 
amusement, not intellectual satisfaction.

That said:

	The *ONE* thing that beefed me big time about the "Matrix" 
was the excuse they gave for the computer keeping all the people 
alive.

	The claim (as I remember) was that the bodies were used to 
store/create energy for the computer to run.

	It *really* irked me.

	If this world *were* a computer generated construct, it would 
explain a few things.
