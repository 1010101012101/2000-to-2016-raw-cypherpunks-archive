There's definately a chance it could become corrupt. But I think the  
big difference between the Wikileaks Party and other, more traditional  
parties, is that the WLP is focused on more than just grabbing power.  
The whole organization is about speaking truth to power, destroying  
secrets, informing the populace, and holding those in power  
accountable. That a little different than most others.

Of course that could all be hyperbole just like Obama's promises of  
change but we don't know yet.  While I agree that a cryptoanarchist  
poses a bigger threat to the power structure than a political party  
does, could this not be a good forward step?
