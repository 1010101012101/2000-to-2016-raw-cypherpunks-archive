"There is a fine line between insanity and parody and he has erased 
that line." - Quote refering to Scott Lively, a member of the Oregon 
Citizen's Alliance, who claimed that gays were responsible for the Holocaust.

Part of perpetrating an effective hoax is presenting absurd ideas in a 
manner that people want to believe.

The problem is that every once in a while the people you are attacking 
with the hoax will make a statement so far off the edge of reality that 
nothing you can come up with could match it.

"Loyalty Day" fits that category quite well.
