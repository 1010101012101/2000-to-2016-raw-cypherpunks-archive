Subject: Bear Advisory
Date: Wed, 29 May 2002 11:24:38 -0400


The California State Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers,
hunters, fishermen and golfers to take extra precautions and keep alert for
bears while in the Yosemite and Mammoth areas. They advise people to
wear noise-producing devices such as little bells on their clothing to alert
but not startle the bear unexpectedly. They also advise carrying pepper
spray in case of an encounter with a bear.

It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of bear activity and
know the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings.
Black bear droppings are smaller and contain berries and possibly squirrel
fur.
Grizzly bear droppings have little bells in them and smell like pepper
spray.
