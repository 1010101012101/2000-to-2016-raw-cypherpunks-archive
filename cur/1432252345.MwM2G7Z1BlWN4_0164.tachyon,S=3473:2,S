Possible, but at least I've got an archived list of cpunx-related
material, which I can reference later (with other newssources, this
happens rather frequently). So, in case none of you is running a newssink,
I'll just go ahead, and make a new one, even if it's just for my private
use.

I'm at work: where I'm supposed to work. Apart from the fact of lacking
time to waste, the ssh link to a remote machine tends to sudden lapses
into 10 sec latency, making mail writing a chore if not impossible.

I hope to have at least a dialup at home by tomorrow, thus removing any
good excuses for being lazy.

My web connectivity over loaded ISDN is actually better than my realtime
editing ASCII connectivity over ssh over said link.
