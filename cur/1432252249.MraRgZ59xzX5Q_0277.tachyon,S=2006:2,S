White smoke from the chimney of the L of C...

As of now, it is now explicitly legal to decrypt the blacklists of
NetNanny - style applications.

As of now, it is now explicitly legal to RevEng abandonware dongles.
Also legal to break copy-restriction schemes on abandonware.

The most surprising exemption is for eBook decription.  It is only
allowed if you can't otherwise render the text into a 'specialized
format'.

Within the last 5 minutes, the LOC website
(http://www.copyright.gov/1201) posted the determinations for DMCA
exemptions from the May hearings.

Interesting read, if nothing else.  4 classes of works were exempted,
and for several that weren't, there's an explanation of why.
