(senhorita contains the 9 most-commonly-used-in-English letters, tho' not in
order)

There is another problem - assuming the TEMPEST gear or camera can't see the
randomised resistant letters, if it can follow the cursor then it's just a
simple substitution cypher to get plaintext (assuming the gear can get
clicks).

I thought of having a large cursor grid, with resistant symbols on each grid
place, and changing the position of the operative symbol every so often -
how often? -  but I don't know how to get such a large cursor - any ideas? X
on OpenBSD preferred.

Any better ideas?
