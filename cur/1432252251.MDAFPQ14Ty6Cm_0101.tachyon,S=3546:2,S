This sounds an awful lot like an institutional version of the Nuremburg 
Defence" <klink>"Ve vere only followink orders" </klink> If a Supreme
knows that the system is f*cked up enough that he can't free an
innocent man, there are two things he should do:

1. Call the President and request a pardon.
2. Call Congress and get the process changed so this doesn't happen
    again.

There is no 'due process' if the system knowingly jails innocents.
If they don't do this, they can't call themselves a 'Justice'.

Heck - I'd consider the title 'human being' also in dispute.
