ANTI-LEAK MEASURES IN SENATE BILL TARGET PRESS, PUBLIC

The Senate Intelligence Committee markup of the FY2013 Intelligence
Authorization Act, which was officially filed yesterday, devotes an entire
title including twelve separate provisions to the issue of unauthorized
disclosures of classified information, or leaks.

But several of those provisions aim to disrupt the flow of unclassified
information to the press and the public rather than to stop leaks of
classified information.

As reported in the Washington Post today, one of the proposed measures
(section 506 of the bill) would dictate that only agency leaders could
present background briefings to the press.  Other agency personnel, such as
intelligence analysts, would be barred from providing any background
information to the press, even when such information is unclassified.

Background briefings are essential "because they help journalists
understand the full context of a story, get key details right, and ensure
that individuals or the United States as a whole will not be harmed by the
publication of incorrect information," according to the Sunshine in
Government Initiative, a press advocacy coalition.

Questioned by the Post, Senate Intelligence Committee chair Sen. Dianne
Feinstein acknowledged that she had no evidence that such briefings, which
are prized by reporters as valuable sources of information, had contributed
to unauthorized disclosures.  And yet they would be forbidden.

See "Anti-leak measure targets background briefings" by Greg Miller,
Washington Post, July 31:

Other provisions in the new bill were also roundly criticized by public
interest groups concerned with access to government information.

A provision to prevent former government officials from providing paid
commentary to news media outlets on intelligence matters is very likely
unconstitutional, said Kate Martin of the Center for National Security
Studies in a new analysis of the bill.

"The over-breadth of this provision in prohibiting commentary and analysis
even when no classified information is disclosed would violate the First
Amendment," Ms. Martin wrote. "Indeed the provision seems drafted in order
to chill public discussion of information that is not classified rather
than being narrowly tailored to simply target disclosures of classified
information."

Another provision (in section 511) would grant intelligence agency heads
the authority to unilaterally revoke the pension of an employee if the
agency head "determines" that the employee has violated his or her
non-disclosure obligations.

This section "would give intelligence agency heads nearly unrestrained
discretion to suppress speech critical of the intelligence community-- even
after an employee has resigned or retired from an intelligence agency-- and
to retaliate against disfavored employees or pensioners, including
whistleblowers," wrote the Project on Government Oversight and several
other public interest organizations in an open letter to the Senate
Committee yesterday.

Fundamentally, the Senate bill "changes the relationship between the press
and the federal government," according to the Sunshine in Government
Initiative.

Drafted in secret and without the benefit of any public hearing, the
Senate bill includes provisions that are "crude and dangerous," the
Washington Post editorialized today.  See "A bill to stop security leaks
puts a plug on democracy," July 31:

The bill was approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee by a vote of 14
to 1, with Sen. Ron Wyden in opposition.  The text of the bill is here:
