So what do people think of David Brin's "transparent society" approach to
this problem? We can't completely stop ourselves from being watched, but we
can make use of all this technology ourselves. Police have ALPRs and
dashcams and bodycams, but by and large they have actually resisted
expansions of their own surveillance because they want the flexibility to
be able to make up justifications after the fact. Phone cams have for the
most part taken that choice away from them. The result seems likely to be
less police abuse than at any point since at least the early 20th century
in the US.

Even Snowden's leaks were enabled by very similar technologies to what the
NSA deploys against us.

Is there any reason to believe that, overall, technology will benefit
governments more than it does individuals?
