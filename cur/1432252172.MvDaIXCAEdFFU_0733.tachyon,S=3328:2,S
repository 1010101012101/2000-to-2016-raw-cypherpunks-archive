Here's a question for constitutional scholars: Can a sitting president be 
charged with plagiarism?
As President Bush wages his war against terrorism and moves to create a 
huge homeland security apparatus, he appears to be borrowing heavily, if 
not ripping off ideas outright, from George Orwell. The work in question is 
"1984, " the prophetic novel about a government that controls the masses by 
spreading propaganda, cracking down on subversive thought and altering 
history to suit its needs. It was intended to be read as a warning about 
the evils of totalitarianism -- not a how-to manual.
