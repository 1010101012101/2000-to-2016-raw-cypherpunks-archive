White House officials are insisting President Bush meant no direspect when 
he referred yesterday to the people of Pakistan as "Pakis" -- a term 
considered a grievous ethnic slur in Britain and Canada. The Pakistani 
ambassador to the US brushed the blooper aside, but it joins the 
ever-growing list of Bush malapropisms.
