323 AD: Constantine makes Chrisitianity the official religion of the Roman
Empire.
410 AD: Alaric the Goth sacks the city of Rome (by then no longer the
capital).

The 'height of the Pagan Empire" came several centuries earlier. Barbarians
couldn't have sacked Rome at it's height - they could not have got within 
several hundred miles of the city.
