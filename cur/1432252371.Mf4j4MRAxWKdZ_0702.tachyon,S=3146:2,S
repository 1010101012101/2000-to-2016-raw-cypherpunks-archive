Well, they've been working on the mountains of skulls in Iraq (of 
course, we have to destroy the country in order to save the country), 
so going after eyeglass wearers, the college-educated, and those who 
watch PBS is the logical next step.

Today's news is that analysts are saying a successful prosecution of 
Saddam on "war crimes" is going to be nearly impossible, given that he 
was a sovereign leader attacked by a foreign power and that none of the 
"WMD" were found (not that having WMD has been grounds for war crimes 
convictions, else the U.S., U.S.S.R., P.R.C., U.K., France, Zionist 
Entity, and numerous other states would have been prosecuted.).

So, I expect that even as I write CIA toxins experts are preparing what 
will make Saddam go away the quiet way. Look for him to go "of natural 
causes" before any War Crimes Tribunal can ever actually happen.

(This space reserved for former Marxist and now neocon standard-bearer 
James Donald to foam that I am a Saddam lover and a supporter of 
Chomsky.)

(apparently the illiterates who recorded the Maximum Leader's thoughts 
on the dangers of "almanacs" may have gotten the two confused, we are 
now hearing, and the order for the droids to search for "almanacs" 
apparently got confused...so now they're looking for evildoers who have 
either of these banned books)
