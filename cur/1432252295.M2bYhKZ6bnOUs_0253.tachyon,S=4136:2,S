Let us not forget the more tangible 'value' in bombing the WTC and messing 
up things downtown. First of all, the companies in the WTC were, to say the 
least, impacted (actually, the company I work for lost 11 people and 
relocated to NJ for about a year)....hitting them (and their workers) was 
probably not considered "collateral damage" by Al Qaeda, any more than 
bombing German or japanese urban production centers was considered that for 
the allies in WWII. Next comes the financial district and Wall Street as a 
whole. The third (and as it turned out by far the most impactful) was the 
destruction of the Telecom Central Office in #4 World Trade Center, along 
with bringing off-line the big Verizon CO across the street. These actually 
caused Wall Street to be knocked off line for several days, an impact that 
is hard to underestimate. And while I suspect that Al-Qaeda were probably 
unaware in advance of the impact on Telecom, the rest was certainly a 
conscious decision.
