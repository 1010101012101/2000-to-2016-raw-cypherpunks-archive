Jim Bell has made a motion to have three of the USA's
witnesses undergo psychological evaluation. No names
given in the case docket. Since Jim has been repeatedly 
moving to have his federal defender, AUSA London, and 
Judge Tanner recused, it may be that those are the three 
needing data minded.

Or the three could be composed of anyone has ever posted 
to cypherpunks or received mail from it or wrote about it or 
read about it or thought about making a snuff film of it.
