"The Minaret of Freedom Institute condemns the apparent terrorist attacks
that have taken place this morning Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001 and expresses our
sympathy to the victims and their families.  We call on American Muslims to
volunteer to give blood to assist at this time of crisis and need"

This Muslim libertarian site is an excellent resource for those wanting to
know about pro-liberty Muslim beliefs and activities. Among their declared
goals: "Counter distortions and misconceptions about Islamic beliefs and
practice; demonstrate the Islamic origins of modern values like the rule of
law and sciences like market economics; expose both American and
Islamic-world Muslims to free market thought; advance the status of Muslim
peoples maligned by a hostile environment in the West and oppressed by
repressive political regimes in the East."
