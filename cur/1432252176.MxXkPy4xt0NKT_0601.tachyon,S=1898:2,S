    "US Patriot Financial (USPF) exists to help Americans, who risk 
their lives making this world a better place, obtain life insurance.   
This includes resident aliens.
    Whether you are a soldier deploying overseas, a DOD contractor 
helping to rebuild war torn countries,  a missionary volunteering to 
help the most needy, or a business man or woman traveling the globe to 
support our economy we can help.
    Using  our extensive network of life insurance carriers, we are able 
to provide protection to those whose service leads them into some of the 
world's most dangerous places.   This includes US citizens living abroad."
