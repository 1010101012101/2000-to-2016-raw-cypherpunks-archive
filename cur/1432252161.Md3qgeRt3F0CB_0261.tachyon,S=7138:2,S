Universities have MANY serious problems.  The fact that they are now
mere hazing facilities (and goddamn expensive ones at that) providing for
the "filtering out" of those society would rather not have to listen to
(the poor) - and the fact that we as a society still allow this
"university system" to act as a control over gainful employment is
probably the single worst problem the universities have.

But, you came here with your own specific university problem, so let's
just address that one :-)

Really?  You mean they have actually started to behave like
congresscritters and presidents?

I guess they are finally teaching Karma :-)

I sure hope he's on one of MY juries!  It sure beats the other 11 who will
be "hang 'em, he's a commie fruitcake cause he doesn't bow to D.C. five
times a day".

I gather from the phrasing here that the message itself is not what is
being complained about, but rather the target of the message is the issue.
Hypocrisy is a wondeful thing, isn't it?  ;-)

Yada, yada, yada...

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
