That's not something the remailer should be doing - that's something
that the user sending the message should be doing.  
If the remailer list shows what jurisdiction the remailer is in, 
that makes it easier for the user to determine,
but it's the user's choice.  
Of course, if the remailer _always_ adds its own encrypt-and-mail hop,
sending to another remailer in another jurisdiction, that's transparent
to the user and a good thing (as long as it can avoid mail loops.)
