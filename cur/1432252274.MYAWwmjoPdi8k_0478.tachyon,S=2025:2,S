Does it apply even if it is the same cipher but with different key length
and/or block size?

I was pondering such "encapsulation" for the situations when The
Government forbids using ciphers stronger than <limit>. Then use as strong
one as you wish, and encrypt the result in the legally-weak wrapper.

Once they ask for your escrowed keys, or bruteforce it, they will figure
out that you are a crypto-lawbreaker - but you will pass a routine
automated screening. And once you catch their interest, you already have
problems anyway.
