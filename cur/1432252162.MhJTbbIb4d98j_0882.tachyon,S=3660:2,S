I use pgp6.5.8 - it has a single command line program (pgp5.x had a
separate program for key management), and it has more pgp2.x like
command line options.

I would use gnuPG as the code is cleaner, more readable and smaller
but they're still refusing to include IDEA by default, even though
the IDEA license allows free non-commercial use.  (They added in RSA
as default since the RSA patent expired, but that's almost useless
without IDEA, as you still can't talk to pgp2.x).  There is an IDEA
module I think, so I suppose the best situation would be to add in
the IDEA module to gnuPG and use it.
