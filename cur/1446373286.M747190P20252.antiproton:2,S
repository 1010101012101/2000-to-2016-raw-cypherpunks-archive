Jim, astute and concise reply as always. If you're looking for a
shorter tract on some of Murphy's work you should consult this:

http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Theory-Essays-Market-Anarchy/dp/1479258377

The Mises Institute is good about making their work freely available
as well.

I think the idea of assassination politics distills to a very
insightful approach to defense and crowdsourcing in general.

However, from the vantage point of anarchism one crucial aspect worthy
of consideration is that of self autonomy and negative liberty. You
don't have "freedom to," but rather "freedom from" the state. With
assassination politics there is an argument that this is retributive
justice regarding compulsory theft of assets (and property, in certain
instances). However, I strongly urge you to consider that the taking
of a life is serious business.

Consider this:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3208907/The-Ashley-Madison-suici
de-Texas-police-chief-takes-life-just-days-email-leaked-cheating-website
- -hack.html

There are lesser means that can be employed and crowdfunded which
could strongly dis-incentivize working for the state (such as invasion
of privacy, which is arguably retributive with respect to Rothbard's
notion of justice).

The problem with David Friedman is that he approaches
Anarchocapitalism like a problem in physics. It will just end up a
certain way because market forces will make things happen. However,
one thing that he does not take into consideration (for instance,
where he differs from the Independent Institute and the Mises
Institute) is the notion of individual freedom and the right of
neither the state nor any external actor to violate your personal
autonomy (which you can extrapolate from your body/mind and unto you
property).

- From the Friedmanite perspective, citizenry will kill the state, the
state will kill back, and the process will reach an equilibrium. While
that might work in the 'market sense,' to reach that state requires
pretty grotesque action to take place.

That is the problem with Utilitarian Anarchocapitalism. There is no
real consideration of actual human rights, it is a market driven
theory on how society could potentially function in the absence of the
state. Nothing more.
