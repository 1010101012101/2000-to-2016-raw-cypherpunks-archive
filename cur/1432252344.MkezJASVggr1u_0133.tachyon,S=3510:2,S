2 and 8 seem to be contradictory. Unless you just back up on the box, as 
Tim mentioned. That's not much of a backup.

If you're treating this box as an unrepairable black box, you'd just 
throw it away and use a new one if it broke. That would technically 
meet these requirements, but it would require sending out the public 
keys occasionally and it would make it possible for Fred to 
fraudulently sign a message and claim it came from one of the 
replacement boxes. If there were a single, eternal signing box he 
wouldn't be able to get away with that.
