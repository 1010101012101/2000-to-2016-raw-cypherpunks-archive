You fucking self-centerd ego-maniacal animal abuser. You NEVER have to use
fear with pets. If you have to use fear it is your failing, not the pets.
Do the animal a favor get rid of the pet, you're not fit for it.

I hope the next time you use fear on your pets somebody comes along and
teaches you the lesson, a 2x4 up your ass seems suitable.

Do your kids a favor, don't have any.
