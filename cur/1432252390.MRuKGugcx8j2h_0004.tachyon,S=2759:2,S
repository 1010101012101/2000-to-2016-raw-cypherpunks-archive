Nothing surprises me about Iraq, Liberia, Kosovo, Somalia, and all of 
the other countries the U.S. has conquered.

Suppression of the press, collection of guns, installation of malleable 
bureaucrats, shooting of journalists filming in public areas, outlawing 
of certain political parties, kidnapping of dissidents, creation of 
concentration camps and gulags...

And what do the brainiacs think is going to happen when the Iraqis  
have their first ostensibly free election? Will Cheney declare it null 
and void?

"We should not march into Baghdad. To occupy Iraq would
instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab
world against us and make a broken tyrant into a latter-
day Arab hero. Assigning young soldiers to a fruitless
hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning
them to fight in what would be an unwinable urban guerilla
war, it could only plunge that part of the world into ever
greater instability."
--George H. W. Bush, "A World Transformed", 1998
