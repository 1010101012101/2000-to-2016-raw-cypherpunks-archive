"Professor Rat" goes to his own folder in my Procmail script.  I
occasionally skim it, but mostly I just delete it when it expands to many
megabytes.

I hope this isn't going to be another one of those cases where some
federal judge reads list messages completely out of context, and concludes
that some plot is afoot to blow up the federal government.

Perhaps Professor Rat is a federal agent hoping to bait some list member
into publicly cheering when he criticizes high-ranking public officials.

Or perhaps Professor Rat just made the mistake of playing Paintball on the 
weekends while subscribed to the Cypherpunks list.

Allusions work, like "the coke-snorting C student who drove his car
drunk into somebody's hedge."

I wouldn't necessarily leap to the conclusion Professor Rat lives in 
Australia.  Perhaps he just has has a shell there.
