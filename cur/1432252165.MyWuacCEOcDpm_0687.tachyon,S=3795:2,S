Great way to entrap, too.  Switch content, then bang.

Some kind of 'common-carrier' protection would be helpful
to those providing generic services like credit card validation.

If the folks being charged made the case that they didn't know some
of the content was 'tainted', they should get off.  You'd have to
show that they were guilty of thoughtcrime themselves.

[This completely avoids the bogosity of the case, given that noone is
harmed ---that these are just bits being sent, not people being harmed.]
