Hillary "smarm with out the charm" Clinton is finally being treated to the 
welcome she deserves.  If Ruddi hadn't dropped out or the Repos hadn't run 
such a weak candidate the voters would surely had sent her packing.  Next 
election should be interesting.

We recorded that VH-1 show and not unexpectedly she was not to be seen (the 
booing lasted her entire time on the stage).  Ah, ha!
