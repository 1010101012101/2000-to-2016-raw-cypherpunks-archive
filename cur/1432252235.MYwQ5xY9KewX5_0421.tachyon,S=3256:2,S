   Right, in fact if sheep (and sometimes cattle) eat Phalaris sp., for
instance, they get the "staggers", depending on the time of year and other
environmental conditions, and also upon the alkaloid makeup of the particular
cultivar. Phalaris, of course, contains fairly large amounts of tryptamines,
like dimethyltriptamine (DMT), as do many other plants. And thank the Goddess
for that -- but sheep don't like it. Or maybe they do, and just aren't saying.
