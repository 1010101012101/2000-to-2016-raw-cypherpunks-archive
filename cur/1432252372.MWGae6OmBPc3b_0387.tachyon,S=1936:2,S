Yesterday I caught Keith Olberman's show on MSNBC when he was 
announcing that Fox News will be hiring Dennis Miller for occasional 
guest commentaries.  Keith Olberman is known for his funny quips, but 
yesterday he did a drop-dead hilarious impression of an extended Dennis 
Miller rant.  Only this time, it was Keith Olberman ranting against 
Fox's "We decide, you obey" reporting style.  The writing and delivery 
were perfect, and he really hit his target.

I've nearly boycotted TV news lately, so that was the first time I've 
seen his show.  I'll Tivo it for entertainment value if nothing else.
