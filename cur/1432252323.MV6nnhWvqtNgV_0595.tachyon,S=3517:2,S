I don't think it does anything to us.

I think the title of the email is more interesting than the article,
which is about a company being forced to hand over information that
they have.  We've always believed that this was the case under
Canadian law, and are unsuprised.  We designed our systems so that
this isn't a worry, and are comfortable that thats a fine stance under
Canadian law.
