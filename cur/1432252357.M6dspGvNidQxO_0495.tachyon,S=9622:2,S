Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .455

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is se||ing for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, March 28, 2005 / PRNewswire - FirstCall via COMTEX/ - 
Montana 
Oi| and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to 
announce 
that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the 
Alberta Canada region where the company currently has interests in 
three 
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to 
partner
in, or acquire leases, which may inc|ude producing we|ls and or 
exp|oratory
programs which will strengthen Montana¡¦s position with energy, cash 
oriented 
investment banking groups.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for 
dri|ling 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas in these 
programs. 
This wi|l significantly |essens the risk for the investment grOup, 
hence 
encouraging financia| participation as we|| as speeding up the process 
of 
commitment by the investment gr0up.

Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, ¡§We at Montana are 
aggressive|y 
persuing all possible opportunities for growth and success.  Peter also 
notes ¡§that whi|e these opportunities are very exciting for the future 
of the company our current projects are also our first priority¡¨

The Sylvan |ake project wi|l begin very short|y the company and its 
partners 
have secured a dril|ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road 
ban 
to be |ifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer Alberta a mere 
3O 
mi|es from Sylvan Lake.  The initia| we|l is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko Sand 
test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take 
approximate|y 
1O to 12 days to dri|| and test the initia| well. Each deve|opment well 
has 
probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oi| per day and 75O mi|lion cubic 
feet 
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 
30O,OO0 
barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for

The average we|l in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 500 barre|s of 
oi| 
per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, 
the company intends to drill up to 4 more we||s on these |and sections.
