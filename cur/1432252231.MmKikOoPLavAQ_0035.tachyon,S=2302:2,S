   [1]BostonBTS writes "[2]IntelliOne Technologies has just launched a
   real-world test of Need4Speed, a real-time traffic-monitoring system
   that tracks drivers' cell phones. From their website: 'Unlike any
   other solution available today, the IntelliOne Roadway Speed
   Measurement System produces live roadway speeds for all highways and
   surface streets where mobile phone coverage exists, accurate to within
   three miles per hour.' Of course, any compulsory phone-tracking system
   raises privacy concerns. According to an article on LiveScience, 'the
   [3]personal identification data of users will be stripped from cell
   phone signals before they are processed by IntelliOne's software.' The
   cell phone companies have this data, but IntelliOne says they won't be
   keeping their copy."
