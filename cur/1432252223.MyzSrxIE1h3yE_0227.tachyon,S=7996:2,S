Dear Member:

One of the more inviting aspects of our Web site is the ability
 to explore The New York Times Archive of over 500,000 articles 
dating back to 1996.  You can retrieve articles published within 
the past week free of charge, and purchase older articles.  
Depending on your research needs, you can choose from four 
different pricing options: 25 articles for $19.95, 10 articles for 
$9.95, four articles for $5.50 or a single article for only $2.50.  
(Sorry, but photos, charts and graphs are currently unavailable).

To learn more, visit:

What's a three-letter word for "Premium Crosswords"? "Fun." 

For  $19.95 per year or just $3.95 per month, you can play the 
Daily Crossword Puzzle and over 2,000 archived puzzles.  
You can play them directly on your computer or print them to 
play offline.  Our service offers Crossword Puzzles from the daily 
editions of The New York Times, both puzzles from the Sunday 
New York Times Magazine and puzzles dating back to 1996 from 
The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Archive.  And you can 
enjoy participating in the Crossword Puzzle Forum, hosted by 
"Puzzle Masters" Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon.  Subscribers
