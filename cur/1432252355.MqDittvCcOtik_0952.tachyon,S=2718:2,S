                Unable to crack the encryption code without a password,
agents
                 went back again with a search warrant and placed on his
computer
                 a high-tech device called a key logger, which monitors
every
                 keystroke. After nearly two months of surveillance, the
FBI cracked
                 his password: nds09813-050. A source close to the case
later
                 confirmed that it's Scarfo's father's prison
identification number. The
                 Feds had it all the time.
