I can't say (personally) I'm a fan of either candidate. But even if
Gore were to win, I'd likely continue the working relationship with the
White House staff that I have now. Apart from ideology, they have an
incentive to do so: I write articles (such as one I'm doing today) in
which they'd like their positions represented.
