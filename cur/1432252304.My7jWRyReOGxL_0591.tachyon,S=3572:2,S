What's happening with you, Tim ? Your short term memory malfunction gives a
probable reason for search of the compound for THC carriers.

The boosted high-end was mentioned in the context of dolby-recorded tapes
played without dolby circuit on or not present at all.

[and to another troller - music industry became well aware in 90-ties that
their major consumers - teens - do playback dolby tapes without dolby, and got
used to it, which made producers often boost high end in general, even when
dolby became immaterial. It's funny that average spectral characteristics of
music can give away it's age ]

"Warmer" sound is particularly enhanced if the source is 1/4" Revox.
