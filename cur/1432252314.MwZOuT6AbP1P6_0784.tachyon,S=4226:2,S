One or more of the several thousand people you are addressing may be 
the right person for the subject.  However, since there are several 
thousand people here, and none of us knows what all the others have 
written, you really have to be a lot more specific in requests for 
information.  Further, the one who wrote the article you read may or 
may not be listening at this time.
