Yes, that's him. In the course of those conversations it was revealed that 
he was an employee or principal of a European company which was producing a 
line of key-escrow crypto products, and he was hoping to bias the standards 
towards creating a market for his otherwise distasteful and shameful 
merchandise.

So it's not surprising (but not encouraging) to see him reappear, marketing 
the same tired apologies for his unwanted and useless garbage, seeking to 
create a market by forcing people to buy a product they won't spend a dime 
on unless it's at gunpoint.
