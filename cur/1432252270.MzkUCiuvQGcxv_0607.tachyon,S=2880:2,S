One of the first uses of backscatter or passive transmission was when the 
Russians bugged the U.S. embassy in Moscow in the 1960s using resonant 
'nails'.  The heads of the nails (no larger than the standard variety) were 
actually hollow with two resonant cavities (I think at non-harmonic 
frequencies) formed by a 'wall' and covered by a metal diaphragm.  The nail 
shaft was an antenna. The nails had been placed just below painted 
surfaces. Sound pressure caused the diaphragm to alternately cover and 
uncover the cavities leading to a change in resonance at audio frequencies. 
Nearby, a microwave transmitter operated by Russian agents beamed energy 
into the embassy.  They could listen in on conversations by detecting the 
changes in reflected power from nails.  From reported stories it took quite 
a while to discover these babies, but then a gain it might not have and the 
embassy security people used them to run 'false flag' operations.
