The Constitution applies at _all_ times. It is not something that is 
only for nice, calm situations.

The Bill of Rights does not say that the various parts of the Bill of 
Rights are suspendable when someone decides there is some reason to. 
This means the USA Bill, with its suspension of big chunks of the Fourth 
Amendment, is ipso facto unconstitutional.

My belief is that every Congresscritter who voted to pass this USA Bill 
should be tried and executed.

As for the 600 "Arabic-looking" men (maybe a few women, I don't know) 
being held without charges being filed in a timely way, I'll chortle if 
even 10 of them become vengeance-seekers in the next 10 years.

Someone held unjustly, without charges being filed, is morally obliged 
to kill his oppressors.
