You can 'blame' anyone for anything anytime you don't like their message..
doesn't mean you can control
it with state violence.. e.g., religion, hollywood, erotica, nra, nambla,
Democratic party, kkk, teletubbies, etc.  Ie, your 'blame' is as cheap as
your words.  Pretty simple, really: sticks and stones can break your bones,
but bits will never hurt you.  

(Unless you're a content producer getting napsterized, but that's another
thread :-)
