     I trust that, once you have figured out how to make it work properly,
you will generate new keys for your currently not-so-very-hidden service,
now that you've identified the connection between the URL above and yourself.
:-)
     For that matter, it's probably best *not* to run most kinds of hidden
services on tor relays precisely because tor relays are well known through
the directory.  Running a hidden service on a client-only tor would be the
safest way because clients are not listed anywhere as such.  There might be
a place for running a hidden service on a bridge, but it would have to be
for something not terribly dangerous to the hidden service operator because
bridges *are* known to the bridge authorities and thus must be considered to
be listed somewhere.  Something like a web service that is also accessible
directly and publicly and that presents no known danger to its operator (e.g.,
the various tor status pages) can reasonably be run on a tor relay node,
a bridge, or a client.

     Best you learn how to protect your butt *before* opening it up to the
world, no?  Have you thought about running your service inside a jail or a
virtual machine?  That would make it much easier to wall it off from the
rest of your computer and home network.

     Again, a jail or a VM would help you contain any damage, and a backup
of the jail's or VM's environment would make it very easy and fast to
restore it to the way you set it up.

     A jail or a VM can certainly help you there by limiting the ability
of shell accounts to access the world at large, especially when combined
with the application of a decent packet filter on the host system.
