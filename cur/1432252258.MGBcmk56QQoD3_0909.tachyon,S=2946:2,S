...which should then use OTPs, no?  The whole point of AES was a combination
of efficiency versus security. Otherwise, just use TripleDES.

Getting Rijndael in use, out on its own, is the best way to verify whether it
works well -- as efficiently and as securely as desired. This is the way to gain
confidence, by testing. Trust is earned.
