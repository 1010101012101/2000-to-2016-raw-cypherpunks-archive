I can't sympathise much on this basis. A family member, a retired cop
and the family shame, confirmed what I had suspected: that most people
in jail are there because they couldn't keep their mouths shut --- on
the street, in the police station, in court. And many who are denied
parole or who have it revoked couldn't keep their mouths shut in jail.

Even if you couldn't shut up, why didn't you use an anonymizer? You have
a characteristic writing style, but there are other rambling, obscure
writers on c-punks and the writing couldn't be positively linked to you.
Or, better yet, you could learn to write in a conventional,
straightforward, clear style and have complete deniability.
