Given how many nations are recreating their stuff to protect their
citizens' data from NSA etc, the Russian efforts are not unusual. But of
course Russia has a long history of social repression. One can argue
that it's all defensive, and driven by fear of the Allies. Or instead,
one can argue that it's just Russian mafia/oligarchs protecting their
turf and sheeple. Reality is probably some mix of all that, with maybe
even some idealism thrown in.
