He was an illegal combatant because he did not actually enter a country 
we were not actually at war with, whose government was not actually the 
force behind the 9/11 attack.

Using the psychics employed by the CIA, America has deduced that he may 
have been _thinking_ about entering Afghanistan, even though he didn't.

And that's enough for a thoughtcrime conviction in the beknighted 
states.

The case is so weak he'll hang himself in his jail cell.
