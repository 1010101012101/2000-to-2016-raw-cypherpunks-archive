It's a not entirely uninteresting approach, but one doesn't have
to resort to libertarian rights-theory to refute it (not that 
arguing about rights is going to resolve anything anyway).

Simple pragmatism can do the same. I mean, Nathan, have you ever
considered what happens when taxes are raised to 95 percent?

I know you were just speaking hypothetically, but to be realistic, a
hypo will have to includse the negative effects as well as the
positive. For instance, what are the economic effects? What are the
black markets that arise?  What punitive measures must nations adopt
to enforce tax collection?  What about revolt and the ensuing
bloodshed? What about public choice theory?

Think these things through, if you really want to be "pragmatic."
