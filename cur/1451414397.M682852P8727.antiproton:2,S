Ack,

I was with friend from north France recently who's girl-friend is btw
Askenazi and he reported to me how Paris look like toady: it was about
beating some Arabic looking guy on street.
When pocket-sized girl started to complain it was revealed that it is
group of cops in civil dress kicking guy in the middle of workday on the
street.
Some youngsters where shouting from balcony something about police state
and police brutality and other 50y-like old guy was filming that from
other side of street from balcony, too.
During next 20min police in uniforms appeared; they took that beaten
Arabic-looking guy from street both youngsters and that 50y old cameraman=
=2E

So I'm no way telling that I do agree with whatever is happening in
western Europe or Anglo-Sax countries. We are just more doomed if we
will allow Russian style model: strong state is better than every single
personality or collective and freedom of individual is less than state
power.
