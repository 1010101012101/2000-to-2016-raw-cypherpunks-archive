One could count some fraction of all the *.binaries.* on usenet
as anonymous communications (via stego), but then you'd have to know
how many are stego'd, and that is the game after all.

Yes.  Trivially, If your correspondent told you, but that's out of
band.  Otherwise,
If there *remains* info which was not washed out "in transit", then that

would be an inband way.  Maybe all the pictures with a red flower
in them are carriers, and this content isn't washed out.  Maybe its a
more subtle crypto-watermark, independent of the stego'd message.

1. How do you know the signature of the unaltered carrier-medium?
E.g., have you measured the LSBit noise from my camera recently?
Under which lighting conditions?

2. Don't you think I can measure the properties of my carrier and shape
the stego'd info to match?   (This does get into an arms race over what
properties to measure.)

You don't just put your message in the LSBits or whatever.  You
compress,
encrypt, and possibly redundantly code them.  Then you shape the noise
to match the bits you're replacing.

Depends on the coding.

Just make sure you did the original analog recording and destroy the
original after you stego it.  Best also if you never post unstego'd
messages
so the Adversary can't measure your raw carrier.

A simple stego message was placed without real

You shouldn't stego life-critical messages without proper training in
the use of your tools.
(That training may vary with personality, see _Silk and Cyanide_.  Some
like "why",
some like "do this".)
