Yes, but I found it suprising to realize that the number of people who 
need to use a Swiss bank for it to be private is much smaller than the 
number who use a remailer.  (In addition, Swiss banks have natural
cover traffic provided by the ever-efficient local Swiss.)

Survielling a bank is more expensive than a remailer, and a bank will
not tend to have an 'upstream ISP' where all patrons of the bank,
wearing tags, can be identified.

This is absolutely correct, and Ryan's points about latency mattering
a great deal to users are also bang-on.

Probably; but if the end points are both expensive to trace, watching
those transfers may not buy you a lot.

As Dan Geer pointed out, banks are in the risk management business.
If you put your risk management algorithm in a box and expect me not
to game it, its because you have too little money to pay for the
analysis.  LTCM had this problem; their banks decided it was more
profitable to squueze them than to let them live, and they had no
escape plan.  (Its too bad the banks didn't know what their
liabilities were, but thats another rant.)
