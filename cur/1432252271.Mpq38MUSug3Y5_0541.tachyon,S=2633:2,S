	Hello,

	Im developping a usb driver, and I need the w2k checked build version. I
know that I need a Microsoft online ID to login and download the checked
build version. Searching in the web, I have found an article with your
password for your ID. I  would like to contact with you because I need
quickly the checked build.

	Sincerely yours,
