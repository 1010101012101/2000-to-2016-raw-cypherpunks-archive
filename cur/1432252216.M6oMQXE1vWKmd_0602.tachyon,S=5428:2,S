A touch hand wavy, but interesting.  (and thank you to JY for the
pointer.)

I don't see how they expect this to work.  We've already got cheap
rip off motherboards, who's gonna stop cheap rip off TPM's that ain't
really T?  I think it moves the game into a smaller field where the
players all have some bucks to begin with, but somebody will create
a "TPM" that looks like the real thing, but runs cypherpunk code
just fine.

3) some people think DRM will work and some people don't, and they all
work at the same company.

Anyone who can comprehend the physical reality of computers can see DRM
can't possibly work.  Unfortunatly, that's a minorty of the human
population.  I think the CEO's may actually have a clue, but if there's
money to be made from suckers, why not!!??

Well, I know why not, and so do you all.  But I don't think mandated
"Fritz" chips will fly - and it's simple economics.  Logic will never work
:-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
