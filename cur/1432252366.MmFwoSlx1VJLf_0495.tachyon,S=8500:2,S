My theory is the whole Tom Cotton letter to Iran was a legislative trojan,
and there was a coordinated psy-ops campaign to get 47 senators to sign it.

So who would be financially motivated to hack the republican party, and 
have the covert intelligence and psy-ops/social engineering capability to 
pull it off?

For all we know this was done by some pissed off NSA/CIA cpunk employees who
know how to work the system and aren't quite ready to pull a snowden yet.

Oh, and the *discovery* of NSA/CIA involvement in hacking the party would
just be a bonus easter-egg for a lot of libertarian-minded cpunk patriots.

The man has a million cracks & crevices, dark, warm, inviting places for 
the roots of a million seeds to grow.

What are you planting this spring?
