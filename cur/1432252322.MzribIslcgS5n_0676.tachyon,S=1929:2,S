A federal appeals court panel has struck down a law that restricted
children's access to
    violent video games, giving the software the same free-speech
protection as that for
    works of art.

    A panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a St.
Louis County, Mo.,
    ordinance that bans the rentals or sales of graphically violent
video games to minors violates
    free-speech rights. In doing so, the panel reversed a ruling by the
U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Missouri and ordered the lower court to craft an
injunction that would
    prohibit the ordinance from taking effect.

    In Tuesday's ruling, the panel decided that if the paintings of
Jackson Pollock, the music of
    Arnold Schoenberg and the Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll are
protected by the First
    Amendment, then video games should be, too.
