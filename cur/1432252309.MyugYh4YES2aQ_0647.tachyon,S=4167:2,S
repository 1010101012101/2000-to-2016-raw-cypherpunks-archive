I know the story. That was the Moro tribe, right? There was also a story
of a prisoner having been wrapped in a fresh pigskin and hanged.

Shortly after 911 I suggested that the US publicize video clips of its
forces dipping bullets in pig's blood and painting pigblood deathheads
on cruise missiles and preparing boxcar-sized piggery and slaughterhouse
runoff aerosol bombs. Rumors of pork-only meals in US prison camps. The
whole dying unclean thing...

It may or may not work - I don't know how serious these guys are about
their religion. Should the leaders be more worldly they might struggle
with their texts to devise a palatable philosophical out for their field
soldiers.

All in all it's a funny idea though.
