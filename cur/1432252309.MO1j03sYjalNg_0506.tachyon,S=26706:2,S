<FONT SIZE=3D3><P>In his essay "Theory and Practice," Immanuel Kant argue=
s that citizens must always obey their government and consequently never =
rebel against it.  He defends this absolute prohibition by claiming that =
rebellion would violate requirements of duty and morality,</FONT><FONT SI=
ZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn1">1</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> which theoretically permit o=
nly a government to interpret the moral will of a society and obligate ci=
tizens to act according only to a priori reason. Despite Kant's objection=
s, Locke's principles of rebellion not only conform to the Kantian catego=
rical imperative and support the right of a collective to determine and e=
xecute rebellion for itself, but also demonstrate paradoxes that in gener=
al trouble Kantian political theory.</P>

<p>Kant bases his political theory on the morality that he develops in th=
e <I>Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.  </I>Fundamentally, Kant cla=
ims that the basis of morality is a good will that acts only according to=
 a conception of Pure Duty, duty that "help[s] others where one can . . .=
 [with an] inclination for the sake of duty alone."</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1>=
<!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn2">2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Kant argues that <I>a priori=
</I> reason compels one to act according to such a conception of duty.</F=
ONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn3">3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Thus, Kant defines duty as "=
the necessity to act out of reverence for the [universal] law."</FONT><FO=
NT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn4">4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Thus, only actions consisten=
t with the categorical imperative are moral.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- An=

<A HREF=3D"#fn5">5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Kant then derives two import=
ant formulations of the categorical imperative.  These are the <I>Formula=
 of the End in Itself</I>,</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn6">6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> and <I>the Formula of the Ki=
ngdom of Ends</I>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn7">7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> When a citizenry upholds the=

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Thus, as Kant argues in "Theory and Practice," w=
hen a government implements the moral will, the citizenry must comply wit=
h even unpleasant actions.  Pure reason alone, not the happiness of the c=
itizenry, generates the categorical imperative.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!--=
 Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn9">9</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>  From this, Kant discovers a=
n absolute prohibition on resistance because, he claims, resistance unive=
rsalizes only anarchy,</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->

<A HREF=3D"#fn14">14</A></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>John Locke's opposing stance on the right to rev=
olt can help to highlight some of the problems in the Kantian view. Like =
Kant, Locke argues that society fundamentally values "reason."</FONT><FON=
T SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn15">15</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> However, Locke argues that=
 reason compels citizens principally to value property</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D=
1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn16">16</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> and to create government t=
o help them protect this property.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link =
Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn17">17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>  Consequently, once a gove=
rnment fails to protect, or, worse yet, harms, the citizens' property, th=
at government "dissolves" its right to legitimately rule the people, givi=
ng right to the collective to establish a new government.</FONT><FONT SIZ=
E=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn18">18</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Locke argues that only a "=
long train of abuses," such as the use of tyrannical and capricious power=
 against the collective, enslavement, and arbitrary rule without regard t=
o the moral will justifies such a revolt against the government.</FONT><F=
ONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn19">19</A></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>The categorical imperative may indeed uphold Kan=
t's absolute prohibition on rebellion. Paradoxically, the categorical imp=
erative also seems to support Lockean justifications for rebellion. First=
, and most importantly, Locke's conception of rebellion seems consistent =
with Kant's conception of duty. As mentioned above, even Kant can conceiv=
e of the possibility of a ruler tyrannizing the collective moral will.</F=
ONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn20">20</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>  An evil tyrant could arbi=
trarily murder innocent citizens or commit other moral atrocities against=
 the collective and forbid citizens to oppose these actions. Kant argues =
that pure moral action is action solely based on the idea of duty.  It wo=
uld seem, then, that, in this scenario, citizens would be morally <I>obli=
gated</I> to violate and resist the law and assume their duty to save the=
se citizens from harm. Thus, the universal maxim that a citizen must alwa=
ys help another individual facing imminent harm justifies resistance to a=
 state that uses unjust force against its citizens.</P>

<P>Similarly, a government that coerces its citizens to act unwillingly w=
ould violate the Autonomy Principle. Any government</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1>=
<!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn21">21</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> that prevents any citizen =
from determining and acting upon universal maxims of morality would not r=
espect the individual's ability to will the categorical imperative. This =
is a violation of the Autonomy Formulation of the categorical imperative.=
  Any Kantian collective striving to achieve moral freedom would be thus =
morally <I>obligated</I> to resist all forms of external enslavement. Thu=
s, the Autonomy Formulation universalizes the Lockean principle of resist=
ance to a government that enslaves its people.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- =
Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn22">22</A></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Finally, the Kingdom of Ends also seems to unive=
rsalize resistance. If the Kingdom of Ends requires government to execute=
 and protect the moral will, any government that neglects its duties, fai=
ls to implement the moral will, rules without regard to the moral will, o=
r arbitrarily alters the government, violates the categorical imperative.=
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn23">23</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>  In these cases,</FONT><FO=
NT SIZE=3D1> <!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn24">24</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> the government would delib=
erately stop administering the moral will, thus challenging the enforceme=
nt, legitimacy, and perhaps even the existence</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- =
Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn25">25</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> of the moral will.  Thus, =
any Kantian society would be morally <I>obligated</I> to ignore a governm=
ent that neglected its duties and to establish a new government that <I>w=
ould</I> do its job. Thus, the Kingdom of Ends universalizes Lockean prin=
ciples of resistance when the government neglects its duty.</P>

<P>Consequently, the only legitimate government in a Kantian sense is a g=
overnment that adheres to and implements the collective moral will. As I =
have just shown, when a government attempts to destroy the moral will, de=
nies its citizens the ability to create the moral will, or neglects the m=
oral will (thus preventing the moral will from actualizing itself), the g=
overnment violates the categorical imperative.  Therefore, the categorica=
l imperative universalizes the notion that these forms of government are =
illegitimate.  When a government violates the categorical imperative, the=
 government "dissolves" its legitimate claim to govern.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D=
1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn26">26</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> As Locke rightly points ou=
t, such an illegitimate government is the true rebel force, since it impo=
ses its own will upon the collective, rather than merely implementing the=
 collective moral will, thus "rebelling" against its duty to enforce the =
collective moral will.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn27">27</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> </P>

<P>Consequently, Kantian citizens have an obligation to restore legitimat=
e rule not only because legitimate rule alone conforms to the categorical=
 imperative, but also because they have a duty to the collective to prote=
ct and uphold the moral will. Moreover, if the collective wills the gover=
nment in the first place, then the collective should have the ability to =
will another government when the first government fails to uphold the col=
lective's values.</P>

<P>Consequently, there are also many responses to Kant's argument that re=
bellion requires immoral actions in order to accomplish its purposes.  Mo=
st importantly, Locke responds with the idea of supreme necessity:  in ex=
treme circumstances, a citizen must protect one's own life and the lives =
of one's fellow citizens.  Violence to reinstate a moral government would=
 be a lesser evil than permitting an evil government to reign. A tyranny<=
/FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn28">28</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> that destroys the moral in=
nocence of the collective that it is supposed to represent causes far gre=
ater, more insidious and more irreparable evils than does the violence th=
at attempts to remedy it.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn29">29</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3> Besides, if the categorica=
l imperative justifies rebellion, then the categorical imperative also ju=
stifies the means to accomplish this rebellion. Finally, as Locke observe=
s, "this doctrine of a power in the people of providing for their safety =
a-new . . . is the best fence against rebellion" because a government tha=
t respects the collective's ability to form a new government is a governm=
ent that understands the limits of its own power.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!=
-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn30">30</A></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Kant's problems concerning rebellion demonstrate=
 serious flaws in Kantian political theory. First, the categorical impera=
tive leads ironically to moral relativism, not moral absolutism.  Both Ka=
nt and Locke base their political theory upon the idea of "reason." Howev=
er, Kant and Locke generate radically different conceptions of reason, on=
e based on <I>a priori</I> reason, the other on self-preservation. Both K=
ant and Locke use "reason" to justify their very different views on the p=
olitical right to rebel.  The categorical imperative, instead of supporti=
ng one idea and disproving its opposite, seems paradoxically to support b=
oth. Can an absolute principle still be absolute if its contradiction is =
also absolute? If the categorical imperative can generate both a principl=
e and its antithesis, then can't the categorical imperative generate <I>a=
ny</I> principle?</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF=3D"#fn31">31</A></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>  Kant assumes that since <=
I>a priori </I>reason generates universal principles, everyone will gener=
ate the same precepts and act similarly in similar circumstances.  Since =
people reason differently, and since the categorical imperative seems to =
derive whatever an individual wants it to, the categorical imperative see=
ms to support moral relativism, rather than moral absolutism. Thus, a gov=
ernment that bases itself upon the moral will of the collective would fou=
nd itself on relativist principles, thereby annihilating the ability of i=
ts citizens to unite.</P>

<P>In addition, Kant's notions of individual rights conflict with his not=
ions of legitimate state power. The categorical imperative aims to empowe=
r individual rights over the state, while simultaneously creating and giv=
ing legitimacy to the state. Then Kant argues that when the state forms, =
the collective must always obey the government--in effect, arguing that t=
he state becomes more important than the individuals that willed its exis=
tence. The system works as long as the government reflects the collective=
's moral will, because then it remains impossible to determine whether th=
e collective or the government has control. However, if an evil regime co=
ntrols the government and works contrary to the moral will, Kant argues t=
hat the state still has supremacy. In such circumstances, Kant should hav=
e argued that individual members of the collective have a duty to achieve=
 moral freedom beyond any requirements of governments. Then he would have=
 discovered that individual members of the collective always have a duty =
to resist and rebel, to strive for moral freedom. Consequently, Kant shou=
ld have discovered that the moral needs of the individual citizens should=
 always outweigh the needs of the state.</P>

<P>The failure of Kantian logic to defend against Locke's qualifications =
for rebellion demonstrates weaknesses in Kantian political thought.  Sinc=
e the categorical imperative generates both an absolute prohibition again=
st rebellion as well as exceptions to this absolute prohibition, a collec=
tive ought to expect the categorical imperative to derive only relative, =
not absolute, morality. Kantian limitations on the freedoms of the collec=
tive also contradict the moral needs and requirements of the collective. =
 As a result, it seems impossible for a society to adhere to Kantian conc=
eptions of reason and morality and still conform to a Kantian conception =
of government. Besides, a bitter irony seems to exist suggesting that a m=
oral people would never want to live in a Kantian society.  If morality t=
o Kant means compliance with the law even during the darkest times, a mor=
al people could violate laws of duty to maintain personal moral purity, t=
hus committing greater, more morally haunting, sins of inaction in time o=
f greatest need.  Great intentions have created marvelous wonders in the =
world. Yet, even these great intentions, when unchecked, have and will co=
ntinue to cause far greater moral disasters than those they purport to he=
lp. Indeed, we live in a world "where to do harm/Is often laudable, to do=
 good sometime/[is] dangerous folly."</FONT><FONT SIZE=3D1><!-- Anchor Li=
