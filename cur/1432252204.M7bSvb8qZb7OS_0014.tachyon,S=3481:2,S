I think that's a fair description of Day I. By Day II, though, Leen
seemed to miss some obvious (to me) technical questions that could be
raised on cross. I also had the change to watch him more closely, and
he seems to be doing a perfunctory job. He's almost communicating to
the jury (and clearly communicating to the judge) that he believes
his client is guilty but has the right to a trial.
