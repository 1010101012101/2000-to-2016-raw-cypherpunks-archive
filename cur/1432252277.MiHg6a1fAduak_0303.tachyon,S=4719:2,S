some interesting stats, also interesting copy / paste behavior:

"Scope and Scale of NSA Collection
According to figures published by a major tech provider, the Internet
carries 1,826 Petabytes of
information per day. In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches
about 1.6% of that. However,
of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review.
The net effect is that NSA

part in a million. Put another way, if a standard basketball court
represented the global

represented by an area smaller than a
dime on that basketball court."

to read:

again we see the fallacy of "not a search/collection until reviewed by
an analyst."...
