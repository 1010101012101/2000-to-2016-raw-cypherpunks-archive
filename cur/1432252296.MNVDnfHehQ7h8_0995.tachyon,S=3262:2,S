BU may be speaking of the attitude of a district judge when he learns
what you've done. It may not be an offense in itself, but it skirts
refusing a court order (in one hypothetical), and is really going to
just piss the judge off. So many trials include both sides trying to
convince the judge that they're taking reasonable positions, and
occasionally getting blindsided by a pissed off judge when he thinks
they're not. It's petty tyranny, true (look at my wired.com report on
the Scarfo case and the judge getting pissed at press coverage of it)
but it's what happens.
