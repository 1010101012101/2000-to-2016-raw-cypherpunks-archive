mucked this up badly- was not to imply my writing biblical,
instead that 'ideas' become theology, referenced text then
have faith-based aspect institutionalized, structuralized as
shared belief systems. sinning against ideology if going
against consensus in its inaccuracy, all of it corruptible
as ideas in their errored state and within language and
social relations, as it becomes or is ungrounded, etc,
then having this be the basis for exchange, development

...correction:  splits and divides the shared condition.

(please ignore that it does not make grammatical sense)


note: gotta say it, because it is relevant- i have social skills
of a 10 year old, never developed or kept pace with others
due to learning/behavioral deficit; not good with groups or
social relations unless about ideas or internet comms;
(aspergers) and, writing skills are horrendous, subpar
by far, some of it involving deteriorated brain function.
lysdexia also ubiquitous issue, i blame phonics.
