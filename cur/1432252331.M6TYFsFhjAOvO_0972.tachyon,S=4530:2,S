Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
full-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $12O
mil|iOn in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 170,0O0 Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,O0O homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,0O0 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
e|ectric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 milli0n for a
project this size.

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimu|ate the
development of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
re|evant po|icies, strategies and p|ans. To fulfi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
