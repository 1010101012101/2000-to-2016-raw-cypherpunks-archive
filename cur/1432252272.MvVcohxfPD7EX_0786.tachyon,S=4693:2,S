Quit inciting me to bake US troops into pies. I didn't want to do it, but 
you made such a convincing argument that I just had to. it's all your fault: 
You FORCED me to bake Corp Anderson and Lieutenant Sanders into pies. (Well, 
I actually didn't bake them in pies but baked some GI Joe action figures 
into pies, but that's the same thing after all: It's the thought that 
counts.)
