Uhhh yes it will go through the safety glass.. Look at the pics.. One person
had already put piece of lumber through it.. That was about a 15lb
extinguisher... From what I can tell from the photos the protester DID
intend harm to the police. Of course none of us were there so its really
hard to know the truth..
