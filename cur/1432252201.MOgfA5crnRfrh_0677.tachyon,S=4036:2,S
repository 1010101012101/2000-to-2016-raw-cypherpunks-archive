Subject: [liberationtech] The Tor Project has funding for a Firefox developer

The Tor Project is looking for a Firefox developer as a contractor
position likely starting in October and going through Q1 2013, with the
possibility of later in 2013 and beyond. There may also be a possibility
for part-time work prior to October. This would be a telecommuting
position, with collaboration happening primarily over IRC and email.

The purpose of our browser is to build a private-by-design reference
implementation of "Do Not Track", but through the alteration of
browser behavior and without the need for regulation or begging:
https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-private-browsing-modes-do-not-track-vs-real-privacy-design

Your job would be to work on that Firefox-based browser as a developer.
This includes triaging, diagnosing, and fixing bugs; looking for and
resolving web privacy issues; responding on short notice to security
issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on
implementing new features and web behavior changes. You'd also be
reviewing other people's code, designs, and academic research papers,
and looking for ways to improve upon them.

For information on how to apply and what to send in with your
application, please see the job posting:
https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en
