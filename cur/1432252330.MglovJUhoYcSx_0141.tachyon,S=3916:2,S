You're confusing two reports.  FG wrote about *private citizens*
calling for a whack via newspaper ad, which pisses off Israel the Govt
as much as the
Arizonans sniping immigrants on their own.  Or taking out an ad
calling for the whacking of Vincente Fox, fer instance.

Recently, both Israel and the Palestinians
gave lists of people they want to whack/imprison to the CIA
(who is playing fnord nanny).  These latter are official
"gummint" actions.  That's what you read about most recently.
