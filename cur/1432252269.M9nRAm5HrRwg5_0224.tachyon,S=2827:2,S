Acoustic Keyboard Eavesdropping
By STEPHEN MIHM

Published: December 12, 2004

When it comes to computer security, do you have faith in firewalls? Think 
passwords will protect you? Not so fast: it is now possible to eavesdrop 
on a typist's keystrokes and, by exploiting minute variations in the 
sounds made by different keys, distinguish and decipher what is being 
typed. 

<SNIP>

This means that firewalls and passwords will amount to nothing if someone 
manages to bug a room and record the cacophony of keystrokes. Asonov 
managed to pull off this feat with readily available recording equipment 
at a short distance. Even as far away as 50 feet, and with significant 
background noise, he was able to replicate his success using a parabolic 
microphone. He also anticipated an obvious practical objection: how does a 
would-be eavesdropper get into a building and spend enough time to 
''train'' a computer program to recognize the keystrokes of a particular 
keyboard? Not a problem: it seems that keyboards of the same make and 
model sound sufficiently alike -- regardless of who is typing -- that a 
computer trained on one keyboard can be unleashed on another.
