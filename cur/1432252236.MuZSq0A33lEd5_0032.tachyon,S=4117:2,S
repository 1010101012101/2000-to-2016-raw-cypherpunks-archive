I'm moving this to a fresh thread so that it will be unencumbered by the
other discussion that has strayed a bit. Even if one were to ignore
government agency interference, finding the best crypto choices is a
good topic, but it can easily get lost in the other discussion when some
people have written off the other topic. So lets try to keep this thread
solely on the technical topic of cryptographic quality.

I haven't yet seen anything conclusive. People have called into question
some or all of ECC, NSA's suggested Suite B, and so on. I put some links
in a previous message[1]. If anyone knows of some solid research showing
specific ciphers have been compromised, I'd love to see it so we can
inform users.

We use the RNG from FreeBSD so that may be a better question for a
FreeBSD-specific forum or list. There may be people here that know,
however, you're more likely to get better feedback from FreeBSD directly.
