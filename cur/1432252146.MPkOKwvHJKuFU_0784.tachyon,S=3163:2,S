Stego doesn't need to have a detectable (as telling apart from noise)
signature. If you show me how you test for stego I can show you a way to
package content that will pass that test. The problem space is similiar to
build good digital watermarks.

The difficulty is constructing a realistic-looking noise for a given set of
digital sources. Given that the tests take crunch, this will be limited to
forensics. (And one would wonder why the turdorrists smart enough to use
steganography wouldn't use really good cryptographic file systems).

And any idiot knows successful terrorists don't use crypto.

If you have noise in the signal, can you substitute that noise with your
payload easily, or is it better to use synthetic low-noise signals, and add
your suitably encoded payload to it?
