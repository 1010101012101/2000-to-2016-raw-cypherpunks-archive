What's up with voice encryption?  I'm ready to use it.  I'm ready to
pay money for it.  However, this is only if it uses a real crypto
algorithm (AES, 3DES, and not some "proprietary" crap) and if it has a
published protocol, so we can verify that it is actually encrypting
properly.  Starium has had "demo" units out for almost two years now,
but their web page has been static for a long time, and no one has
answered the phone there for a long time.  Any others?  I know that
voice encryption is the last great crypto taboo, and I'm waiting for
it to fall.

I am aware of quite a few other voice encryption units out there, but
all that I have looked into have used a proprietary protocol, and even
worse, some proprietary crypto algorithm.  That seems pretty useless.
If their alg is so fabulous why didn't they submit it to the AES
competition?  Ergo, their alg is not so fabulous.
