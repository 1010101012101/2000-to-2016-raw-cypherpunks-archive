You have this backwards. The world spot market price for light crude is 
something like $25 a bbl. Refineries receiving no subsidies can produce 
a gallon of gasoline and sell it profitably for about $0.60.

Then taxes are added, and added.

In Europe, even more taxes are added to a gallon/liter of gas/petrol.

Where are the subsidies you think are being given to those who import 
oil they buy for $25/bbl and then refine in refineries receiving no 
subsidies?

(I hope you don't say things like "oil depletion allowance." That 
affects _some_ producers, and should of course be ended as all taxes are 
rolled way back, but this does not affect the refiner who buys Saudi 
light sweet, hauls it to refineries in the Caribbean, outside the U.S., 
and then sells it in the U.S. Or do you think Royal Dutch Shell is being 
subsidized by the U.S. Government? Gonna be news to them.)

As I said, you have it all backwards.
