On this whole point of Gnupg (gpg) and some of the issues with using
it (and transitions etc), may I (well, I just will) recommend this,
from sources I've compiled in a way that people seem to like and have
found helpful:

Crazy Strong: @gnupg "learn or die" in 2015 #31c3 All systems
https://securityinabox.org/thunderbird_main
See also http://futureboy.us/pgp.html#GettingStarted
http://www.g-loaded.eu/2010/11/01/change-expiration-date-gpg-key/

on twitter as:
https://twitter.com/AnonyOdinn/status/550826144014934016

which has caused Gnupg / thunderbird / etc. awareness to reach 14,685
accounts that might otherwise not have seen it.

based on an analysis from http://tweetreach.com/reports/12801475
Learn or die folks.

but you may ask, what about the transitions? new machine? older key
issues? proper use? getting stronger new key? etc.

valid questions! which is what I am asking myself right now (since I
have some old key issues that I am trying to work through and I didn't
have good answers).

fortunately, rysiek came to the rescue in a very timely way, and gave
me permission to republish (rysiek's) statement which appears below:
rysiek explains:
GPG Key Transition: http://rys.io/en/147
Zmieniam klucz GPG: http://rys.io/pl/147

twitter:
https://twitter.com/AnonyOdinn/status/552630836747456512

The instructions are very clear and helpful.  (Thank you rysiek!)

I'll be developing my own transition statement at some point soon
using rysiek's page as a guide. Not sure of when, but rysiek's page
will be my guide.
