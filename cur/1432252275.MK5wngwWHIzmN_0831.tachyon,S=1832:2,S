I guess it's been a while since I set this up, so people
have forgotten.

There's a "whitelist" that has subscribers to all
the CDRs, anonymous remailers, and anyone that
has ever posted to any CDR (assuming we got the mail).
It's not often that there is a non-spam post from
a sender that isn't on the whitelist-- when there is, I
forward it and put the sender on the list.

The idea is to filter out the spam without requiring moderation.
