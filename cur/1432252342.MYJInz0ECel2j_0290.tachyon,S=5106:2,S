This is actually done systematically done in parts of the US. It's referred 
to by various names, including a "time bank". Basically, anyone in the 
community contributes X hours of their skill, which is counted purely as 
time in hours. They can then "withdraw" an equivalent number of hours from 
the bank in terms of the goods and services of the other bank memebers.

Strangely, in some parts of the country the system has so proliferated some 
communities that they have issued "money" that can be spent in local shops. 
This money is "backed" by X hours in the time bank. There're some people who 
actually collect these time bank tokens.

Now for some reason, there was a lot of talk about these time banks back in 
the mid 90s, but now I rarely hear about them. I wonder if the potential 
loss of tax revenue was a factor.

Hum...it'd be interesting to look at securing one of those local time banks 
with financial cryptography.
