Also, make contact with people far away from you _in_ the strong set,
thus making a "bridge" between widely separated parts of set. This requires
more people to "travel" over you for short paths. bwah ha ha.

Vis a vis Peter Wan, #1 on the list, and a professor at GA Tech. Great
spreader of the faith, this man...

4. Sell your house, clothes, and other belongings and become a prophet
of cryptography. Normally, you would be faceless and noone would know
who you _really_ were. But in this case, you'll have your GPG identity,
which is better than any flesh-and-blood ID anyway.

"Drew juice". :) One of my friends is very into PS2 Gauntlet recently,
and suggests I begin assigning levels.

"Don Marti, you are now a level 27 keywhore."

But yes, I'm doing my best to only encourage _good_ behavior from this
ranking, which is why the main report is structured as it is.

Heh, is this the wonderful email garden writeup, or am I to be expecting
something different? You're quite the writer, my friend.

BTW, I still have your server sitting in my bar. Maybe burnallmp3s.org
becomes an Ogg Vorbis shrine.
