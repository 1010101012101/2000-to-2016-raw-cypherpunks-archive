Three Of Twenty-Four Anti-Racist Activists Released

Three of twenty-four anti-racist activists arrested on August 24 at the 
Baltimore Travel Plaza have been released.
[BALTIMORE MD] At the Baltimore Travel Plaza Saturday August 24 at 
approximately 7:30am, twenty-four to twenty-nine anti-racist activists were 
arrested after a confrontation with neo-nazis who were gathering to travel 
to Washington DC to participate in a rally organized by the National Alliance.

Major F. H. Bealefeld told Indymedia that the attack included weapons such 
as stick, hockey sticks, and similar weapons. There were three injuries, 
one of which required hospitalization. According to an anti-racist 
activist, approximately 120 neo-nazis attempted to board charter buses at 
the Travel Plaza.

The Sunpapers (8/25/02) reported the police as saying that "It was not 
immediately known whether the attackers were counter-demonstrators or 
members of a rival supremacist group." However, it was widely publicized 
that the National Alliance had organized a rally for August 24 and that 
anti-racist activists were planning to respond with counter-demonstrations, 
and possibly other methods. In fact, the neighborhood around the Baltimore 
Travel Plaza was extensively leafleted in prior days, according to an 
anti-racist activist.

The Sunpapers should have spent more time investigating the event, rather 
than relying on the police officials. While the Sunpapers' report was not 
as egregious as that of FOX 45, which reported a fight between rival 
neo-nazi groups, a little more investigation would have given a more 
accurate picture of the event.

Three of those arrested have been released as of mid-afternoon August 25. 
Bail has been set in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 each. One arrestee, a 
minor, was charged with 23 counts of aggravated assault, according to an 
anti-racist activist.

Anti-racist activists who would like to support the arrestees may make a 
check out to Black Planet Books with "jail solidarity" in the memo line and 
mail it to Black Planet, 1621 Fleet Street, Baltimore, MD 21231. See also:
