The main difference, the axis along which one classifies
maillists/usenet/weblogs is the control.

On usenet, once the site agrees to carry a newsgroup, you have many entry
points and automatic distribution that is next to impossible to choke (other
than with noise.)

Maillists are more controllable (as even cypherpunk nodes experienced) but and
probably the least bad solution so far. And they are not much different from
usenet - fewer "newsgroups" (you decide what you want) and you are your own
server. With today's connectivity and computing resources, smaller maillists
(seeral hundred subscribers) don't really need servers (exploders) - just a
shared recipient list. Very censorship-resistant.

Weblogs are at the mercy of site operators and extremely vulnerable to
moronship and censorship.

This means that the Next Big Attack From Them will be on the e-mail. It's far
too easy for everyone today to bear arms, I mean have an e-mail interface.
