Steganography Detection with Stegdetect
Stegdetect is an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in 
images. It is capable of detecting several different steganographic 
methods to embed hidden information in JPEG images. Currently, the 
detectable schemes are

    * jsteg,
    * jphide (unix and windows),
    * invisible secrets,
    * outguess 01.3b,
    * F5 (header analysis),
    * appendX and camouflage.

Stegbreak is used to launch dictionary attacks against JSteg-Shell, JPHide 
and OutGuess 0.13b.

Stegdetect and Stegbreak have been developed by Niels Provos.
