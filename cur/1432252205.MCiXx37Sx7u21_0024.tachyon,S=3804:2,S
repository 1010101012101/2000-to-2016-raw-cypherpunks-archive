At first it seems that there isn't much one person or even a few can do 
about this, but I'm no longer so sure.  The politics and power of government is, in the end, always dispensed from the end of a gun.  For this reason very few citizens even consider contending with the government for political purposes until they fell there is little choice.


Nothing less than a guerilla war seems necessary to restore something akin to the original constitutional balance in the U.S.  But where to recruit these people?  My suggestion: the terminally ill.  

Many TI come to the table with a 'gift', the certainty of impending death and for some the possibility of fearlessness for physical harm or imprisonment. While the majority of the TI will not see any reason to buck the system in their final days (ideological disagreement, fear for the effect on their families, lack the health, resources, skills or mentality for such a ' final adventure ') I did some back of the envelope calculations that show that more than 100 people die in the U.S. every day who could fill the bill.

I've coined the term Zombie Patriots to signify the TI who volunteer to give their last full measure to the American Restoration.  Operating alone or in small groups they could form the backbone of an American Civil Liberties Army.

ZPs need an education in how to create a personal plan of action and acquire the needed skills and resources (Paladin Press where are you when we need you).  A Domestic American Patriot Family Fund may also be desired.
