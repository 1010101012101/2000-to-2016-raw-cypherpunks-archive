My understanding is that the initial permutation, (which essentially
writes the 64 bits of key in a 8 x 8 block by column and row,
then reads it out by row and column) was included to simplify
early DES chip hardware. It has no impact on the security of 
the algorithm. If you know what you are doing, it does not effect 
key agility in software implementations.
