This basic idea is discussed in Massey and Maurer's ``The
Importance of Being First'' paper.  There are a couple
issues:

a.  The keys need to be independent.  (Otherwise, imagine if
cipher #1 is DES encryption, and cipher #2 is DES
decryption.)

b.  There order of the ciphers matters for the kind of
security proof you can do.  If you do Twofish, then
Rijndael, you can prove that a known-plaintext attack on
this system = a known plaintext attack on Twofish and a
chosen-plaintext attack on Rijndael.  (That is, the combined
system can be no easier to break than the easier of a
known-plaintext attack on Twofish or a chosen-plaintext
attack on Rijndael.)

A smarter way to do this is to do OFB-mode or counter-mode
with all N ciphers.  That way, you can prove that breaking
the resulting cipher is equivalent to breaking OFB mode
encryption under all N of the ciphers.

The dings in DEAL wouldn't amount to much in this setting,
in practice.  (Okay, so the dings in DEAL wouldn't ever
matter in practice, unless you wanted to use DEAL alone for
a hashing construction.)
