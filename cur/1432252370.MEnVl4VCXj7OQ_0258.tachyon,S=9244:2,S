Well, there's some truth here but a lot of oversimplification as well.
I'd argue that the US patent system (or at least the thoughtof it) had a lot 
to do with the ability of inventors to take risks, gather startup capital, 
and get a product rolling. There is first of all the perception that their 
"secret sauce" is to some extent protected (as are the time & $ 
investments), as well as the actual protection (litigation actually works 
once in a while, and the threat thereof has kept some from copying to soon 
and too closely). This environment has had a major effect on technological 
innovation.

That's not to say it can't happen in other environments, but it seems to 
unfold very differently in, say, China or the USSR (which actually has 
contributed lots of technological and scientific ideas to the world). But 
none of them have benefited $$$-wise (nor has the pace been nearly as fast) 
as in the US.

Meanwhile, regulations and governments can give some industries a head 
start, particularly if a "jungle" already holds a nice warm niche for the 
output of those industries. Thus Sematec helped US semiconductors to roar 
back from the brink of extinction, and the buying up (and subsequent 
dismantling) of lite rail systems in the LA basin in the 30s and 40s 
apparently had a major impact on the rollout of vehicles Might we have seen 
much better public transportation in that area if this capitalist 
coup-d'etat hadn't occurred? The moon shots did apparently accelerate the 
development of semiconductors.

(A side note should be made here about the fact that some technologies have 
a very high activation energy barrier...without a very intensive amount of 
capital, they can't happen. Indeed, aren't we nearly at that point with 
sub-0.13um technology? It is possible that further advances just won't be 
possible without direct or indirect government funding.)

The best technology does not always win. In fact, the concept of "best 
technology" is kinda shakey most of the time. There are sociological, 
political, and other factors than can alter the course of things for a 
while.

That said, the technological "survival of the fittest" notion seems to be a 
fairly constant undercurrent that re-asserts itself periodically as the 
various sociological ephemera come and go. Like Kuhn or Popper, these aren't 
the only drivers, but they are certainly one of the axes.

So the picking of technological winners is possible, but if the technology 
is actually a winner!
