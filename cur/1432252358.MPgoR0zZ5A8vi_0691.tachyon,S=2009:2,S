There were once cpunk subscribers from NSA's National Computer Security
Center (ncsc.mil; 144.51.x.x) in the 90s and a slew of .mils, .govs and
others 
interested in crypto before it became a porkbelly commodity.

Learning from cpunks, a daily bot from ncsc came to JYA.com (predecessor 
of Cryptome) when it set up in 1996, and took anything new:

There are still occasional visits from several ncsc machines but not
a daily bot, at least not by that couture label. 

Here's a list of 2,821 machine addresses at ncsc in 2001:

Never a hit from nsa.gov, which appears to be only public tool like fbi.gov
not used for lazy gandering and fucking off.

NSANET and www.nsa (no extension) are hard to crack but once gave 
good comsec, maybe still do:
