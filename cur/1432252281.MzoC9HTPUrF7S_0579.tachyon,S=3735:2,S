Now we hear of calls urging dual-citizenship residents of 
ZOG-occupied Palestine to send in absentee ballots to Florida,

ballots on a fast jet to Florida.)

U.S. Absentee Voters in Mideast 'Unknown Quantity'

Palestinian territories could influence the outcome of the razor-edge 
U.S. presidential election but are unlikely to be able to vote late,

living in Israel and Palestinian-ruled areas could still send in 
ballot papers if they proved they were unable to postmark them by the 
November 7 deadline.
