said another way:
 there are risks known, and known unknown, and unknown unknown,
  in such a calculated cache - digital and present harm alike and unto the

FY2014 corpora is coming, like cryptome-jul2014

reply to receive early distribution.

- cryptome, web, other selected volumes
- sha256 short sums, selected signatures
- annotated search-able formats, where available
- coder's annotations and subsets [to explain later]
- Xapian stores by domain for custom aggregation or scope
