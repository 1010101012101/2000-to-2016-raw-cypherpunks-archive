A truthful report would have read as follows:
	"US claimed its forces were on the outskirts of the  
	Airport.  The minister for information denied that US  
	forces were anywhere near reported, and offered to  
	permit newsmen to tour the airport.  The ministry of  
	information minders took the the newsmen to the airport 
	lounge, but did not permit them to get anywhere near  
	the outskirts of the airport, let alone tour it, which 
	shows the minister to be lying about permitting newsmen 
	to see for themselves, which would suggest the minister 
	is lying the location of US forces, and the US  telling 
	the truth.

Instead, Fisk conspicuously fails to mention that the minders  
are controlling the newsmen in a way that prevents them from  
knowing what he claims to know, and instead proclaims that the 
minister is telling the truth, and the US lying

Fisk omits critical facts, and confidently claims to know what 
he was not permitted to know.

The one is a lie of omission, the other a lie of commission.   
Fisk conceals from his readers the fact that it is impossible 
to check on the lies of a totalitarian state, and denies 
barefaced the fact that promises to allow such checking are 
always lies.
