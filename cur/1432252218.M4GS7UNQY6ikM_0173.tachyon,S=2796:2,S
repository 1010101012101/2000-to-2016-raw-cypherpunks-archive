I don't think E-gold ever held out its system as non-reversible with proper 
court order.  All reverses I am aware happened either due to some technical 
problem with their system or an order from a court of competence in the 
matter at hand.

Its not clear at all that courts will find engineering a system for 
irreversibility is illegal or contributory if there was good justification 
for legal business purposes, which of course there are.
