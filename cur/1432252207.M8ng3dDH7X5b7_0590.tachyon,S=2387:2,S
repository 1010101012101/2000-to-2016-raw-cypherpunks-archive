I suspect he's doing what I've done on several dozen systems: he's 
attacking novice users who leave passwords cached, private and public keys 
together, weak passwords across all systems and encrufted (Gates' version 
of 'encrypted :-) or encrypted files.

As for the wirespeed intercept on the backbone, thats OLD news: we were 
doing in the core at Savvis back in 2000.

He's exploiting the stupid, not the real users. And lets face it - most 
users have less than a clue.
