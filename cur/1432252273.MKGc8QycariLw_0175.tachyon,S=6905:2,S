Those are the costs for being just a member of UEFI -- what you were
suggesting originally was being a root key holder, able to sign
developer keys which can then be used to sign operating systems to boot
under Secure Boot equipped firmwares that ship recognizing that root
key. This would be nice, because then people wouldn't be so dependent on
Microsoft's Certificate Authority. But, this comes with the kinds of
costs you might expect from a secure operation to keep certs safe --
insurance, audits, running the process of signing developer keys, etc. I
don't know where all of the costs come from but I can see how they build
up quickly.=20

Some -- resources for all of this are an issue. Also depends if by
"proper" you mean that it comes enabled and preloaded with trusted keys,
in which case see above.

One thing that would make this whole mess better would be if drivers
could effectively be signed by more than one key. That would help lessen
some of the dependency on Microsoft, because drivers could be signed by
smaller party keys without having to drop Microsoft. I think this is
allowed for by policy and signing format but is not being implemented.
