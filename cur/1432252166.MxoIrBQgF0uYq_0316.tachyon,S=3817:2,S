Subject: VeriChip chairman promotes RFID "chipping" of immigrants


Dave,

Many of us who are concerned about the potential abuse of RFID
systems have long suspected that some "low status" class of
individuals would be the first to find itself subjected to RFID chip
implants under government edict, after which the range of included
persons would gradually expand to cover more and more of the general
population.

These chips in their present form cannot be controlled by the
implanted individual, and so are subject to interrogation at any
time with or without the knowledge of the "chipee."

I've speculated in the past that persons convicted of sex crimes
might be among the likely initial targets by the proponents of this
technology, possibly as a requirement for parole.

However, it appears that VeriChip (the main player in the human RFID
implant space) may have their sights on a significantly larger
demographic.  VeriChip's chairman was on Fox News last Tuesday
promoting the concept of "chipping" immigrants, "guest workers," and
the like.

Here's the transcript:

Hold out your arm -- this won't hurt a bit, eh?
