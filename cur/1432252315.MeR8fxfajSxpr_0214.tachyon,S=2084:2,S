I'm not sure what your motivation is for wanting to rewrite history, but that 
isn't what Glaspie said.

There's a video interview I saw about all of this on 60 minutes (I think) 
where it was made clear that Glaspie did in fact say to Saddam that "We have no 
opinion on your Arab - Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait."
