A BETTER ENCRYPTOR: Forget high-end alphanumeric characters. The
latest in encryption technology is deceptively simple - and familiar.

messages in adjective-riddled promotional language. Spam Mimic uses
phrases like "become rich within 30 DAYS" and "We will help you SELL
MORE and SELL MORE" to bury your real meaning.
