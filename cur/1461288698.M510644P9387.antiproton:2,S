I'm not a "gold bug". But I do own (physically possess) enough gold to
live on for a few years, even at current prices. Also silver, computer
gear and parts, some guns and ammunition, and so on. One never knows.

I use Bitcoin, but don't hoard it. It's a convenient way to get paid and
lease services online. And I know how to use it, as anonymously as
needed. I don't really care about the "threat" aspects. I just do my
thing, and do what it takes to be left alone.
