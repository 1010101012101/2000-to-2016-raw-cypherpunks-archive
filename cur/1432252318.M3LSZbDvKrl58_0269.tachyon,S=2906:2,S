Even if we used it here, the fate of legislation would still be
determined by the dominant party in the Senate, which would still rarely
if ever admit 3rd parties, and by the president's veto.

I assume you're criticizing only House election procedures because

restructuring the federal legislature.  If it were possible, would you
prefer to see nation-wide proportional representation if it included
mandatory geographical distribution requirements like those you
described?
