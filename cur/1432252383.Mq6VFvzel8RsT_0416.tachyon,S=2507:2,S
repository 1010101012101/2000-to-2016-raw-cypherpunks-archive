I thought some of you might be interested in this. "The Conet
Project" is a 4 CD collection of recordings of the so-called "numbers
stations" which are purported to be one way short wave communications
from intelligence agencies to their people in the field. The
recordings (just re-released) are really quite amazing. Intelligence
communication as art? Who knew? More information can be found here:
