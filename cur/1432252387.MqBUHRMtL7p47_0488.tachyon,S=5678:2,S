All I'm saying is that if the feds are doing their job well, they won't 
stick out at all. Smells like a witch hunt.

Anyone who comes here and regularly expresses unpopular opinions in a 
provocative way is generally--almost by definition--"not liked". And if you 
don't like someone, you tend to interpret anything they do in the light of 
your not liking them. I can't help but think that since the topics being 
discussed here are so sensitive, everyone gets a little twitchy and runs 
the risk of going overboard in the way they perceive "dissenters" who are 
at odds with the prevailing wisdom. 

Actually, I think the group would be better off if more people were around 
to goad everyone into clarifying their thoughts and articulating them 
succinctly and persuasively. Couldn't hurt. Believe it or not, Choate is 
doing everyone a favor. 

And even if a whole gang of feds were actively trolling the group, what 
difference would it make as long as everyone has enough sense to see 
through it and keep their heads on straight? In a sick and perverse sense, 
you might call it Darwinian justice. 

Also, the "but they're wasting our time" angle is easily circumvented by 
having the self-discipline not to write knee-jerk replies to obvious 
nonsense. Some people never learn...

I must have missed it. Unless you think I'm one of her nyms, you might 
noticed I've had some unkind words for ZKS myself. Becuase as much as I 
fear the NSA, I fear gullibility and stupidity among the well-intentioned 
even more. And if saying so makes for a more entertaining debate, well, so 
much the better.

True, but if she really is incompetent, she's hardly a threat, is she. The 
only feds to really worry about are the competent ones.
