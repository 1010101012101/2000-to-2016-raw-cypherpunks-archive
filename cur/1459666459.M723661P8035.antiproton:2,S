I think bigger problem than the sites is that many more things are
screwed.

One can block sites, but browsers suck probably worse.

On debian 8, "iceweasel about:blank" in a fresh profile sets you a
google cookie. In addition it checks for updates (almost sure from
mozilla.) -- run it from terminal, wait at most few hours and watch
stdout/stderr. Chromium was found to run native code downloaded from
google.

For search engines and the like you are the product (as someone
already said).
