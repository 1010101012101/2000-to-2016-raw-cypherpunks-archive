I mostly agree. I hope the situation will better. I think one of the big
things that's needed is a superior alternative to Republics. From there,
something so fundamental, perhaps we can see more improvements. (note: I'd
like your suggestions)

There's still wise choices in a skewed system. They're just not always
realistic, sometimes even bizarre. The better the system the better the
wise choice.

Complex agreements, abstaining from violence, huge organizations, etc.
These are valuable, aren't they?

Ideally, there's a political game that is able to generate "appropriate"
political choices. It's not a republic, a trade union, tribal
understandings, etc, etc, per se, but there's always something.

Without this system we are screwed anyway. If we do have that system we
*should* use it.

And we can use it to determine the absolute widest boundaries of what is
permitted, boundaries which you may not wander out of. We can produce
incentive schemes, to encourage the correct behavior. In fact, if the
system works it needs no restrictions.

We've yet to find a system that works. (also on the account of those pesky
flawed humans making up the systems)

Do tell me Juan, how do we prevent a "criminal monopoly"? Isn't it better
to make a very good "criminal monopoly"?

Well, atm I'm still dreaming up the utopia. So far I have no convertees,
either :)

I have the right because I can. Powers *are* rights. Or, rather, rights do
not exist until a criminal monopoly invents justice, and grants people a
promise of abstaining from using power; a right.

IIRC you have this philosophy of inalienable rights, or natural rights, or
rights you would always claim, whatever. It doesn't matter. If you haven't
the power to claim a right, you do not have it. Ask the pigs, cows,
rabbits, ferrits, birds, and all the other animals we do whatever we want
to. Ask the mountains thought to have spirits. Listen to them and you will
hear but weeping for lack of strength.

Ofc, I'm the asshole for saying this.

I think in practice it will be easier to make the system a compelling
opt-in. If you don't want to be in it, it is probably not good enough. It's
important to be a bit selfish, not help people that don't opt-in. It's only
fair ;)

I stated "it makes investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less
important". I think most people that have patents don't need their
investments to be even more worthwhile. I think patent licensing systems
like mpeg, dolby, proprietary connectors, etc, do not help anyone. I think
copyright has crippled the economy and creativity, and served mostly to
produce Justin Bieber.

I do like that there's no more (at least much less) need for secrecy. And I
like the idea that an independent inventor is able to to make a living.
There's some research-only companies that have a very good market position
thanks to copyright law, whereas otherwise they'd be at the whims of
producing companies.

Understand, then improve upon.

I honestly do not know.

This is a very complex issue spanning all industries. I think the patent
system is a steaming pile of mercantile shit. The core idea is not so crazy
though - idea's can be stolen, so they must be property. But you don't lose
the idea when it gets stolen.

It ruins the creative industries - we've made our fantasies protected
property, subject not to the potential for art but the will of businessmen.
Countless stories go untold. The stories that do get told are smudged with
corporate inserts and ruinous inserted political messages. (look for
racism/feminist inserts, they're everywhere and they usually fail to
actually be unracist or feminist)

Software is such a broken industry (thanks huge sw companies!) that any
sense of right or wrong is already pre-broken. I think software was
probably more fun when nobody could protect it. We could develop software
based on bounties. There's another game theory problem, but at least
software would be fun again. (note: copyright is ineffective at protecting
software atm, if it were effective the market might actually be well
developed but still not fun)

Should Kia be allowed to copy exactly what Ford is doing? It seems like
theft to me. Ford invested and created something (a car design), why should
Kia customers not pay for that effort? Secrecy is an expensive (and
impractical) solution.

Fortunately, if we just let them figure it out they will have to find the
optimal way of dealing with it. Not us. I think merging all car companies,
making manufacture a non-market activity (product price =3D costs + 10%
instead), sales can still do whatever it does now, allow the designers to
self-organize and support the projects they believe in, reward them more
when their products work out.

Microsoft/Apple, Intel/AMD, ATI/Nvidia, most telecoms actually form cartels
with more than 2.

The basic principles are:
* There is a market leader
* There is competition
* If the market leader claims the entire market, it will be destroyed by
government (anti-monopoly law)
* The market leader will calibrate it's effort to stop short of claiming
the entire market (likely preferring to reward shareholders, divest, etc)
* If the competition advances, the market leader will advance as much (it
has more resources to advance, and will typically succeed at maintaining
it's lead)
* Any advance the competition makes is now wasted, as the market leader
will match the advancement
* The competition has no reason to advance, except upon itself (other
competition)

I'm not so wise on the world, I am no expert on the actual state of markets
and corporations. I'm sure someone reading is.

Some 4 year old children are soldiers. Bankers are ageist and pretentious,
so they prefer white 25 to 60 year olds (in-corporate ranks are age-pinned)=
