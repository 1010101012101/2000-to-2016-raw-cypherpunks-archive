My own aside, how many votes are required before my right to
security in person and property should be violated?  50% + 1?

Why only American citizens?  There are entire countries whose
populations are worse off than the most poorly ensured USAian.
Doesn't your heart bleed for them?

Regardless, don't go to the trouble of raising taxes and cutting

some level of healthcare for every American citizen.  I'm
assuming quality of care isn't a consideration?
