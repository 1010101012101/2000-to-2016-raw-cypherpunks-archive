Brin's ideas only look cool if you think that we're living in a perfect
anarchy, and that there's no intrinsic edge in centralism. Surveillance
technology favours centralism, however, and we all know why anarchy is
unstable with current type of agents, right? So he built the foundations
of his glass castle on a pile of stinky poo.

Brin is confabulating an alternative reality. This reality doesn't give a
flying fuck about what he thinks is going to happen. He's actually doing
damage, because quite a few people find his ideas superficially appealing,
and stagnate in happy complacency. Sheep like the idea of Brinworld.
Goverments love the idea of Brinworld, because it makes selling the
current brand of FUD much easier. Happy sheep don't mind being shorn so
much.

Dunno, they come off a lot like narcistic wankers to me. Maybe some of
them are writing code, but they must be damn secretive about it. There are
literally very few people in the world who're good architects, and
actually develop stuff.
