	No, it doesn't. In the places where most people live, if you shoot a 
burglar in your home, you *will* call your lawyer if you've got half a 
brain in your head (talk to the cops about a shooting *without* one? Are 
you nuts?), you will probably go downtown, at least to get booked, and you 
might spend some time (measured in hours) behind bars.
	
	You've just shot (and if you're any good killed) someone--the fourth 
worst crime in the books (after using ethnic slurs, making sexist comments,
  and being mean to poor people by wanting to keep your hard earned 
money)--unless the police know you, they are likely to do it just to make 
sure you're not the burglar who got the drop on the home owner.

	Then there is the family of the deceased. You're a big fat target for 
a civil suit, and if the family cannot afford a lawyer, one will be 
appointed to them by the Brady Campaign against Civil Rights.

	Where do you live that the cops are that stupid and lazy?
