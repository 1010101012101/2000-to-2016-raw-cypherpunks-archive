Summary: Fewer than 100 angry email messages from American gun owners led 
U.N. conference organizers to turn over the correspondence to U.N. internal 
security forces. The U.N. gun-summit began today, and -- see below -- 
includes proposals for a global gun database, tracking of firearms, 
complaints about encryption and so on. What's interesting is that even this 
limited outcry was enough to prompt U.N. officials to make the appropriate 
"we're not trying to limit private ownership of guns," apparently 
backtracking from previous positions.

>He said he had seen some of the nearly 100 letters and e-mails that had 
>been sent by gun-ownership advocates. They were mainly irate and "strongly 
>worded" protests, and allegations that the United Nations wanted to take 
>guns away from civilians in conflict with the constitutional rights of 
>United States citizens. While he would not characterize any of the letters 
>as explicitly threatening, they had been turned over to United Nations 
>security authorities. Mr. Honwana added that it was not for his Department 
>to determine whether the correspondence was threatening. It was up to the 
>Organization's security staff to make that determination.

>A small arms and light weapons register could be established, adds the 
>report, at the national level to assist information-gathering and 
>information-sharing. One option could be to extend this register to the 
>regional level. While the option of a United Nations register was 
>discussed, significant opposition continues to exist to a global register 
>on the basis that it is premature and the provision of such sensitive 
>information could undermine, not enhance, national security.

http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dc2746.doc.htm
>On specific points to be included in the recommendations to the 
>Conference, the representative of Pakistan promoted a proper marking 
>system for numbering weapons... Some tracking system was in the interest 
>of both producers and governments, which should keep the information under 
>their authority at all times.

>Furthermore, some of these activities are already
>conducted by the brokers or other participants in the
>chain of the illicit trade, by using e-commerce channels
>and networks. This e-commerce is frequently encoded
>or encrypted, thus placing an extra burden on the law
>enforcement institutions to detect it.

United Nations opens gun conference
The United Nations opens a special session in New York focusing on the 
international market for small arms. The UN has already angered proponents 
of freedom with proposals to limit or prohibit private ownership of small 
arms. (07/09/01)

UN investigating email from gun owners as 'threat'
The United Nations is investigating whether irate letters and email from 
American gun enthusiasts protesting an upcoming conference on illicit trade 
in small arms constitute a security threat. The body has received about 100 
complaints from Americans "who erroneously believe the conference seeks to 
infringe on their right to bear arms," said a U.N. spokesman. (07/05/01)
