I was wondering in a similar vein.  There are also the reports of the 
rented car found to contain Arabic-language flight training manuals, 
and the hotel room in Boston rented by persons sharing the names 
of suspect passengers on the hijacked flights.  NewsMax carries a 
story 
(http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/9/12/80845.shtml)
 that 5 suspects have been identified.

This is too easy.

The overt sophistication of this attack was such that I have a hard 
time believing the perps would leave so many obvious clues behind 
without intending to.  And if they intended to leave clues, the clues 
are almost certainly red herrings.

Interesting times, indeed.
