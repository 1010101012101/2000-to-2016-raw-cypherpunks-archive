Yes, and Stalin dismissively asked an advisor how many divisions the Pope

Yes, you've advanced that notion before. That sort of penurious antipathy is
why encrypted communications as a matter of course will never catch on. Not
among the masses where it is most needed. Outside of a few specialized

really about. Or at least, what it used to be about.
