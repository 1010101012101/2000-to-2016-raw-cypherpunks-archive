Hint: Please give use version numbers of stuff you have.

The main distribution site for PGP freeware cl for unix is:
http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html

In case this isn't clear to you, pgp4pine and pgppine are different
programs, and both are just wrappers for pgp.

I have no idea why you don't just install the appropriate debian
package for whichever of pgp4pine or pgppine you prefer... unless you have
a pre-apt version of debian (suggestion: upgrade) or you
don't know what you're doing (suggestion: RTFM at
http://www.newriders.com/debian/html/frames/ , seeing especially the
"Removing and Installing Software" section).
