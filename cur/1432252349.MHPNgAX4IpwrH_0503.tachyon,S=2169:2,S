Yes --the analog hole is alive and well.   But in an Orwellian
future, the movies have signals that disable the camcorders.  Think
macrovision for theatres.  Think "copy flag" for video acquisition
devices.
Think CALEA for PGPfone :-)  There are already patented plans to display
the images such that  the eye doesn't notice, but camcorders will record
flicker.
There are means to go around this, of course.  See
watermarking/steganography.
(Not you, DH, just random readers seeking more)

Of course, future *Sony* camcorders will *burst into flames* if you try
to record such... techno-sharia, steal a copy, lose your fingers.

Oh, but Sony would never do something *irresponsible and dangerous* like
that...
