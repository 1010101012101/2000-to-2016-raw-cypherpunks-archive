And the nexus of taxation is the actual worker (narced out by others), 
not the means of settlement. The means of settlement is usually cash, 
folding money, and is not traceable in any plausible way.

The attack on off-the-book/under-the-table business transactions is not 
the clearing mechanism. After all, cash works perfectly well for 
clearing under-the-table transactions.

What nails under-the-table transactions is (rarely, actually) when 
someone narcs out a partner as a way of getting a lighter sentence.

This will all change if cash is ever outlawed, if the Beast insists 
that all financial transactions be cleared through one of his compliant 
banks. This is expected to happen soon enough, by more of us than just 
Xtian Fundies.
