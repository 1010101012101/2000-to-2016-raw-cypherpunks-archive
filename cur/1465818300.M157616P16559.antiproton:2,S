Indeed. I gnashing my teeth here and there over those dang humans, so very
few can be trusted to behave rationally, let alone without the negative
aspects of the mind and emotion - vindictiveness, anger, spite, envy,
greed, lust, lynch-mobbingness etc.

An immediate transition, say removal of the state, would probably descend
into gangs exacting vigilante justice on each other, causing a lot of
damage, collateral damage, to humans and property, before eventually they
figure out (if they/ the majority do figure anything out) that sanity
requires a basic procedure of "do unto others as you'd have them do unto
you" and therefore a justice procedure which involves more than just "go
bash the shit out of the person your mate says did the wrong thing".

An external authority is indeed probably required with the current state
of schooled humans, to educate them on internal authority and how best to
exercise that, such as to syndicate in an objectively self interested way.

Lynch mobbing demonstrates that most humans don't get past their first
thought to a second thought. That's just asking a lot... evidently.

So practically I believe we are left with attempts to create enclaves of
like minded individuals - syndicates of self interested humans, limited in
number, acting in mutual self interest, learning how to handle the
different natures of one another.

I do believe we are stuck with the state for the short to medium term, and
I'd hate to see the last 20 years of US hegemonic demonic domination of
the planet had Russia completely disintegrated with Yeltsin.
