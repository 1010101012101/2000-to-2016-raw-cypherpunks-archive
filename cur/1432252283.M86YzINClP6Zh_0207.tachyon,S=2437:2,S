The answer to that question depends on some leg work which involves 
converting the source code to stegetect into hardware and seeing how fast 
that hardware runs, then multiplying by X where X is how many of the chips 
you can afford to build.

I'd image that it's a lot faster to have some hw that gives you a yea/nay 
on each JPG, than to say, attempt to crack DES.
