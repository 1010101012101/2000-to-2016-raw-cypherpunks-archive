I don't think this follows. If I say "Alice ripped me off", Alice's 
reputation may well suffer even if reputation isn't a scalar
property.  People who consider my word as being worthless won't
lower their opinion of Alice, but somebody might.

Doesn't the concept of "selling for face value" imply that there's
a currency known to be legit?  I mean, if I'm trading paper for
paper I ought to expect to average 1 for 1.

Somehow this reminds me of a story I once read where one crook
was selling another crook what was purported to be high quality
counterfeit money but was actually the proceeds from a bank
heist (the irony being that the "real" money was worth considerably 
less than the counterfeit).

I believe what you are saying here is true, but I don't see what
recognizing this gets you.  In principle, if there's a digital
currency which is allegedly redeemable for dollars and I think
that there's about a 50-50 chance that I'll actually be able to 
redeem the currency then I ought to be willing to accept it at
50% face value, but in practice evaluating probabilities like
that is pretty hard, and I'm pretty much always going to be
coming up with probabilities close to one or close to
zero that any kind of "backed" currency is good.

Again, I don't see where this gets us.
