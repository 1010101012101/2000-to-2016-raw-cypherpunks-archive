Hi sugar,
Have not heard from you for ages! Have you forgotten about me? Hope not!

How are things going?


I am still single and spring has come.. all of my friends are hnaging out 
with their boyfriends and I am alone L

Though we might get to know each other better and perhaps this Spring will 
be the last lonely spring for us?

I have registered my profile at http://singelrussiangirls.info/?idAff=33 - 
why don't you come and see my new photos? And perhaps even email me..

Will be waiting:
