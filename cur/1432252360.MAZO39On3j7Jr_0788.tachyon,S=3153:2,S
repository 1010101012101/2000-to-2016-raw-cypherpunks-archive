A Wall Street Journal article today on the SDMI/DCMA lawsuit
by Ed Felten, et al, includes this nasty:

  "The decision to file the lawsuit hasn't been without consequences.
  Dr. Drew Dean is scheduled to resign from the Xerox research
  center tomorrow and says, without elaborating, that the resignation
  is 'related' to the DMCA lawsuit. A Xerox spokesman says that
  the legal challenge is 'not something the corporation wished to
  be involved in' but declined to comment further."

Drew, like Dan Wallach, was a grad student of Felten's and the
Xerox job was his first, I believe.

Will Princeton boot Felten, will Rice boot Wallach? Depends on
the courage of the trustees to resist their buddies' pressure,
as half-dead Xerox could not.

All hail the principled scientists, buck up trustees.
