Um, what's all this crap about?

You want to publish a newspaper, do so.  There's no special requirement
for anyone to publish papers.  All you have to do is simply print and
distribute.  You might need to comply with some post office regs about
printing ownership info.

Hell you can even type up "Letters to the editor" and post them
anonymously to cypherpunks@whichever_server_you_like. :)

Call it the Cypherpunks Weekly Journal if you'd like. :)
