SYSTOLIX HAVE RELEASED FILTERSIM VERION 2.0 - INTEGRATED FILTER DESIGN,
SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS

A fully working trial version of FilterSim 2.0 can be downloaded now from
Systolix web site at http://www.systolix.com/swdownload.htm. FilterSim is
the latest DSP development tool from Systolix. It combines a sophisticated
multi-stage filter design tool with an integrated digital simulator.
Simulation results can be viewed using the built-in signal viewer and
analysis tools, allowing designers to study filter characteristics and
quantisation effects in detail. Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the
tool, it includes a new simplified user interface to streamline the process
of specifying complex multi-stage filters.

Here is a summary of the key features, more information can be found at
http://www.systolix.com/fsintro.htm.  

* FILTER SPECIFICATION & DESIGN *
  Import externally generated FIR / IIR coefficients for analysis /
re-quantisation 
  Design filters to user specified quantisation 
  Export coefficients 
  Simple graphical entry of filter networks
    - Support of multi-stage (FIR / IIR / mixed)
    - Support for multi-rate filters (decimating / interpolating /
resampling) 
    - Support for multiple levels of quantisation in a single network
  Support for multiple filter types including 
  IIR Filters
    - Butterworth / Chebychev I-II / Elliptic
    - Low Pass / High Pass / Band Pass / Band Stop 
  Windowed FIR Filters
    - Kaiser / Blackman / Von Hann / Hamming / Rectangular
    - Low Pass / High Pass / Band Pass / Band Stop 
  Equiripple FIR filters
    - Low Pass / High Pass / Band Pass / Band Stop 
  Half-Band FIR Filters (Window & Equiripple) 
  Pulse-shaping Filters
     - Raised Cosine / Root Raised Cosine / Gaussian 
  Hilbert Transforms 

* FILTER SIMULATION *
  Extensive simulation capabilities including
    - Fast, optimised simulation engine
    - Built in signal generation functions
    - Import user test data
    - User definable quantisation for coefficients and data
    - Define unique quantisation per stage

* FILTER ANALYSIS *
  Powerful analysis capabilities including
    - Graphical view of magnitude/phase/impulse response
    - Built-in FFT 
    - Graphical viewer for simulation/FFT data
    - Automatic system transfer function evaluation
    - Automatic calculation of SNR / THD
