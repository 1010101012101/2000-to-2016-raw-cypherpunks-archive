I have myself been declared a motherfucker by Juan's executive fiat,
though not if I recall correctly a Statist Pig.  Perhaps this post will
rectify that deficiency.  Only time will tell.

Not everyone seems to be in agreement about how horrible ioerror is.
His defenders include at least one individual who isn't afraid of
disclosing information that she knows sounds "paranoid," in the process
of disclosing her take on Jake.

The absence of any legal proceedings, criminal or civil, seems rather a
big data point.  Lots of people are willing to throw stones, nobody is
willing to face a potential perjury charge or countersuit.  Maybe nobody
was actually harmed, beyond hurt feelings.

Any male geek person with Our Mr. Applebaum's "celebrity" status who is
also (in my heteronormative radical queer opinion) good looking, is very
likely to avail himself of the sexual perquisites of social prestige.
If that is the case with Our Mr. Applebaum, it would inevitably result
in at least /some/ hurt feelings, even if he was a perfect fucking
knight in shining armor - which he probably ain't, because who is?

Pardon my macroaggression, but there is a very current Identity Politics
fad for cutting all Male Pigs down to size, and its fan base demographic
intersects with the fan base of everything that even looks "radical and
culturally cutting edge" to a fuzzy studies major, including the TOR
Project.  In this social matrix, acts of simple careless idiocy, devoid
of malice and producing no real harm, could lead to all of the charges
we have seen.

If you are of a paranoid bent, ask whether a political warfare operation
could produce the exact results seen in Our Mr. Applebaum's recent
history.  Seeking out unsatisfied customers of Brand Jake who are
associated with evangelists for Feminazi fashion would be a snap:
Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance with automated social network mapping
and psychographic classification, finding people matching the desired
profile and history would only require a work order.  Develop one agent
- witting or not - and the rest handles itself.  (If, and please pardon
the expression, Our Mr. Applebaum has exposed himself in any way.)

Of course, this kind of thing is unheard of.  Unless the name Mendax
means anything to you.

It is possible that Our Mr. Applebaum is a raging asshole who routinely
mistreats women in serious ways.  But if so, the lack of any criminal
charges or civil action is surprising.

It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable
to the Mean Girls on the cheerleading squad getting some amusing
revenge, motivated by nothing more serious than some naive sap's
socially awkward behavior.  That model fits the available evidence
better than the criminal model.

It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to
arrange this party for Our Mr. Applebaum, they could quote a very
reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible
to prove absent a credible inside source.  That's the beauty part of the
institution of State Secrecy.
