Bah! You actually think old people are the only ones who read books? When was
the last time you asked someone in graduate school about it, must've been
awhile.

You want to know the last book I read cover to cover? "Uncertianty: A Guide
to Dealing With Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis", (Morgan
and Henrion, 1990, 332 p.) You want to know when? Yesterday. Four more on
related subjects in the last seven days. All that on top of a 40-hour work
week, homework, and and trying to get my head around a new language for an
advanced simulation modeling and analysis class.

But then, since I don't waste time on vapid TV shows, I have more time than
you'd think. The last non-work related hardback: The Tristan Chord: Wagner and
Philosophy (Bryan Magee, 2001, 397 p.) When? Last week. VCR: the old BBC
productions of Shakespeare's Timon of Athens, The Merchant of Venice, Richard
II, and Henry IV part 1, one a night. Some C-SPAN, bookTV on C-SPAN 2.

So the next time you feel like sniffing at somone else's reading and leisure
habits on the basis of age alone, perhaps it would be helpful to trouble
yourself to learn the tiniest little bit about what they are, eh?

Agh, back to work. :)
