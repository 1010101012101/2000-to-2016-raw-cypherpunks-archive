I fail to see where they're mentioning the word mesh at all.
If I would do it, I would just package Tor, Tahoe-LAFS, I2P
and maybe a couple other select goodies (tinc, opportunistic
encryption, whatever), and put it on the residential Internet.

If you recall I repeatedly suggested that here and elsewhere,
to the overwhelming sound of crickets.

If you're talking mesh, one of the basic requirements is to get
rid of central address allocation authority and establish
a local-knowledge based routing. If you get that far, the
human operator mistakes are removed from the loop.

Do you have a pointer to description of your project, and what went
wrong?

I can tell you one thing: Eben Moglen is not a stupid man, and he's
surrounded with technically capable people. If he can raise the money
for 10-100 k wall wart units you can assume people will do useful
things with them.
