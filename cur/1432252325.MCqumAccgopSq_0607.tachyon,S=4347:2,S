I've stayed out of this conversation so far, but there are a couple of
points here I can't resist. This first is the idea of developing a
ZS-affiliated trading forum that could end up being of tremendous
value, even if your arguments are incorrect, Michael. You may remember
that in Munich we talked about setting up some kind of trading forum
as part of project RES-2:

https://sites.google.com/site/zsorg2/10-res-2-bitcoin/res-2-b-implementation

That was envisaged as a way to encourage use of Bitcoin, and also
probably anonymous. Right now I have 2 questions: (1) Are these two
features compatible with the idea of an interactive market, do you
think? (2) What other features would be good or necessary?

I second this wholeheartedly. At first I had hoped that we could talk
about the big ideological poles or trends in a detached way, but we
are being distracted by ingrained thought habits and preconceptions.
In fact, I think that insisting that people focus upon specifics
rather than shorthand would be very much in the spirit of our
Principle of Construction - well said, and many thanks Michael!
