That's your business.  I just thought the meme sighting was funny.

I don't quite know what to say to that.  Perhaps collective ennui (or
senility) has set upon most USENET denizens.  Odd that.  Personally, I would
have thought that name-calling would have lost its novelty after a few years.

They should know better.  I recall some of the uproar about the Cypherpunks
moderation experiment.

You're quite correct.  While I haven't had the time to actually read more than
a few messages from those days, it's obvious that the then fresh speculations
have become today's old news.  Now, those with the skills and resources are
busy planning and implementing that which they see will be profitable within
their planning horizons.  Few would be so short-sighted as to talk about their
work when it might hurt their income or revenue potential.  So, we wait for
product releases, legislation initiatives, etc.

Sure.  It looks like most people (myself included) are waiting to see what
happens so they can amend their plans accordingly.  What else is there to do?

Despite the fact that I disagree strongly with wholesale `liquidation', I at
least respect your candour -- and while I'd love to argue this point with you,
that, too, has been done to death.

However, I've at least got an incentive to stay off the welfare rolls.

As they say, these things happen.


If I have anything useful to contribute to future discussions, I'll do so.  If
not, I'll just go back to lurking while I work on my own projects, education
and career, such as it is.
