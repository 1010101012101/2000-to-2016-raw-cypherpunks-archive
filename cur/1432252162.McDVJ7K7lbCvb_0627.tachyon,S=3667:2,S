Your presumably-misspelled subject line, "Ho to KICK OUT Junkbusters 
users," seems ironically appropriate.

Though some prefer the spelling "Hoe."

As for finding ways to see who is avoiding looking at yoiur 
advertisements, most of the ad filtering is done at the recipient's 
machine, right? Gonna be hard for you to reach into their machines to 
see if they're running ad busters in a local script.

As for the ads themselves, who ever looks at them? The doc com ad 
stream model has been collapsing since its inception...only in the 
last six months has the message gotten nearer to the dinosaur's brain.
