And newspaper pages are vastly bigger than a typical screen. The eye can 
move very quickly to the sections of interest. Magazine pages are more 
like normal screen sizes.

I don't begrudge the ad makers their "right" to buy space at some site 
for their intrusive ads. I _do_ think it's getting to the point of 
absurdity. This will cause more and more people to look into Ad busters.

What will be interesting is if the advertising industry seeks to block 
the distribution of those ad busters, perhaps based on some kind of DMCA 
claim.

(Ads could be tied-in to the content, with some light crypto or copright 
protection. A "circumvention" of this liight crypto could be a DMCA 
violation. I would not be surprised to see this already impicated in the 
DVD cases: that 5 minute period of trailors that cannot be 
fast-forwarded past...it's probably a violation of the DMCA to build 
devices which circumvent the copyright holder's plans and intents.)
