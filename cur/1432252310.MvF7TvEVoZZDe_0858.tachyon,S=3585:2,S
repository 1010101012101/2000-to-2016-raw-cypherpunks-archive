There are a couple of laws that are universal.
One of them is "Don't Annoy The Cops".
While occasionally you can violate this by accident,
because there's some thing the cops are doing that you didn't expect,
or because their paranoia or grouchiness levels have recently increased,
but usually you know when you're going to violate it.
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it,
just that you shouldn't be surprised.
