The test perhaps ought be, can you (/we) elucidate anarchist beliefs,
benefits, cautions, etc, to enough people such that someone who's not
you chooses to run for president on an anarchist platform?

Such changes can surely only occur with the leverage of "getting it
out there, and "it" being appealing to enough of the general
population".

Juan, are there aspects of political anarchism (I think we need a term
other than "anarchy" if we want Joe Sixpack to not glaze over) which
you have personal doubts about, or you're not sure about how best to
handle, or even unsure about how to educate others about? Perhaps
another thread though... but I am seriously interested in a more
nuanced discussion than "those USG cunts" ;)
