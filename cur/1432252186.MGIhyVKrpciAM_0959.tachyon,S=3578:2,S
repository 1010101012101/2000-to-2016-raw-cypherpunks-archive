Yes, this is very worrisome.  I've been waiting for the day when we have
less anthrax cases than the day before, and apparently we've not seen the
peak yet.

The guy in Florida is supposedly doing well, despite surgery to insert
various breathing tubes a while back.

Congress has now decided not to repopen for business on Tuesday.

These anthraxed buildings may be a writeoff.  I doubt people will
volunteer to go back into them, even after happy-fun-decontamination.

American Media is selling and relocating.

I wonder how many suspicious pulmonary deaths have flown under the radar
to date, because they weren't correctly diagnosed.

More bad news will probably follow in the weeks to come.
