Proliferation is a political means. Keep on proliferating,
proliferate widely, proliferate fast, get all your friends and
business on it, get the public on it, remove the capability
for legacy plaintext, and embed and entrench crypto
deeper than the Marianas.

Also, call/visit/write your MP/congresscritter and
give them your concerns about backdoors and
your freedom/rights, your life being meta'd, recorded,
analyzed and stored forever for no good reason
(for which an interest in crypto and speech isn't one).

Proliferate and speak!
