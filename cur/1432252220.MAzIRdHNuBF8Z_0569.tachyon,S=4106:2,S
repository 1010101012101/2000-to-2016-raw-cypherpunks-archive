Let us make a more realistic supposition:

Let us suppose instead he organized an entertainment where a
lightly clad singer sang and danced, and showed that video on
television interspersed with advertisments, and I then captured
that video on my hard disk, deleted the ads, and put it on the
internet.

In that case, where is my promise?  Doubtless I must have made it
in the same moment of forgetfulness as I signed the social
contract.
