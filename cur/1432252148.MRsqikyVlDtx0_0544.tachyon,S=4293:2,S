Indeed, Daniel Ellsberg planned to have Congresspeople speak about the
still-classified Pentagon Papers via this part of the Constitution.
Senator Mike Gravel did it. You can read about it in Sanford J. Ungar's

Battle over the Pentagon Papers. If I'm not mistaken, Gravel has spoken
out in favor of Snowden.
