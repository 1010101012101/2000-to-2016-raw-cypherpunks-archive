Anti-snooping operating system close to launch

16:28 28 May 02 NewScientist.com news service

Computer activists in Britain are close to completing an operating system 
that could undermine government efforts to the wiretap the internet. The UK 
Home Office has condemned the project as potentially providing a new tool 
for criminals.

Electronic communications can be kept private using encryption. But new UK 
legislation will soon give law enforcers the right to demand encryption 
keys from anyone suspected of illegal activity.

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) was introduced to update 
UK surveillance laws to include electronic communications. But privacy 
campaigners say it gives too much power to law enforcers and permits 
intrusive eavesdropping.

Peter Fairbrother, a mathematician and computer enthusiast, is programming 
the new operating system, called M-o-o-t. "It is aimed at anybody who's 
concerned about the government being nosey," he says.
