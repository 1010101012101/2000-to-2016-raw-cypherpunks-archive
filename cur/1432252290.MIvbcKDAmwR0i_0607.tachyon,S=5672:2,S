The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri|led 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you wil| stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
