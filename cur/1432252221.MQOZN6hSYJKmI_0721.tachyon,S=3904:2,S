"Rather, the problem with AP is that it is mob rule at its worst. There are 
no checks and balances. It is the height of folly to suppose that AP would 
be used only against those whom cypherpunks themselves oppose, like corrupt 
government agents. AP could be used against anyone who has a high profile. 
If AP were implemented, there is no question but that Jim Bell would be one 
of the first targets! All those people who found himself on his list, along 
with their heirs and successors, would want revenge. Everyone involved with 
the assassinations would be anonymous except Bell himself, making him the 
most prominent target of their wrath. Other notable supporters of crypto 
anarchy would follow soon, such as cypherpunk founders May and Hughes. The 
people involved with the digital cash would be targets as well, and so on."
Extract from 'nomen nescio'
There are checks and balances,get a grip.Read the essay.Its self 
limiting.No one who is anonymous has anything to fear from AP.They do have 
a lot to fear from the rogue terror state USA. Bell and I are willing to 
die,maybe even cj.It will be worth it and theoretically no one need 
die.Would you start paying to have people killed risking the knowledge of 
that getting out?
There is a disgusting lack of belief in peoples common sense and decency on 
this list,refs to 'sheeple' etc.Tim said its an openly elitist list 
once.Thats distorted your view of humanity I think.Tim is too fearful of AP 
as one of the 4 horsemen.
I worry more about pedophiles,the end result of turbocharged 
capitalism.There are pedo brothel owners that need to be nominated for 
operation soft drill.I need their names.
