Everyone here is perfectly capable of reading my posts and deciding for 
themselves--why the need for the grand pronouncement? Now that you've told 
everyone how to think, why not use your filter file and get it over with.

head" theme are a complete waste of time. Who would have ever imagined that 
someone so intelligent and thoughtful could be so petty.
