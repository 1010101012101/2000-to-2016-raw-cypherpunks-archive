A few times.  It doesn't play well with multiple layers of NAT, and it
doesn't seem to be compatible with some of the experiments we want to
run in the near future.  Plus, it's drawing a certain amount of heat
in Germany, which implies that other countries will be paying closer
attention to it.  Trying to explain that we're using RetroShare for
its distributed forum capability rather than piracy is probably not
going to be believed.

As I understand it, RetroShare uses your current public IP to contact
other current public IPs.  It uses PGP public keys for authentication
and encryption, and tying those to IP addresses that ISPs can use to
ID people may not be something some of us are interested in doing.
I'd rather consider the folks who are not okay with this
preferentially because the reverse can alienate people (I've lost a
few good friends that way, and learned that lesson the hard way).

Those are things I'd taken into account.

Thank you.  I hope it's feasible; I plan on starting experimentation
in the reasonably near future (December of 2012).
