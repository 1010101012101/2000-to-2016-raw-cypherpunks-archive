LE, Gov and private industry have always been bedfellows - they will
continue to enjoy preferential treatment and advanced threat intelligence
whilst sacrificing 'secrecy' both of internal operations and client
information for the privilege.

The gov can get IP addresses for sybil attacks, they don't need to smuggle
honeypots into internal networks to accomplish this.

The problem is that the 'day one' offering is very light, just a honeypot -
after the target is socialized 'day two' 'enhanced feeds' can be marketed
by LE & Gov by turning on the two-way flow of information. Casual erosion
of trust / privacy boundaries.

Which, of course, only further cements the old adages espoused on these
lists.

<br>
While my analogy and definition of security may not have been best<br>
suited, nor is this reply, the point remains that there is nothing<br>
special here for you as a corp. Anything you say that LE can provide<br>
for *you* with honeypots can also be sourced internally or from the<br>
open market and your subsequent call to LE to mop up upon discovery<br>
of badness therein.<br>
<br>
What is unique here is that LE will be classifying things learned<br>
from the HP&#39;s as gov&#39;t secrets. That&#39;s a hard problem. As oppos=
ed<br>
to telling you all of what you need to know to secure your own net<br>
under internal policies and vendor contracts that you would otherwise<br>
remain in control of.<br>
<br>
Further, technically, parking an HP on your net only tells you about<br>
what happens regarding via that HP, nothing else. And since you<br>
must distrust this other party HP [1], then all you&#39;ve got is a<br>
cracked HP outside your trust zone, no different than any other box<br>
on the internet. It&#39;s limited vantage point and bogus security<br>
metrics argument.<br>
<br>
Sure, the US gov&#39;t might be able, on the whole from this, to correlate<=
br>
and expose more nation-state/international crime sources against<br>
the US and embarrass some foreign diplomats. That&#39;s always a good<br>
and fun thing [2]. And the services of LE are indeed valuable.<br>
<br>
However do not make the mistake of thinking that *you yourself*<br>
will benefit *directly* from this program, that&#39;s not what it&#39;s<br>
designed for or capable of. In fact, you will be left out as dog<br>

<br>
The responsibility for securing your net still rests with you and<br>
