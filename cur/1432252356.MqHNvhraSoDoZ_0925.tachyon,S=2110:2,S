Surely you jest.  Anyone in any office in Utah is a Mormon.  And most of
the profs
at the universities there.  Good luck trying to buy a beer, BTW.

If they didn't own Utah, they would be firebombed faster than you can
say Janet Reno.
They only got to own Utah because they Judased their own religious
beliefs (polygamy)
to suck up to the rest of the (puritan-based) country.

I have no beef with anyone practicing their mental illnesses privately,
but when they
use the violence of the State to coerce others, they need killing.

Reminds me of when a sociologist was interviewing a southern farmer:
Why do you think the murder rate is higher in the south?
I guess more southerners need killin'.
