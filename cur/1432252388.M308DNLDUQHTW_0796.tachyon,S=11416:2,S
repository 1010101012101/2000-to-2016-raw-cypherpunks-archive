bitcoin does seem to have stabilized after that initial jump. I think
the initial jump was due to the network effect of how fast the current
group of adopters jumped on board and started using bitcoin.

Still, this is a of course a valid point. Although, the value increase
seems to have been mostly beneficial to the early adopters. But, I
could see how if the system stabilized, then a new wave of adopters
jumped on board, it could suddenly become very unbalanced for the
initial participants if various scenarios unfold.

Although, I am not sure *if* the bitcoin system would automatically
inflate in an exponential way each time a new wave of participants
joins the system.

One real potential problem is making sure that "honest nodes" control
the majority of CPU power. So far, so good. It won't be easy for
anyone to spoof this system. But, if a group of people wants to
intentionally attack the system, there could be problems. Bitcoin is a
good candidate for complex systems models as a means to put more
foresight into stability, health, etc

Sepp, this is a great point.

One of the nice things about bitcoin is that it is F/LOSS, so it is
ultimately fork-able. If bad decisions are made about the growth, the
project could be forked, a different governance scheme could be
implemented, etc.

I don't yet know enough about bitcoin to be 100% sure, but the system
at least for the time being does seem to have stabilized (it could
simply mean that participation has stabilized).

Bit coin claims:

"Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees
and be completely inflation
free."

And yes Michel, I will post this on the blog and in wiki :)
