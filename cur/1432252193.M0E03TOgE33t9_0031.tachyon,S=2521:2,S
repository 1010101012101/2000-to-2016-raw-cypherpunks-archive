What, precisely, is broken about KAME?

What is it about the Linux crowd that, if it's two years old, it's
apparently time to reimplement it.  (Firewall code, software RAID,
libc, you know, whatever. Bonus points if it means a kernel A{B,P}I
modification...)

How 'bout just importing the reference implementation which Works,
something FreeS/WAN was never actualy able to say?

Oh well.
