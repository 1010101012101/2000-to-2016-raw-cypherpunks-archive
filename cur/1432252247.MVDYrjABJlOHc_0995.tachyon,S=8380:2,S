No. I feel an internal disgust at such an idea. Had you full control of=
 the=20
bugs/implants and could actually get the info/data out and then leak it=
 to=20
Wikileaks/whatever, then it would have a shred of sense, because you co=
uld use=20
these tools as a force for good.

The way it is, you don't have such control. So you would be giving thes=
e away=20
to some orgs you don't like hoping this will get them in hot water with=
 the=20
NSA/the government.

There are two scenarios here. Either you'd be de facto giving a present=
 to the=20
NSA -- and I don't feel like giving the NSA presents; or, it would be a=
n org=20
that works with the NSA, or at least is conducive to whatever the gov d=
oes --=20
hence, the implant-gathered data would not be used.

Of course you could also hit a potential whistleblower within such an=20=

organisation, which would be even worse.

Either way, a bad, bad idea.

Forensics is the way here.

Sorry you had bad experiences. I work in an NGO that tries to be at lea=
st=20
partially funded by donations, and it's fucking hard. We want to be fun=
ded by=20
donations because being funded by grants or sponsors is always a "strin=
