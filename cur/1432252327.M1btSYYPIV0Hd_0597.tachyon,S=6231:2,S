When the first results about exponential speedup of factoring came  
out, people assumed that this was true in general.  But it isn't.  In  
particular, simple search, where you have only an equality test so you  
can't build a hash table or some kind of ordered structure - is O(N)  
on a traditional computer - and O(sqrt(N)) on a quantum computer.  I'm  
not sure what the current knowledge about what a quantum machine can  
do for NP computations, but there's no "probably" here.

The physical arguments to which I was referring say *nothing* about  
how the computation is done.  It can be a QM computation as well.

In any case, the simple search result above applies directly to brute  
force:  For that problem, you only get a polynomial speedup anyway.

That's a ... bizarre point of view.  :-)  Should freedom from related- 
key attacks be part of the definition of a "secure" encryption  
algorithm?  We should decide that on some rational basis, not on  
whether, with care, we can avoid such attacks.  Clearly, a system that  
*is* secure against such attacks is more robust.  Do we know how to  
build such a thing?  What's the cost of doing so?  But to say it's an  
*advantage* to have a weakness seems like some kind of odd moral  
argument:  If you're hurt by this it's because you *deserve* to be.
