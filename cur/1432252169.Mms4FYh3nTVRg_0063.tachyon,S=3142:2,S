"In 1992, inspired by his example, a band of mathematicians, 
computer scientists, and software engineers based primarily in the 
San Francisco area began to discuss ways to defend personal 
privacy in the computer age. They were brought together by an 
intense ideological commitment to privacy and free speech, and by 
an anarchistic mistrust of government and big business. They 
dedicated themselves to creating and widely disseminating the 
best cryptography possible, for all to use. They called themselves 
the Cypherpunks."

The article is mainly about the burgeoning privacy business, 
interviews with folks from Zero Knowledge and such.
