So,

this has been floating in my vincinity lately:
https://github.com/jlund/streisand

Wonder what you wonderful people think of it.

=2D - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=

The Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, teleco=
ms,=20
politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and informat=
ion=20
that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is tough. =
Or is=20
it?
Introducing Streisand

    A single command sets up a brand new server running a wide variety =
of=20
anti-censorship software that can completely mask and encrypt all of yo=
ur=20
Internet traffic.
    Streisand natively supports the creation of new servers at Amazon E=
C2,=20
DigitalOcean, Linode, and Rackspace=E2=80=94with more providers coming =
soon! It also=20
runs on any Debian 7 server regardless of provider, and hundreds of ins=
tances=20
can be configured simultaneously using this method.
    The process is completely automated and only takes about ten minute=
s,=20
which is pretty awesome when you consider that it would require the ave=
rage=20
system administrator several days of frustration to set up even a small=
 subset=20
of what Streisand offers in its out-of-the-box configuration.
    Once your Streisand server is running, you can give the custom conn=
ection=20
instructions to friends, family members, and fellow activists. The conn=
ection=20
instructions contain an embedded copy of the server's unique SSL certif=
icate,=20
so you only have to send them a single file.
    Each server is entirely self-contained and comes with absolutely=20=

everything that users need to get started, including cryptographically=20=

verified mirrors of all common clients. This renders any attempted cens=
orship=20
of default download locations completely ineffective.
    But wait, there's more...

More Features

    Nginx powers a password-protected and encrypted Gateway that serves=
 as the=20
starting point for new users. The Gateway is accessible over SSL, or as=
 a Tor=20
hidden service.

        Beautiful, custom, step-by-step client configuration instructio=
ns are=20
generated for each new server that Streisand creates. Users can quickly=
 access=20
these instructions through any web browser. The instructions are respon=
sive=20
and look fantastic on mobile phones:

        Streisand Screenshot
        The integrity of mirrored software is ensured using SHA-256 che=
cksums,=20
or by verifying GPG signatures if the project provides them. This prote=
cts=20
users from downloading corrupted files.
        All ancillary files, such as OpenVPN configuration profiles, ar=
e also=20
available via the Gateway.
        Current Tor users can take advantage of the additional services=
=20
Streisand sets up in order to transfer large files or to handle other t=
raffic=20
(e.g. BitTorrent) that isn't appropriate for the Tor network.
        A unique password, SSL certificate, and SSL private key are gen=
erated=20
for each Streisand Gateway. The Gateway instructions and certificate ar=
e=20
transferred via SSH at the conclusion of Streisand's execution.
    Distinct services and multiple daemons provide an enormous amount o=
f=20
flexibility. If one connection method gets blocked there are numerous o=
ptions=20
available, most of which are resistant to Deep Packet Inspection.
        All of the connection methods (including L2TP/IPsec and direct =
OpenVPN=20
connections) are effective against the type of blocking Turkey has been=
=20
experimenting with.
        OpenSSH, OpenVPN (wrapped in stunnel), Shadowsocks, and Tor (wi=
th=20
obfsproxy and the obfs3 or ScrambleSuit pluggable transports) are all=20=

currently effective against China's Great Firewall.
    Every task has been thoroughly documented and given a detailed=20
description. Streisand is simultaneously the most complete HOWTO in exi=
stence=20
for the setup of all of the software it installs, and also the antidote=
 for=20
ever having to do any of this by hand again.
    All software runs on ports that have been deliberately chosen to ma=
ke=20
simplistic port blocking unrealistic without causing massive collateral=
=20
damage. OpenVPN, for example, does not run on its default port of 1194,=
 but=20
instead uses port 636, the standard port for LDAP/SSL connections that =
are=20
beloved by companies worldwide.
        L2TP/IPsec is a notable exception to this rule because the port=
s=20
cannot be changed without breaking client compatibility
    The IP addresses of connecting clients are never logged. There's no=
thing=20
to find if a server gets seized or shut down.

Services Provided

    L2TP/IPsec using strongSwan and xl2tpd
        A randomly chosen pre-shared key and password are generated.
        Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS users can all connect using the=
 native=20
VPN support that is built into each operating system without installing=
 any=20
additional software.
        Streisand does not install L2TP/IPsec on Amazon EC2 servers by =
default=20
because the instances cannot bind directly to their public IP addresses=
 which=20
makes IPsec routing nearly impossible.
    OpenSSH
        An unprivileged forwarding user and SSH keypair are generated f=
or=20
sshuttle and SOCKS capabilities. Windows and Android SSH tunnels are al=
so=20
supported, and a copy of the keypair is exported in the .ppk format tha=
t PuTTY=20
requires.
        Tinyproxy is installed and bound to localhost. It can be access=
ed over=20
an SSH tunnel by programs that do not natively support SOCKS and that r=
equire=20
an HTTP proxy, such as Twitter for Android.
    OpenVPN
        Self-contained "unified" .ovpn profiles are generated for easy =
client=20
configuration using only a single file.
        Multiple clients can easily share the same certificates and key=
s, but=20
five separate sets are generated by default.
        Client DNS resolution is handled via Dnsmasq to prevent DNS lea=
ks.
        TLS Authentication is enabled which helps protect against activ=
e=20
probing attacks. Traffic that does not have the proper HMAC is simply d=
ropped.
        The Dante proxy server is set up as a workaround for a bug in F=
irefox=20
for Android.
    Shadowsocks
        A QR code is generated that can be used to automatically config=
ure the=20
Android and iOS clients by simply taking a picture. You can tag '8.8.8.=
8' on=20
that concrete wall, or you can glue the Shadowsocks instructions and so=
me QR=20
codes to it instead!
    Stunnel
        Listens for and wraps OpenVPN connections. This makes them look=
 like=20
standard SSL traffic and allows OpenVPN clients to successfully establi=
sh=20
tunnels even in the presence of Deep Packet Inspection.
        Unified profiles for stunnel-wrapped OpenVPN connections are ge=
nerated=20
alongside the direct connection profiles. Detailed instructions are als=
o=20
generated.
        The stunnel certificate and key are exported in PKCS #12 format=
 so=20
they are compatible with other SSL tunneling applications. Notably, thi=
s=20
enables OpenVPN for Android to tunnel its traffic through SSLDroid. Ope=
nVPN in=20
China on a mobile device? Yes!
    Tor
        A bridge relay is set up with a random nickname.
        Obfsproxy is installed and configured, including support for th=
e obfs3=20
and ScrambleSuit pluggable transports.
