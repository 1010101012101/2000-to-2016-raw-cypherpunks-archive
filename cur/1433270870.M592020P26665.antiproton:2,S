Parents, yes, have a responsibility to raise their children, and as a
result have a bunch of extra privileges and a bunch more authority over
their children then any one person usually has over another. There is, for
very good reasons, a very strong power dynamic in a parent-child
relationship.

And any power dynamic is prone to abuse, the stronger it is the more likely.
I'm am very scared of the idea of a power dynamic like that, where the
person at the receiving end has their communication completely monitored.
It means that, in case they need to ask for help, that request will be
monitored. And depending on how abused the power dynamic is, that could be
a Very Bad Thing.

Everyone needs a way to ask for help safely. Everyone needs a way to have
peers safely.
A power dynamic without those minimal checks is not a safe thing to have.


(Also, can I express surprise at seeing this opinion *here*? Like, I've
heard this sort of argument before, and it definitely has merits -- but I
Very Much did not expect it on the cypherpunks mailing list? Is there just
some sort of toggle? Do people suddenly go from "no reason that they should
be able to have privacy" to "spying and censorship are suddenly totally
wrong" when they reach the arbitrary age where they are Now An Adult? Was
"get breached" the only thing mSpy did wrong?)
