Any data coming into a drive has to pass through the device drivers of 
the operating system running the computer. It should therefore be quite
possible to construct a driver shim which reports any answers desired to
the higher software layers. Since the documentation of the system is
public (the T.13 group I believe), this is not anywhere near as complex as
some pieces of software. Ex: programs like VMWare virtualize all the
hardware - virtualizing only part of the hardware shouldn't be too bad....
