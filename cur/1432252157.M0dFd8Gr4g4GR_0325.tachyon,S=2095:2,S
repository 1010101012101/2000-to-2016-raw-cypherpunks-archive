	The terrorists are playing a losing game. But if by making idle
	threats that are always taken seriously by people who are just
	scared, we can impose enormous costs on the country and the
	terrorists can impose enormous costs on the country. Then that
	turns their losing game into a winning game.

_WE_ can impose enormous costs indeed!  An Fox printed it without sterilizing
it?  They better be careful, or someone might accuse them of "aiding the
terrorists"!

"Unbridled nationalism, as distinguished from a sane and legitimate
patriotism, must give way to a wider loyalty, to the love of humanity as a
whole. Bah'u'llh's statement is: "The earth is but one country, and mankind
its citizens."
