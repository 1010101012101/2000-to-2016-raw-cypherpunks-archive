mirimir - heres some fucked up people (laura poitras) talkin about the shit

https://youtu.be/KzZfOOvwAMM?t=22m44s

i found that area of the report its at 22:44 the link should take you there

even laura at least thinks about when to film / when not to

btw she talked snowden into filming in hong kong - was it ethical for her
to do it as he was under incredible duress?? i dont know .... i question
her and glenns role and wikileaks role in him being now trapped in russia
but maybe its the best place for him i dont know ... but i still get to
question the ethics of their role... there are other places he could have
gone

my problem with laura as with jeremy is that they are too capitalistic and
therein breech ethics
