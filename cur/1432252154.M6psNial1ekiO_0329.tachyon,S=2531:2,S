I'm a little late to this thread, sorry...

AT&T m-mode models have had this kind of functionality for quite awhile.

http://www.mobileinfo.com/news_2002/Issue25/ATT_Finder.htm

"With a few keystrokes on a wireless phone, a m-mode subscriber is  
given the approximate geographic location of his friend, such as a  
street intersection. The two friends can then exchange messages,  call 
the other, or choose a place to meet from a directory of nearby  
restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and bookstores."

I'm pretty sure they don't use GPS for this... I think they do some 
form of triangulation from the cell towers.
