Dear Bernie,

New Year is the time to get Longines watch, and the only place to get top notch watches that look and perform exactly like the originals is
http://washingtonsni.obxhost.net

The best news is that in January (2009) you can buy two watches and get an extra 15% off your purchase!
http://washingtonsni.obxhost.net

Our Longines watches have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Barton
