if only that were the case.  the exact opposite has already taken place.  
the protesting has done nothing more than take the focus off of the g8 talks 
and place it upon the riots/rioters.  the g8 talks would have only been 
briefly mentioned in the media if there had been not rioting to 
sensationalize it.  the riots only allow the reporters to give the public 
something that they will want to watch (read death, destruction, and 
mayhem).
