It begins here and is extended by the 14th.  A judges job is to apply 
the law to the case presented to him.  For all federal judges (and 
today state judges) the law is a stack of rulings by other courts and 
laws based by legislative bodies.
For a federal court the stack is

The Constitution.
The accumulated federal statues
Case law

For state courts we have

The Constitution (per the 14th)
State Law
Case law

Any layer can be overridden by the layer above it, so state and 
federal judges are expected to take all layers into account to 
minimize the number of rulings that have to overturned on appeal.  It 
is also expected that lower courts take a more strict view of the law 
than appellate courts as the appellate courts job is to rule on 
points of law while the lower court is a primarily a finder of fact 
with ruling on law a secondary role (the difference between appellate 
and original jurisdiction).

victims of the darkness."
