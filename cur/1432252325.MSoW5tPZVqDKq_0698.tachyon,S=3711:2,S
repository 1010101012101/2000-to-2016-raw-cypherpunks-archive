Bob;

please pass this on


Opportunity strikes again, it seems. I am looking for employment. I
just finished up the
delivering the a large project for Apple, and as my reward they are
laying me off.
Actually it's more bad timing that anything else.

I will be looking for work shortly either contracting or full-time
and would appreciate
if you can point me to anyone whom might have work. I am very flexible.

my resume is online at http://www.vmeng.com/vinnie/resume.html
