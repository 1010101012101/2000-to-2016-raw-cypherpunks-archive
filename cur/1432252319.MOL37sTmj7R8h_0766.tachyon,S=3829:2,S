This confirms the news I posted a few days ago. The first known case of 
inhalational anthrax in 25 years happens at this time. Then the second...

Moreover, in the same small town of Lantana where three of the WTC 
pilots lived and worked.

Mighty weird coincidence, if it is. One coincidence is probably that, 
but more?

(A complete speculation, admittedly, is the connection with the first 
dead guy's occupation: a photographer for the weekly tabloid "The Sun." 
Speculations that he was photographing the WTC pilots and their small 
plane for a "scoop" on bioterrorism are unsubstantiated.)
