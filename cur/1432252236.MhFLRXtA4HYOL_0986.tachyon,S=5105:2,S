I don't believe that is an accurate paraphrase of what Mike Rosing said.
He said the purpose (not effect) was to remove (not reduce) his control,
and make the platform trusted to one entity (not "for the benefit of
others").  Unless you want to defend the notion that the purpose of TCPA
is to *remove* user control of his machine, and make it trusted to only
*one other entity* (rather than a general capability for remote trust),
then I think you should accept that what he said was wrong.

And Mike said more than this.  He said that if he could install his own
key into the TPM that would make it a very useful tool.  This is wrong;
it would completely undermine the trust guarantees of TCPA, make it
impossible for remote observers to draw any useful conclusions about the
state of the system, and render the whole thing useless.  He also talked
about how this could be used to make systems "phone home" at boot time.
But TCPA has nothing to do with any such functionality as this.

In contrast, Ben Laurie's characterization of TCPA is 100% factual and
accurate.  Do you at least agree with that much, even if you disagree
with my criticism of Mike Rosing's comments?
