Thinking back to an article Douglas Rushkoff wrote a while back, let's
see what's out there...

Established gratis orgs that already do this:

http://www.ces.org.za/index.asp#_blank
https://hourworld.org/

Open Source Currency: https://github.com/oscurrency/oscurrency
Based on Rails, F/OSS timebanking software.

Community Forge: http://communityforge.net/
Based on Drupal, implements LETS.

Ripple: https://ripplepay.com/
Track obligations through a socnet.

This will also be of interest:
