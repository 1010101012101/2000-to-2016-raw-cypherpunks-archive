John channeling my innermost fears...

i now view crypto as cost factor, rather than protection.

"what's your threat model?"
 [something laughably broad and unrealistic]

"let's try to focus on realistic threats"
 [modest aims to prevent plain-text observation and MitM downgrade
attacks like SSLstrip]

"so here's how you would build that, since nothing out of the box is
sufficient..."
 [further reduction to prevent trivial passive observation]

"if you eschew all these apps and services, and force everyone you
communicate with to configure their settings like this..."
 [departs rejected]



for a fun experiment, grab your latest Kali linux, position yourself
in the middle, and see just how much of your desktop, Android, iOS
activity escapes unmolested...


it seems most most in the industry flee to offensive operations lest
cruel realities render their crushing existential depression lethal.


others plain crazy and try to play on "Hard Mode(TM)"[0] with the life
consuming insanity that entails ;)

why so impatient?  sure, DWave is a door stop, but incremental
progress continues unabated.

i still have hope.  it starts with absolute anonymity for everyone as
basic infrastructure of every network.  like internet protocol:
privacy edition.   i'll let you know when the low latency datagram
based unlinkable traffic analysis resistant transport is ready, and we
can figure out what step #2 looks like
 ;P
