i dont think he is just talking about afghanistan there but you are
entitled to your opinion

i think his mind was being changed after that about iraq thats what the 2
paragraphs say to me and it was a progression - he kind of came to on the
iraq thing but then still backed the invasion anyway

i have seen another quote someone sent me on twitter - as i use to fight
with glenn on twitter about pierre and shit ... and laura ... i cant find
it ... i will keep looking - these things were out in the press before this
book was published

fyi i fought a lot with laura over her unwavering support of wikileaks she
has a huge blindspot there for sure - it was like talking a kid out of
their lollipop or going back in time and talking people out of doing human
sacrifices

i never heard the israelis knew about the attack beforehand ?????????? i
mean zionists....

saudia arabia is too important for the interests of capitalist fucks
globally not just because they produce oil but because they have money and
dont give a fuck about their people in terms of advanced politic > monarchy
- the fascist capitalist built their infrastructure and maintain it - you
think that is a few dollawolfs rrrr some change in the coach?

read: confessions of an economic hitman

and you can watch john talk about the shit here:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I wa=
s able to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; develop<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American s=
ecurity really<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign countr=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did you read the motherfucking article?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I read the motherfucking article. He says that he was apa=
thetic,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and trusted institutions (and even that asshole W). Maybe he n=
eeds to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; more mea culpas for that, or cut off his left pinkie. But unle=
ss you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cite some public statement where he actively supported the inv=
asion,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than just deferred to arguably better-informed opinions=
, it&#39;s no<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; big deal in the current context. In my opinion.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this should tell you how duplicitous he is just like the g=
overnment<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; says he<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didnt do anything - he didnt fuck that bitch - oh he fucke=
d them hard<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d say rather that he let Uncle Dick finger fuck him, but=
 just a little<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ;)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also daily kos sucks<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don&#39;t read that shit.<br>
