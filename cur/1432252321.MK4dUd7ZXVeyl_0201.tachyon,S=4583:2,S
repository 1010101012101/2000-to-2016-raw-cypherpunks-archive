         Yeah, I thought of that too;-) The NTRU folk, however, didn't wait 
for today's announcement to place their bet.

         The NTRU reference implementation for embedded systems -- the NERI 
toolkit the company has been shipping for a couple of months -- includes 
Rijndael code described as "an excellent complement to our core public key 
technology."

         Anyone know of any other commercial firms (other than the 
respective developers) which made an overt pre-announcement commitment to 
one of the AES candidates?

         Apparently the fact that Rujndael was the/a leading AES candidate 
was apparent to some prescient souls (not me <sigh>) at least since AES3 in 
N.Y. last April. As Bram Cohen <bram@gawth.com> put it:

         Suerte,
