I'm working on influencing security in embedded, e.g., writing and
designing secure systems (comprehensively, starting with arch & code.) It's
an educational effort with embedded ISVs and OEMs at every step, you can
presume the market, if they're thinking of security at all, is currently
buying into 'fire-walling' and 'obfuscation' approaches.

There are some interesting groups like We Are the Cavalry working on that
as well.

Some fun uses of Raspberry Pi computers as air-gapped PGP / KeyStores and
Hardware Tor routers. DIY info-theoretic secure communications platforms
(opto-isolators and so on.)

On the topic of HWSec, I'm interested in detecting in-sil modification,
allowing end-users to simply and easily verify their hardware in the same
way that the OS community has become entranced with 'deterministic
verifiable builds'.
