Wow. What kind of fucking idiot wrote this thing? A piece like this can 
actually get published? This is the biggest set of arguments I've seen yet 
for moving TO Canada!

BTW: I always thought that "Economic Immigration" was an excellent 
idea....it siphoned off tons of Hong Kong millionares before the PRC took 
over. The US should have been doing it in addition to the non-Express route.
