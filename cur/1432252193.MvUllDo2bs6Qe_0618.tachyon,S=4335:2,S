For perspective, however, current-model Palms have 33 MHz Motorola 68k
processors, which used to be considered a nice desktop CPU.  In 1991,
when PGP was first released, the Mac Classic II had a 16 MHz 68030 and
2 MB of RAM.  If that was enough for PGP, then a Palm m500 ought to be
capable of it also.

Granted, you will want to use longer keys now.  But the hardware in
your pocket can do more crypto than you might think.  And they're only
getting faster.
