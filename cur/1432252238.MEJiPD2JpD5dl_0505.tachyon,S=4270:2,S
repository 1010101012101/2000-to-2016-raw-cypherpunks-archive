Business 2.0: Citigroup to Push Ecash into Primetime.
Citigroup and America Online certainly know about consumers. They are, after
all, the world's leading financial institution and the top online service
provider. Now the two bet that by joining forces, they can bring
electronic-payment services into the mainstream...
By 2005, market-research firm Ovum predicts, e-payment transactions will
exceed $2.2 trillion...
c2it will be free to users for the first three months, after which it
will cost $2 for each person-to-person transaction.

SJ Mercury: Jumping on bandwagon of eBay criticism.
There's reason to believe -- maybe not now, but soon -- that eBay's $170
million acquisition of Billpoint, its online bill-payment service, may
need to
be re-examined. In the worst case, some people are predicting that eBay may
even consider selling it....
A month ago, PayPal began imposing charges on sellers of 1.9 percent
plus a 35-cent transaction fee, not unreasonable in the credit card
world. And in a case of one company zigging while the other zags,
Billpoint has suspended its ordinary 2.5 percent seller charge for Visa
users over the holidays in an effort to gain market.
