I think we all suffer a fair amount of cognitive dissonance on this one.

We all know stories.  DES is now revealed as interfered with, yet for  
decades we told each other it was just parity bits.  The same process  
happened to GSM -- MiBs specified the 40 bit key, but because it was a  
secret design, they didn't need to create a legend to hide the 16 bits of 
zeroes.  Add in export control regs, add in the war against PRZ.

If someone where to do a longitudinal study of the public knowledge of the 
interference, I think it would mount up.  Individually, we can ignore those 
stories as conspiracy theory, but in aggregate, much harder.

This is the good news.  I think the message has finally got through that  
usability is more important than classical CIA, etc.

Yeah.  This is a mystery to me, where did this crap come from?  Although  
it aligns perfectly with the geek mentality, other specialties in CS tend 
to create a greater resistance to the guild mentality.  I can't pin the 
causality on it as yet.

A great read!

An interference attack can be extremely high-leverage.  Being good at it  
can do a lot of damage.  This however doesn't mean that one is any good at 
defence.
