Certicom Extends Security Platform, Enabling Developers to Address
Government Market
                         
    Certicom Security Architecture for Government provides integrated suite
    of security toolkits that ensure critical FIPS 140-2 and ECC compliance

    MISSISSAUGA, ON, Dec. 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Certicom Corp.
(TSX: CIC), the authority for strong, efficient cryptography, has extended
its Certicom Security Architecture(TM), enabling developers to embed a
FIPS 140-2-validated cryptographic module into their products and be
eligible for sale into the federal government market. The Certicom Security
Architecture also provides developers with an efficient way to enhance new
and existing applications with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and meet
the field-of-use guidelines set out by the National Security Agency (NSA)
to protect mission-critical national security information.
    The adoption of ECC within the U.S. federal government is proceeding
rapidly, and Certicom is taking a leadership role in enabling agencies and
government contractors to integrate the strongest security technology into
their products. The comprehensive Certicom Security Architecture provides a
bridge between legacy crypto systems and ECC, and gives developers the
flexibility to standardize code among different security environments and
platforms - maximizing code re-use and portability. This flexibility also
means developers will not need to redesign their solutions to meet future
government crypto requirements.
    "Hardware and software developers are increasingly realizing that
compliance with regulatory requirements for security is a pressing concern,"
said Dr. Jerry Krasner, vice president and chief analyst at Embedded Market
Forecasters (http://www.embeddedforecast.com ), the premier market
intelligence and
advisory firm in the embedded technology industry. "A cost-effective approach
is to use a tool that ensures compliance with FIPS 140-2 requirements and
eliminates the potentially costly step of third-party FIPS validation of a
device or application."
    Strong security is a key requirement across all networked applications
and devices. The Certicom Security Architecture allows developers who may have
little security expertise to add FIPS 140-2 validated security to their
solutions while avoiding the time and expense of the FIPS 140-2 validation
process. A common application programming interface (API) unifies Certicom's
proven developer toolkits to create a plug-and-play security architecture that
includes higher level protocol functionality that can operate in FIPS mode,
such as SSL and PKI.
    "Certicom Security Architecture for Government makes it easy for OEMs,
ISVs and integrators to sell products into the government sector that meet
strict government security requirements, including FIPS 140-2 and ECC," said
Roy Pereira, vice-president, marketing and product management at Certicom.
"The National Security Agency is committed to making elliptic curve
cryptography the most widely used public-key cryptosystem for securing U.S.
government information. Certicom is committed to providing the technology and
tools to make that possible."

    The Security Builder developer toolkits integrated into the Certicom
Security Architecture for Government include:
    -  Security Builder(R) GSE(TM), a FIPS 140-2-validated cryptographic
       toolkit;
    -  Security Builder(R) NSE(TM), a cryptographic toolkit for national
       security information;
    -  Security Builder(R) Crypto(TM), a cross-platform cryptographic
       toolkit;
    -  Security Builder(R) PKI(TM), a digital certificate management toolkit;
    -  Security Builder(R) SSL(TM), a complete Secure Sockets Layer toolkit;
       and
    -  Security Builder(R) IPSec(TM), a client-side virtual private network
       toolkit.

    Certicom Security Architecture for Government is available immediately,
except for Security Builder NSE which is available in Q1 2005. For more
