I remember that from school, but I don't recall any successful 
prosecutions. Not that the topic was emphasized; my criminal law 
professor was much less leery of the unchecked and unaccountable power 
of the state. (And some of my classmates viewed conspiracy as a good, 
all-purpose tool for nailing people you _know_ are guilty but who are 
so clever as to leave no evidence. Future prosecutors and legislators, 
no doubt.)
