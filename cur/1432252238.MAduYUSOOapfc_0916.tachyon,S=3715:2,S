This is called hashing.  There are lots of ways to do this.
If you need cryptographic strength, use a cryptographically strong
hash function like SHA1 and keep 5 digits of output.

If you don't need cryptographic strength, use a CRC code
(Cyclic Redundancy Check). 

There are lots of books out there with theory or examples about
CRCs and cryptographic hashes.  The basic differences are
how easy it is to predict differences in the input given
different outputs - in cryptography you care about this being hard,
while for regular applications you just care that different inputs
usually give different outputs so everything's distributed evenly.
				Thanks!
