Reminds me of a line from that movie earlier this year, Eddie The Eagle,
where he lands off the ski jump without crashing for the first time (or
at least, without dieing :) and his trainer (who got banned from the
sport so many years prior for being arrogant 'but transparent') yells
out "You did it! And we're a disgrace!!"

So: You did it! You stood for honesty, spoke personally and
transparently, drew out some more fascists, and crashed and burned, and
(according to tor-project), we're a disgrace!

Hey, I'll take Team Cecilia, Juan, Alex, Rayzer and the rest of
cypherpunks ANY day. Might not be many people in this world who value
freedom of speech, but at least a few...

This is one of the beautiful results (sometimes) of being "simple"
(transparnet, open, honest, asking straightforward questions etc, even
when some people will say "oh, how stupid you are - you got banned/
everybody knows the answer/ etc") - ahah, but some true human nature got
shown, and others have a chance to see something they may be not saw
before.

That's a great service to other humans, so thanks y'all!

Astoundingly messed up guy. I'm suspecting actually a fake guy, one of
the ja.group women with a huge knot in her knickers - but that would be
even more disturbing.
