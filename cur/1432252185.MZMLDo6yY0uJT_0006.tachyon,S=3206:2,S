Schwarz was not charged with violating other people's intellectual 
property, but other people's physical property.

He needed killing, just as much as Martin Trayvon did, for much the same 
reasons as Martin Trayvon needed killing.

If an anti state protester, protest state power, not property.  If you 
are protesting property, you are a pro state protestor

Which is why Schwarz thought he was part of the powerful, and thought 
those he harmed were part of the powerless.  Because he was striking at 
physical property, not intellectual property.
