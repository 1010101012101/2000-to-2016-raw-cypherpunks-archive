I took a peek at the items on sale. Of particular interest to privacy
buffs is Item U1 (see https://www.lfcfa.org/auction/prop.aspx)

	4.User Data 
	ITEM: U1
	Mailvault service user data
	DESCRIPTION: all manner of user data currently stored in the
	Mailvault system - this includes user accounts, stored mail, PGP
	keys.

If I were a Mailvault customer, I would find this perturbing.
