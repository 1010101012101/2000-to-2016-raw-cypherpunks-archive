I filed a Notice of Appeal (Interlocutory) in about March 23,2001, on the new case which began November 2000.  This ISN'T the same case as turned into appeal case 99-30210.  The filing of this appeal notice had the legal effect (albeit ignored) of divesting Tanner's court of jurisdiction to proceed with the upcoming trial.  Tanner, and corrupt attorney Robert Leen, ignored this, however.

has received appellant's 4/5/01 pro se notice of appeal, and pro se
emergency motion to stay d.c. proceedings pending appeal. Because
appellant is represented by counsel, only counsel may file motions,
and this court therefore declines to entertain the motion. The Clerk
shall serve a copy of the pro se motion on appellant's counsel of
record, Robert M. Leen. Within 14 days of this order, counsel Leen
shall file a response to appellant's pro se motion. In addition,
counsel Leen shall move for voluntary dismissal of the appeal filed
4/5/0, or show cause why it should not be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction because the d.c. has not issued any orders that are final
or appealable. If counsel Leen elects to show cause, appellee may
respond within 10 days after service of counsel Leen's memorandum. If
counsel Leen does not comply with this order, the Clerk shall dismiss
this appeal pursuant to 42-1. Briefing is suspended pending further
order of the court. The Clerk shall also serve this order on appellant
