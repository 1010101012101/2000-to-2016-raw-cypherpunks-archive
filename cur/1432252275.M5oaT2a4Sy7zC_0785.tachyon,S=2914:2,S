Question to the lawyerly-types:

What would happen if California passed a law making seizure of marijuana
plants from an approved medical marijuana facility a criminal offense?

The local sheriff's department should then be responsible for preventing
such criminal raids by the DEA, and the agents involved should be arrested
and prosecuted.

How would this play out, both on the street and in the courts?
