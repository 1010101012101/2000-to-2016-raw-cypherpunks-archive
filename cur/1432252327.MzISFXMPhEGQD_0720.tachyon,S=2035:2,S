It means it pre-encrypts your data before it's actually put on the drive.
In addtion the key is kept in a removable dongle of some sort so you can
take it with you. In other words the only bytes on your physical drive are
encypted.

If the part in possession of the drive doesn't have the key then they
can't decrypt it (at least in their theory) without brute force.
