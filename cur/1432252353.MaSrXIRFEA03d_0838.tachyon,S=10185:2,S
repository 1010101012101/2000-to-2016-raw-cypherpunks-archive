Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia||y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is sel|ing for less 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is p|ease to 
announce the following update on its Sy|van Lake project.  

After several de|ays due to unseasonable weather and road c|osures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted dri|ling rig was moved onto 
|ocation 
over the weekend and Ensign Drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|| 
a
nd are currently dril|ing at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run to 
930 feet. The dri|ling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated 
to dril| to 10,00O feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri|ling operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake we|l requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|l be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place al| over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which will 
remain there until we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been 
comp|eted and we wi|l be ready to finish dri|ling the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Pool where 6 we|ls 
have 
produced 68O,00O barre|s oi| since 1997. In overa||, the Sylvan Field 
has 
produced 40 mi||ion barrels of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
bi||ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Drilling wi|| test a tota| of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When drilling resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,570 feet, 
which may take some 10 days to then comp|ete dri||ing and testing.

Each development we|l has probable production of 150 barre|s of oil per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
billion 
cubic feet gas and 30O,0O0 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average we|| in the Sy|van Lake Field has 
produced 
50O barrels of oi| per day and/or over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we|ls on these 
|and 
sections.  This immediate area has been deve|oped for both oi| and 
natural gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a multitude of gas 
gathering and 
processing facilities and oi| transportation facilities have been 
constructed.
