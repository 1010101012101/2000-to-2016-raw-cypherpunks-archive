Financial Cryptography and Data Security
Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
25-28 January 2010

http://fc10.ifca.ai

Dear Colleagues,

We would like to invite you to submit a poster (deadline extended to
December 3rd) and participate in the 2010 Financial Cryptography and
Data Security Conference, January 25-28, 2010 in Tenerife, Canary
Islands, Spain, a boat-ride away from Morocco.

We had an extremely competitive review process this year. Out of 130
submissions we accepted 19 as FULL papers (acceptance rate: 14.6%) and  
15 as
SHORT papers (acceptance rate: 26.1%) for a total of 34 presentations.
Additionally we are glad to have 3 workshops co-located with FC this  
year,
with an additional 19-20 papers.

FC 2010 will thus feature close to 55 high quality paper
presentations, 2-3 panels, 3 workshops, 3 distinguished lectures in
the main conference (and several additional talks in the workshops),
as well as a great social and networking program, all hosted in a 5
star hotel in a most beautiful location.

The following is a preliminary (several papers are accepted
conditional to succesful shepherding) list of all the 54 papers
accepted at the main FC conference as well as at the workshops.
