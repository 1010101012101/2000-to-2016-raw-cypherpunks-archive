Just last month, Wurzler Underwriting Managers upped the price
  for insuring companies that use Microsoft's Windows NT server
software, on the basis that the
  software has had a series of security problems. Wurzler, one of the
earliest agencies to offer hacker
  insurance, began charging its clients 5 percent to 15 percent more if
they use Microsoft's Windows NT
  instead of Unix or Linux for their Internet operations.
