Indeed, Motorola has done a good job building their pagers so that they'll
run a long time on a relatively small battery, because they've got internal
timers which shut down even the receive circuitry between transmission
cycles; they wake up every so often to listen for pages, then go back to 
sleep - if they go outside a coverage area, the battery life drops 
substantially because the receive circuitry is active full-time waiting
to find a familiar signal.

I have no information that this technique has been used in cellphones - or
will be - but it's already in consumer-grade technology that's been shipping
in volume for years now. So it's certainly not difficult to build a 
wireless device which remains active on very low power, waiting for a 
signal from its Real Owner to wake up and do something.
