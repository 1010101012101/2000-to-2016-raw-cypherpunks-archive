An HTML of Jim's RICO suit:

  http://cryptome.org/jdb/jdb-v-usa-ric.htm

The RICO suit is over twice the length of AP.

For those who haven't followed the Bell case and Assassination
Politics, here's a link to the Jim Bell and Carl Johnson files:

  http://cryptomer.org/jdb/jdb-files.htm

Jim and his Multnomah County Common Law Court avengers 
have put together an impressive cast of enemies of the citizenry, 
many of whom are probably little known here, but whose names 
and duties pop up in the official records of the Bell trials as in 
the comprehensive RICO suit.

According the WWA prosecutor's web page, Robb London
has moved on, perhaps to the gargantuan homeland terrorism
upmarket. Not sure where Jeff Gordon is, anybody know?
