there are mesh networks

freifunk

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=freifunk+berlin

also when people woke up to the cables of the net all going thru the US
there was at least talk of making new infrastructure on other land masses

i wrote about the chatanooga model that freed the fiber under the city of
chatanooga and also the future being wireless hubs not broadband ... look
to what the powers are making frameworks for and develop outside that realm
using its flaws

when i lived in syria i had video calls in the middle of the desert ... no
cell towers in sight -

iraqis had video calling in 2000 or even 1999 - anyone that had an
efficient fone (nokia was big)

in other words the whole system is throttled and thats not just about speed

but quantum computing development is being ignored ?
