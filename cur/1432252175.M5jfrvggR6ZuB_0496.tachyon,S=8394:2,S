Thanks! Yes, that's correct. We're also looking into implementing forward secrecy in this asynchronous environment with support for large group chats.

Key management is another important aspect, and something that has a high learning curve for the average user. For Subrosa, we've tried to make globally accessible keyrings without compromising security. Each user has a profile blob, which contains their RSA private key, AES-GCM keys, and user settings. The profile blob is encrypted with a PBKDF2-derived key from the user password.

The encrypted profile blob is sync'd with the server. When logging in, the client is required to send a hash of the derived key (the server knows this as the client sends the hash during registration) before the server returns the encrypted blob to counter offline brute-forcing attacks on the password.

For end to end encryption to be widely adopted, it needs to convince people who don't care about it as well. And that means it can't be any harder, or more confusing than popular offerings.

RSA keypairs are stored on our servers, with the private key being passed through PBKDF2 with the user password (not sent). Messages are encrypted using exchanged AES keys, with VOIP/video chats encrypted with SRTP.

Subrosa's client is fully open source however, and you can (and should!) run a local copy of the client. We use the ForgeJS library. http://github.com/subrosa-io/subrosa-client
