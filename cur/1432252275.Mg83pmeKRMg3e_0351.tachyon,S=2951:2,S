Dave,
	This evening BBC transmitted an interesting program concerning
privacy and surveillance. Probably not a lot new to most IP readers,
but the compilation is compelling. The program is described at
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5015826.stm>

programmes/?id=money_programme>.

Enjoy - if that's the right word.

	Denis.
