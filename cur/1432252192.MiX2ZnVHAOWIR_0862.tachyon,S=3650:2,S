Filtering the From: line won't work- the list keeps getting added
to new "macketing lists" and web sites.

Filtering cypherpunks mail that originates at toad.com gets a lot of
the spam.  But, after that was identified as a way to avoid the
spam, the other CDRs started getting added to the spam lists.  Hmm.
So filtering it out only does so much; and there are still
non-spam posts that are sent through toad.

I've set up a CDR which filters out posts from non-subscribers
to any CDR.  Posts from non-subscribers (like you) are forwarded
to the list if they're not spam.

% echo "info cypherpunks" | mail majordomo@lne.com

You're fortunate!

A third option is to run a program that recognizes spam
contents.  I've written one: www.lne.com/ericm/spammaster.
