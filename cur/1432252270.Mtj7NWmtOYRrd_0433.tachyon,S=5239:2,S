This is getting close to the 'agree to disagree' point, but I'll go one more
round.

No, the transport layer is not to blame.  The malicious users are to blame.  The
subset of Tor users abusing Wikipedia may be "almost universally bad", but that
is still a subset, and doesn't indight Tor itself.

What I'm saying is that Tor is designed to provide anonymity, and does this
fairly well.  That anonymity is at odds with the social contract where it
provides an avenue for malicious action without responsibility, but that fact
is not the fault of the anonymity or its enablers; it is the fault of the bad
actors.

I'm not saying openness is wrong.  I'm saying it has its costs, which you
obviously already recognize, and reducing those costs may require embracing a
less-than-fully-open philosophy.

That modification may include blocking Tor exit nodes, based on the behavior of
bad actors.  That's unfortunate, but expedient.  But trying to force-fit
pseudonymity on the Tor anonymity model is an attempt to shift your costs onto
Tor.

That Tor is working as designed, and that the problem with bad actors using its
cloak is a problem with the actors themselves.

As Bob Hettinga noted elsewhere, "perfect pseudonymity *is* perfect anonymity".
Arguably, perfect pseudonymity is a more useful construct, but it is a much
harder problem than anonymity.  And given that perfect pseudonyms are perfectly
disposable, that still won't address the bad actor problem completely.  Openness
requires responsibility, and responsibility implies accountability, so the only
"perfect" solution is 100% meatspace correlation to enable enforcement of the
social contract.  That might solve your vandalism problem, but it introduces
other issues.

Those people are not sticking their heads in the sand.  They're correctly noting
that nothing is broken except the bad actors.
