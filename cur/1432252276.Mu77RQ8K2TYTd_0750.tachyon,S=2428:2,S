I have one word for all of you.

Equity.


:-).

I expect that someday we'll vote shares for the application of
non-monopolistic force just like we now "vote" for the application of
monopolist force.


I think statists -- including most cryptographers who should know
better -- are looking this "problem" of the mutual exclusivity of
"accountability" versus anonymity in electronic voting and they just
don't understand what they're looking at yet.

Maybe they never will.

I think we're looking at something as fundamental as Coase's theorem,
here, or at least Dan Geer's observation that the boundry between
symmetric and asymmetric as identical to the boundry between the firm
and the outside world.

We're looking at the definition of crypto-anarchy here, folks.
Anarcho-capitalism made real.

Cheers,
RAH
Who still thinks that financial cryptography is the only cryptography
that matters.
