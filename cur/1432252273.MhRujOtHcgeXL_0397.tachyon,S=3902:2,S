Actually, in that context I was specifically NOT referring to
gold as a generic proxy for value,  if you'll recall I was listing
reasons was gold is particularly well suited to be a proxy for
value.  The point is that gold is something that falls into the
category of sparkly things that women like.  Women will sleep with 
you if you give them jewelry, even if they're not going to
sell it.  Umm, or so I've been told.

Of course, men like the sparkly stuff also, but if wear lots of
jewelry people are likely to think you're either gay or a pimp.
Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that, but giving off
misleading signals can lead to embarassment.
