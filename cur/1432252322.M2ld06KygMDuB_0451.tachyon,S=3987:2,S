(based solely on proper CDC responce to a questionable hazzard such as
pulmonary anthrax):

If it had been truly believed by ANYONE at the CDC that the situation had
originated in N. Carolina, there would have been one hell of a lockdown of
all farms and immediate testing of all livestock in the region (including
samples from every restaurant, meat packing plant, food market, furrier, and
slaughterhouse - as well as samples from every worker involved with
livestock, every farmer, chef, and meat packer etc). There was no such
effort

If it has been belived that the 2 incidents were bizzarely timed, yet
natural incident occuring in Florida, the same actions would have occured in
Florida in every town these men had lived in or visited for the past 60
days.

There would have also been an immediate stoppage of all meat deliveries by
all meat packing plants, slaughterhouses would have been shut down for
testing, and all livestock farms that dealt with any of the supermarkets and
plants in Florida - and the CDC would have immediately put a call out to
stop all meat consumption in those states that recieved meat from the same
plants ... None of this occured.

Tim is correct  about the North Carolina story "no longer operative." The
story that this occured naturally seems to be slowly slipping as well -
