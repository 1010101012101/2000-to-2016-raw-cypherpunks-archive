WOW!

Let's examine your little clip here.


>Tyler Durden
> > "Care to Avoid harming Muslims"?

Your statement was that the US took special care in avoiding harm to 
Muslims. In this case we have Muslims tortured at Guantanamo and now angry 
as hell. And you expected...what?

>http://washingtontimes.com/national/20041018-124854-2279r.htm
>: :	Despite gaining their freedom by signing pledges to
>: :	renounce violence, at least seven former prisoners
>: :	of the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have
>: :	returned to terrorism, at times with deadly
>: :	consequences.

Wow! Tortured prisoners signed statements and then went back on their 
promises? The nerve!

Note the incredible linguistic bias. "Returned to terrorism?...That's a 
laughable statement for people who returned to their own country to fight an 
invader. And the word "Despite" it's arguable even more hilarious.

And of course, your quote of this piece in this context points to your 
ever-present logic of "They're more evil than we are therefore it's OK if we 
fuck them over".

>: :	Additional former detainees have expressed a desire
>: :	to rejoin the fight, be it against U.N. peacekeepers
>: :	in Afghanistan, Americans in Iraq or Russian
>: :	soldiers in Chechnya.

Hum. Muislims helping Muslims to push the US or Russians out of their 
occupied countries. I've seen worse uses for religion.

But more importantly, are you seeing where this is headed? Let's forget 
differing ideologies and get really, really practical here. If you or I were 
grabbed in our own country and brought 7000 miles away, and then tortured 
for 2 years, wouldn't you most likely become convinced that the torturing 
nation was a great evil that had to be stopped? Even more, what if your life 
sucked in your own country and you didn't have a lot to live for anyway?

The violence sown by Western powers will continue to result in further 
Septemeber 11ths. Simply increasing the scope or intensity (a la Iraq II) 
isn't going to make things better.
