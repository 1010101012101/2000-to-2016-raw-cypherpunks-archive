Given Hitlery Clinton's war creds, I don't think she's the least-worst
option - if World War 3 erupts the rest is simply irrelevant.

USA leadership is defined these days by the CIA. Overthrowing sovereign
nations - now that's leadership that cannot be ignored.

The litany of outsourcing, from North America's industrial base (we've
had the same sellout here in Australia) to China, to H1B visa's, the
destruction of USA's middle class is all but complete now.
This is a very sad thing, and will ultimately affect the 1%ers.

[Here in Australia we have a "negative gearing" tax regime on property
(land, houses and commercial real estate) and so the middle class is
defined by those with real estate assets, since money (fwiw) tends
strongly away from entrepreneurial wealth and into real estate.]

Would be nice if that were true.

Can he be much worse than 'the establishment' as represented by Hillary
Clinton (even --if-- this statement is true)?

Trump campaigns on "fear of new ideas"? Now -that's- a new one!

This is true - America is a wounded dragon:

I don't know, but I don't believe this is true.

That's an intense statement! That needs unpacking to carry any weight
with me!

I think his 'wall across Mexico border' ain't gonna be funded regardless
- that would be pretty funny if it were ever created :)

Yeah? This is sounding ... political, at this point, rather than
factual.
