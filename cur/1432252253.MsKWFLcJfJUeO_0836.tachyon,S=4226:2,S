Actually almost every one of these examples were DEVELOPED either 'out of
the blue' by the industry or by the 'off-road/racing' groups, not by any
factor related to litigation (though their ACCEPTANCE in the regular
consumer market was - thought those are not the same beaties by a long
shot). Most definitely these were NOT in responce to litigation.

ABS - Road racing cars (ala Le Mans)
Crumple Zones - Indy style racing and aircraft
Safety Glass - invented in the 20's, in responce to accidents not lawyers
Shoulder/passive belts - racing since the turn of the century

Bumpers and air bags being the primary exception in your examples.
