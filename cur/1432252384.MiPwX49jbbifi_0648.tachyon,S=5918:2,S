11 months in 2007? How long will that take 18 months from now if we assume 
pure microprocessor advance a la Moore's law? Is there also a slow but 
steady stream of algorithmic imrpovements to factoring?

Where the f's Cordian these days?

Also, I didn't know any real encryption work was done at Bellcore, though I 
consider it possible this guy was doing this work in his "spare time". I 
remember back in the day they broke a 'Smartcard' by environmentally 
stressing it and getting the sick chip to throw up essential bits...

>Mathematicians and number buffs have their records. And today, an
>international team has broken a long-standing one in an impressive feat of
>calculation.
>
>On March 6, computer clusters from three institutions - the EPFL, the
>University of Bonn and NTT in Japan -- reached the end of eleven months of
>strenuous calculation, churning out the prime factors of a well-known,
>hard-to-factor number that is a whopping 307 digits long.
>
>"This is the largest 'special' hard-to-factor number factored to date,"
>explains EPFL cryptology professor Arjen Lenstra. (The number is 'special'
>because it has a special mathematical form -- it is close to a power of
>two.) The news of this feat will grab the attention of information security
>experts and may eventually lead to changes in encryption techniques.
>
>Although it is relatively easy to identify huge prime numbers, factoring,
>or breaking a number down into its prime components, is extremely
>difficult. RSA encryption, named for the three individuals who devised the
>technique (Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman), takes advantage
>of this. Using the RSA method, information is encrypted using a large
>composite number, usually 1024 bits in size, created by multiplying
>together two 150-or-so digit prime numbers. Only someone who knows those
>two numbers, the "keys", can read the message. Because there is a vast
>supply of large prime numbers, it's easy to come up with unique keys.
>Information encrypted this way is secure, because no one has ever been able
>to factor these huge numbers. At least not yet.
>
>The most recent factoring record is RSA200, a 200-digit 'non-special'
>number whose two prime factors were identified in 2005 after 18 months of
>calculations that took over a half century of computer time.
>
>The international team factored the current 307-digit behemoth using the
>"special number field sieve," a method devised in the late 1980s by Lenstra
>(then at Bellcore), his brother Hendrik, then a professor at UC Berkeley,
>English mathematician John Pollard and Mark Manasse from DEC. The 11-month
>job took a century of computer time.
>
>A feat like this would have been unthinkable back in 1990 when Lenstra
>started applying number theory and distributed computing to the task of
>breaking factoring records. Increased computer power and refined
>computational techniques have raised the bar, and will continue to do so.
>"We have more powerful computers, we have come up with better ways to map

>Is the writing on the wall for 1024-bit encryption" "The answer to that

>is still secure, because it is much more difficult to factor a number made

>number like this one that has a special mathematical form. But the clock is
>definitely ticking. "Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize
