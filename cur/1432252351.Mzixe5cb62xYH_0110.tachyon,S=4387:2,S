The crank tank probably dismisses it as being determined mainly
by government regulation. Most railway acts had a guage clause.

However in the UK the vastly superior broad guage was converted
to narrow precisely because of network effects.

The crank tank is asking me to distinguish between 'path 
dependence' (a term I have not used) and 'network externalities'.
This is clearly a tactical ploy to try to move the argument to 
their definitions. It is an Oxford Union debating trick for folk
with a weak cause.

The original argument was addressed to a public audience. If the
crank tank 'Independent Institute' cannot justify their claim
in public language they are clearly frauds and should retreat to
the house litterature they publish their whacky theories in.

The claim the economic effects can only be understood by experts
in the field is made to foreclose debate. They want to claim that
you and me and everyone on the list that does not agree with them
do so out of ignorance. Oh by the way they get to decide who is
an expert.

The Institute for Historical Reform and the Creationism Study
Institute use the same tactic.
