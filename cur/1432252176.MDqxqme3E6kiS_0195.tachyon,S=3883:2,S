Bamford's book "Body of Secrets" has a lot of good discussion on
moon-bounce work by the NSA.  As Phillip wrote, two of the main
applications were passive eavesdropping on Soviet communucations
(though satellites later did a *much* better job) and
very non-directional communications to/from spy ships.
