I'm not a banking law geek, but I believe that there are federal
regs in place known as "know your customer" rules which apply to
depository institutions like banks, credit unions, etc - the 
regs which were withdrawn would have required NBFI's (non-bank
financial institutions) to comply with similar rules, as they're 
sometimes used instead of banks to avoid the KYC rules. 

Or am I thinking of something else?
