Ciao amore,

Leaving the house to purchase your necessities is so last month- come
e-browsing with me tonight!

Always and truly yours,

Arlene

Ciao!  Arlene

Holy smokes, it looks like I may have come across the most fitting gift for
my son! It's this great e store that has luxury look timekeepers and since
you're my pal, I wanted to tell you first.  You're charitable to all other
people, but not ever to yourself and I surmise this should change.

It's time you get what is owed to you, a rugged luxurious wrist accessory.
Their post is a snap, so there's no waiting and they also provide online
tracking!

If you see a  navitimer you want to give as a surprise, they have the most
adorable gift boxes!

Because I love you,

Eike
