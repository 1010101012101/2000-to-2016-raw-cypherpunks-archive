Here's one other thing; how does the "compliant application" get the 
decryption keys??  If I can't copy files without being hooked up to
the net, then half my computers at home will quit working!  (I have 
two distinct networks: one for secure data and one with internet 
access...).  If the compliant application needs to hook up to the 
internet in order to get a decryption key to read data, these drives 
will not work for a host of legitimate non-networked applications. 

On the other hand if the compliant application does NOT need to hook 
up to the internet to get keys, then someone with a debugger will have 
a utility to get your drive's whole list of keys (and a patched BIOS 
to make it behave like a regular drive) within a couple weeks of 
their introduction to the market.

Unless it comes out at the same time as "encrypted instruction set" 
computing, where the executables are decrypted inside the CPU...
