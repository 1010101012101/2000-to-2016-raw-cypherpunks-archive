It's super frustrating that Turbid assumes you are going to
reverse-engineer the amplifier stage of your sound card in order to set
some difficult-to-understand parameters which apparently can completely
break it's ability to extract entropy if set incorrectly.  (See the
installation instructions in section 12 of the paper linked above.)

It would be much better for it to have a default set of parameters (or
an autotuned parameter engine) that have a very high likelihood of
giving acceptable results upon "apt-get install turbid" on some
arbitrary hardware.

I mean, seriously.  The Turbid authors appear to assume that every
person who installs Turbid is going to build a custom Y-audio cable and
put a voltmeter (set to the correct mode of course!) on the outputs of
their sound card.  WTF?

It's fine if conservative, default settings result in Turbid getting
only 100 bits of entropy per second rather than 100 Kbit/sec.  Mix it
into /dev/urandom and call it a day.
