Isn't a good definition of a cryptographically-strong PRNG that even if
you know bits 1..I-1, you still don't know anything about bit I? (Unless
you know the internal state of the PRNG, of course.) A c-strong PRNG
shouldn't be susceptible to any currently known analyses.

Perhaps that's just a theoretical definition, and no existant PRNGs come
close. But I thought some good ones were out there.
