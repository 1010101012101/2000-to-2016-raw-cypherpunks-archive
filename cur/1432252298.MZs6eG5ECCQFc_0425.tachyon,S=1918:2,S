Too late - we missed it!  It was on May Day, aka May 1.

Obviously it's designed to give American Labor Unions something to do
when the rest of the world is celebrating Labor Day,
since of course American Unions aren't Commies and never have been.

(Unfortunately they are mostly Democrats, so the Administration
is still looking for ways to crush them, but they'd better be
Loyal Americans anyway...)

I don't know how the turnout for the San Francisco May Day Parade went.
It used to alternate between hippie maypole dance things and
commie parades, and this year looked like another commie year
plus it was raining like mad...
