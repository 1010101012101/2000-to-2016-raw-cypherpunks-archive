It's interesting to note you keep track of subscription patterns.  "Fuck you 
dead", hmmm, I suppose that's better then your old refrain of threatening to 
shoot someone. Do you feel self-censored, afraid of the authorities, or just 
don't want to get your got.net account yanked?

My point about Reason Magazine is your inability to understand that the 
magazine has improved.
