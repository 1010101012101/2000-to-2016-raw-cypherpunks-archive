This brings me back to my stint at Intel, 1980-82, as a new Product Enginee=
r for the 2186, an 8kx8 pseudostatic (self-refreshing dynamic) RAM. (One of=
 the first DRAMs to use redundancy to increase yield.) =C2=A0I may have bee=
n the first engineer in the world to see, through a microscope focused on a=
 DRAM chip, a very quick series of flashes, evidence of the programming (bl=
owing) silicon fuses on the chip, to program the row- and column-redundancy=
 information.
=C2=A0Product engineers were, and presumably still are, responsible for wri=
ting test programs to run chips through their paces, in Intel's case using =
a Teradyne computer. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 http://www.teradyne.com/products/=
semiconductor-test/magnum-v
I don't think the concept of this kind of weakness is new: =C2=A0Even in 19=
80, DRAMs were tested for such repeated accesses, to ensure that such error=
s would not occur. =C2=A0This was particularly true for a process called "d=
evice characterization", in which chips were attacked in all manner of elec=
tronically-abusive ways, to uncover these weaknesses, and fix the circuit d=
esign should such flaws be uncovered.=C2=A0One way these techniques could b=
e thwarted is to return to the use of parity-bits (8+1 parity) in memory ac=
cess, in DRAM module and computer design, to whatever extent they are no lo=
nger used. =C2=A0Any (successful) attempt to modify bits in a DRAM would qu=
ickly end up causing a parity error, which would at least show which manufa=
