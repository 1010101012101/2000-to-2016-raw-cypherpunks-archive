I bet FBI agents have nightmares. At least those involved in the Waco and
Ruby Ridge cases. I think they were unable to sleep at night, dreaming of a
piece of paper jumping between them and their victims and threatening to...
whatever.

Has anyone EVER saw the Constitution stand in any place, let alone "in the
way of full-scale represion"? People with guns do that, not paper. Why do I
have to repeat something this obvious?

(No, "it was a metaphor" doesn't cut it. It was a dumb metaphor. Next time
you're arguing something, get rid of metaphors. As an exercise, try
rephrasing what you said above without using any. Forget about
"constitutional protection" or "Constitution standing in the way". Try to
make sense.)
