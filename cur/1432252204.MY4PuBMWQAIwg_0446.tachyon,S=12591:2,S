 >>you
seem incapable of quoting in a legible manner. <<

Im learning on the job,bear with me,please.

 >>You should
be aware that I'm not taking you seriously<<

Thats a weight off.

 >>Ordinarily, I wouldn't
feed the trolls, but I'm bored.<<

Backatcha.

 >>Jim Bell was arrested for, charged with, and convicted of crossing
US state lines with the intent to threaten a federal official, a
felony in this country. Felony == crime. <<

Not assasination politics.He was investigating abuse's of power.Nowt to do 
with "assasination politics".Unless your a paranoid official.

 >>Carl Johnson was similarly convicted of threatening a federal
official, still a felony in the US.<<

Well CJ is here,lets ask him.The authorities seem dreadfully frightened of 
something laughable and impractical dreamed up by a circle of eunuchs; 
Thats where I come in.If the authorities don't like it.I just might.Im a 
libertarian socialist.(anarchist)

 >>Regardless of what you think of the laws involved, these two broke
them according to the legal system under which they chose to
operate, which is, by definition, crime.<<

Yeah,so? Assasination politics is a crime? It must be like drugs and terror 
then.DECLARE WAR!

 >>Bully for you that you live (or claim to live) in Australia under a
different legal system.<<

I live in au,profess assasination politics openly.(operation soft drill) 
Would you mind e-mailing the victorian police and ask them to return the 
computer they stole from me over 6 months ago? Tell them how impractical 
and laughable it all is.Cops might take your laptop tomorrow.Dont come 
crying to me then.The police are bullies.

 >>The point here is that Bell, Johnson, and you have all made
yourselves prime suspects if any public official (especially one in
the US) is killed in a way that can be linked to assassination
politics, <<

Oh,like that prosecuter in WA state just recently? I think CJ posted on 
that as I may have at melb indymedia.Suspects or subjects of surveillance 
and in CJs case low,vicious harassment.Shows how brittle and shitscared 
they might be,dontcha reckon,Gabe? The panopticon they will need to build 
will break their own back.

 >>and the still-rather-powerful executive branch of the US
government is likely to come looking for you (and Bell and Johnson,
if they're not incarcerated at that point) if someone should be,
and likely to charge you with incitement to murder.<<

Whats the charge? "Just give me my fucking phone call." FUCK the POLIZI. 
and all who sail in them."Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees" 
E.Zapata. libertarian socialist.

 >>. It doesn't
matter whether or not this is Right (I'm willing to stipulate that
it's Wrong), it is the reality of the situation.<<

WoW! Shit like that can lead to revolutions! Lets Go! No such thing as bad 
publicity.Especially for a laughable,impractical scheme.The powers that be 
will be laughing stocks.Hilarious.Surreal.Im really scared.

 >>The crypto and electronic currency ideas used in assassination
politics are kind of neat as a thought experiment<<

How do you know that there isnt a 'napster for hitmen' or anti-choice 
warriors' or JDL cadres,already? No one can say there isnt for sure.Whats 
the nuremburg website all about? Doc-watch? Look around,AP is out there.Its 
especially 'neat' for ecash hungry crypto-anarchists.They seem to be being 
left behind for some reason.Will the last cypherpunk please turn out the 
lights? We do seem to need some new blood here as jim,CJ and I seem to be 
incompetents in yr eyes.

 >>but the execution
(no pun intended) has, thus far, fallen extremely short. Unless
you know something I don't and would care to share it.<<

As far as I know,you are a P.I.Gs,(person/s impersonating govt servant/s) 
Also Ive only just unpacked my PGP.
Ill probably give up OSD when the executions start.Like genet will only 
support palestinians till they get their own (police) state.Its the 
challenge of ushering in crypto-anarchy thats sucked me in.The essay is 
worth publicizing  on its own...by any means necessary.

 >>My point is that knowing who was paid to kill someone is not the
only way to find out that the assassin performed the assassination.
The assassin can easily be (and often is) caught in the act. The
assassin can fail (and, for bonus points, also be caught). There are
plenty of examples of assassination attempts for which there is no
monetary paper trail in which the assassin has been caught. (Let's
see, in US history off the top of my head: John Wilkes Booth, Lee
Harvey Oswald, and John W. Hinckley Jr.)<<

Thats a huge plus.How many incompetent assassins do you want running 
around.(did oswald act alone?)

 >>The issue of getting caught is totally orthogonal to the monetary
paper trail; they intersect if a LEA uses the monetary paper trail
to catch the assassin, but that's not the only way to catch him.
Getting caught, though, must be a concern equal to, if not greater
than, compensation to an assassin interested in getting paid for
assassination (since he can't get paid if he gets caught or, at
least, it won't do him much
good in prison).<<

I still like operation soft drill as its an 'open conspiracy" Skim the 
essay up to the last page (10) Everyone contributes
pledges of 1$ at a bulletin board,anon if they prefer,payable (in 
installments if desired).No crypto required till payday.
The money could go to next of kin,comrades, etc. If the assassin so 
desires,thus making  a hit on oneself possible.
Sandy sandfort  might jump in at this point and scoff,but the other point 
is the mass civil disobedience aspect of bringing someone like condit,OJ or 
my own dennis to account.Empowering for all those who seek justice.The 
individual citizen decides who the baddies are and if they raise a few 
K,maybe the issue gets some media.Worth a shot.Not mob justice cos it takes 
time.It didnt take long for the USAma pot ,though, and someone said that he 
would be a hard on for AP a few weeks back,check archive 2-3 weeks.

 >>> (you just contradicted yrself btw.)
How so?

Well in the way you scoff at AP and salute it at the same time.You dont 
speak to OSD.either.

 >>No, no. AP is funny because it's impracticeable.

On very preliminary results by a  few  publicists under enormous 
pressure.Its too early to write it off.

 >>Bell's theory does a really good job of sorting out the business end of 
assassination,

No contradiction? I realize your critting the application of the 
application.All human endeavor will suffer from human failing and again its 
early days.Orville and wilbur didnt give up teaching mr ed to talk did they?

 >>I think you've watched Grosse Pointe Blank five too many times.

I prefer scorcese and crimes and misdemeanors by woody allen.Also godfather 
and prizzi's honor.I do like john cusack.(and he likes the clash too!)
He could play me in the AP movie though I look like mel gibson.The union of 
hitmen idea's quiet funny.Dan A,what a guy.Blues brothers,YEAH! Theres a 
movie.I saw grosse pointe once and have forgotten most of it,Im sorry I 
missed the recent TV series,sounded like a hoot.Not much time for movies/TV 
these days.

 >>How
many seasoned professional killers do you really imagine are running
around in the US these days? No, really, I want to know what you
think.<<

How many in the armed forces? Police force? Correctional 
wackenhutters?CIA.FBI.ATF.IRS. I dont know and I dont care.The more dead 
americans the better for the rest of the world.I dont want to live on 
Venus.FUCK AMERIKKKA!

 >>Hrm. That kind of counteracts the utility of Bell's system of
remuneration for assassination, doesn't it? If the assassin would
have done it for free (or, at least, cheap) and is willing to die
trying, why would he bother with all the crypto flim-flam? <<

Indeed; See operation soft drill.Collapse of govts.Anarchy.

 >>Sure,
maybe having a list of "recommended targets" would be helpful for
all those civil-liberty-loving suicidal assassins out there just
searching for a suitably morally devoid victim, but there's not
much need for an organization to hold predictions in escrow then,
now is there?<<

You could be right.Operation soft drill is the 'let it all hang out'version 
of AP. The 'organization' is the (P-P) network,Its distributed and gets 
together for specific 'events'.No fixed abode.Crypto-anarchist nomads bring 
down the last empire.Could be a movie in it.Send us a script.

 >>> KILL THE PRESIDENT! "Id buy that for a dollar!"(Me)

 >>Really, I don't see what you've got against W. He's actually just a
harmless twit, another Ronald Reagan. You really ought to be more
interested in his cabinet, starting with (my former governor, who
managed to lose an election to a dead man) Ashcroft. They're the
real assholes. But you'd have a hard time knowing that considering
you don't even live in the country whose public figures you're so
interested in having assassinated.<<

If you want to 'fork your own distro' on assfluff,Ill be the first to 
contribute 1 proffr dollar Your stooping low for a so called 
cypherpunk.Dont any of you listen to alpha baboon tim may? National borders 
are not even road humps on the infobahn?
Remember? Dickhead, Im only interested soft drilling a few hundred of the 
richest people in the world and some 'public figures' that get in the 
way.Viva crypto-anarchy,VIVA! Theres only one question...who is to be 
master...thats all.

 >>Cheers mattd, apologies to the unamused on cypherpunks...

Yeah,cheers yourself  you hump.
