Paris cybercafes raided in
shoebomber inquiry 

By Verena Von Derschau in Paris

01 January 2002

The Paris prosecutor's office opened a judicial inquiry into
Richard Reid, the man accused of trying to blow up an aircraft
with explosives hidden in his shoes, and investigators have
confiscated computers from Paris cybercafis he visited.

The inquiry into a possible charge of "criminal association in
relation to a terrorist enterprise" would cover anyone suspected
of having acted as Mr Reid's accomplice, officials said.
