First, Arabs are Semites. Amazing how often we hear pro-Arab views 
being characterized as being anti-Semitic.

Second, Zionism is a political movement. It is usually correlated 
strongly with the Jewish religion, but is not identical to it. Most 
Zionists are Jews, some Zionists are not Jews, many Jews are not 
Zionists.

Nowhere in my article did I mention Jews or Judaism.

As for appropriateness, fuck off.
