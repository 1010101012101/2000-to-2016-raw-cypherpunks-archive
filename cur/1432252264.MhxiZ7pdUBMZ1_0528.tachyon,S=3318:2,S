We do have a problem with our faith in technology. 

In all fairness though, I would bet that there are people in the Bureau
who are saying "I told you so." It's tough to compete for airtime and
budget no matter what organization you're talking about.

I assign the attacks on civil liberties to a sorry combination of panic
and opportunism. It's disgusting and shows how weak we are. If those
proposing these measures had any courage or honor or respect for their
country they would be eager to open a substantial debate both in public
and in session. Instead, they are using chaos and panic to avoid
responsibility. The brevity of the list of those who want to debate
these issues honestly is far more depressing than all of the violence of
the past month.

See the reports on the sales of anti-depressants and sleep aids.
