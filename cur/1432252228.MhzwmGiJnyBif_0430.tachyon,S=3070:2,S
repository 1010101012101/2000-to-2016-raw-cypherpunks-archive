I wrote what I honestly believed was the truth when I wrote it. I may send 
along a followup clarification.

That you responded with venom and invective instead of with a "whoops, 
sorry, honest mistake, didn't mean to say you were a spammer, let's put it 
behind us" does not make anyone take you more seriously.

Frothing and kvetching -- after the error was yours in the first place -- 
is not going to change anything.
