A popular remailer will handle some 3,500 messages a day. But this
includes intra remailer-network traffic. How many of those messages are
messages entering and leaving the cloud is any remailer operator's
guess, since current remailer statistics software has no means to
differentiate between internal and boundary traffic. Of course any
self-respecting TLA would know the those figures that the remail
operators themselves are currently unable to obtain.
