If someone in the private sector fails to please the customer, he
does not get any money.  If someone in the government sector
fails to please the customer, tough luck for the customer.  If
the customer tries to do anything about it, he has the customer
beaten up.

Unsurprisingly, you get better service and products from the
private sector.
