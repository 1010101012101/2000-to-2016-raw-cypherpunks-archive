I also heard coverage of this when it was being argued. The attorney 
for the woman also pointed out to the Court that the drug tests were 
not used to intervene AT THE TIME, so no possible causation issues 
were involved. The blood/drug test was done only FOR THE PURPOSES OF 
PROSECUTION. The authorities tested everyone, filed the results away, 
waited until the births had occurred, then filed drug charges.
