There are persistent rumors that Havenco does not really host anything on the platform, all bits are on dry land with VPN pipes to the platform, so that it looks off-shore hosted.

In other words, the platform is a decoy, storage-wise.

What matters is where bits enter 'known' Internet. Until communication infrastructure becomes truly distributed (forward-routing for the masses) this will remain the bottleneck and choke point. Kudos to Havenco for figuring this out.

Is secret publishing contradiction in terms ?
