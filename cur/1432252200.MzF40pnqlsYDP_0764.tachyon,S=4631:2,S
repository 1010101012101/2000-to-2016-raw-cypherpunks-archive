Yeah, right.    Writing to network administrators sometimes works,
or at least puts the spammer into "Whack-a-Mole" mode where
they've got to keep switching their sucker-collection endpoints.
(Unfortunately, free email accounts make that pretty simple,
but you can at least reduce revenue collection from existing spams,
and for spammers selling spamware rather than other scams,
it's important to discourage new suckers from getting in the game.)

A more appropriate response would be to
subscribe them to the cypherpunks list (:-)
Unfortunately, this is bad - the main impact of responding to
spammer's "remove me" or complaint email addresses is that it
confirms to the spammer that they had a valid address,
so they can reuse it or resell it.  So sending the list would
make it easier for the spammers to spam you directly.

There are more cypherpunkish approaches - the "teergrube" project
(go search for the FAQ) or similar trap servers can absorb 
infinite quantities of spam, v....e....r...y....s...l...o...w...l..y,
so you can reply with lots of "thank you" or "remove me" or
"yes, send me spam, please, please" mail from teergrubed addresses.
