Certainly.  Newton *replaced* dead-greek 'physics' but
Newton was *subsumed* (ie compatibly refined) by Einstein.
If e.g., you could determine that the gravitational constant
varies with time, that would have to be added to the model.

We can't say that; but we can only operate as if they
were constant.

If the laws of physics vary with distance from Sol,
for instance, astrophysicists are *fucked*

If evidence supports this then sure, a new quality/quantity may
be introduced.  Does dark matter have spin :-)

>can we say that these parameters will never change?

No, but without evidence that they do, Mr. Occam (who
had to leave his razor at the security checkpoint)
suggests minimizing the number of free variables and trying to work
with an assumption of constancy as much as possible.
