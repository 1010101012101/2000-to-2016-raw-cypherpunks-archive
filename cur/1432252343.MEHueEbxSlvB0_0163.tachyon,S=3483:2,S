Sugar.  That's all.  Kids get really hyper when fed tons of soda, candy
and chocolate.  There's a good example of how to eliminate the problem
right here in Wisconsin - the Appleton (or Oshkosh, but there abouts)
school systems have gone to feeding kids bread, carrots and milk several
times during the day, and have no behavioural problems.  Getting the
obvious to be seen in Madison is quite a chore!

It's more like the "publish or perish" syndrome.  Some field of profs
needs to create a new thing so they can keep getting funding for "research".

Dumbing down of Americans has been going on for a long time.  But I'm
not sure that's real either.  How long have the majority of people been
going past 8th grade education?  I don't think that was true 100 years
ago.  I don't think people are any dumber now than they have been over the
past 10,000 years.  We're giving primates cars and supprised they don't
understand basic physics.

We used to think DDT was great stuff.  It took a while to learn otherwise.
Maybe smarts comes from being "sick".  But I kinda doubt it, it's more
likely we're still on the learning curve and we need to get our
environment right to optimize collective social intellegence.

Patience, persistence, truth,
