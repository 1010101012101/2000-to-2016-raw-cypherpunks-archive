The Oakland Privacy Working Group has been doing a lot of work insofar as STINGRAY/HAILSTORM/whatever next generation cellular device position tracking hardware is concerned.  They would probably have some ideas on time-to-physical lock.  It is relatively to suss out the vehicles that are so equipped based upon the antennae magmounted on the roofs or the trunk lids.

The manner in which Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh is fairly well documented, and illuminating.

Or local tech that has been subverted somehow.  I often wonder how wigle.net can be abused to track someone...

They are also becoming rare in some areas.
