Mail programs need, at the very least, text editors, or it becomes difficult to
compose.  Or do you mean that word processors should be integrated into mail

The real issue is a common format.  The fact that there is no common format more
complex than ASCII is a tribute to the power of corporations over the power of

of corporations over the power of the people - but I'm a fan of standards.
