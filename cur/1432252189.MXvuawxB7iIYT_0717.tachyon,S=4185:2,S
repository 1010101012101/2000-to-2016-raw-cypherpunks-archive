Upon rereading your post, I think it was Dave and John that I should
have mentioned, not you. My apologies.

I found the article I was thinking of, saying 13 reporters jailed
in the last two decades:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60300-2001Aug25.html

John, who I admire, seems to think that the government can wave a wand
called "homeland defense" that will cause journalists around the U.S.
to instantly say, "Oh, we must reveal our sources and what they said."
This is, of course, nonsense -- and even insulting to journalists who
take their responsibilities to sources seriously. If I sound a little
peeved, that's why.

I think you're right on both counts. (While I think John should be
considered a journalist, the public interaction he had with Bell over
the suspected CIA facility would likely make some mainstream
journalism groups like RCFP hesitant to back him.) This is why it
makes sense to talk to an experienced, local, and savvy lawyer before
taking the stand at the prosecutor's behest.
