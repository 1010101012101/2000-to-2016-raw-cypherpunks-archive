The Quisling Effect
  Government is not the only destroyer of freedom

By Claire Wolfe


Miller Smithton* is a federally licensed firearms dealer. When he 
wanted to give his own son a hunting rifle for his birthday, he had 
to run a criminal background check on the young man. "I felt like a 
worm," Miller told me. "Like a traitor to my own values and my own 
family. But what else could I do?"

K.J. "Cage" Linton* is a 911 emergency dispatcher and a man concerned 
about the creeping loss of freedom and privacy in the world. If you 
call him because your father is having a heart attack or your 
daughter has broken her leg playing soccer, Cage will calmly ask for 
your full name, date of birth, and other information. (This is aside 
from what already appears on his computer screen from the E911 
service.) You, in your urgency, give him the information. And this 
freedom-loving man, without informing you of a thing, enters you into 
a law-enforcement database. Cage works in a rural county, where he 
has routinely entered his own friends, neighbors, and family members 
into this database of crooks and creeps. He knows that all sorts of 
government employees have free access to the database and use it as a 
juicy source of both local gossip and leads for investigation. But 
he's got to stick you in it. It's his job.

Juan Fuentes was just a man minding his own business. On the morning 
of August 23, 2000 three neighbor children, Jessica, Anna, and 
Vanessa Carpenter, rushed up pounding his door. Anna was bleeding 
from dozens of puncture wounds. All three were desperate. A naked 
intruder had broken into their home and was at that moment savaging 
their little brother and sister with a pitchfork. The girls begged 
Fuentes to get his gun and save the little ones' lives. But Fuentes 
said no. It wasn't that he was afraid to confront the intruder; with 
his rifle he could easily have dropped a pitchfork wielder. No, it 
was the government he was more terrified of. They'll take my gun away 
if I do that, he told the desperate girls, whose brother and sister 
were dying horribly at that moment. To compound the horror, the 
girls' own father, John Carpenter, had locked away the family pistol 
in obedience to California's "child-safe" storage laws. All five 
Carpenter children knew how to shoot and how to handle guns safely, 
but because their father feared the law more than he feared an armed 
intruder, they couldn't save themselves or each other.


We've all heard about the frog in the kettle. Turn the heat up under 
him gradually enough and he'll sit there until he boils to death. 
It's become the most common metaphor to describe our gradual loss of 
freedom.

We never ask, "Who's turning up the heat under us froggies?" because 
the answer is so obvious. It's government, of course. And it is.

But there's something else that's causing the heat to rise and 
freedom to evaporate into air. It's going on in all three stories 
above and in daily life around us. Call it the Quisling Effect.

Most everybody knows what a quisling is: a turncoat, a Judas, a 
Benedict Arnold. Specifically, the American Heritage Dictionary 
defines it as "a traitor who serves as the puppet of the enemy 
occupying his or her country."

The word "quisling" has a naturally slimy sound. Even if you didn't 
know what it meant, you'd know it was something unsavory, 
undesirable, or at best, something weak. Not many people realize that 
(as with martinet, sandwich, and boycott), the word came to us from a 
man's name.

Vidkun Quisling was a twentieth-century Norwegian politician and head 
of Norway's home-grown form of Nazism, the Nasjonal Samling (National 
Unity) Party. He went so far as to urge Hitler to invade his country 
in hopes of becoming Norway's supreme leader. Hitler did. And 
Quisling did -- for exactly five days. The Nazis quickly placed him 
in a figurehead position while one of their own actually ran the 
country. Within months of the war's end, Quisling got his just 
desserts. He was executed by firing squad. And a new word entered the 
dictionary, not only in English, but in many other languages.

The identification of Quisling with dirty deeds is so strong that 
when I encountered an article that mentioned humanitarian acts 
Quisling had committed in the 1920s, it was as if I'd just read, "Ted 
Bundy heroically feeds the poor in Calcutta," or "Jeffrey Dahmer 
rescues kitten from burning building."

But maybe Bundy did send a few bucks to Mother Teresa. And Dahmer, by 
many accounts, wasn't entirely a horrible guy, aside from that 
inconvenient penchant for murdering and eating his lovers. And yes, 
before he entered the dictionary so odiously, Quisling was actually a 
respected man.

Even the blackest of us is not all black. And it doesn't take a long 
look into our own hearts to admit that the whitest of us look more 
like the pile of laundry that was washed 10 times in Brand X than the 
pile that was laundered with the good stuff in the old commercial.

In each of the three incidents that open this article, people made 
pragmatic decisions that went against their own better principles. 
They did so for all the ordinary, perfectly excusable daily reasons 
-- because they feared to break the law, because it was their job, 
because they didn't want to make waves, because it was a compromise 
that got them through the day. When their actions were done only to 
obey a law, they could, with justification, claim the government 
"made" them do it.

Except in a rare tragic case like the deaths of the Carpenter 
children, the negative consequences are miniscule and life goes on.

But it isn't only "the government" that is causing freedom to boil 
away around us. Though major and minor manifestations of The Quisling 
Effect, we sell out our own freedom and the freedom of our children, 
our neighbors, and our friends. Gradually. Oh, so gradually. But sell 
it we do. We are participants, willing or otherwise, in our own 
destruction.


Businesses -- those proud products of our allegedly free market -- 
also sell out freedom. And they are bigger culprits than we. 
Sometimes they do it because corporations, by their very structure 
and nature, have a lot in common with the state. As one friend of 
mine always put it, "Every corporation wants to be a government when 
it grows up." Businesses often help condition us to daily 
regimentation, to trading our privacy for perks, and to going along 
to get along. That, I suppose, is an unavoidable, unintended (?) 
consequence of the post-Industrial revolution.

But businesses increasingly manifest The Quisling Effect for the very 
same reasons we private people do: to avoid making waves, to be 
allowed to do business as usual under the eye of an ever-stronger 
state, or to appease the real or imagined demands of the 
"authorities." (In the latter case, it might be more apt to apply a 
different WWII analogy, and accuse them of The Chamberlain Effect; 
but that's another story.)

How typical is this? Your ISP meekly enables all e-mail and Web 
activity to be easily monitored by the FBI, not because the law says 
they must, but because the FBI unilaterally decrees that they should. 
Online commerce companies, led by the 800-pound mine canary eBay, 
announce that they will turn over any customer record to any law 
enforcement agent, without asking for a subpoena, search warrant, or 
even an explanation of probable cause. Saks department store sends a 
notice to charge account customers, saying it will no longer accept 
more than $350 in cash payments. Even though that amount is far, far 
below the federal government's own "suspicious" cash reporting 
limits, Saks is scared, Saks has decided to be overly cautious. Saks' 
lawyers have no doubt advised the company to prepare for a future in 
which even $400 is a sign that a loyal Saks customer is a terrorist 
or drug dealer.

Banks demand detained information about you and the origins of your 
deposits. Following 9-11, one supermarket chain, in a "patriotic" 
gesture, even turned over its entire database of customer purchasing 
records to the federal government for "anti-terrorism" records. (And 
yes, the type of food you buy and how you buy it really is part of 
the government's profiling of your terrorist potential.)

In some cases, the thousands of companies who do such things really 
are bowing to the law (even when the law isn't constitutional). But 
in most cases, they're merely complying with fishy agency 
interpretations of regulations or  cravenly, pathetically trying to 
look compliant and cooperative in general so that they themselves 
won't become targets of the FBI, IRS, or Department of Homeland 
Security.

It must have been a lot like this in Stalinist Russia. But 
nevertheless, in each case, these businesses are following their own 
momentary self interest -- just as we are when we run a background 
check or enter a caller's name in a database. In relationships with 
"security scared" businesses, your legal rights, or for that matter 
their own long-term self interest (assuming freedom is in the 
long-term interest of every private enterprise), are easy casualties.

Saks doesn't care about your freedom. Nor should it have to, in the 
best of all worlds. Its main concern is with its own survival, as it 
should be. In a free market, its survival would depend largely on how 
well it served customers. In this world, survival depends more and 
more on how well a company kowtows to regulators or law enforcers. 
And like virtually all corporations (and most individuals), Saks' 
little hive-mind will simply adapt to present conditions in whatever 
way it thinks will best ensure its own survival.

(The very concept that the federal government has a right to order 
private businesses to do anything is another matter. But we've long 
ago accepted that state of affairs as normal, however abnormal and 
unfree it really is.)

If this is the way institutions behave, then we can't expect much 
better from individuals who, no matter how much they love freedom and 
still want a nice, uncomplicated daily life. In fact, Miller 
Smithton, my gun-dealer friend, pointed out that there's even a 
corollary to The Quisling Effect in which we not only make conscious 
decisions that trade away freedom, but we begin adopting the 
psychology of the unfree in our daily lives.

For instance, Smithson told me he finds himself sneaking his 
perfectly legal machine guns from his house to his car and back so 
that his yuppie neighbors won't see him. He's not doing anything 
wrong, owning and using these machine guns. Nor is he hiding the guns 
because he's afraid his neighbors are going to steal such valuable 
stuff. He just doesn't want to cope with the almost-inevitable 
suspicion -- complete with reports to the ATF -- that being seen with 
absolutely legal weapons might bring down on him.

So, he submits. Not only in his rational choices, but in his 
attitudes and way of life.


Go back for a moment to the definition of a quisling: "a traitor who 
serves as the puppet of the enemy occupying his or her country."

If you believe that the behemoth now squatting on the banks of the 
Potomac is constitutional or in some other fashion legitimate, then 
the definition of quisling doesn't apply to anyone who bows to that 
government's will -- even when, by bowing or "complying," we diminish 
our own and our children's freedom. By those terms, the loss of 
freedom itself is "legitimate," and heaven help us all.

But if you believe that the ever-consuming, ever-growing creature now 
spreading itself across the land is, rather, an alien living off the 
traditions of freedom as it destroys its own host, if you believe 
that the security state, the surveillance state, and the control 
state are truly occupying forces that don't belong in this land and 
aren't good for it, for you, for your progeny, or for the future ... 
then clearly all who cooperate with it manifest The Quisling Effect. 
Some of us bear a large responsibility for selling our own freedom. 
Some a lot less. But hardly anybody walks among us who isn't 
responsible in some way for cooperating with the freedom-consuming 
occupier.

Unfortunately, there's no solution -- for the moment, at least. There 
is no incentive for your banker or your ISP to stand up and say, 
"Hey, wait a minute, this is wrong and we're going to fight it." And 
for both businesses and individuals, there is almost no motivation, 
beyond sheer stubbornness and increasingly archaic principles, to do 
anything else but comply.

If froggie is getting hotter in the pot, government is ultimately at 
fault. If froggie stays in the pot instead of jumping out, froggie is 
also responsible. But with millions of quisling froggies out there 
helping turn the heat up and up and up ... where, really, is the most 
sincerely freedom loving froggie to go, even if he decides to take 
the giant leap? Straight from the boiling pot into a world of hot-hot 
burners.
