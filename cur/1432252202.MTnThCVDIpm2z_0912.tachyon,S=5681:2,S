Fine. I dont know why you seem to be missing my point: being provoked into
incriminating yourself by an anonymous troll is an entirely different issue
from discussing the substance of whatever it is you happen to be doing.

I just happen to have this gut-level common sense belief that if people might
be able to use something against any given person, it's counterproductive and 
potentially dangerous to broadcast it the way you always do. Having moral
courage is one thing, playing straight into the hands of people who wish you 
ill is quite another. It's none of my business what you do, but I'll be damned
if I don't have the right to say I think you're making a mistake by talking
about it.

>something more than your "intuition"?

It's not about intuition, just reading the news and putting two and two
together. Everything I've seen about what's happening these days indicates that
law enforcement will be looking for any excuse they can find to crack down on
people they don't like. If they can keep people off planes for moronic reasons 
like reading Hayduke and Harry Potter, what else are they going to do with 
what's already on the books? It's probably just a bad case of pantscrapping
paranoia, but I still think it's better to think a few steps ahead.

If you'll look at the archives, we had this conversation a few months ago.
Nothing has changed.

>Unconstitutional nonsense.

It sure is. That's why I think (and have always openly said, here and
everywhere) we need more pro-freedom policy analysts in Washington. I've never
misrepresented myself or what I think here, even when it goes against what
passes for the conventional wisdom around here. 
 

>So, Agent Faustine, report me.

"Agent Faustine?" Are you totally out of your skull on crack? Use your reason:
if I were with the FBI I never would have bothered. What a slap in the face. Do
you always make false accusations to get out of an argument? 


>I wish I'd had your report to distribute to the group on Friday night. 
>Adding your name to the checklist of enemies would have been useful, 

Unreal.

Whatever warped interpretation you may have of me, I'm not your enemy. 
I'll bet whoever started this thread is laughing his head off about now.
