Yes.  The US civ militia knows about burying weapons and scattering
ferrous objects.  Kinda like the leprechaun story, who puts
ribbons on *all* the trees, since he agreed not to remove the
ribbon on the tree over the gold which he placed when captured.

2. they'll dig up (well, they'll hire Iraqis to dig up) whatever
they need to if the Occupation Resistance motivates them.

They will of course also use social controls, if pushed.
No right to bear arms, govt ID required for travel,
meetings must be registered with 'interim' govt,
how do you say Big Brother in arabic?
