Skeletal srchitechture discussion...


I too have been giving this some thought: especially as not exposing list 
membership.

I think a two-way broadcast repeater is the answer:

	Everyone sends to the node of their choice, the node sends to a 
broadcast repeater that knows the source, and sends to everyone else, 
after stipping any mailman specific things like tags, etc.  The down side 
to this kind of dumb repeater is in the case of outages - the repeater 
will not know (or would it? I need to look at this in postfix) what to 
forward.

I think the key is getting the incoming emails to the repeater *prior* to 
mailman intervention.
