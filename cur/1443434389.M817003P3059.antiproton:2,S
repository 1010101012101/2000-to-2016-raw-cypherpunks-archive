I've never successfully installed or used the Android APK. Without that there's very, very little point to Tox over just using Jitsi meet, especially when Jitsi's UX design and performance are so good for non-techies.

If paranoid, run JM on own domain. No Android app but works on Android mobile Chromium, which does prevent a trust issue because compiling chromium is torture and auditing it is extremely awkward thanks to the pull-in-source-during-the-build process.

Would like to see Tox work in a way compatible with my contacts, but only a small hamdful *could* use it and none of them *would*.
