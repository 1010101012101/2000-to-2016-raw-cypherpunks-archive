This is not what most people mean when they say "rich get richer." They're
talking about 1%ers or whatever. In any case, you still seem to be making
unfounded claims about the intent behind Bitcoin, when we have statements
of intent in the creator's own words. Many believe Satoshi is also rich,
Bitcoin-wise, but we don't even know for sure that they have the key to the
account or that they will ever spend that Bitcoin. Personally, I hope they
do. The creator of Bitcoin deserves to be rewarded.

My apologies. I was confused by your use of the phrase "government cash."
Government cash is fiat, but not all fiat is cash. But the cashless
societies already being proposed and implemented are fully centralized and
much easier to trace than Bitcoin, because they require bank accounts with
their concomitant "know your customer" regulations. Bitcoin doesn't make
this situation worse, and by enabling other applications on top of it,
including untraceable e-cash, will only make it better.

Can you elaborate? Does your use of quotes around the word "popular"
indicate sarcasm? My understanding was that a number of merchants had
started using a payment system that used dollars from foreign credit cards
to buy Bitcoin so that they did not have to accept the government-imposed
exchange rate. I'm definitely interested in your insights on this, since
I've never visited a country that was experiencing rampant inflation,
unless you count the US in the late '70s, about the time I was entering
grade school.

I think you overestimate the government's ability to exert control,
something many of the participants in this list have devoted their lives to
reducing. It's the whole point of Bitcoin, so it seems like you're
basically just saying "Bitcoin will fail at its mission and instead just
get coopted by the powers that be." Or maybe you think that Bitcoin is just
a reckless toy created by greedy first worlders?

It depends on what you mean by "exist." The people on this list have
created several. It seems like a major reason that none of them has taken
off has been the need for trusted third parties, something that can be
reduced or eliminated through the use of the blockchain, if not Bitcoin
itself. Bitcoin could, for example, be used as a clearing currency between
various Chaumian e-cash issuers, the same way gold used to be used as the
international clearing currency until Bretton Woods.

Indeed, something I have repeatedly ranted against. So far the regulation
has not had much impact on Bitcoin itself. No legally "tainted" or
"whitelisted" coins yet.

I'm not even sure what form outlawing Bitcoin would take in the US. I
suppose they could try to define mining or even running a full client as
operating a payment service. But that would take some backtracking after
all the regulatory efforts. Which may be a reason I should not be ranting
against regulation; it hamstring's government's ability to completely
outlaw it later.

Perhaps, but that actually seems to be the crux of what we're arguing about
here, and of many arguments on this list. What are the actual capabilities
of the adversary? You don't want to underestimate, but at the same time, if
you overestimate, you may miss a potential solution. Some are probably
living as hermits because they think they're being monitored and/or given
cancer by the smart meter mesh network. Personally, I tend to doubt that
the government's capabilities significantly exceed what's available to the
general public, except in terms of the money they're able to bring to bear,
which is blunted somewhat by the extreme inefficiency of government
contracting/spending/operations/etc.

A "litmus test" issue might be whether you think the NSA's expressed
surprise over Snowden's leaks was genuine. I tend to think it was, and that
his documents are genuine. I see no reason for the NSA to be substantially
more competent than, say, the OPM. They're each large organizations with no
bottom line that attract people of flexible moral character who are
attracted to power and/or job security. I don't think those traits tend to
lead to effective organizations, as much as a number of Hollywood movies
would like us to believe.

A kind of fun book on the OTHER side of the spectrum from what I believe
about government's capabilities is Daniel Suarez's book Influx, about a
government agency tasked with keeping technologies out of the hands of the
public. I think you'd need a pretty substantial head start before
technological advantages can overcome organizational and general human
disadvantages, though. I.e. leaks, infiltration, etc.
