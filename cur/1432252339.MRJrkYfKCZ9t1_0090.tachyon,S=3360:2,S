I have no problem with demime-ing posts, and applaud Eric's work
to maintain a readable cypherpunks node.

My only point, addressed to the fellow who sent an attachment,
is that sending such things to any cypherpunks node makes little
sense. Many of the more frequent posters now use the lne.com node,
so we'll never see your attachment. And, depending on where the
message enters the system, others may not either.
