I can understand a cautionary approach to Tor at a time when attacks
are evident - see some of my past humming and hawing about this sort
of subject (where I am posting as ABISprotocol) in an OB thread here:
https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/866
But in the end despite the (vulnerabilities relating to Tor / I2P use)
at that time I didn't conclude people should stop using it, just that
they should be careful about it and be aware of the limitations of the
software.

This particular e-mail ('IBM Advises Businesses To Block Tor') caught
my eye and seemed rather odd, because in the not-so-distant past, IBM
and Microsoft were actually studying (and even promoting) certain
types of anonymity solutions. To wit:

Direct Anonymous Attestation
http://www.zurich.ibm.com/security/daa/
"As...profiling is privacy invasive, we have proposed a way to use
direct anonymous attestation such that the detection of rogue TPMs and
actually granting/requesting the access are performed in two different
unlinkable transactions..."
(Gee, IBM, isn't that, like, the evil anonymity stuff?)

Idemix / Identity Mixer
http://www.zurich.ibm.com/idemix/

These above two links were mentioned / highlighted last year by
Microsoft staff at the W3C 'Web Cryptography Next Steps' event which I
attended and had a position paper accepted at:
http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/webcrypto-next-workshop/report.html

While I've never trusted Microsoft Windows (much) - having left that
platform long ago for the comfort of Linux - it does seem rather odd
that they would state (as they did in their recent article) that
"Corporate networks really have little choice but to block
communications to these stealthy networks."  You have to wonder who is
the desperate fail person who authored that conclusion to their recent
article.*
