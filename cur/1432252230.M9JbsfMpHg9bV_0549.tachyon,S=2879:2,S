Define "usual"? And explain why that matters.

We are discussing low-yield, non-optimized, basement nukes. Little Boy 
was a gun device, firing a wedge (of some fraction...) into the other 
piece (sphere minus wedge, other half, whatever).

I hate spending cycles on nuke design. See many books--Smythe Report, 
Ted Taylor's articles, The Progressive, etc.--on issues. The Little Boy 
design was publicized in the 40s.
