Ahhhh...I need a cigarette.

But I suspect it's far more likely that some large batch of USA-ians will 
end up having a surprise meeting with Allah as the result of a big ole 
stinky dirty bomb. And with Iraq II we'll have an endless supply of suicide 
bombers ready to deliver. The only drawback is that there's a solid chance 
it'll be set off a few hundred feet from where I work.

Ah well. Dems da breaks. We had a good run.
