	The kid who fired was not a Cop. He was (near as I understand)
the rough equivalent of a National Guardsman.

	No Jim, the primary responsibility of a Police Officer is to 
enforce the law, which really isn't relevant in this case, since the 
shooter apparently wasn't a cop. He was a soldier. 

	And what is the primary responsibility of a soldier? Well, 
in Basic Training I was informed that my basic task was to seek out
the enemy and destroy him. 

	Which is why using Soldiers in peace keeping missions is a 
really, really boneheaded move. 

>This guy is a laugh riot.  Where does he dig this stuff up?  What a moron.

	Tim calls it "Choatien Prime".
