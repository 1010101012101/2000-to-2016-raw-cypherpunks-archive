well, certainly some thinkpads have encryption of the hard drive; if you 
take the hard drive out and try to read it on another system, you find 
the drive contains garbage - if and only if you have a bios and startup 
password set. the same password is used for both startup access and 
drive encryption.
I suspect it is more that they are looking for a reason to block this 
sale, and this is the first one they thought of. exactly why they would 
like to do this is beyond me - possibly MS would like IBM to still be 
tied to them by Windows contracts, or possibly just someone in 
government doesn't like the idea of "THE IBM PC" being a chinese company.
