It's clear from Syverson's writing that he has a devious sense of humor.
And that he gets off on being clever. So I consider it possible that he
was just fucking with them. It amuses me.

But anyway, it's pointless to argue about people's motivations. What we
have now is Tor. Do we ignore it, or make the best of it?

I say that it's better than nothing. You disagree. So it goes.

Whoever controls Tor Project is misrepresenting it. We agree on that.

What we disagree about is how badly they are misrepresenting it.

So tell me again, what would you have people use instead of Tor?

Same question. What to use, if not Tor? Nothing? How is that better?

Huh?
