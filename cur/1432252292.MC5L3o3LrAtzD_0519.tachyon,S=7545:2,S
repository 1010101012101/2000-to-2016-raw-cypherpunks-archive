??? Plan 9 was released Open Source in 2000. Prior to that it had a weird
'no commercial use' clauses. It apparently was intended as a internal use
only project. Forces both internal and external began fighting for the
release of the Rev. 2 code (which turns out can't be done) so instead Pike
and the others created a Rev. 3. They are now working on what is called
the "2000 Release". Haven't had a chance to try it yet.

> How about its external use track record?

None, see commentary above. I've been an avid follower of Plan 9 since '86
when the first papers started to appear. It's current state with respect
to apps is about where Linux was in '92. With respect to the code, it
works and works well. The fathers of Unix did as good a job here as well.

Read Lessigs "Code".

Meaning that through your I/O server you see an effective pool of many
processors on which you can then use to execute your programs. It means
that the filesystem components that appear 'local' may actually not be. It
means that things like backups and such can be left to the filesystem to
take care of 'under the covers' so to speak.

Transitive means that A mounts B, C mounts A and gets B free. Plan 9 does
this, managed by a set of authorization layers for fine control, native.
This means that when Hangar 18 goes online you can mount /hangar18 into
your filespace (via Plan 9 or Linux NFS services) and you will get all the
resources that Hangar 18 mounts through that point. ftp is a good example.
In Plan 9 you 'mount' the ftp server to your file system. If you ever go
out and walk that part of the file space tree and request a file it only
then goes and gets it. You can control its lifetime (to manage disk space
for example) via local cache controls. A 'lazy update' mechanism, very
efficient of network and local resources.

Irrelvant comparison.

You can build a journaled filesystem layer onto Plan 9 through scripts
that define how the various servers are supposed to journal the
individual compnents.

The network layer. The traffic between any two Plan 9 boxes is encrypted
with keys dependent upon the individual boxes (or larger classes if you
desire) if the system is so configured. You can also use this to encrypt
branches of your filesystem. Plan 9 provides SSH.

However the resource owner choses. I'm using 'small worlds network' models
for my 'web of trust'...

But the passwords don't go across the network, therefore they're not
'used' in the conventional sense.

It should be, X Windows sucks.

Another OS, intended for real-time control of "Internet Appliances". You
run it along side Plan 9.
