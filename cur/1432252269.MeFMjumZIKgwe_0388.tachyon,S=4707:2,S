If the government put me in charge of subverting the remailer network, I
think the first thing I would do is round myself up a couple of 
"cypherpunks" (with anti-government, fuck-the-law attitudes) to gain the
respect of the operators of the most stable and popular remailers, and 
assume control of the remailer software development, infiltrating every 
node at the source.

Proposing that the remailer network would benefit more from 10 reliable,
properly configured and legally secure remailers than 50 "mosquito
remailers" is a pure statement of fact. Mix-nets need stable nodes. You're
welcome to design a different system that allows anonymous messages to be
transmitted through short-lived temporary nodes, but I doubt it will be
anything like what we're using now.

The best way to ensure the mix-net is going to protect you is for you to
run a remailer. (Better yet, write your own remailer software). The
remailer network should never become an "old boy's club." Anyone with the
ability to maintain a stable remailer must be permitted to join.

Government involvement isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd happily include 
both a remailer run by Hamas and a remailer run my the Mossad in my 
remailer chains.
