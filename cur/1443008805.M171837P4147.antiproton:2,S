truly Classic Coke a recipe well loved and made verboten none the less.

"Real SDR" will become illegal; no longer exist.

"Consumer SDR" will eat the binary blobs of emission compliant
crippled chipsludge.

"Test Equipment" again a popular category. like "water pipe" where you
used to put your bong, you'll not dare ask about amplified front-ends
or frequency focused antennas attendant with your ADC/DAC test device
- your lab is already stocked!
