The tax thieves often ignore "moving." Americans who leave the U.S. 
and take their assets with them are liable for U.S. taxes for a 
decade or so after leaving (over the $70K or so waiver at the low 
end).

California taxpayer-units who move to Nevada or Florida find 
California attempting to tax their pensions.

I know of a guy who founded a software company, sold out, and moved 
to Switzerland. California is still trying to tax him.

If Hughes decamps from L.A., which is possible, for multiple reasons, 
expect the tax grabbers to keep after them.
