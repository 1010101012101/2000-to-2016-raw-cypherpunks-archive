What?
A pirate radio station in the Carribean is jamming broadcasts in New 
Orleans? I find that hard to believe.

>September 2, 2005 -- Who is jamming communications in New Orleans? Ham

>UPDATE: We can now report that the jamming of New Orleans'

>Caribbean. The noise is continuous and it is jamming frequencies,
>including emergency high frequency (HF) radios, in the New Orleans
>area. The radio frequency jammers were heard last night, stopped for a
>while, and are active again today. The Pentagon must locate the
>positions of these transmitters and order the Air Force to bomb them

>However, we now have a new unconfirmed report that the culprit may be

>jammer that is operating south southwest of New Orleans on board a U.S.
>Navy ship, according to an anonymous source. The jamming is
>cross-spectrum and interfering with superheterodyne receiver
>components, including the emergency radios being used in New Orleans
>relief efforts. The jammed frequencies are:
>
>72.0MHZ   (high end of Channel 4 WWL TV New Orleans)
>45.0MHZ    (fixed mobile)
>10.245MHZ  (fixed mobile)
>10.240 Mhz   (fixed mobile)
>11.340 Mhz  (aeronautical mobile)
>233 MHZ  (fixed mobile)
>455 IF  (jammer)
>
>A former DoD source says the U.S. Army uses a portable jammer, known
>as WORLOCK, in Iraq and this jammer may be similar to the one that is
>jamming the emergency frequencies.

>UPDATE Sep. 3 -- A Vancouver, British Columbia Urban Search & Rescue
>Team deployed to New Orleans reported that their satellite phones were
>not working and they had to obtain other satellite phones to keep in
>touch with their headquarters and other emergency agencies in British
>Columbia.

>There is a report on a ham radio web site that jamming is adversely
>affecting the New Orleans emergency net on 14.265 Mhz.

>If a U.S. Navy ship is, in fact, jamming New Orleans communications,
