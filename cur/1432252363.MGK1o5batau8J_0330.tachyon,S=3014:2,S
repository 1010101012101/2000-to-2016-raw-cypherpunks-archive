[I'm seeing a *large* number of messages yesterday 
and today which apparently have sat on some spool 
for around 2 weeks. In some cases, responses to 
these messages got through rapidly, but the original 
did not.]

Last weekend, someone spammed the DeCSS code to all or most
of the the comp.* usenet newsgroups. Deja has already removed all
of the original posts, but not messages which quote the original - for
example, the post noting this as a spam event contains the entire
source, and is still up. 

[It's possible that the posting had an x-no-archive header, but I doubt
it]
