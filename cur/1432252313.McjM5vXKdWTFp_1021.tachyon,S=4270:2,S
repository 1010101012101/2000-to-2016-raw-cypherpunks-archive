Actually, it's used for whatever the client wants: there's nothing in the 
technology that prevents it from being applied to private e-mail accounts, 
or searching all the hard drives on a network. About the "no expectation of 
privacy in a public place" angle: do you really think two people talking 
solely to each other on IRC expect their throwaway comments to be 
monitored, logged, and made part of some lame marketing presentation? Once 
people know the technical capacity is there for that to happen, that's one 
thing. But otherwise it hardly seems right.

Of course you're right, no one can expect to be handed privacy on a 
platter. How do you feel about web bugs and cookies--if it's part of the 
private sector, anything goes?

I don't think legislation is the answer--educating people so they can take 
care of themselves makes sense to me. Hence my two cents about Private-
sector Echelon.
