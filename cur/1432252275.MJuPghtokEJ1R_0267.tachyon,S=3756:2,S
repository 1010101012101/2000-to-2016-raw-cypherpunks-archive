A friend of mine recently informed me that he has access to a mag-strip
reader, and scanned several drivers' licenses (as well as Safeway cards
and other random credit-card like items.)

Most contained the information displayed on the front of the card, and/or
some seemingly random numbers (most likely, the ID numbers.)

California DL's have nothing interesting stored in that magstrip that
isn't on the front of the card. And no, the signature isn't reflected in
the magstrip.
