What can I say? You clearly don't understand:

-- how remailer _networks_ work (Hint: nested encryption...all the first 
remailer sees when he opens a message is an encrypted message he can't 
read and instructions on which remailer to send it to next, and so on. 
Only if most/all remailers collaborate can the route be followed by 
them.)

-- how Freedom works (Hint: They say that even they cannot know who is 
using it, except in terms of network usage. Which with cover traffic, 
forwarding of other traffic, dummy messages, etc., means the fact that 
Alice was using the network during a period of time does not mean they 
know which exit messages are hers.)

-- blinding. (Hint: That Alice deposits money into a digital bank, and 
is identified by the bank, does not mean the bank knows who received 
digital money from Alice, because Alice unblinds the note before 
spending it--or redeeming it.)

You have several times attempted to corral me into your "which markets 
are moral, which do we focus on?" point.

I only cited several obvious examples (discussed _many_ times here, 
e.g., the distribution of birth control info in Islamic countries, e.g., 
dissidents in a corrupt regime (ZOG), etc.) because some of the 
newcomers seem so unimaginative and ill-informed that they were whining 
about how untraceability only helps criminals, perverts, and terrrorists.

This does _not_ mean I have issued any kind of call for people to work 
on "moral" uses, and I wish you would stop using my name in support of 
your moral crusade.

One man's supplier of the herb is another man's drug dealer. One man's 
erotica creator is another man's pervert. One man's freedom fighter is 
another man's terrorist. These are all obvious points discussed many 
hundreds of times on this list.

It means the markets are further out from the "dollar ghetto" than many 
people think. And the further out from the origin (0,0), the more heated 
the debate becomes about terrorists, perverts, tax evaders, and so on.

How about McVeigh? How about The Real IRA? How about John Brown? How 
about Patrick Henry/ How about Cuban exiles? (By the way, everyone 
should know about the time an anti-Castro group blew up a Cuban 
airliner. Terrorists, freedom fighters, or just a bunch who wants to be 
in control?)

I spoke of dissident-grade untraceability, identical to pedophile-grade 
untraceability. Not to support either dissdents or pedophiles, but to 
provide a handle on just how good this untraceability must be so as to 
protect dissidents from arrest and execution and pedophiles from arrest 
and imprisonment (or execution in Islamic regimes).

 From your words, I doubt you support the same goals I support.

In any case, please stop invoking my name in support of your "moral 
crypto" points.
