prison and a 10,000$ fine if he discloses the results of his independent 
invention a computer
security device.According to the US Commerce Dept,Davidas invention could 
become a threat to

According to the university's assistant chancellor,frank Cassell,Davida

machine that solves a big problem,the security of computers,keeping 
unauthorized persons from
getting into records.
