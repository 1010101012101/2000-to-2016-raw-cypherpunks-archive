hi,

They had been researching on this line in Indian
Institue of Science, Bangalore. I think image
searching has fundamental limits. For  successfully 
matching two images, there should be a subset of
information in both that totally match or match with a
high probability.

Expecting a front view of an image to match with a
side view of the same image is impossible. They are
both disjoint sets of information.

If all the images are frontal images, we can match
them with a hight probability, otherwise I doubt this
technology has a future.

Sarad.
