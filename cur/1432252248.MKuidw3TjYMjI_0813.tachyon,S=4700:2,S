My point was the feds didn't have to murder anybody--play them off each 
other and they do it to themselves.

Without that extra "push"? You're probably right, chances are they would 
have self-destructed sooner or later. Though it's true Mao made it work--
no matter how many in his own cadre he killed. I guess hippies waving
their little red books around in their stupid marches just wasn't
enough, huh.

Still, if you read the documentation, COINTELPRO was quite a formidable 
program. I don't see any reason why contemporary half-baked loopy radical 
groups who espouse violence should expect anything less. Especially now 
that the national security bureaucracy and their analytic institutions
are  getting "information warfare" and deception operations down to a
science. Ignore it at your own peril...
