This could be as simple as a wifi router that runs independent DHCP/XMPP/BitTorrent/etc., coordinated direct connections for file 
sharing/serving (SparkleShare, i.e. git over SSH), etc.

Or it could include peer-to-peer client wifi connections.  Or the router devices and/or portable devices could form meshes to get 
extended range and more of an internet/Internet.

The simple case isn't hard.  I've been thinking of doing the same thing for Burning Man: Resilient, mesh, usually disconnected, 
store and forward when disconnected, secure + public, fair, prioritized traffic, opportunistic but bulk Internet capable networking 
in harsh environments and random usage patterns.  Add store and forward to an XMPP server, plus email, some file transfer and usenet 
like flood propagation (using bittorrent protocols/methods), and you'd have a nice independent communication network.

Layer authentication / crypto, features, and applications as desired.

Stephen
