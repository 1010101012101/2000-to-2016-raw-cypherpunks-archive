Make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any US Mail problems.

When you place your order, be sure to order all 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports to save to your computer and resell them.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.  Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000’s of people who will order them from you.  Also, copy a set of the reports to floppy in case something happens to your computer.

************IMPORTANT*****************

DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or change their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will loose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested and if you alter it, it will NOT work.

Step 1:  After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in Report #5.  This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their cash.

Step 2:  Move the name & address in Report #4 down to Report #5.

Step 3:  Move the name & address in Report #3 down to Report #4.

Step 4:  Move the name & address in Report #2 down to Report #3.

Step 5:  Move the name & address in Report #1 down to Report #2.

Step 6:  Insert YOUR name & address in the Report #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name & address accurately!!!


To assist you with marketing your business on the Internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more!
There are two primary methods to get this venture going:

=======================================================================
METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

Let’s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.  And we will assume that you and those who join you send out only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let’s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better, but let’s just say it’s only 0.2%.  Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails with a 0.2% response.  That equals only 10 orders for Report #1 (That’s $50).  Those 10 people who order Report #1, each send out 5,000 e-mails for a grand total of 50,000 e-mails.  If only 0.2% respond with orders, you get 100 orders for report #2 (That’s $500).  Those 100 who order Report #2 from you each send out 5,000 e-mails for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  With a 0.2% response, you will receive 1000 order for Report #3(That’s $5,000).  The 1000 people who order Report #3 from you send out 5,000 e-mails each generating a total of 5 million e-mails.  With a 0.2% response, you would receive 10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50 million (50,000,000) e-mails.  At a response rate of 0.2% this will generate 100,000 orders for Report #5 to you (or $500,000).

Your income in this example would be:

Report #1                         50.00
Report #2                       500.00
Report #3                    5,000.00
Report #4                  50,000.00
Report #5                500,000.00
Total                      $555,550.00

The numbers don’t lie.  Get a pencil & paper or calculator and figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you WILL make a lot of money!!!

REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE OUT OF 5,000 EMAILS YOU SEND ORDER.

======================================================================
METHOD #2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response.  We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add Method #2 as you go along.  For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report the ordered.  That’s it.  Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with YOUR name on it, will be prompt.  And, they can’t advertise until they receive the report.

******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES******

Follow these rules of thumb to ensure your success:

* If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
* After your first 10 orders, you should receive 100 or more orders for Report #2 within 2 to 3 weeks.  If not, continue sending e-mails and advertising until you do.
* Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, you can RELAX.  The system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll-in.

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER!

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are being associated with a DIFFERENT report.  You can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you.

If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again.  There is no limit to the income you can generate from this business!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TESTIMONIALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"My name is Mitchell.  My wife Jody and I live in Chicago.  I am an accountant with a major U.S. corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "Junk Mail".  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and the percentages involved.  I ‘knew’ it wouldn’t work.  Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old ‘I told you so’ on her when it didn’t work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses.  Within the next 45 days she had received a total of $147,200.00....all cash!!!  I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her ‘hobby’."

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois


"I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else....11 months passed then it luckily came again!. I did not delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.


"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.  Life is beautiful, thanks to the Internet."
