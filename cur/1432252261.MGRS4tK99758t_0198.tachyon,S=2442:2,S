So, there was a person in the audience last night with a video camera & laptop 
rig who was recording the talks into (apparently) Real format. I asked him if 
he was streaming it out live and he said "no, no decent connection from here, 
I'll put it 'up' afterwards."   I wasn't nosy (enough?) and didn't ask where. 
So does anyone know which site it might appear on?

thanks,

JeffH
