Hi Aaron,

Yeah, sorry, we've had a half-dozen people join the list and express
interest in hosting their own nodes in the last few days, and we haven't
really figured out how to deal with rapid growth.  The process is that
someone already in the grid has to create an account for you on the wiki so
you can get access to the classified info.

Give us a little bit to figure out how to handle this sudden 25% growth.
