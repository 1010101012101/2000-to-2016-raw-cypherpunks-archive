I agree with you. Being anonymous is very important here.


Privacy is something alluded to by the famous "Gentlemen do not read
other gentlemen's mail".

Secrecy is what other people cannot find out.

Anonymity (strong or not) is vastly important to secrecy.

Medical data is a great example of this. It may be private, for some
(weak) values of private, right now. Being John Doe at the doctor's 
office and paying cash, though, is vastly better in terms of 
assurance, at least until the doctor's business-cam interfaces 
with other databases. Too bad that works so poorly with insurance, 
but then worker insurance in the US is nearly a government program, 
anyway.
