An upcoming issue of Time Magazine is titled "Rise of the Drones" and  
juxtaposes a low-flying Predator over a suburban American home.

Time (Feb 11) - "Drone Home" by Lev Grossman:

HT @MaryMad, who took umbrage at Chris Anderson's "don't worry be droned" 
article (emphasis mine), also in this issue.

I wanted to take a moment to explain how Mr. Anderson is attempting to  
take some liberties with the history of computation here.  The concept and 
prototype of personal computers first emerged in the late 1960's amongst a 
small group of academics and innovators on the west coast, so I'm not 
really sure how folks could have had a more open-minded view about the 
potential uses of computers at that time.  Up to that time and into the 
mid-70's computers took the form of bulky mainframes and mini-computers, 
only accessible to government agencies and very large corporations.  I 
myself have not encountered much in the literature that talks about people 
fearing computers in the 1960s, other than some amusing IBM public 
relations efforts.  So I can only conclude that Mr. Anderson has 
constructed a straw man through unsourced assertions.  For facts, I 
recommend reading about the emergence of the idea and implementation of 
personal computers in John Markoff's _What the Dormouse Said: How Sixties 
Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry_:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said

And as @MaryMad said, someone should remind Mr. Anderson that computers  
*have* proven remarkably good at spying on us.  I suppose we could be  
gracious and say the qualification "that computers would be used  
*primarily* to spy on us" let's him off the hook, but I'm afraid this  
article is too obviously biased by Mr. Anderson's desire to service and  
profit from the DIY drone community through his company 3D Robotics.
