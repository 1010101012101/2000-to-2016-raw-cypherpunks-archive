Don't forget the copy of the Koran they found when the ninjas raided 
his house. That alone justified the holding without charges, without 
bail, without access to a lawyer. Habeas Corpus never recovered from 
that creep Lincoln's attacks..it was good the fucker got offed.

Gee, I also have a beard, and a copy of the Koran, and I lived in 
Hillsboro, Oregon. I hope the Fedz never learn that I have ricin and 
sarin formulas on my computer, sarin ingredients in my kitchen, that I 
know Steve McGeady from the Hackers Conference, and that I once worked 
with Jim Bell when we were both at that hotbed of terrorist plotting, 
Intel Corp.
