Magicians lottery list accurate

THE American illusionist David Copperfield said yesterday he has been
bombarded by requests for tips on the winning numbers in Germanys
national lottery on Saturday night - numbers he said he predicted seven
months ago.

Copperfield wrote down his forecast on 17 February for the multi-million
mark lottery drawing due on 13 October. The prediction was sealed by a
notary and locked in a box that was kept under round-the-clock
surveillance.

An hour after the winning numbers were drawn, the box was opened on a
live television broadcast and the numbers matched the winning draw: 2,
9, 10, 15, 25, 38 and 4.

"It wasnt a trick," Copperfield told Bild am Sonntag newspaper after
the performance on the popular Wanna Bet? show on ZDF television. "It
was more an experiment and mental exercise. We only use about 10 per
cent of our brain capacity."

Copperfield said he is not tempted to play the lottery himself because
he would not be able to "see" the numbers. "I used to try it out by
giving friends the numbers, but then it would never work," he said. "If
the numbers arent kept secret, it doesnt work."

Copperfield said hundreds of people had written him since February
begging him for tips on what numbers to pick. "Hundreds of emails, so
many letters and requests from people in despair. " 



But can he do RSA keys ?

If he can, that would mean that they are truly random.

If he can't they are not.

This test should become a part of Diehard.
