>"--Disney Channel cartoon portrays music downloads as evil
The Disney Channel cartoon series The Proud Family
(http://disney.go.com/disneychannel/zoogdisney/shows/proudfamily/index_main.html)aired an episode on Oct. 5 entitled EZ Jackster. In the storyline, EZ
Jackster is a Napster-like site, and the show's little heroines
get addicted to the service and play a part in the downfall of the music
industry. Disney is one of the backers of the SSSCA proposed legislation
that is scheduled for a hearing before Congress Oct. 25.

If someone had the presence of mind to capture this to .mpg and post it on one of the popular P2P sites it could make for a good laugh when it gets reworked to have a more plausible ending.
