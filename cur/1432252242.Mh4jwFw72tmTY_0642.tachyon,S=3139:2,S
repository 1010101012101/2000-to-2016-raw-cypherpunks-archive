I'd like to.  But bouncing the mail will mean that
I have to send 100 bounces and process 100 bounces back, since
few spammers use real mail addresses and most of those are
already over quota or rejecting mail.  So it won't save me
much traffic and I'll have to add a hack for dumping
the bounce bounces...

I don't think I can do an SMTP error message since its
getting handled in procmail, after the body is accepted.


If I can't filter better than 50% of the non-subscriber spam without
filtering some real non-subscriber posts, I'll probably try the bounce
message thing.  OTOH, the way I review non-subscriber mails after this
change lets me see the sender name and subject without looking at the
mail like I did before, so it may turn out that it's fast enough for me
to review that I don't need to do any filtering at all.


Oh, and before Peter asks, next time I mess with it, I'll make
messages with the appropriate X-approved header go through without
human intervention.
