	I should have written "supposedly wants", and yes, 'overthrow'
	is too strong I guess. But even assuming satoshi isn't too
	anti-establishment, direct cooperation with the
	police seems out of character?

	I'm not sure how that would work. At the moment the baking
	mafia does launder money for various criminals, but they do it
	secretly. I'm not sure how the fact that all bitcoin
	transactions are public and potentially traceable would help.

	On the other hand, if the banking mafia somehow 'adopted'
	bitcoin, then financial control and oppression would be greatly
	increased, since, again, all transactions are public.

	Well, I partially share the feeling although I don't think
	there's something intrinsically wrong with private property and
	markets. What about Kropotkin and Bakunin - were they 'middle
	class'? =P
