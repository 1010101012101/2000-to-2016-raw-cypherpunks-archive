So...
how many people does one have to terrorize in order to be a terrorist?

PS: Anyone else getting tired of the term "terror"? Back when we all hated 
Osama bin Laden (remember that guy?) Osama was promoted from "Terrorist" to 
"terror mastermind" to "lord of terror" and so on. I'm sick of being told 
I'm some sniveling lil' bitch that needs protecting. Right now I am 3 blocks 
from the "Hole of Death" and if I stand up and look out that window I can 
see what will likely be the next "ground zero", but I'm not scared per se 
(granted, it would SUCK to die in a giant pile of collapsing rubble or 
crashing-and-bleeding due to a dirty bomb).

Can't we just call the "terrorists" our "enemies" like back in the good old 
days?
