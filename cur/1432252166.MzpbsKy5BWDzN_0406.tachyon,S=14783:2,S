          THE WHITE HOUSE



                          Office of the Press Secretary



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                      January 21, 2003



             New White House Office Coordinates Global Communications



Why?
The President understands the importance of conveying America



's message to the
world. Better coordination of our international communications will help convey
the truth about America and the goals we share with people everywhere. He knows
we need to communicate our policies and values to the world ? with greater
clarity and through dialogue with emerging voices around the globe. Created by
Executive Order of the President, this new office within the White House
coordinates strategic communications with global audiences, integrating the
President's themes into new and ongoing programs.


The New Office of Global Communications
The Office of Global Communications (OGC) advises on the strategic 
direction and
themes that United States government agencies use to reach foreign audiences.
The Office assists in the development of communications programs that
disseminate truthful, accurate, and effective messages about the American 
people
and their government. With State Department Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs
remaining at the frontlines of international communications, Global
Communications coordinates the work of many agencies and Americans to convey a
few simple but powerful messages. These will be aimed to prevent
misunderstanding and conflict, build support for and among United States
coalition partners, and better inform international audiences.

Lessons learned from the temporary Coalition Information Centers (CIC) have 
been
applied to the new Office. Created to react to our adversaries' misinformation,
CIC quickly proved that White House-led efforts could facilitate strategic,
proactive communications in the war on terror. Last year's focus on the
liberation of women in Afghanistan is a prime example. Working closely with the
communications office of the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, Global Communications recently coordinated communications about the
Administration's Ramadan activity and the President's views on Islam.
Recognizing the value of remotely deployed coalition information centers, the
President has authorized the new Office to coordinate with the appropriate
agencies the creation of teams of communicators to work in areas of intense
global media interest. No such team is currently operating, but OGC is 
organized
to move swiftly in cooperation with other US government agencies and coalition
partners.


America's Message to the World
This  new office assists the President in communicating his message to the 
world
-- dignity, security and liberty for all people, everywhere. The 
"non-negotiable
demands  of  human  dignity" and the National Security Strategy's focus on 
peace
and  freedom  are US Government policy, but they are also universal 
aspirations.
As such, they provide a framework for more listening and greater dialogue 
around
the  globe,  and  a  framework  in  which  OGC  will coordinate a variety 
of new
efforts.

As  the President says, we value the dignity of all human life. Family, 
learning
and  generosity,  both  here  at  home  and  around  the  world,  are 
central to
prosperity and peace for all.

Meanwhile,  for  security's  sake,  we  seek  to defend, preserve and 
extend the
peace.  The  President's strategy makes clear that peace is defended by 
fighting
terror  and  tyranny. Peace is preserved with good relations among great 
powers.
And peace is extended by encouraging free and open societies.

And  America  must  always  stand  for liberty. As the President plainly 
states,
freedom is God's gift to every single person. Freedom is also the one true 
model
for  national  success.  Different  circumstances require different methods 
? we
help  societies  so  they can choose for themselves the rewards of 
political and
economic freedom.


New Initiatives
The President understands that reaching global audiences ? especially 
people who
are open to the truth but unsure or critical of some aspects of America ? will
take many years, but we must begin to make a difference now.

OGC coordination efforts focus on 1) daily messages, 2) communications 
planning,
and 3) long-term strategy.

1. OGC produces The Global Messenger, a one-page fact sheet sent world-wide to
disseminate key points and daily activities on global issues. OGC leads a daily
conference call of Administration leaders to coordinate near-term and mid-range
communications planning. The office also works closely with the State and
Defense Departments to ensure rapid response to allegations and rumors in the
war on terror.

2. The new office coordinated themes and events to support the President's
successful drive for Congressional and U.N. support for disarming Saddam
Hussein. OGC is coordinating efforts to reveal the disinformation and 
propaganda
of the Iraqi regime, including the publication of Apparatus of Lies: Saddam's
Disinformation and Propaganda, 1990-2003. Working closely with the Pentagon and
all relevant agencies, OGC is coordinating the launch of new reconstruction
initiatives in Afghanistan. Also, from time to time, OGC facilitates the
organization of teams of communicators to be sent proactively to foreign or
domestic areas of high global interest and media attention. For example, one
such team worked with the international media gathered in Kabul, 
Afghanistan for
the Loya Jirga. This effort underscored the ongoing US and coalition commitment
to rebuilding the country and restoring liberty.


3. OGC will coordinate government-wide efforts to convey America's message to
the world by improving communications about US humanitarian and pro-democracy
efforts. Drawing on the President's outreach to Arab and Muslim audiences, OGC
is working closely with the State Department to increase our interaction with
existing pan-Arab news media. Also, the Office is studying new ways to reach
Muslim audiences directly via US-supported broadcasting.

      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and 
the laws
of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

      Section 1.  Establishment of the Office of Global 
Communications.  There is
hereby established within the White House Office an Office of Global
Communications (the "Office") to be headed by a Deputy Assistant to the
President for Global Communications.

      Sec. 2.  Mission.  The mission of the Office shall be to advise the
President, the heads of appropriate offices within the Executive Office of the
President, and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) on
utilization of the most effective means for the United States Government to
ensure consistency in messages that will promote the interests of the United
States abroad, prevent misunderstanding, build support for and among coalition
partners of the United States, and inform international audiences.  The Office
shall provide such advice on activities in which the role of the United States
Government is apparent or publicly acknowledged.

      Sec. 3.  Functions.  In carrying out its mission:

      (a)  The Office shall assess the methods and strategies used by the 
United
States Government (other than special activities as defined in Executive Order
12333 of December 4, 1981) to deliver information to audiences abroad.  The
Office shall coordinate the formulation among appropriate agencies of messages
that reflect the strategic communications framework and priorities of the 
United
States, and shall facilitate the development of a strategy among the 
appropriate
agencies to effectively communicate such messages.

      (b)  The Office shall work with the policy and communi-cations offices of
agencies in developing a strategy for
disseminating truthful, accurate, and effective messages about the United
States, its Government and policies, and the American people and culture.  The
Office may, after consulting with the Department of State and obtaining the
approval of the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs on the
President's behalf, work with cooperating foreign governments in the
develop-ment of the strategy.  In performing its work, the Office shall
coordinate closely and regularly with the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs, or the Assistant's designee.

      (c)  The Office shall work with appropriate agencies to coordinate the
creation of temporary teams of communicators for short-term placement in areas
of high global interest and media attention as determined by the Office.  Team
members shall include personnel from agencies to the extent permitted by law

                                  more

                                                    (OVER)
                                  2

and subject to the availability of personnel.  In performing its functions, 
each
information team shall work to disseminate accurate and timely information 
about
topics of interest to the on-site news media, and assist media personnel in
obtaining access to information, individuals, and events that reinforce the
strategic communications objectives of the United States and its allies.  The
Office shall coordinate when and where information teams should be deployed;
provided, however, no information team shall be deployed abroad without prior
consultation with the Department of State and the Department of Defense, and
prior notification to the Office of the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs.

      (d)  The Office shall encourage the use of state-of-the-art media and
technology and shall advise the United States Government of events,
technologies, and other communications tools that may be available for use in
conveying information.

      Sec. 4.  Administration.  The Office of Administration within the 
Executive
Office of the President shall provide the Office with administrative and 
related
support, to the extent
permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropria-tions, as 
directed
by the Chief of Staff to the President to carry out the provisions of this
order.

      Sec. 5.  Relationship to Other Interagency Coordinating Mechanisms.
Presidential direction regarding National Security Council-related mechanisms
for coordination of national security policy shall apply with respect to the
Office in the same manner as it applies with respect to other elements of the
White House Office.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect any function assigned by law or by the President to the
National Security Council or to the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs.

      Sec. 6.  Continuing Authorities.  This order does not alter the existing
authorities of any agency.  Agencies shall assist the Deputy Assistant to the
President for Global Communications, to the extent consistent with applicable
law and direction of the President, and to the extent such assistance is
consistent with national security objectives and with the mission of such
agencies, in carrying out the Office's mission.

      Sec. 7.  General Provisions.

      (a)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by any party
against the United States, its agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its
officers or employees, or any other person.

      (b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to grant to the Office any
authority to issue direction to agencies, officers, or employees.
