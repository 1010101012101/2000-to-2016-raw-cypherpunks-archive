And this is why socialism in any form is a bad idea.  It prevents
evolution in action from culling the morons.  In the olden days these
guys would have been sabertoothed tiger fodder.

Let's face it, shit like hotmail, AOL, MSN, and their cousins are really
socialism in disguise.  They allow the morons access to what they 
shouldn't have.  They don't need to be on the net, they should be 
watching TV getting brainwashed while they enjoy their favorite pisswater
beer.
