Gee, I thought a potato was a tuber that formed from a rhizome.  You will
want to notify these folks so they can update their webpage, as well pass
the word to the references they cite.

http://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotech/potato.html

A rhizome is a somewhat elongated usually horizontal subterranean plant
stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material.  It 
produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true
root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves.

Rhizome |= root, potato |= root.
