Exactly: those weren't the groups that made the real impact when it 
actually came to getting down to business and changing policy. Blame 
MKULTRA or whatever you want, but the bottom line is that they fell apart 
(and had their members killed or put in jail) whereas groups who didn't 
espouse violence continue to this day.


And while

Without Ghandi, British policy would have taken a far different turn. 
Violence hasn't exactly been a stunning success for the IRA, has it.

Guess you totally missed what I was trying to say about the Pankhursts.

Oh come on. Address my points, don't insult me. We can get as specific as 
you like--there are too many issues here to cover them in adequate detail 
in a couple of posts.

Not Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Susan B. Anthony, Bobby Kennedy and and the 
vast majority of the people who espoused the causes you mentioned above. 
The ones who made the real difference--the ones who immediately come to 
mind every time we think of their cause--didn't espouse violence. If you 
want to talk about Che and Mao and Chairman Gonzalo, that's another story.


> What came of it? 
>>The Indians are a free country. You and blacks can vote.

Not because of the anarchists decision to espouse violence, which the point 
of the above question.

If you want to talk about tactics of anarchists today, why not draw on 
examples from other groups who espoused violence, rather than comparing 
them to groups which largely used peaceful tactics. Apples and oranges.

After Rodney King? the LAPD scandal? Abner Louima? Mumia? Patrick 
Dorismond? Not anymore. Ever see statistics on the way people perceive 
racial profiling? Maybe the "kindly cop" stereotype still holds in  
whitebread middle America, but the rest of the nation is getting a clue.

True...

Who said it did? I thought it was interesting to note how it paralells 
quite a few different cases today. Anyway, I certainly think it's more 
relevant to the effects of the tactics of anarchism than bringing up 
Ghandi. 


> Ouch. There's a real lesson there!
>Yeah, you need to study history more.

Who doesn't? Anyway, I wasn't bringing it up to score debate points or some 
childish thing like that, why counter it that way. Too bad you didnt see 
anything interesting there-- I really do think it's really worth 
considering, especially in light of the whole "counterterrorist mania".

 

>You're trying to sit on the fence and at the same time stand on both
sides.

Not really, it's a complex set of issues. Why don't you say a little more 
in detail about why "spirit" is a more central issue than tactics, that 
ought to be interesting.
