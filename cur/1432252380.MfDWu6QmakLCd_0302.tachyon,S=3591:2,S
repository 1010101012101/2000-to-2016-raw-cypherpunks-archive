I thought this paper might be of interest, which lends further support to
what Tim said. The gist, as I'm sure most of you know, is that people
compete to be heard and seek to validate their personal choices. This is why
MOST books on Amazon have 5-star reviews.

I sent this to a particular ABA official as support for my contention that

impartiality. The paper was a little too mathematically-inclined for my
audience.
