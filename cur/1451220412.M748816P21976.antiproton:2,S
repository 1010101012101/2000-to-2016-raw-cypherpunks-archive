I'm not Anglo-Saxon btw. I'm from one of ex-occupied country. You know
CzechoSlovakia? So that country where Russian tanks where since 1968 and
most of intelligence was  and beaten regulary. You know totalitarianism
under Russia supervise. So IMHO some personal and family experience. In
case I should decide if to emigrate/migrate to Chicago or Leningrad
[Snkt. Petersburg], guess what I will answer? ;]
