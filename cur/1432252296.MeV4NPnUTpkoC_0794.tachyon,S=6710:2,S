Most of the genetic factors against which insurance companies _might_
discriminate are predispositions. The factors _tend_ to make one _more
susceptible_ to heart blow-outs, for instance.

Where do you draw the line between factors which the prospective insured
can control and those he cannot? If all of your grandparents died of
lung cancer, was it because they had a genetic flaw, because they smoked
three packs a day, because they lived near a coal mine, or some
combination of the above? How much responsibility for their deaths
should they shoulder?

I'm strongly suspicious of any statement that contains "It just seems
that". Every discipline from engineering to economics shows time and
again that the "obvious" conclusions are often wrong. Usually wrong, I
suspect, but I don't have numbers to back that up. <g>

In the absense of regulation, an insurance company could form by putting
a pile of money in escrow and getting some customers. Yes, the practical
need for a pile of money would shut out most people, but it would be a
lower barrier than the current regulatory mess. In a free market the
encrusting infrastructure could be blown away in one step by a single
insurer.

The individual purchasing insurance is (a) betting that he'll have needs
which cause him to draw out more than he put in, (b) concealing
information from the insurer such that he _knows_ he'll be drawing out
more than he put it, or (c) wanting or needing catastrophic coverage
even though he expects to put in more than he takes out.

Company-provided plans are a whole 'nother matter; ignore them for now.

coverage for a given malady times the expected likelihood of that
malady) had better be lower than the sum of the premiums paid, or they
won't stay in business long. Forcing an insurer to accept an
expected-high-cost customer at an "affordable" premium either drives up
the premiums for everyone, causes a reduction in services for everyone
(or a particular subgroup, but that would probably cause more trouble in
the long run), or eats into insurer's bottom line. One
expected-high-cost customer wouldn't break the insurer, but there's
never just one.
