Saudi cracks down on tailors dressing militants
By Heba Kandil

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi authorities have increased inspections at tailor
shops in a bid to stop the illegal production of military uniforms used by
al Qaeda militants bent on toppling the pro-U.S. monarchy.

Above the clatter of sewing machines, many tailors told Reuters on Wednesday
that inspectors had warned them against selling uniforms to people without a
military identification card.

"Every two weeks there is a police inspection at our shops," Indian tailor
Ulom said in his tiny shop, one of several lining Riyadh's al-Wazir street
where the bulk of uniforms are made.

"If I don't ask for IDs, I could be arrested," he says, holding his hands in
a cuffed position.

The government began restricting access to uniforms after al Qaeda
militants, in military or police gear, escalated their battle against the
government and the Western residents they regard as "infidels".

In one of the bloodiest attacks by Osama bin Laden's group, militants
masquerading as security men killed 22 civilians in a May shooting and
hostage-taking spree in the oil city of Khobar.

In November 2003, suicide bombers also got into a Riyadh housing compound by
dressing up as security forces. At least 18 people, mainly Arabs and
Muslims, were killed in that attack.

And repeating a frequent claim, al Qaeda said in an Internet publication
that some policemen had helped them kidnap U.S. engineer Paul Johnson --
whom they beheaded last week -- by providing uniforms and cars. The
government denied the report.

At least 85 civilians and police have been killed by al Qaeda, blamed for
the September 2001 attacks on U.S. cities.

DEVIANTS

The Saudi authorities say the militants often copy military costumes and
paint cars in police colours.

But some militants used to serve in the security forces and diplomats said
they often use their IDs and contacts to legally obtain props. Saleh
al-Awfi, tipped to be the new al Qaeda leader in the kingdom, was a former
Interior Ministry employee.

Mohammed, another Indian tailor, said he was happy to comply with the
government regulations because he wants to make sure he is outfitting the
"good guys" and not the "deviant faction".

"By God, it's a crime what's happening," he said as he carefully measured
green camouflage cloth.

"But we only service people with military ID cards," he added, rising from
his seat to greet a customer inspecting the boots, pistol holsters and name
badges in the window display.

Saudi forces won a major battle against the group on Friday when they shot
and killed four prominent militants, including Saudi's al Qaeda leader
Abdulaziz al-Muqrin.

Despite the government's efforts, some Saudis say anybody can buy the
costumes without the mandatory documents. The shop's provide uniforms for
cadets at military school and officers.

"Yes, there are restrictions but a trader will often forgo IDs for a
profit," said one Saudi journalist. "Buying a military outfit is as easy as
buying a can of soft drink."
