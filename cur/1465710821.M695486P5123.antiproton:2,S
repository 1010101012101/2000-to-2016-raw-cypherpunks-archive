There's a difference between cowardice and understanding that
some/many/most actions in support of liberty are
[un|counter]productive. Plus, as we age, we accumulate obligations,
some of which (marriage and children especially) are vastly
inhibitory. This is not to say that action for freedom is worthless,
but it does mean that one must be judicious in choosing those actions
which will productive and worth the risk.

It's important to realize that not all actions which are morally
legitimate are reasonable. Take for instance the writings of Richard
Slomon, who advocated for a number of (in his philosophy) morally
legitimate actions (cf "retaliatory recapture"), but who didn't
actually undertake those actions, for various reasons.
(https://thedegree.org/research/richard-r-slomon-archive/)

Lastly, one should realize that your first obligation is to yourself,
then to your [chosen] family/friends, and finally none at all to
"society", which is a construct of dubious utility, and which doesn't
exist on its own. It's not a matter of "every man for himself and
devil take the hindmost", it's a matter of "there's only so much one
can do, and the most important things come first".

Kurt
