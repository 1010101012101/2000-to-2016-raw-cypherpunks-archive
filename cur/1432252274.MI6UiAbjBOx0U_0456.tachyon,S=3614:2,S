  Iraq soldiers' phones hacked

  June 26, 2006

  MOBILE phone calls home made by British soldiers in Iraq may have been
  intercepted by insurgents, it was reported yesterday.

  Soldiers have been warned of the danger of insurgents using electronic
  equipment to intercept their calls and obtain the numbers of their family
  in the UK.

  The Ministry of Defence confirmed there was concern over reports of
  "nuisance calls" to servicemen's families.

  It played down suggestions that the calls had included death threats.

  A Territorial Army document warned that insurgents in southern Iraq had
  managed to obtain the home telephone numbers of British soldiers using
  electronic intercept devices.

  It said there had been "many instances in the last weeks of relatives and
  friends of personnel serving abroad on operations getting nuisance phone
  calls".

  The newspaper report suggested that the calls had included claims that a
  father or son serving in Iraq is dead or will soon be killed, as well as
  verbal abuse or silence.

  The Ministry of Defence said: "There have been reports of nuisance calls to
  the families of service personnel. To our knowledge, nuisance calls have
  been just that - nuisance calls.

  "We are not currently aware of any reports of anything more sinister."
