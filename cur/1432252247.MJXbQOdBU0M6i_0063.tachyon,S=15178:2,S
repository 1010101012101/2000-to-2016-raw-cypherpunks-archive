Rivkin's assessment of Kissinger's political prescience is a little missing in
facts. Kissinger didn't architect any kind of 'deal' with Vietnam: The
Vietcong chased our guys up the stairs of the ebassy to the choppers. China?
Initiated by Mao. Let's not forget Kissinger's accidental sumoning of the
Khmer Rouge and the subsequent ongoing instability in Burma.

No, Kissinger was a lucky fuckup.

> itself changed. The "tradition of long-serving senior politicians from both
> parties who were devoted to a truly national service has passed, or largely
> so." The entire system, especially as it has been transformed by the

> calculations, the need to keep powerful and vocal constituencies happy, and
> an eye on the next election." This effect, Mr. Kissinger posited, has been

>
> But Mr. Kissinger also dismissed the idea that there was ever some golden
> age for the domestic fundamentals of American foreign policy. With a wry
> smile, and a clearly bemused eye, he noted that the 1960s and '70s -- when
> he served as both national security adviser and secretary of state under
> two presidents (holding both jobs during Nixon's second term) -- were not
> "idyllic." "I thought," he said, "it was very rough."

> The dominant theme of today's Washington battles is that most of America's

>
> Mr. Kissinger agreed with the point that other nations will have to have
> scope to develop their own identities. But he pointed out that to have
> world order, "these identities need to be reconciled into some general
> consensus." An American strategy of benign neglect may, in any case, no

> relatively small transnational networks or failed states can project power
> against democratic societies with devastating consequences.

> Meanwhile, most of today's international actors, "including states,
> international organizations, and nongovernmental actors, are disenchanted
> with different aspects of the existing world order." Unfortunately, Mr.

> But, Mr. Kissinger noted, it is important to recall that the American

> independent, the U.S. could operate reasonably well in relative isolation.
> These attitudes persist. As a result, Mr. Kissinger posits, Americans have
> little patience "for a long time of foreign tension."
>
> Because of this, "presidents tend to present difficult cases, particularly

>
> Foreign policy, he emphasized, "is not something easily put on the clock."

> I glanced over his window sills, crammed with photographs of Mr. Kissinger

> and Brazil are not included."
>

> stability than that posed by states such as Nazi Germany or the Soviet
> Union. The nation-state is weakening in Europe, he observed, and has met

> States and Asia can it be found in its classic form."
