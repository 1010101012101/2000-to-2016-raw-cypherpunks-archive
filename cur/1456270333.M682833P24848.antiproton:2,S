Either that or pisscoins

The market for that appears to have fallen apart about the time
it sounded like Iran might be legitimately able to ship oil.

Otherwise, if you can't sell oil, you can make Urea from natural
gas and sell it to India with some crypto-snakeoil.

I also find it rather amusing how policies in China seem to have
more control over the price of Bitcoin than policy of the fed has
over the price of the dollar.

it's the grudge match of the century: China vs the Fed

If you are betting on gold someone out there will be happy to 
relieve you of your value.
