Ah, but since Ivan tested his superpower battlefield capabilities on 
lightly armed Afghans and lost thanks to US assistance, the Afghans' 
neighborly Pakis have come up with nukes and perhaps a few other 
devices obtained from hardup Soviet CBW researchers who are 
eager to assist the Afghans just as the US did.

Nobody would dare suggest the Slavs are looking for payback,
and have lulled the last remaining superpower into thinking bygones
are bygones, the cold war is over and done, as if thousands of
handy airliners would never become giant Stingers.
