If I remember correctly, the TCP MD5 option field was designed for 
securing BGP traffic, using the shared secret approach.


I was also thinking about "borrowing" this feature for things like 
announcement of additional features, eg. the possibility of opportunistic 
encryption, in eg. the TCP/SYNACK packets. There's space for 16 bytes of 
magic numbers.
