One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large grOup of pheno|ic secondary 
metabo|ites of p|ants that include more than 2,OOO different known 
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vessels inc|uding capillaries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.
