Meanwhile, in the USA...

still no ruling from 'government' on the matter of BART and cell /
wireless throttling or shutoff generally.

http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/proceeding/view?z=6uvc1&name=12-52

Notice the link to the proceeding is currently down, you can't see the
NLG, Public Knowledge, etc. filings. fcc.gov is up, but transition.fcc.gov
is acting funny or not available.  The Electronic Comment Filing System
(ECFS) where people go through to file things to the FCC is unavailable
totally, and fjallfoss is down, unless I've just burnt a fuse or
something.

I haven't been watching the FCC much if at all in the past year, so maybe
I just missed them moving onto a new site and I don't know what it is? 
However it appears that the FCC has temporarily lost its shit, and I want
to note here for the record I had nothing to do with it, I just noticed.

"Connecting America" is up though. :-O
https://www.fcc.gov/connecting-america

Public Knowledge (which files a lot with the FCC) hasn't posted anything
about it.  This was a story released in the last tweet that
@publicknowledge RT'd:
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/23/us-usa-security-privacy-idUSBREA0M0TI20140123

Something about the NSA.  Whatevs.

Interesting timing, the Ukraine, DC, etc.
