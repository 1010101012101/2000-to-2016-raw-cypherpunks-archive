I do not think so:  Observe CNN whitewashing Saddam.  Observe 
NBC imagining "unexpectedly strong Iraqi resistance", 
predicting that the battle of Baghdad would resemble the siege 
of Stalingrad, and observe its conspicuous failure to notice 
that the US was winning decisively in the cities.  If you 
watched NBC, then when the statue fell, you would say "Hey, 
what happened!!"

Ann coulter has been having a great time parodying the foolish
pinkos that dominate the news media.

This is a melange of infamous claims issued by the New York
Times, NBC, and CNN --- "US ofrces meet unexpected resistance"

She has been doing much the same in every column since the
statue fell.
