fair enough; my position is that this is insufficient and passes the buck.
many don't agree.

said another way: security is everyone's responsibility!
 everyone should encourage and enforce strong defaults, strong suites,
and accept no less.

(i pay bribes in bitcoin to adopt this position ;)

this is better; although perhaps more cumbersome key management wise.
good key management always cumbersome it seems!

absolutely better than storing hashed passwords.  how many people
generate long, random, unique passwords for every site?

GNet NS is locally scoped to each peer as of my understanding, so not
quite a strong global unique naming scheme.  i do believe on further
reading that Namecoin would work, and am looking at this further...
thanks for the responses and clarifications!
