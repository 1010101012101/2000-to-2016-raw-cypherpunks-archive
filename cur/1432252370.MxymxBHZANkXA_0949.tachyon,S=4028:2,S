      Well, very low frequency could be used quite easily by almost anyone, in
fact, the simplest, cheapest, most portable transmitters would use VLF and
morse code. It's something any 10 year old kid could rig, and you get
excellent propagation all over the world. Hams use VLF around campfires just
for kicks.
And if you used it in burst mode with a pre-recorded tape or digital input of
an encrypted message sent in morse -- who knows?
