A nice little rant, I must say.

BUT...there are some interesting undertones here. First and foremost, I see 
no mention of JYA being an 'anarchist', and indeed there's a slightly 
positive spin given to his efforts. The first (and lesser) implication of 
this is that NYT and its employees are smart enough after 9/11 to realize 
that their continued physical survival will depend on being fairly 
practical. A "don't look over here" approach didn't work before, and it 
won't work now.

More than that, it may indicate that the business managers at major media 
are starting to realize that they can't continue pissing off huge chunks of 
the public and still sell papers, etc.... Note the move from "Iraqi 
terrorists" to "Iraqi insurgents". Wait for them to start calling al-Sadr 
"hardline" rather than "Radical".

Wish I had some kind of punchline here, but it seems some kind of small tide 
has turned.
