Skype Trojan targets Syrian citizen journalists, activists

   By [2]Frank Smyth/Senior Adviser for Journalist Security
   The Russian manufacturer promises results. The software can be used to
   control your own or, say, a customer's computer by making it a remote
   software client. Or it could be used for spying on others.
   "BlackShades Remote Controller also provides an [3]efficient way of
   turning your machine into a surveillance/spy-device or to spy on a
   specific system," reads one line of the online product description. The
   software [4]sells online for $40 (an additional $12.60 brings premium
   support) through the Canadian E-Commerce reseller [5]paypro, and it can
   surreptitiously record keystrokes and screen views while giving the
   intruder clandestine remote access to the target computer.
   The [6]terms of service include several disclaimers. Purchasers must be
   "of legal age to use our services and are not a person barred from
   receiving services under the laws of Russia or other applicable
   jurisdiction." Purchasers must further agree to not use BlackShades to
   "harm people in any way," or "upload, post or otherwise make available
   any Content that you do not have a right to make available," or
   "provide material support or resources...to any organization(s)
   designated by the Russian government as a foreign terrorist
   organization."
   The spyware has been embedded into what looks like just one of many
   .pif video files being circulated by Syrian activists on Skype to help
   document attacks and human rights abuses by Syrian government and
   pro-government forces, according to a report [7]posted yesterday by the
   University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. North American-based forensic
   experts dissected the Trojan spyware embedded in the video file
   circulating on Skype, which ends with the extension "new_new.pif."
   The digital workings of the latest Skype Trojan are similar to those of
   a prior YouTube video Trojan that also targeted Syrian activists,
   according to a [8]report yesterday by the San Francisco-based nonprofit
   Electronic Frontier Foundation. The EFF report includes screen shots to
   help Syrian activists and other users identify the specific harmful
   files.
   Yet merely deleting the files or using anti-virus software "does not
   guarantee that your computer will be safe or secure," added EFF. The
   remote control access that BlackShades provides could allow intruders
   to install other spyware on one's computer. What's the safest bet? EFF
   suggests re-installing the computer's Operating System and changing all
   passwords to any accounts that one has logged into since the infection.
