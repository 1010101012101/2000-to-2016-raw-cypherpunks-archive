You deserve a Tim response, but that ain't my style- 

Of course the USA doesn't currently practice upholding the universal rights 
that our constitution recognizes, this is why Tim suggests that people need to 
be shot, or be fucked till dead.

And why would you think that American judicial morality and justice should be 
dependent on cost? After all it would be cheaper for the cops on a traffic 
stop to administratively just shoot you in the head for an offense then go 
through the costs and rigors of a trial.
