Leakage yes, but I think a lot of people get sick or die (eg in a 
subway attack) because of inhaling the gas phase.  Of course if you touch 
the liquid you're toast.  I'd think an alkali decontaminizing layer in the
filter would
help with the nerve agents.

Remember that *2* weeks ago some jokester flew (landed :-) an ultralight on
the Statue of Liberty?

A lot would die just from the panic.
