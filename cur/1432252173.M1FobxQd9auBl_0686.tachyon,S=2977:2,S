Ed Gerck, Eva Waskell who publishes The Bell, and 
another friend of theirs attended a recent Bay Area
Cypherpunks meeting.  Interesting people, and they
added a lot to the discussion.  Ed's ideas on certificates
and trust are different than, say, Carl Ellison's
or the X.509 mafia's or Phil Zimmermann's,
but he's not a crank, and it was good having him around.
