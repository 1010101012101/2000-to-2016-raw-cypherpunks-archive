There are at least two problems with that
0) That's what happened now, and nobody likes it :-)
1) The ballots that appear to have been misvoted, about 19000 of them,
disproportionately appear to have been for Gore, and not for Bush,
so it seriously biases the results in that district.
You could avoid this by voiding _all_ Presidential votes from the district.
2) The district itself is heavily Democrat, so voiding all their votes
doesn't fix the imbalance either.
				Thanks!
