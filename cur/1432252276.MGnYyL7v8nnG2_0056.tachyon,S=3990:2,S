Yes, it was intended as a paraphrase.

For currently illegal immigrants, you're right: the contract (the
agreement to do x work for y money is a contract, however 
informal) is illegal and so unenforceable. This leaves these 
workers open to theft by "stiffing" as you put it. 

The guest worker program will legalize these immigrants (for a 
period of time), so the contract will be legal and become 
enforceable.  Why do you think the guest worker program will
make it worse in this regard for currently illegal immigrants?  
This is the weakest objection to this program I've heard yet.

If both parties agreed and adhered to these terms, I see no
problem with any of that.  Employers and employees should be 
free to negotiate their own terms without the coercive 
interference by the State (via minimum wage, overtime, maximum 
work week, etc regulations).

See above for my answers to this.

Oh please, did you not read the last 6 words of my sentence?
"(and, obviously, that someone will pay)" means "what the 
market will bear".  Of *course* there has to be a willing buyer
to complete the transaction.
