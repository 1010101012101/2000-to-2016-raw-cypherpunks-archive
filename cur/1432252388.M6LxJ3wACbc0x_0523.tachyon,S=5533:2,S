They do it now, sans encryption. The mass distribution is what makes it
economical. If the encryption can be gateway'ed then it's useless and
doesn't raise the cost significantly.

A more useful mechanism would be to distribute the keys and appropriate
client software to spammers. What's a flat $50?...

And it has NOTHING to do with the encryption. The lack of log's is what
prevents back tracing.

No, the goal is to stop spammers.

In addition, there are aspects of remailer operation that make the
complaints about spam pretty irrelevant.

Nobody said anything about the interim processing until now. How is this
relevant to the 'free speech' aspect of requiring the use of particular
forms of encryption end-to-end.

Where's the key management mechanism to ensure the security of the traffic
in the reamiler network?

It's your problem, there are aspects of this proposal that are simply
silly, and several others that haven't been adequately explained or
examined.

You talk about decreasing the load due to spam, and don't even recognize
that you've replaced it with a whole other process. One that potentialy
could be more complicated, error prone, and expensive in time and resource
impact than the original 'problem'.

The solution to bad speech is more speech, not regulation. And don't kid
yourself that setting up such a mechanism isn't regulatory.

What algorithm are you proposing to identify plain-text? There are key
managment issues, what is your proposal for this problem? There is the
increased complication of admining the box (think of resources to support
both the remailer operation as well as the encryption - consider that
scale carefuly).

I'm in Zimbabwe and the remailer is in the US, how do I manage the keys to
enter the network in such a way that it is secure?

You need the key to get into the remailer, otherwise how does it tell the
message is encrypted? You seriosly propose sticking some static PGP header
for example will stop anyone, spammers know how to use word processors too
you know.

> Jim, do you really understand how remailer chaining works?

Yep. Apparently better than you do.

Have a nice day you pretentious butthead.
