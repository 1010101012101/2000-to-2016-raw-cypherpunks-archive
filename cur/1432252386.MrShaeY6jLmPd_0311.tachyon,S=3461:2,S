You could make giving enforceable promises an option for candidates -- 
something like "If I can't cut taxes in my first term I will eat my hat" or 
"... I'll owe everyone with a voting receipt with my name on it $100". Then 
there'd be pressure on candidates to boost their credibilty by making 
enforceable promises instead of "empty" ones. 

Secondly you could get around the problems induced by the labyrinthine checks 
and balances of the US system by tying the liability to measurable behaviors. 
The president either vetos a certain bill or fails to; a senator or 
representative either introduces a certain bill or fails to. As long as the 
bill is specifically identifiable in advance there isn't a great deal of 
wriggle room.

A third alternative is to remove the politiican from the loop. At the same 
time you vote for candidates, you vote for propositions which become law if 
approved by a majority of those voting. The problem is who gets to decide 
what's proposed. Alternatively  groups of candidates (e.g. parties) could be 
able to codify their promises as bills before the election. If a enough 
candidates who subscribed to the relevant platform get elected, then they're 
deemed to have voted for the bill already in their official capacity as 
senator or whatever.

cheers,
Tim
