Right, that's why there are so many of them out there...

Interaction between licenses for who?...

You're using a flawed model. There are three 'roles'; author, distributor,
user. Any license must interact with all three roles. The fact is that the
license doesn't effect the developer nearly as much as the distributor and
the end user. You're only looking at a single layer of interactions.

There is another aspect you're completely ignoring, unless one license
prohibits(!) use with another license the interaction (outside of "Can I
make money off it?") is nil - both for developers and users.

Utility, which license brings the maximum benefit to all three roles.

Yes, it is.

One shoe doesn't fit all.
