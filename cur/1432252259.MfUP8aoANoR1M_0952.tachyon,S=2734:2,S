What kind of argument do you think was used by the senator's colleagues
and industry lobbyists in order to defeat the proposal?

Clearly, if you had read the paper, then you would know that it is
about encryption and authentication, and only tangentially GNU-Darwin,
which is mentioned for credibility and example purposes.  One also
wonders if your assessment of the Washington events surrounding the
post-911 encryption proposals is complete or accurate.  It appears to me
that the White House was unwilling to expend political capital on the
authentication schemes of the profiteers, which were contrary to the
national security interests.  Presumably the congress was swayed by
similar arguments in the days following the 911 attacks.
