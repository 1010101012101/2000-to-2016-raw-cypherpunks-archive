Because the buyers of certificates have a different model of what they are
buying.  They neither know, nor can they care, because they do not know,
about the subtle "protocols" published over the last twenty-five years that
supposedly, if executed carefully, provide certain "guarantees".  No.  The
customers know that to get stuff they want, such as permission to put the
label "Your credit card information is secure.  We use Thawte Certificates,
Thawte, the Guarantor, your Rock of Assurance." on their PAY HERE NOW web
page, they must buy a certificate from Thawte, and not from Captain Gull
Enterprises, Division of Certificates.  The customer knows that crypto is
subtle, and only a well known large corporation can be trusted.  After all,
they have the resources, and the name, and if you do not use them, and
something goes wrong, well perhaps a canny lawyer might be able to show
that you were not using the industry standard, which might lose you the
case.

oo--JS.
