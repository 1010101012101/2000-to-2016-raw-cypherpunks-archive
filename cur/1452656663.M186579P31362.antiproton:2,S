Re:
"What did the every day German or Italian citizen see before fascism
ravaged sanity?"

[ They or some fration saw the Reds ]


There were labour, socialist, soviet communist, and anarcho-syndicalist
movements up to and including the 1930s and the Spanish Civil War.

And there was the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and
subsequent Civil War between Reds and White Russians, plus foreign
interventions in Russia/USSR.

My interpretation is that the Fascism in Europe (in Belgium 1939, for
instance) was at least in part a reaction to the movements and
activities of the Communists, Bolsheviks,  Marxists, Socialists and
Anarcho-syndicalists.
