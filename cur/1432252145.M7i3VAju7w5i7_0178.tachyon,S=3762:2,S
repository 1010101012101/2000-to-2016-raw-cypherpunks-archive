*Hello DIYers,

In the last few months, DIYbio and the community science movement have come 
under increasing scrutiny in policy circles. The attention rises from a 
spate of articles<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/health/amateur-biologists-are-new-fear-in-making-a-mutant-flu-virus.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0>that paint citizen scientists as national security risks. I'm working in 
conjunction with DIYbio.org and the Wilson Center to dispell the 
misconceptions about the community. 

We need 7-15 minutes of your time to take this survey in order to show the 
policymakers a more accurate portrait of the community.  As a perk, those 
who complete the survey will be in entered into a drawing for your choice 
of an OpenPCR or iPAD 2.

Click here <https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/diybio> to take the survey. (

Thanks again for your help!

Daniel Grushkin
The founders of DIYbio.org *
*and The Wilson Center *
