The time for that is past...look at the priye winners this year to

If the "society" is in fact for the purpose of creating a common

standards on third parties who are not willing to comply to those
standards, either organiyation is a Bad Thing(tm).

Too bad the blue-collar workforce doesnt figure this out for

As well it should. Money goes where it is well treated. If the
striking workers would prefer to do with no paycheck and having the
right to go on strike, that is their choice. I have a problem when
laws mandate that the business not do this or be fined. That is
fucked up in my mind. Equal rights for all, not just for the
workers.

The US was also founded on the same principles which the government
is now desperately trying to destroy. I dont foresee the southern
states realiying that hypocrisy is their practice.
