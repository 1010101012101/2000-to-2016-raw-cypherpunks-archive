=========================
 From US Pat 5,345,238, Satellite signature suppression shield

If a high energy laser (HEL) is being used to attack the shield, the laser 
must irradiate the cone with an energy above 10 watts per square centimeter 
normal for more than two minutes continuously to damage the gold coating. 
Occasional short term hits will do no damage except by lasers with a much 
higher energy than currently considered practical. Higher laser energy 
levels will do damage in less time, but the signature suppression levels 
are low enough, that closed loop tracking of the satellite is impractical 
at altitudes above 100 km. FIG. 6 shows the time required for vaporization 
of the metal film over the balloon skin as a function of the aspect angle. 
Direct irradiation with a 10 W/cm.sup.2 laser beam was used. The dotted 
line in the figure represents a 10 micron gold film over a 0.5 mm Kapton 
skin. The solid line represents a 10 micron aluminum film over a 0.5 mm 
Mylar skin.
==========================
So if the exterior of the missile had characteristics similar to the shield 
above it might deter direct damage from a HEL.

I haven't done the path loss calculations but suffice it to say acquiring 
and maintaining beam lock and delivering several Watts/cm at distances of 
100 km is a daunting challenge.  Due to Raleigh scattering some pretty big 
aperture mirrors are needed to keep beam divergence sufficiently small 
(non-Gaussian optics, for example second order Bessel, could also help but 
complicate optical design and efficiency.)
