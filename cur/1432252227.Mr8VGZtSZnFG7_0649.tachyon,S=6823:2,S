What a weird statement to make (not sure if trolling). From In-Q-
Tel's website:

  "We identify and invest in venture-backed startups developing
  technologies that will provide “ready-soon innovation” (within 36
  months) vital to the intelligence community mission...

  As a strategic investor, our model is unique. Our investments
  accelerate product development and add mission-critical capabilities
  with the sole purpose of delivering these cutting-edge technologies to
  IC end users quickly and efficiently."

Is it a police beating still called a police beating if the police shut
their eyes while lashing out?

If decisions or recordings are being made about my data, and not by my
service providers, then my data is being surveilled. Regardless of
whether it was done by a human or a computer.
