Coulter is an ultra-skinny (pretty to some men, not to me--if she were 
a male she'd be Iggy Pop at his most skinny--see note) loudmouthed 
fascist. Like many who have become talking heads on t.v., she excels at 
interrupting and completely ignoring the points made by others. (Not 
that I am necessarily different, but I am not supposedly engaged in a 
debate with another. Nor am I on television, thankfully for me and 
thee.)

(Note: If there were no lawyers suing people for their opinions, I'd 
opine that Anne Coulter has the physical characteristics and the 
fast-talking patter of a speed freak, a meth addict, a crystalhead, 
which could explain a lot about Anne Coulter. But lawyers are 
everywhere, and googling for names, so I won't opine.)

Coulter had a quotable line which shows just how much of a statist she 
is: "We should invade their country, take their oil, and convert them 
to Christianity." (Or words to this effect...exact quote can be 
googled.)

I stopped watching most of the networks for news during the War of 
Aggression in Iraq. When I occasionally land on CNN or Fox or MSNBC I 
am disgusted by the repeated teases for upcoming stories (sometimes the 
minutes devoted to the several teases exceed the length of the story 
when it finally appears), by the loudmouthed brayings, and by the short 
attention spans (a guy named "Anderson Cooper" is the worst on CNN, at 
least. He almost never lets a guest finish a thought. And his 
interruptions are banal, not useful as some interruptions can be. 
Another CNN guy, Aaron Brown, is actually refreshing in his laidback, 
Charles Kuralt-style slow examination of an issue...I ought to Tivo his 
show.)

But Anne Coulter is a complete jackass. She's not even a "neocon" in 
the good sense.
Just another statist.
