There will be no such place. The mighty wrath of WTO and WIPO will descend
upon the countries who would dare to not enforce the interests of The
Wealthy, followed by import duties, locking the "infringers" out of the
"free" market.

They can??!?

Blessed be encrypted digital media!

(Another reason to hope for the world of software-defined generic devices
- no customs would have a reason to seize an empty generic core, even if
one of its functions could be "illegal", if flashed with the right
firmware. I should sacrifice the necessary time and buy a handful of
Xilinx FPGAs and learn how to play with them...)
