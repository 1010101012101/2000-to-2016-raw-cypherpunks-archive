Anarcho capitalism, anarcho piratism, and feudalism are related systems.

Any actually existent system tends to have elements of all three.

Saga period iceland was primarily anarcho capitalist in icelanders 
relationships with each other, and primarily anarcho piratist in their 
relations with distant peoples.  They abducted a whole lot of women from 
Ireland.

Feudalism with a King who is merely first among equals is anarcho 
capitalism in which those privileged to use force have established a 
cartel and local monopolies, but not a general monopoly.

Anarcho piratism is anarcho capitalism where the number of people who 
are out of law with each other is alarmingly large.
