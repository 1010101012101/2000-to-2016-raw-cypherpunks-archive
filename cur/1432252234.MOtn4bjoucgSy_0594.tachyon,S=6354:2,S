Too funny ... not ...

I remember in Taiwan when I was a kid,
there was a nice little informative
"truth-in-advertising" sticker right
on the rotary dialer on the phone
telling us not to talk about politics
because the police was listening ...

Hey, at least they didn't bother to
hide or ofuscate the situation.
Maybe NSA was "practicing" there too.

For the crap we dish out about the bad
evil ol' Soviet Union and the other
"oppressive" governments, at least
they were up front about their tactics.

...

For the second disturbing fact we jump to the Olympics -- not this year's
games in Sydney -- but the 2002 Winter games in Utah. Given the 1996
bombing at the Atlanta games and the 1972 hostage crisis in Munich, I
really, really wouldn't want to be responsible for public safety at an
Olympic games anywhere. So it isn't surprising that the security plans for
Salt Lake in 2002 are very robust - perhaps too robust for some people,
including me.
