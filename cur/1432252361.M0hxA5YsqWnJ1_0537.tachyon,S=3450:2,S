The following is a message from the "December 16th Committee":
July 18, 2002 Update: Political Prisoner Richard Williams
Dear Friends,
For eight of the past ten months, Richard Williams, a Euro-American 
anti-imperialist political prisoner, has been held in isolation at USP 
Lompoc in Central California. He is the only political prisoner remaining 
in administrative segregation since the events of September 11, 2001. Yet, 
there have been no misconduct charges against him, so we ask, "Why is he in 
the hole?" See background information below.
