The server is in a position to keep track of the money transfer by
recording the serial numbers of the old and new coins as the exchanges take
place.  The server is perfectly capable of making the linkage.  If you
don't trust the server, then you must believe that all your transfers are
know.

The advantage of the various blinding schemes is that your trust is in
mathematics and probability, not in the integrity of the server operators.
