What is this, Henry Kissinger's vanity website or something? It reads 
like one of his Nixon era State Dept. memos on Vietnam or some shit. 
Pure felgercarb.

No state worthy of the name, benevolent or oppressive, and in it's right 
mind, declares war with individuals, or abstract concepts, despite the 
dangerously deluded metaphors. Mr. Bin Laden must be flattered no end if 
he thinks that the U.S. reallly considers him personally, or even his 
entire organization, that much of a menace. Doubt he's that stupid, though.

That's not necessarily to say that military force is not going to be 
used, but even if a single judiciously placed CIA bullet could resolve 
the matter, and not just for the moment, it likely wouldn't have Bin 
Laden's name on it. Not for maximum effect, anyway. But, loose lips sink 
ships, etc. Plus, TV, newspapers, websites, etc.need circulation. Bin 
Laden is good copy. Hottest thing since O.J. Almost as hot as wallowing 
in the enormity of 5000+ dead, After a century which, as others on the 
list have pointed out, saw 100's of millions dead from war, famine, 
disease, state terror, etc. Ruwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia, etc, just in the 
last 5-6 years or so.

Not to discount the horror, but I got over the "It can't happen here" 
syndrome as a kid in November, 1963. Get a fucking grip, America. And 
get off your high horse, too. Especially if you want to do anything 
about it, even if it's just to preserve more than an illusion of 
invulnerability.

Jesus, it's Sunday, isn't it? Off soapbox,
