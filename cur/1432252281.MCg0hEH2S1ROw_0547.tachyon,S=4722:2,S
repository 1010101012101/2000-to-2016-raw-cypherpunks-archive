Need fully automated fractional reserve banks, which use bitcoin as gold.  
Accounts are, of course, public keys, banknotes are chaumian tokens.

That just offloads the problem of price discovery somewhere else in the  
system.

Price discovery is hard.

Price discovery in micro transactions needs to be substantially automated - 
at both ends.  People will not invest the effort needed for manual price 
discovery.

Bad, incompetent, or buggy price discovery has killed every previous  
effort to solve this group of problems.

Price information is probabilistic, thus a price discovery mechanism has  
to support a full Bayesian model, recursive probabilities estimating the  
probability that the true probability is p, performing maximum entropy  
modeling.  This is the sort of work that gets very smart engineers hired  
at astronomical salaries by wall street.

This is a real life problem, for which there are real life solutions.  A  
friend tells me "As soon as they see your nose, the prices will go up by  
ten times.  Let me negotiate for you, and then you appear with the money."

He negotiates, then calls me in.  Upon seeing my race, some of the people 
he has negotiated with have fits at his lack of racial loyalty.

So, end users just have to get multiple independent sources of metadata.

And, to motivate them to get multiple independent sources of metadata,  
those that don't have to get scammed.
