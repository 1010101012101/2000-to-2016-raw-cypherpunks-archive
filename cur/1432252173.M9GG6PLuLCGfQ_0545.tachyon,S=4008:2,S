I agree with you that the term is stretched a bit thin. Still, there seem
to be at least two major things which fall under it in the work I've seen

	1) "Digital Rights Management" - which you mentioned below
	2) Contract languages like E (www.erights.org) and 
	the Haskell combinator library discussed in
 
Simon Peyton Jones, Jean-Marc Ebert, and Julian Seward in ICFP 2000 
``Composing Contracts: an Adventure in Financial Engineering.''

It's unfortunate that the Franklin and Durfee paper focused on 1) as their
raison d'etre for their protocol -- for all the reasons you cited. It's
not clear that 1) will fly, and even if it does, the end user won't be
doing much meaningful negotiation...

Even so, it seems to me that their techniques will have wider application.
Suppose Alice wants to selectively reveal parts of her contact with Bob to
Carol -- maybe she wants to convince Carol that Bob didn't give Alice a
better price than Bob did to Carol in order to win Carol's goodwill. 
The techniques in the paper seem to  allow Alice to do that without having
to reveal exactly what her price from Bob was (or learn what Carol's price
was, for that matter) -- and have it backed up by a contact signed by Bob. 

Then again, I don't know how often these kinds of situations come up in
real life...or will come up in the future.

Where would I go to learn about the difference between contracts and
licenses so as to understand what you mean here? (Besides law school;
that's still an option for me, but not now). Because I'd like to avoid
contributing to this problem if that's possible...

Thanks,
