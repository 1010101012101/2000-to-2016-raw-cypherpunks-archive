If I recall correctly, (and it's possible I don't), the ZKS freedom.net 
client had
features to pattern match strings (that you configure) when you were 
using your
nym, and warn you with a popup message box when it detected them in 
outgoing
traffic.  So you could be sure you weren't inadvertently sending data 
that could
compromise your nym (like your real name, or your other nym's names, 
etc).
