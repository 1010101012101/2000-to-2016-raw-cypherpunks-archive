So far, this is orders of magnitude more expensive than a keylogger. I am
not aware there is too high amount of the receiver units in use (nor I
suppose they are easy to operate by a non-specialist), so the number of
targets being threatened this way is much more limited than if some
software or comparably cheap hardware is used. For now, at least.

Then there is the shielding...

Specified it as a threat. But this is what physical security is for.
Again, this brings the threat of being discovered. Also, a TSCM sweep can
reduce the risk.

Use challenge-response. Immune against replay attack. With proper
algorithm, reasonably immune against cryptographic attack on intercepted
transactions. If it works over the Wild Wild Net, it should work over an
IR/RF connection as well.

True. Again, physical security / tamperproofness issue.
