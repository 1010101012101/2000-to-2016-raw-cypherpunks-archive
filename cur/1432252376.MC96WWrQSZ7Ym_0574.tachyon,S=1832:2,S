The point is that the asset (a performance) which the bearer-document
(ticket) grants access to expires.  I think that's actually orthogonal
to the
ticket itself expiring.

Another example with a more gradual loss of value
might be a bearer document for a certain amount
of short half-life radioactive substance.   Or just the
substance --no documents, just assets-- though that's
less portable than gold for health reasons.

I suppose that some foodstuffs also show halflives.

And, like a 10 year treasury note, appreciate with age.
