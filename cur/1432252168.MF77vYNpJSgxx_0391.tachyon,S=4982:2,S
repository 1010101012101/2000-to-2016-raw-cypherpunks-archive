It is economic warfare amongst protocols. Those protocols that let others profit
or steal from other by fraud, succeed. There is no incentive with the
behavioural psychology of the average human for security. Hence they are going
to pay the ultimate price. The environment in which that price will be extracted
is a police state and no lawful money in circulation and 100% spying with
whining from those who stole all the purchasing power to keep the system that
way. Fortunately, and unfortunately, it will not last in terms of historical time.

The way out is complex. Some of it will require living human beings who know The
Law of The Land - Common Law - to stop the fraud. There are people working on
this. See the Rayservers blog where news from two such groups is covered:

Slavery ended because of the mechanised cotton picker. Soon, it will be clearly
only people who know how to do business without being robbed blind, who will
survive.... trading without the enemy.

No point decrying twitter and facebook. It is what it is due to physics,
finance, etc. Better to build Web 4.0:

which will be tried and purified in the fires of the greater depression and its
attendant wars - again the inevitable necessities of physics, finance, etc.
