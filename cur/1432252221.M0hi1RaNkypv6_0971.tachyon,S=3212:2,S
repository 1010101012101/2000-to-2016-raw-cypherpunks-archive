325,000 Names on Terrorism List
Rights Groups Say Database May Include Innocent People

By Walter Pincus and Dan Eggen

Wednesday, February 15, 2006; Page A01

The National Counterterrorism Center maintains a central repository of
325,000 names of international terrorism suspects or people who
allegedly aid them, a number that has more than quadrupled since the
fall of 2003, according to counterterrorism officials.

The list kept by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) -- created
in 2004 to be the primary U.S. terrorism intelligence agency -- contains
a far greater number of international terrorism suspects and associated
names in a single government database than has previously been
disclosed. Because the same person may appear under different spellings
or aliases, the true number of people is estimated to be more than
200,000, according to NCTC officials.
