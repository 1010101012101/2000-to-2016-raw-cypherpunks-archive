Also, there's a guy constantly repeating that his family in iran is
going to be murdered because of this CIA guy.  The story is completely
nonsense of course. 

Supposedly, the iranian guy is working for tor, *helping the pentagon
undermine the iranian government*. That's fine and dandy. The iranian
gov't doesn't really care. HOWEVER, if the silly story about the CIA
agent gets out, now the iranian government is going to kill this guy's
family....why exactly? Because now they really understood what tor is
about? Please.
