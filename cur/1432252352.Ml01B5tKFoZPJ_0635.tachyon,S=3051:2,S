Well, as pointed out previously it may not be necessary to authenticate. If 
you believe you'll be passing through a high WiFi density area, and that 
chances are decent at least one or two of the hotspots do not require 
authentication, then have the app toss off a bunch of the emails and try 
again at the next spot. The emails should make it through somewhere 
(particularly in places like NYC, were there must be a dozen or more public 
hotspots within a block or two of where I work).

Of course, if authentication happens to be achieved, then I guess have the 
app delete those emails it got through.

Which leads to the possibility of perhaps attempting both strategies 
simultaneously, but on different frequency bands.
