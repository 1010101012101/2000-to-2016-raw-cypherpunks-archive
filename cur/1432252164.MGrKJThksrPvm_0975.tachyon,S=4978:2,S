What is a CD but a copy of a work, Sampo? Record companies sell
*records*, right?

A copy on my hard drive is *my* copy. I can, in fact, sell you a copy
of my copy (I love recursion....), but then the space, occupied by
your copy, is *your* copy. It's rival.

:-). I'm not the yokel who started this fight quoting LMD, I'm just
the guy who's finishing it...

The non-rival, non-excludable thing is standard academic econ-talk,
though. I was jerking his chain a bit about quoting a eurosocialist
rag, like you seem to be doing. The part about it not being
applicable is close to being right, thought. Or at least that even if
one applies the non-rival, non-excludable double negative nonsense
one still gets the right answer with private transactions involving
all digital goods and services.

For me, this is all about Coase's theorem, transaction cost, Coase's
observation that you can't have a market without property, and the
fact that, of course, if transaction costs were low enough, if we had
a working bearer cash economy on the net, for instance, the
definition of property would not be a legal one involving
"intellectual property", but a physical one, about encrypted bits,
protected not with laws, but with strong financial cryptography
protocols.
