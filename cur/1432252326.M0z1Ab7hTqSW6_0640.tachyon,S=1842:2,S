Are you trying to confirm that either the WASTE folks are homosexual, or
puerile,
as one might guess from the names of some of their projects?  (Not that
either impugns their code.)

On the other hand, both AES and 3DES are US gov't approved.  Which is
sufficient reason to use Blowfish.

Some of the other critiques of WASTE methods are substantial, however,
in particular the SSL recommendations are useful tidbits to remember.
