 After waiting around for about 45 minutes, the motorcade passed by us
again. A few police cars, followed by a van or two, drove by. Then, a
Bush/Cheney bus passed, followed by a second one going slower. At the
front of this second bus was The W himself, waving cheerily at his
supporters on the other side of the highway. Adam, Brendan, and I rose our
banner (the More Trees, Less Bush one) and he turned to wave to our side
of the road. His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction.
And then, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of
America, extended his middle finger.

Read that last sentence again.
I got flipped off by George W. Bush.

A ponytailed man standing next to us confirmed the event, saying, "I do
believe the President of the U.S. just gave you boys the finger." We
laughed probably for the next half hour, and promptly told everyone we
knew. Brendan actually snapped a picture of Bushy in action, but the glare
and the tint of the bus windows make it difficult to see him at all.
Nonetheless, it was the best possible reaction.

We pissed George W. Bush off. We are true patriots.
