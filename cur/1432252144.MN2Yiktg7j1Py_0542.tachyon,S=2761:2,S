I'm looking for people who want to operate tlds in the orsc zone.

You need to know BIND, and have a familiarity with database programming
like mysql.

If anyone is interested - send me a private email and i'll followup on it
this weekend and we can start getting you online.

The orsc needs new blood.  It's stagnated at 380 member tlds.

regards
joe baptista
