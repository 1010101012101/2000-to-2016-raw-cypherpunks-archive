Hum. Some funny possibilities here:

1) Obtain classified information and make a recording of someone reading it 
(and if you don't want to incriminate yourself, have a computer read  and 
record it).
2) Take recording to Judge Ellis III's courtroom, or anywhere he will 
appear.
3) Put in earplugs so you can't hear recording.
3) When Ellis III appears, play recording of classified information over a 
loudspeaker
4) Send in the cops: By hearing the classified information, Judge Ellis III 
has just committed espionage.

Better yet, do this at a gathering of (insert hated group here) and have 'em 
all carted away.

This fuckwit needs killing.
