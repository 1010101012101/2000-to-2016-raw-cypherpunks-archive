Funny, I don't remember anything about "minors" in the Bill of Rights...

Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of
the
press..

Vendors are of course free to follow any policy they want, for any
reason.
Movie theatres follow the G/PG/R/X system for PR, not obligation.
Similarly with Walmart and their decision not to sell certain
recordings.

However Washington is a government, and the 14th has something to say:

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State
deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
