 >>If the US prisoners in question had engineered, or were suspected of
having engineered, the deaths of thousands of innocent people, I suspect
that even LESS sympathy or consideration would be shown them. They
certainly would not get any from me. Marc de Piolenc<<

Has your head been up your ass for the last 50 years? In the name of 
anti-communism and to expand the Imperialist United Snakes 
Empire,MILLIONS,not thousands,MILLIONS of innocent people have 
died.Horrible bloody deaths! And now the statue of liberty is suddenly the 
fucking RED QUEEN! A word means what I want it to mean!?FUCK THAT NOISE!
Fuck your sympathy,Fuck the US and Torture and Kill all US prisoners.Its 
good enough for them FUCK THEM! To hell with Amerikkka.All paying tax got 
what they deserve.Anyone who destroys American interests, consulates, all 
missionary organizations, McDonald's, KFC, Shell or Caltex petrol pumps or 
American Express, or anyone who cuts off the head of an American, you will 
be given complete protection and a special place in paradise.See the CIA 
sabotage manual for ways to FUCK SHIT UP in Norte LaLa 
Land.http://smog.net/curiosities/sabotage/
