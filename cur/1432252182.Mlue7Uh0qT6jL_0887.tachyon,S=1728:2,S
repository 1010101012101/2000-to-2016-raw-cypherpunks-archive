How secure can I make a Java sandbox from the rest of the network I'm on? 
Can I make it so that my network administrator can't see what I'm typing? In 
other words, a secure environment that's sitting on an insecure machine.

And of course, there's a short term 'solution' (which will work until they 
catch on) and then a long-term solution (which they can't very easily stop 
even when they know such a thing exists).

Oh, and it helps to remember that a network admin AIN'T an engineer: If 
Microsoft or someone hasn't built an app for it, then they can't do anything 
about it.
