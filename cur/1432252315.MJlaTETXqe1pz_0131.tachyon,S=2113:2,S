The first axiom of government being force monopoly, and all that.

Maybe the first duty of a citizen is to arm himself against his  
government? :-)

An, um, enthusiastic, constitutionalist I was reading this week  
somewhere talked about how before the 14th amendment, of all things,  
(some :-)) people who lived in the US were US nationals, free people,  
and after the 14th, they were "citizens" and thus as much property of  
the state as any, say, European. :-)

It's amazing how people think that the use of force is somehow  
magically controlled by lawyers and politicians mouthing the proper  
incantations...
