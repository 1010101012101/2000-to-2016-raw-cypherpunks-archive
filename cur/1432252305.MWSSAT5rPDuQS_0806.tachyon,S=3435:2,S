Speaking of such, here are some actual facts. I wrote about Rasmussen in a 
recent Wired article. Here's what their polls say:

        http://www.portraitofamerica.com/html/poll-1468.html
        Earlier this year, Rasmussen Research conducted a survey
        measuring the electorate along a scale favored by many
        libertarians. This survey found 16% of American voters are
        functionally libertarian. However, only 2% of voters claim
        the title of libertarian to describe their own views.
