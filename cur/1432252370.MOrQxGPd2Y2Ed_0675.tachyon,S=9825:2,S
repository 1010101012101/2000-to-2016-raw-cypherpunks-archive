>  Montreal ? October 23, 2000 ? Zero-Knowledge® Systems Inc., the leading
>  developer of privacy solutions for consumers and companies, today 
> released the
>  source code of its next-generation Linux Freedom client. The company also

>  users. Using Freedom code developed by Zero-Knowledge, developers,
>  cryptographers and standards bodies will be able to build new open protocols
>  and technologies for protecting privacy.
>
>  As the recognized privacy leader, Zero-Knowledge is fulfilling its 
> commitment
>  to deploy consumer products that are open and transparent in order to allow
>  anyone to verify how they perform. The release of source code provides the
>  software development and security communities the necessary proof that 
> Freedom
>  alone empowers consumers to trust only themselves with their data and 
> privacy.

>  "Responsible privacy begins with privacy providers being open and 
> transparent
>  with their users. Zero-Knowledge is demonstrating its leadership by 
> releasing
>  the source code to Freedom and facilitating the creation of necessary 
> privacy
>  standards," said Mike Shaver, Chief Software Officer of Zero-Knowledge 
> Systems.
>  "We encourage other privacy companies to do the same."
>
>  "Open source desktop users have a need for powerful privacy tools which
>  facilitate their use of network services. At Helix Code we are building a
>  world-class open source desktop environment that gives the user very 
> intimate
>  access to web services, and so privacy is especially important to our 
> users,"
>  said Nat Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of Helix Code, the leading open
>  source desktop software and services company. "Now that Zero-Knowledge 
> System's
>  Freedom privacy suite will be open sourced and available for Linux, this
>  important need is finally being addressed. This is a big win for the open
>  source community."
>
>  Freedom 2.0 for Windows (95/98, 2000, NT, Me) and Linux will be 
> available for
>  Internet users before Christmas 2000. The 2.0 version for Windows will 
> include
>  new features and performance enhancements requested by the Freedom user
>  community. A Macintosh version of Freedom is expected in 2001. Among other
>  accolades, Freedom was named 2000's "Most Promising Internet Newcomer" by PC
>  World and called "the Rolls-Royce of privacy software" by Yahoo! 
> Internet Life.
>
>  The entire source code to the Linux version of the Freedom privacy suite,
>  released under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 and other Open Source? 
> licenses,
>  is available for download at http://opensource.zeroknowledge.com.
>  Zero-Knowledge will next release the source code to the Windows client 
> and to
>  the server software that powers the Freedom Network, a globally-distributed
>  network of servers operated by service providers and independent 
> operators that
>  route Freedom traffic.
>
>  Freedom is the first commercial product that empowers Internet users to 
> fully
>  control their identities and personal information on the Internet without
>  having to trust their data to an ISP, privacy company or other third party.
>  Freedom transparently encrypts and reroutes Internet traffic, preventing the
>  accidental release of information that could compromise personal privacy
>  online. Users create multiple digital identities (pseudonyms, or "nyms") 
> that
>  they can associate with their Internet activities.
