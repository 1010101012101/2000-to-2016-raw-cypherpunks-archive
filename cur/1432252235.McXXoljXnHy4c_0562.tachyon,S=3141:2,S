The election outcome is great.

With a bit of luck, we should see the supremes do a party line 5/4 vote on 
a partisan issue, further destroying what little credibility they have left.

With a bit more luck we should see two slates of electors, one proclaimed 
by the courts, and one by the legislature and executive.

Bush's case against the Florida supremes was great:   His team shot them 
down root and branch, claiming that everything they did and said was beyond 
their jurisdiction, as of course it was, but if one of them had been caught 
scratching his bum, I am sure Bush would have argued that the offending 
judge lacked jurisdiction to find his own bum also.
