At most, an insurance company would have some information Bob didn't
have. Bob could reasonably demand a copy of the results of his DNA test.
If the insurance company refused, he could shop elsewhere. Or
self-insure, as many of us choose to do.

If they're Americans, they've probably been socialistized by the public
school system. In addition to the inculcation of a belief system the
public schools seem to actively discourage critical thought and the use
of, gasp, shudder, numerical data. (I'm speaking in broad terms, of
course; there are many isolated exceptions.)

Not that I don't contemn the ignorant. An adult must take responsibility
for his education, no matter how badly mangled it was during his
childhood.

You've probably noticed, Tim, that most of those who claim a right to
affordable insurance are those who expect to _need_ a lot of insurance
benefits. I'm not sure that those people realize it themselves, even
when it's pointed out to them. (That may simply reflect on my skill at
oratory, but I should think that a huge collection of data points speaks
for itself.)

I concluded long ago that medical insurance is a bad idea for society.
It encourages irresponsible behavior to the extent that prices are
spread to other people. And of course attempting to adjust premiums
based on expectation of irresponsible behavior in well on its way to
being labeled a crime against humanity.

Or Hillaryomics. Oh, wait, you already excluded Marxist economics.
