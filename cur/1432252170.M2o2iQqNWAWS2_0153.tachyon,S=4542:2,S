It matters from a resolution perspective as well. The fact is you claim
1/20 messages are being dropped (per remailer or per submission? Do you
see any difference in drop rate dependent upon number of remailers, you
should?). That's an ASTOUNDINGLY high figure. Several orders of magnitude
over any expectation of 'normal' behaviour.

This means that not only is the technology itself under question, but its
implimentation as well.

In short, with this level of failure you can't 'trust' anything.

Duplicates are not drops, signatures do nothing for drops. You're changing
the rules in the middle of the game.

Which we don't have if we accept your numbers. Depending on the technology
you're trying to vet is a recipe for disaster (well Mallet won't think
so).
