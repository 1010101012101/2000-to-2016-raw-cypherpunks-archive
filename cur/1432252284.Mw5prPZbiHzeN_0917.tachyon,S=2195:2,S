Yeah, but this steps crosses a line, I think. Before, your home could be 
taken for a public project. Now, the supreme court has ruled that your home 
can be taken for a "public project" that consists entirely of private 
development, in the name of the "public good", which is supposed to equal 
higher tax revenues.

What this equates to is, whoever had more money than you can take away your 
home. Previously, it was just the occasional men-with-guns that could do 
this, but now they effectively have proxies everywhere.
