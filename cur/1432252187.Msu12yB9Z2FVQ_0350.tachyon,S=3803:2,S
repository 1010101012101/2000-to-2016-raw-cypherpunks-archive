hmm, i recall amusing conversations about honey tokens and baiting TLA's.
*grin*

true, this is probably how it is done.
would IPsec or some NSA built auth & privacy at layer 2 be more likely?

consider this vicious rumor but a little birdie informed me that
physical security at these locations is well covered.  strategically
placed cages, reinforced and locked, armed guards. all this on top of
the usually very tight security at these facilities. (though it
sounded like the guards were a recent introduction.  someone getting
nervous about legitimate employees poking around?)

so in this case i think there is probably useful data on the disks
(the filters and controlling software for the narus / other
equipment), caching might be implemented (the T3's on fibre channel
have some nice throughput, although this configuration is years old at
this point), and i very much doubt any destructive countermeasures.

network file systems introduce reliability concerns.  intermittent
link outages would mean a bit of caching in the local case, but might
cause monitoring / capture failure in a network file system scenario.

maybe we'll find out in the near future. :)
