*** Sure enough.  For me the terrorists are those who impose terror.  If
you're afraid at a hackerspace because it is infiltrated by spooks, then
you're a victim of mass terrorism.  FUD is a common tactics of
terrorism.  Big media propaganda is a good channel for that as well.

The TLAs use terrorism constantly.  That's how they win: FUD, FUD, FUD,
and then pick up.  Remember that FBI tactics of finding a potential
target and luring them into committing a crime in order to arrest them?
 That's also a form of terrorism, because it prevents anyone from having
sane human relationships.  "Maybe this cool stranger I've been opening
up to is going to rat me out, or enter my home, or rob my mother".
Terrorism is not just suicide bombers blowing up a bus or two guys
walking into a building for a massacre.  That's the handcrafted level of
terrorism.  That's the terrorism the industrial terrorists use as an
excuse to impose their industrial terror and distill more control across
society.  FUD, FUD, FUD, and then pick up.  In the voice of the
terrorists, everyone against them is labeled a terrorist.  The more
vociferous ones are put on a kill list and droned out, along with all
the people around them.  If that's not "an evil act of terrorism", I am
the Maadi.
