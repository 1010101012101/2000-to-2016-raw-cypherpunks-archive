And this, my dear Janie, is one of the very attitudes that got us into
this mess in the first place.  Just because you are a socioeconomic flake
whose every waking moment is consumed by the passion of your "toys", does
not mean that the rest of the world follows in your twisted footsteps

For one, your comments above imply that the Afghani's actually *have
something to lose*.  I think you need to reexamine the premise.  Second,
you are assuming that your value systems can be reliably projected onto
other societies.  Bzzzt.  This type of societal narcissism is where the
current fad treatment with spoorozites originated...

Step back from all the jingoist rhetoric a little, and examine your
underlying issues.  Between you and "Dr." Willie, this list is a microcosm
of Amerikka - a last great bastion of hate and predjudice: certainly not
the kind of place people want the medical practitioners "hanging out".

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
