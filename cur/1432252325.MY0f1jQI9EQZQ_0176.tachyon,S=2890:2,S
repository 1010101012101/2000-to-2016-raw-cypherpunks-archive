Someone tell the Travel Channel in that case, they did a story on the
London underground, including the Underground (big U) and mentioned this
very thing. It was called "Underground London" and unfortunately, the last
day they list as an air date is 8/25.

Seems they even have a name for the people who have to clean the human
debris up...fluffers, if I recall correctly. Brings to mind another
occupation that I won't detail here.
