There is already a reasonably good proof-of-work mechanism built
into SMTP-- START_TLS.

Any server that is willing to do TLS with mine is very unlikely
to be a spammer.  In fact a quick check of about 8000 spams I have
shows that two of them used TLS.  (both in the last week.   hmm.)

While it's true that the TLS protocol allows a client to subject
a server to a DOS attack by getting the server to do the expensive
crypto operation first (as the Dean & Subblefield paper points out)
in order for a MTA to deliver mail, it's got to complete
the TLS handshake.

So, to fix the spam problem, all we have to do is require START_TLS. :-)

Now, to generate an 8192-bit key....
