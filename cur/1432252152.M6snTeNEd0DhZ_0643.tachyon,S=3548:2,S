    RIAA talks tough on Web radio copying
    By Declan McCullagh

    WASHINGTON--The Recording Industry Association of America said
    Wednesday that it has begun pressing for anti-copying technology in
    future digital radio standards.

    Mitch Glazier, the association's top lobbyist, said the RIAA is
    contacting IT and consumer electronics groups to ask them to consider
    a "broadcast flag" for digital music sent through the Internet,
    satellite or cable.

    [...]

    The idea is straightforward: Future hardware and software would treat
    music differently if it were designated as broadcast-only, preventing
    users from saving it or uploading it. Currently programs like
    StreamRipper or StreamCatcher can record streaming music distributed
    through Webcasting.

    But because people might not use these new kinds of music receivers if
    given a choice, new federal laws likely would be necessary to compel
    software and hardware manufacturers to abide by the broadcast-only
    designation.
