'Applications' as used in Wagner's statement can be actions
or computer programs to accomplish the desired tasks for the
users/owners.

>From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:

  Application \Ap`pli*ca"tion\, n. [L. applicatio, fr. applicare:
     cf. F. application. See {Apply}.]

     3. The act of applying as a means; the employment of means to
        accomplish an end; specific use.

>From WordNet (r) 1.7 [wn]:

     3: a program that gives a computer instructions that provide
        the user with tools to accomplish a task;

Both involve using the term 'accomplish'.
Whereas from WordNet (r) 1.7 [wn]:

  software
       n : (computer science) written programs or procedures or rules
           and associated documentation pertaining to the operation
           of a computer system and that are stored in read/write
           memory;

As you can see, 'application' differs from 'software' in that an
'application' needs to 'accomplish' the desired tasks.

If as you said later,

that the desired tasks cannot be accomplished, then the software might run
but the 'application' does not.

Note the TPM FAQ quoted is correct in using the term 'software' but that
is not the term used by Wagner. The sentence where the term 'application'
is used in the alleged Palladium White Paper might appear to be self
contraditory.

Therefore I do not think that Wagner needs to withdraw his claim.
