There have already been reports of "electronic votes" being reported,  
mysteriously, before the election precincts closed.

We know the results are often fixed, but reporting the results before  
the polls are closed sorts of makes the point obvious even to the  
sheeple.

But, like the current hullaballoo about spam and telemarketing, the  
larger issues are not being discussed. Providing more sound bites about  
why Washington needs to be more successfully targeted by Al Qaida, with  
a lot more destruction than the paltry efforts we saw on 9/11, is  
boring.

The focus of this list in recent months on political lobbying  
activities is wrong-headed. We need to be working on ways to make Big  
Brother powerless, either through technology or through destroying his  
nests and his tens of millions of helpers.

The death of twenty million enablers and welfare addicts will be a very  
good thing. Burn, corpses, burn!!
