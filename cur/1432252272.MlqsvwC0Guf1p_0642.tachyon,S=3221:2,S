I was referred to you...I am a recruiter with an excellent
opportunity....OPEN salary for someone in with knowledge of ITARS licensing
for the Export industry in a Defense Manufacturer on Long Island..
Is this the same ITARS you are teaching...could I post the position with you
or could you recommend anyone?? I'm really stuck on this one..I understand
that these types hang around Washington DC, but that's my only clue into
solving this puzzle....anything to help me solve it?
Much appreciated,
