The Bill of Rights actually grants no rights, it only limits what the
government may do with respect to defining/restricting them. See 9'th and
10'th. It in effect sets out a list of prohibitions of things that
can't/shouldn't be done. I challenge you to find a single 'assignment'
sentence in the first 10 amendments.

With respect to the laws of the states, the Constitution only(!)
stipulates that the federals must guarantee them to be representative. It
says nothing about the actual form/function so implimented.

persons or things to be seized.

                                 Amendment V

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual
service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

                                Amendment VI

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have

construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

                                 Amendment X

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
