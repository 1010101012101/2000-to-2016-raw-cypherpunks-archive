 January 9, 2005

 MIAMI, FLORIDA --  A truck driver has disappeared with the 3.6 million
nickels he was hauling to the Federal Reserve Bank in New Orleans, police
said Friday.

 Angel Ricardo Mendoza, 43, picked up the coins, worth $180,000, Dec. 17
from the Federal Reserve in New Jersey and was supposed to haul the
cargo--weighing 45,000 pounds--to New Orleans for a trucking company
subcontracted by the Federal Reserve, police said.

 On Dec. 21, Mendoza's empty truck and trailer turned up at a truck stop in
Ft. Pierce, Fla.

 Miami-Dade police, the FBI and the Federal Reserve police are investigating.

 "We are concerned for his safety because he's missing," Miami-Dade
Detective Randy Rossman said.
