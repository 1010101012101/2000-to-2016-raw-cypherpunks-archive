I've got one.  It's an envelope lined with copper foil. I get
the pass out when approaching a toll booth, and put it back
(and put the 'chip clip' back on the envelope to ensure that
the foil makes good electrical contact) as I pull away from
the toll booth.
A toggle switch would be nice, but we can be fairly confident
that a Faraday cage is working as designed. Bear. "

So you need active defense of plate masks/obfuscation
mechanichs... flip down blanking devices, character cards,
mask films on a loop roll motor, OLED plates. DIY 007. Drive masked,
reveal as needed. Worst case, you don't notice the cop car
near you and get a paper ticket for no plate or a hacked random
nonspec plate. $100+... better than daily loss of privacy to
intersection/roadside cams, google robot cars, etc.

Next battle... killing all the manufacturer supplied transponders
in your car...

Then your cell phone.
