Well, anyone with a brain knows they do, and that statements from a US 
company are meaningless because nobody wants to go to jail over an NSL.

What a top-level observer can see (AFAIK) is who's logged in, probably 
what their username/keyID is, and how much they're talking to the server.

Because peerio uses miniLock formatted messages, the potential exists 
for minimal-knowledge service, but from the github docs it seems the 
server maintains an entry for which user is allowed to access which 
encrypted files, and therefore reveals to an observer who's the recipient.

So, it's a metadata-rich service, little better in that regard than 
email.. although the encryption is pretty well designed and unless you 
set up a "PIN" there's no permanent storage of private keys even on your 
computer, so it's also quite secure when crossing borders.

Also, there is a feature that clearly relies on compliant clients, where 
you can delete files from the server including copies sent to clients. 
Obviously if the attached files are downloaded from the system, this 
can't reach them, but it will destroy any "authenticated" copies of the 
messages from the server, if it works (you're trusting the server). 
OPSEC wise, this is a nice feature because it means you can clean up 
after yourself and keep the authenticated-data-at-rest on either end of 
a conversation to a minimum.
