Here's the cron-run script that I use to do it.  In my case
it combines the regular list and the list of subscribers to
the digest version and any other address that's been added to
the allowed posters list into a new allowed posters list.
If you set up majordomo to send rejected emails to the list
manager (the default) then any "legit" poster who's post
gets bounced by somehow not being on the approved list can
be added by the list operator.


#!/bin/sh
mjhome=/home/majordom
if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "usage: updateperms list1 list2 permlist"
    exit 1
fi
cd $mjhome/lists
if [ $1 -nt $3 -o $2 -nt $3 ]; then
 cat $1 $2 $3 | sort | uniq > $3.tmp && mv $3.tmp $3
 echo "updated $3"
fi
