How do FISA-approved wiretaps work, anyway?

All these NSA-bound collection points... are they always enabled,
listening for any interesting traffic?  Is non-FISA-warranted intel
ditched prior to collection, ditched at NSA, or never ditched?

Is the FISA process just:
0. Listen to some conversations.
1. Find something of interest.
2. Go to FISA with a tap request for the parties involved
3. Start flagging subsequently-collected intel with "FISA Approved"
4. Let certain people search the database at any time, but classify
anything not FISA-approved as TS/SCI.
