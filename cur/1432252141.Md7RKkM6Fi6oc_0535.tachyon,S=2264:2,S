My understanding was that Jimbo Wales had done just that. At http:// 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Justin_Berry#Total_rewrite.3F he wrote  
that he'd like to see a total re-write, and the time of that posting  
is also the time on the oldest version of the page that's available  
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php? 
title=Justin_Berry&oldid=42757036). My impression was that there was  
an older page that Jimbo Wales had simply wiped, erasing the history,  
and blocking the author (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
Talk:Justin_Berry#Bone_to_Pick...). Consider also the unlikihood that  
Jimbo started this page. From the talk page, it looks like the  
original article can be found at http://rookiee.aisdigital.net/ 
justin_article_archive/Justin_Berry.htm.
