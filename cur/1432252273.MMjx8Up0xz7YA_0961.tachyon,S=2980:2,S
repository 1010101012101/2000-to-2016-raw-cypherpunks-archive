Well, I am a telecom *and* a data guy, and I think I can clear it up :-)

First, I suspect that the Tor node did *not* have a 300mbit ingree or
egress, which is why the 300mbps was an effective DDoS ;-)

Second, as the guy who spent several years being the carrier schmuck on
call for these kinds of attacks, a 300mbps attack is a pretty small one.
Big enough to knock off the average web site or small ISP, but pretty
small from the carrier perspective.  He probably knew the sizeof the
incoming attack because the voice on the other end of the phone (the
carrier schmuck on call) told him how much data he saw coming down the
pipe at the target.

Hopefully that'll clear some of the muddy stuff?

I like the idea of belief in drug-prohibition as a religion in that it is
a strongly held belief based on grossly insufficient evidence and
bolstered by faith born of intuitions flowing from the very beliefs they
are intended to support.
