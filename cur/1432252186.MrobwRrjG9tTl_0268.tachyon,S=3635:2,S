 Hi: 

I noticed your well done ad in classifieds. As a PPL associate
I'd like to introduce myself and maybe compare notes.

If you'd like to do so please email me.  Meanwhile check
out my site that I and many other associates are using to
gain a large volume of names due to the SEM system
and popup windows that follow the visitor as he navigates
the normal PPL site.  Here's some URLs to check out…

Home page w/popup

Associate recruiting page

Focus advertising page

To your success
