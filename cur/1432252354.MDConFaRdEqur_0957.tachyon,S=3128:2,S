This organ-incubator needs to read the constitution.  Satan is an angel;

angels are protected from govt interference as religious entities.

This guy is supressing his urges.  He drinks baby blood, when he's not
plooking them.



BILL BARS SEX SITES AT LIBRARY
Steve LeBlanc, Associated Press writer
South Coast Today (Massachusetts)

Surfing for smut at local libraries would be barred under a bill set to
be
heard by Beacon Hill lawmakers today.

The measure, sponsored by Republican House leader Francis Marini, would
also
block Internet access to "satanic cults," "indecent depictions of bodily

functions" and "illicit drugs, alcohol or tobacco products."
