Conventionally, in order to be a prisoner of war you have to be a
soldier.  To be considered a soldier, you have to be in uniform
and you have to be part of an organized military force, meaning
that you have a rank and, unless you are the commander in chief, you
have  a superior to report to.  This is an essential requirement,
because PoWs are supposed to be handled through their own chain of
command.

In the second world war, people out of uniform but carrying guns
were often just shot out of hand.  If taken prisoner, they weren't
treated as prisoners of war but as spies, bandits, or terrorists.
Some of us remember the chief of police in Saigon dealing out summary
justice during the Tet offensive on this basis: the VC wasn't in
uniform, so he just shot him, right in front of all of those
cameramen.

Those fighting on behalf of the Taleban appear to be an unorganized
militia - no uniforms, no ranks, no saluting, just guns and lots of
spirit.  You can't make them PoWs because they don't recognize any
chain of command.
