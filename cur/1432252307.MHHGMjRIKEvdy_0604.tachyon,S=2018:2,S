Part of the problem is that they *don't* have locally infinite authority,
only locally infinite responsibility.
The minimum-wage incompetents have orders they *must* follow,
and don't have the authority to decide when they're bogus or inappropriate
or have been documented around or obviously apply to some *other* Dave Nelson,
but do know that if they get caught failing to harass _this_ Dave Nelson,
they lose their jobs, and if they let _some_ Dave Nelson through and the 
plane blows up,
they're in even worse trouble.
