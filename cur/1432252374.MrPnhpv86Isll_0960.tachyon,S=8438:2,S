Subject: RE: Microsoft Trial Judge Based His Break-Up "Remedy" On 
Flawed Theory, Not Facts
Cc: freematt@coil.com (Matthew Gaylor)

Dear Mr. Hallam-Baker,

If you knew anything about the academic debate over "path dependence" 
("network externality") theory you would know that the work by our 
research fellows, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, has been 
appearing in the leading, scholarly, peer-reviewed, economics 
journals for the past ten years.  They have conclusively shown that 
"network externality" theory has absolutely no empirical evidence. 
And, no economists or any others have been able to show any errors in 
the devastating Liebowitz/Margolis analysis.  Indeed, hundreds 
academic economists have signed our Open Letter agreeing with this 
analysis.

As a belief system without any scientific evidence and with people 
such as yourself who accept this urban legend without proof, "path 
dependence" is a house of cards that is being used to advance the 
corporate welfare ambitions of various major business and government 
interests.  In so doing, the Microsoft case has nothing to do with 
consumer welfare and everything to do with corporate welfare.  (For 
your information, it was the acclaimed, New Left historian Gabriel 
Kolko who first showed how antitrust has been used repeatedly for 
corporatist purposes since its initial adoption.)

So, since you have obviously not even seen the Liebowitz/Margolis 
book, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT: Competition and Antitrust in High 
Technology, and you apparently prefer to defend the blatant campaign 
for corporate welfare (antitrust protectionism), who indeed is the 
crank and right-winger here?

Incidentally, so you do not continue to embarrass yourself, I would 
suggest you first learn the difference between the terms, "network 
effects" and "network externalities."  Reading the book, WINNERS, 
LOSERS & MICROSOFT, would make an excellent way to do so.
