Hello,
 
I recently visited your website and believe you may be interested in forming a strategic partnership. Our company owns and operates fully licensed online casinos. We have over 30,000 clients and 8,500 partner websites.

The online gaming industry is the most explosive on the net, with over $10 billion projected by 2002. We would like to offer you the following proposal:

Qwest Global Intertainment provides:

* Casino / sportsbook front end design (for an example, go to www.GetYourCasinonow.com)

* All gaming software, customer service, credit card processing, and logistical support

* Up to 50% of casino net-win (tracked in real-time)

* Profit checks mailed each Friday, rain or shine

You provide:

* Website Promotion via banners, email, or search engine placement.

Without assuming any of the risk, you can drive traffic to your personal

Internet casino and immediately increase your company's residual income.

I invite you to look at our corporate website at the following address:

http://www.GetYourCasinonow.com

I look forward to hearing from you!

Partner Manager
