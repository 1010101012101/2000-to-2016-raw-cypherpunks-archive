One of the reasons why Bush ditched the small arms treaty is that 
these days freedom fighters tend to outnumber "terrorists" -- the 
tide of revolution is mostly flowing in the direction the US 
finds quite comfortable.

The largest beneficiary of the small arms treaty would have been 
Sudan, a nation on the UN human rights committee that 
vociferously condemns human rights violations by the US -- also a 
country with widespread chattel slavery for inferior races.

US government policy is not all that bad compared with the
mainstream outside the US.  Many governments and newspapers take
the position that there are no freedom fighters -- that all use
of foce against any government, however bad that government may
be, is terrorism.
