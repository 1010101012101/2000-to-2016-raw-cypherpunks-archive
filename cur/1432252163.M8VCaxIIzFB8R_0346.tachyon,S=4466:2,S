"When faced with force, you reply with force when you can."

Nah. This isn't even true in a fistfight, except when the guy you're 
fighting is a) significantly smaller than you, and b) less trained. More 
often than not, if someone attacks you, it's because they either have or 
perceive themselves to have an overwhelmingly superior force. In such a 
situation it's often best to run. Barring that, then "soft" methods are by 
far the best alternative, but soft methods normally require intelligence, or 
at least the ability to utilize an opponent's force against him (I think I 
can unequivocally state that I have had the opportunity to test such a 
principal here on the streets of NYC). And of course, if it's possible to 
diarm your opponent without actually killing or maiming him, that's 
sometimes far more appropriate...reference 'Aikido' and remember the 
unmasked "MasterBlaster". Every once in a while, somebody makes a mistake 
they eventually regret.

As someone said better than myself, Crypto is one little tool in an aresenal 
against "Men with Guns"...in the end Men With Guns will probably try to 
shoot away bits, but it's not going to work too well. Meanwhile, P2P, WiFi, 
Crypto,and lots of other stuff will slowly start to chip away at things on 
the edges, until the core is exposed.
