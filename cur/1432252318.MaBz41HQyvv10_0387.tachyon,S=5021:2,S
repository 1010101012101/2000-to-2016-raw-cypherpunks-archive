I happened to hear from Lee Caplin of Starium today. They've
apparently (I'm looking at Lee's email message while typing this, but
I don't wish to speak for them) abandoned plans to sell the
bump-in-a-wire device. Now they're thinking of marketing a small
RJ11'd cryptophone an executive would carry around. Also, Lee says
Starium has filed for patents on a desk phone, answering machine and
conference phone.
