How useful.  That'll really, I mean REALLY show 'em who's boss, as they shut the airport down and strand thousands of hapless travelers who I am sure will really understand your idiotic point.  Which is ... ?

Shit, all it takes is for you to put on some sneakers, run rapidly past the security checkpoint(s), perhaps open an alarmed door on your way out to the tarmac.  Do it at a hub, shut down everything.  Doesn't take anything as stupidly exotic as powdered explosive in your pantyhose, idiot.
