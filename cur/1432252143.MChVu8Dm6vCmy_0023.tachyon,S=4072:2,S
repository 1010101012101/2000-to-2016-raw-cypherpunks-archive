Subject: Computer Security Division Activities

NIST's Computer Security Division has recently made the following 
information available:

1. A report of the Second Modes of Operation Workshop, which was held in 
the Santa Barbara area on August 24, is available at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/modes/workshop2/index.html.

2. A change notice for FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard, is available 
at http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/tkdigsigs.html. This change notice 
specifies recommended key sizes, suggested modifications to the random 
number generators (RNGs) defined in the FIPS, and recommends a method for 
using the RNGs in the FIPS and in the change notice for general purpose 
applications.

3. The Key Management Schemes document for the Key Management Workshop is 
available at http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/kms/workshop2-page.html. The 
Key Mgmt. Guideline for the workshop will be available in a few days. The 
workshop is scheduled for November 1-2 at NIST. Registration is REQUIRED 
because of enhanced security procedures (i.e., so that attendees can be 
admitted to the NIST campus). Please see 
http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/kms/workshop2-page.html for registration 
information.
