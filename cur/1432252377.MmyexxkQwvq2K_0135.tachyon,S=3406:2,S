But if source code is free speech, isn't a judge ordering some code be
removed/edited/changed an intrustion on free speech? Isn't saying
"Remove Explorer from the core install!" the same as saying "Remove this
chapter from this book!"

Sure, the chapter can then be republished separately, but who is the
judge to decide what elements of a work of speech belong together? 

Code IS speech. And this has implications beyond DECSS and PGP.
