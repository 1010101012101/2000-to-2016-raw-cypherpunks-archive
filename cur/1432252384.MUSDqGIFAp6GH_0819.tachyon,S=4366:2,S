While I am unsure of the _current_ status, as of 1989/90 it was at least
OK to place severe restrictions on *how* one did business with them.  At
that time I worked for a company that separate divisions, of which one was
a [consumer] retail outlet (interestingly, the other division was strictly
for Fedz contract work- oh, the irony!).  

During 1987 ('88?) the Fedz (in the person of IRS) made rather a lot of
purchases via P.O., and was so "laid back" about [not] paying their bills,
that the retail side of the house put in a strict cash-only policy on
government purchases, and simultaneously placed a no-sale policy on them
until their bills were paid in full (which never happened, and which means
there were no further sales to the federales).

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
