As I was telling Jayvan, the idea would be that early adopters use the cu=
rrency for its inherent uses to them, as opposed to its speculative poten=
tial.

Right now, bitcoin is almost exclusively speculative. It's worth a lot of=
 money because the value has been increasing consistently. That's tulipma=
nia.

In a perfect world you would have some way to protect a currency against =
speculation. The volatility in bitcoin makes it less useful as a currency=
, therefore the speculation is damaging bitcoin.

I don't have a solution, and I'm not suggesting one, I'm merely suggestin=
g that a solution might exist that would be a substantial improvement.



If bitcoin was based on something that had inherent value, say cloud stor=
age, then a spike in value would be followed by a spike in the amount of =
storage being contributed to the network (bitcoin currently does this, a =
spike in price is followed by a spike in mining). The key here though is =
that the network would be protect from dramatic dips in value. When bitco=
in drops in price, all of the abundant mining does nothing to save bitcoi=
n, because the bitcoin mining doesn't actually add any value to the netwo=
rk. Nobody cares how many petaflops the network is pulling, because the p=
etaflops can't be put to use somewhere else.

But if the mining was based on cloud storage, a dramatic drop in the pric=
e of the currency would result in a dramatic drop in the cost of storing =
data on the network. That's something that actually has use, and so peopl=
e would let the price fall unreasonably low (instead they would find a wa=
y to make use of the cheap storage). This would allow the currency to rid=
e arbitrary spikes in price while being protected against arbitrary drops=
 in price.

Jim, the amount of mining being done on the bitcoin network has no impact=
 on the price. The price might have an impact on the volume of mining, bu=
t because the mining is specific to the bitcoin network (double sha2 hash=
ing or something like that) it can't be sold or used for other applicatio=
ns. Bitcoin mining is only good for bitcoin mining, which means the deman=
d for the mining is exclusively based on value of the bitcoins being mine=
d every day.
