Dude, this is a rant.

Why do you want "free markets" when the real world is rooted?

The majority of actors are just "rooted", so they are not
rational, irrational, ... hyper-transcendental, they are "rooted".

Capitalism is good on paper. Socialism is good on paper.

It is the realword implementation that matters, not the ad.

About "free markets":

"free market" is a buzzword, commonly used for spam.

Are banks "free market"?

IMHO banks are pyramids (AKA ponzi scheme).
It is tempting to make a change by going banks go boom,
but this likely will have too much collateral damage for 
people and not for "rooters".

Are "stock markets" free markets?

They are clearly just a gambling place.
