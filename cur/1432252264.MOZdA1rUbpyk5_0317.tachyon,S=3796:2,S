Uh, ya'll don't all respond at once now. 

Seriously, I know I'm not a regular poster, but don't leave me twisting in
the wind here. I haven't heard this kind of deafening silence since the
time I told my lawyer the church job was a frame up and who did the
framing. He didn't believe me, but he found out I was right. (I think his
point then was "yeah, so?", but he got us off without a trial. Damn sharp
attorney, that one.) 

If you're worried I'm trolling for pedos or something, or if you're some
kind of amateur detective like I'm told reads the list, or an armchair
psychoanalyst like the ones the FBI hires as consultants, no I don't make
a habit of turning the kiddies on to porn, and fuck no I don't let 'em
surf using my account. I won't turn off the Playboy channel when they come
in the house, unless mommy's with them or something. Well, that depends on
the mommy. I was just commenting on what I observe people letting their kids
watch and do.
