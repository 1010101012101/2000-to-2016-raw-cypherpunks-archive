ALERT: New CCOPS Poll -- your opinion needed

CCOPS:  Concerned Citizens Opposed to Police States has a new poll 
with the following question:

An Ohio man, a convicted child molester, has been sent to prison for 
seven years for writing fantasies of torturing children in his 
personal journal. By all accounts, these writings were repulsive. 
Should people be sent to prison for recording private thoughts in the 
privacy of their own home, when the activities described are illegal 
and/or violent, but there is no indication the person intended to act 
on them?

You can vote yes or no.

CCOPS has a new poll: "Thought Crime?"
Express your opinion, go to:

  http://www.ccops.org/

and tell us YOUR opinion on this complex issue.

NOTE: This poll will be up for 10 days. Give your opinion now
and check back soon to view poll results and comments.
