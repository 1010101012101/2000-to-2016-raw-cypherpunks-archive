That's what the Eff-folks advocating TOR are saying. And point to a
file on Torproject.org. See:


http://cryptome.org/0003/tor-spy.htm

However, this appears to be a giant evasion perhaps asubterfuge, 
even reminds of what Big Boys say when customers learn they are 
siphoning customer data. Read the privacy policy the lawyer-advised 
apologists bark, and upon reading the privacy policy see that it only 
emphasizes the subterfuge. Openly admitting siphoning is supposed 
to make it okay because everyone does it under cover of lockstep
privacy policy. Fuck that.

If the Tor operators really know what they are being used for, then 
they should admit to being agents of the USG, as Michael Reed had 
the guts to do.

Claiming this US spying role for Tor is well known is a crock of shit,
but then spies lie all the time and care not a whit that they peddle
shit for eaters of it. If you believe them and like what they do then 
don't shilly-shally, just do what Michael Reed did but others are
too ashamed to do after having been duped since 1996.

If Reed's precedent for honesty is followed, there will be an 
admission that the Internet was invented for spying by its inventor. 
And then cryptography and other comsec tools. And then cellphones 
and the like. Hold on now, this is getting out of hand, the apologists
will bellow, everybody has always known that there is no privacy
in digital world.

Actually, no, they did not. And those who knew keep their fucking
mouths shut to reap the rewards of deception. Now that is a truth
everyone knows. No conspiracy theory needed.
