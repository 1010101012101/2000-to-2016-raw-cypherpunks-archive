Reading about the Romanian student arrested today for allegedly 
releasing one of the "Blaster" variants, I was struck by how easy it 
would be to "bring a shitstorm down" on someone by inserting comments 
into the virus code.

Second Suspect Arrested for Internet Virus

Wed Sep  3, 5:54 PM ET

By JIM KRANE, AP Technology Writer

  Police in Romania on Wednesday arrested a 24-year-old former student 
in connection with a computer-crippling Internet worm, according to a 
computer security company that aided police.
...
  Company analysts traced Ciobanu through some Romanian-language text 
inside the virus that eventually led them to a Web page containing 
Ciobanu's home address and telephone number, Vicol said.

Tim again: This is not the first time an arrest has been made based on 
comments in virus/worm code. Sometimes the comments are about 
professors, sometimes about girlfriends, sometimes about local food and 
other trivia.

It would be easy to implicate someone, for at least the initial months 
of house arrest (as with Parsons, the American kid also arrested for an 
alleged Blaster release), by scattering incriminating comments. Getting 
incriminating evidence onto their home or office computers is not as 
easy, but we can all think of ways this could be done.

Absent verifiable signatures on such code (who would sign such a thing 
with a traceably sig?), conviction may be difficult. A charged person 
could claim he was "set up."

Still, acquittal is months or years down the road, after great expense.

I'll bet we see something along these lines soon.
