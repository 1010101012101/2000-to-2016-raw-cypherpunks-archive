Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
milli0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
