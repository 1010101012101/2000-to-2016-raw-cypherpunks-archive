THIS WEEK'S COMMENTARY=====================================

An Insider's Look at the Next Economy 

Editor's Note: I hope that everyone had a great 4th of July with their families.  Due to the holiday shortened week, the RagasReport decided to take a short nap this week and enjoy some of the beautiful sunshine here in Florida. 

Of course, the report will return next Friday with its regular dose of insider commentary and analysis of the tech sector.  In the meantime, I thought I'd share with you some of the great endorsements that my new book - Lessons From the eFront - has recently received.

Don't forget to visit the new website for Lessons From the eFront and enter to win a FREE Palm VIIx handheld.  You can also download the Introduction to the book from the site. 

The future is now.  The Next Economy is now - read about it! 

Buzz About Lessons From the E-Front

"During a time when plenty of painful lessons are being learned, Lessons from the E-Front could become a battle guide for the walking wounded.  It's a must-read for anyone who wants to profit from tech veterans' wins and losses." -Thom Calandra, Editor-in-Chief, CBS MarketWatch

"A great book for people in the trenches." -Guy Kawasaki, CEO, Garage.com, and author of Rules for Revolutionaries

"Matt Ragas captures the entrepreneurial spirit with real-life lessons and stories, but without the jargon and grand academic theory.  His insightful analysis cuts to the core of running a business in a time of rapid technological change and market volatility." -Bill Martin, Founder, Raging Bull Inc.

"Valuable reading for all would-be entrepreneurs as well as seasoned veterans." -David Bohnett, Founder, GeoCities

"An excellent guide for entrepreneurs, full of thoughtful pragmatism." -Gary Rieschel, Executive Managing Director, Softbank Venture Capital

"Reading Lessons from the E-Front won't make you rich, but it might help you figure out the next step.  At the very least, you'll get a glimpse into the minds of ecommerce pioneers-the ones destined to make it and the ones with the arrows in their backs." -Larry Magid, Syndicated Columnist, Los Angeles Times

"No longer will a cool idea and a PowerPoint presentation be enough to get your business off the ground.  If you want to build a real business that lasts, read this book." -Tom Taulli, Internet Stock Analyst, Internet.com

"The dot-com boom may be over, but the lessons from it endure.  Lessons from the E-Front is full of valuable advice.  Anybody looking to start a company should read this book." -Andy Wang, founder, Ironminds.com, and features editor, GEAR magazine

"Anyone who thinks high-tech business operates on a wing and a prayer, with glib leaders and ephemeral business plans, will be enlightened by this book.  Open it to any page, and you're certain to glean a diamond-cut nugget of hard-won insight." -Brad Hill, author of thirteen books including - Getting Started in Online Personal Finance

"Matt Ragas was one of the first investment writers to realize that the New Economy is about more than just technology -- it's about how companies use technology, whatever their business." -Spencer Reiss, Vice President - Gilder Publishing and Editor of New Economy Watch
