So the neighbors of that dead blonde Utah jailbait volunteered their
fingerprints, presumably for discounting them, though possibly not.
In any case: how could a neighbor-friendly cypherpunk give
prints which were *not* entered into the Fed Oracle?

Only way I can think of is to physically control your deadtree print
sheet
and require the Feebs to manually enter the dozen topo-feature-locations

of your print from a memoryless measuring device, (eg, a glass lens and
reticle) in front of you, then take the print sheet with you.  How you
verify
that the imaging system is memoryless is up to you.

Comments?
