Honestly, people, some of these suggestions are like a parody of geek advice=
 to civilians ;-)

The kid will soon hit upon the same practical solution that his or her peers=
 all use: the smartphone (preferably with a VPN like Freedome), plus browsin=
g at a friend's house. Wiping, Linuxing and LUKSing a family PC will escalat=
e the real-life threat, and the kid's defenses will fall quickly to the pare=
ntal equivalent of that XKCD password cartoon.=20

If the kid has a need for full size keyboard and screen, and has a few more t=
echnical chops than most, there are some alternatives:

 * Boot up Tails in Windows camouflage mode. Choose More Options at boot. Sh=
oulder surfing will probably bust him/her anyway, sooner or later.=20
 * Make one of those WinPE Windows USB drives, if real Windows is required. L=
ast time I looked this wasn't that easy.=20
 * Get a small, fast external drive and install the OS of choice. If the hos=
t is a Mac, use Carbon Copy Cloner (or dd) to copy an existing machine to th=
e external drive, or do a fresh installation there. For Linux, choose your f=
lavor.=20
  * Get a Raspberry Pi and hook it to the keyboard and screen, at times when=
 you don't expect interruption.=20
  * A virtual machine may be possible on the monitored host, if the required=
 drivers are already present. Probably not. See  http://www.vbox.me/. If any=
one knows a VM that works without admin rights, speak up.=20
