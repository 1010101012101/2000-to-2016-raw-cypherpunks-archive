After Genoa,where the black bloc was probably infiltrated by 600 nazi's,and 
9-11 that unleashed the jingo monster,many anarchists are casting around 
for new ways to take down the state.Greenpeace just copped a humungous fine 
and might also be seaking alternative protest strategies.While all that's 
going on the Homeland military industrial godzilla is frightening many 
people and even some lawyers into the crypto-anarchist direction.If you 
need PGP just to e-mail your kids safely...
All these swirling currents have created a window of opportunity or "sweet 
spot" for the mass promotion of Cypherpunk approved crypto-anarchy.In the 
book and series "A force more powerful," the raw power of mass civil 
disobedience is demonstrated again and again.With the Internet,the fact 
that you may be a minority in your nation state becomes much less 
important,security and solidarity become more important,even revolutionary 
against a divided foe.While the technical advances plateau for a 
nano-second why don't we all 
link,agitate,connect,protest,boycott,sabotage,expand,contract,do all we can 
short of self immolate to get crypto-anarchy out,in,up down and all 
around.You know it makes sense.
