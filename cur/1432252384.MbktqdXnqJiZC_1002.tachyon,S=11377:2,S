'Europe Will Be Islamic by the End of the Century'

by Robert Spencer
Posted Sep 16, 2004 How quickly is Europe being Islamized? So quickly that
even historian Bernard Lewis, who has continued throughout his honor-laden
career to be strangely disingenuous about certain realities of Islamic
radicalism and terrorism, told the German newspaper Die Welt forthrightly
that "Europe will be Islamic by the end of the century."

 Or maybe sooner. Consider some indicators from Scandinavia this past week:

Sweden's third-largest city, Malmx, according to the Swedish Aftonbladet,
has become an outpost of the Middle East in Scandinavia: "The police now
publicly admit what many Scandinavians have known for a long time: They no
longer control the situation in the nations's third largest city. It is
effectively ruled by violent gangs of Muslim immigrants. Some of the
Muslims have lived in the area of Rosengerd, Malmx, for twenty years, and
still don't know how to read or write Swedish. Ambulance personnel are
attacked by stones or weapons, and refuse to help anybody in the area
without police escort. The immigrants also spit at them when they come to
help. Recently, an Albanian youth was stabbed by an Arab, and was left
bleeding to death on the ground while the ambulance waited for the police
to arrive. The police themselves hesitate to enter parts of their own city
unless they have several patrols, and need to have guards to watch their
cars, otherwise they will be vandalized."


The Nordgerdsskolen in Aarhus, Denmark, has become the first Dane-free
Danish school. The students now come entirely from Denmark's
fastest-growing constituency: Muslim immigrants.


Also in Denmark, the Qur'an is now required reading for all upper-secondary
school students. There is nothing wrong with that in itself, but it is
unlikely, given the current ascendancy of political correctness on the
Continent, that critical perspectives will be included.


Pakistani Muslim leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed gave an address at the Islamic
Cultural Center in Oslo. He was readily allowed into the country despite
that fact that, according to Norway's Aftenposten, he "has earlier make
flattering comments about Osama bin Laden, and his party, Jamaat-e-Islami,
also has hailed al-Qaeda members as heroes." In Norway, he declined to
answer questions about whether or not he thought homosexuals should be
killed.

 Elsewhere in Europe the jihad is taking a more violent form. Dutch
officials have uncovered at least fifteen separate terrorist plots, all
aimed at punishing the Netherlands for its 1,300 peacekeeping troops in
Iraq. And in Spain, Moroccan Muslims, including several suspected
participants in the March 11 bombings in Madrid, have taken control of a
wing of a Spanish prison. From there they broadcast Muslim prayers at high
volume, physically intimidated non-Muslim prisoners, hung portraits of
Osama bin Laden, and boasted, "We are going to win the holy war." The
guards' response? They asked the ringleaders please to lower the volume on
the prayers.

 What are European governments doing about all this? France is pressing
forward with an appeasement campaign to free two French journalists held
hostage by jihadists in Iraq. The Swedish state agency for foreign aid is
sponsoring a "Palestinian Solidarity Conference," which aims, among other
things, to pressure the European Union to remove the terrorist group Hamas
from the EU's list of terrorist groups -- despite Hamas's long history of
encouraging and glorifying the murder of civilians by suicide bombers.

 What Europe has long sown it is now reaping. Bat Ye'or, the pioneering
historian of dhimmitude, the institutionalized oppression of non-Muslims in
Muslim societies, chronicles in her forthcoming book Eurabia how it has
come to this. Europe, she explains, began thirty years ago to travel down a
path of appeasement, accommodation, and cultural abdication before Islam in
pursuit of short-sighted political and economic benefits. She observes that
today "Europe has evolved from a Judeo-Christian civilization, with
important post-Enlightenment/secular elements, to a 'civilization of
dhimmitude,' i.e., Eurabia: a secular-Muslim transitional society with its
traditional Judeo-Christian mores rapidly disappearing."

 After the Beslan child massacres, however, there are signs from Eastern
Europe that this may be changing. Last Sunday Poland turned away one
hundred Chechen Muslims who were trying to enter the country from Belarus.
This is the sort of measure that the countries west of Poland have been so
far unwilling to take. But since one cannot by any means screen out the
jihadists from the moderate Muslims, and the moderates are not helping
identify the jihadists either, what choice did the Poles have?

 It might not be too long before they will have to turn away entrants from
Scandinavia and France as well.

Anti-Semitism in Sweden
By Arnold Beichman
Published October 29, 2003

    By now we've come to accept that, as Germany was once the hotbed of
anti-Semitism, it is the Middle East -- from Egypt to Damascus to Saudi
Arabia to the PLO -- which today is a seething cauldron of racism. What,
however, is even more alarming is that anti-Semitism is spreading to what
would hitherto be considered the most unlikely places.
     I have before me a study published Oct. 20 in a leading Swedish daily,
Dagens Nyheter, which reports that "Arab and Muslim attacks on Jews are
rising sharply in Swedish society [while] silence surrounds Muslim
Jew-hatred." The study, inadequately translated from Swedish, was prepared
by two Swedish social scientists, Sverker Oredssom, a professor of history,
and Mikael Tossavainen, his research assistant.
     The situation has become so bad, they report, that "Jews in Sweden
today often feel compelled to hide their religious identity in public:
necklaces with stars of David are carefully hidden under sweaters, and
orthodox Jewish men change their kippot [skullcaps] to more discreet caps
or hats when they are outdoors. Jews in Sweden nowadays get secret
telephone numbers to avoid harassment. In Sweden. Today."
     In a Swedish population of some 9 million, there are about 20,000
Jews, mostly in Stockholm, Sweden's capital. The social scientists blame
the Muslim migrants, now 3.9 percent of the Swedish population, for the
growth of anti-Semitism. (Sweden has the second-largest percentage Muslim
population in Western Europe. France has the highest Muslim population
percentage, 7 percent.)
     "Most Swedes believe that anti-Semitism is an extinct problem in our
country," they write. "Most Swedes believe that our society has evolved and
that we are more enlightened today. ... Unfortunately, they are wrong.
During the last year, the security police registered 131 anti-Semitic
crimes. Nobody knows how many incidents go unreported. but the security
police expect the number to be large."
     Jewish congregations in Sweden have noted a sharp increase in
"harassment, threats and attacks by Arabs and Muslims against Jews in
Swedish society during the last few years," the report states. "The problem
is furthermore aggravated by the almost complete silence which surrounds
this form of Jew-hatred. If anti-Semitism among Arabs and Muslims in Sweden
is discussed at all in Swedish media, it tends to be in the form of
trivializations or denials of the problem."
     The report's authors say anti-Semitism was once "only found among
marginalized groups at the extreme right and left. That is not the case
anymore. During the last decade, another form of anti-Semitism has started
to spread in the suburbs of large Swedish towns: a Jew-hatred often
imported from the Middle East and not seldom presented under an Islamic
flag which also wins adherents among groups of Arabs and Muslims in Sweden."
     Teachers in Swedish suburbs report widespread hostility against Jews
among Arab and Muslim students. Several Internet Web sites in Swedish
report on Muslim political and religious topics and at the same time spread
anti-Semitic propaganda in this fashion: the Holocaust is dismissed as a
Zionist fiction, an event that never happened. Then comes another
declaration, this one full of admiration for Adolf Hitler and regret that
he didn't live long enough to complete his extermination campaign.
     One Swedish Web site announces the existence of a Jewish conspiracy to
take over the world, an announcement with which Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahatir Mohammed would be in full agreement.
     At some point the European democracies, like Sweden, will have to
decide how far freedom of expression and other civil liberties extend when
Web sites in several European languages, including Swedish, are publishing
blood libels against Jewish citizens. The American philosopher, Arthur O.
Lovejoy, has written:
     "The conception of freedom is not one which implies the legitimacy and
inevitability of its own suicide. It is, on the contrary, a conception
which defines the limits of its own applicability; what it implies is that
there is one kind of freedom which is inadmissible -- the freedom to
destroy freedom. The defender of freedom of thought and speech is not
morally bound to enter the fight with both hands tied behind his back."
