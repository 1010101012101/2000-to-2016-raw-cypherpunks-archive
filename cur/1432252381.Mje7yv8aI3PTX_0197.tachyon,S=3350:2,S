Why should you? Whoever said effectiveness is a requirement?

I certainly am not. I worry about sickness when it comes, and if it's bad
enough, suicide is painless.

Usually people's decisions on matters related to health have little to do
with the expected cost of getting ill. Not one of the people I know exercise
to save money. They exercise to have fun, feel good, look good and to not
get sick, which is generally unpleasant regardless of cost. Generally I know
few people which are not in exceptional health.
