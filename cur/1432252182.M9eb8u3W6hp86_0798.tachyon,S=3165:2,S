The IMEI is displayed by *#06# on GSM phones and isn't broadcast.

GSM phones broadcast a temporary version of the IMEI called TMSI
(Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) rather than the IMEI directly
for privacy reasons (!)  The Nokia phones with Net Monitor mode will
display the current TMSI.

See for example,
