Some of the pointers are also symptoms of a bad connectivity. I've got
only a very lagged ssh link at *work*, zero connection at home.

I think there's definitely value in a dedicated cpunx news sink

make one at yahoogroups.

Unless any of you people already run such a newsticker? No point in
reinventing the wheel.
