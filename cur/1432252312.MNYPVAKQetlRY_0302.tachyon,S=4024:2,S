Interesting ovelapping dates for Bidzos' participation in RSA and Verisign.
Does the alleged tampering with RSA extend to Verisign? We use a
Verisign token. Is that suspect?

http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/news-events/press-room/executive-bios/james-bidzos/index.xhtml

James Bidzos is president and chief executive officer of Verisign. He 
also serves as chairman of the board of directors and has been 
executive chairman since August 2009.

As the founder of Verisign, Bidzos is an Internet and security 
industry pioneer whose accomplishments include building RSA Security 
into the early standard-bearer for authentication and encryption, and 
launching Verisign as a company in 1995 to develop the digital 
certificate infrastructure for Internet commerce.

Before returning to the president and chief executive role in August 
2011, Bidzos served as Verisign's first president and CEO and also 
served as Verisign's chairman of the board of directors from April 
1995 until December 2001, as vice chairman from December 2001 to July 
2007, and as interim CEO from July 2008 to August 2009. Bidzos served 
as president and CEO of RSA Security from 1986 to February 1999, and 
then served as RSA's vice chairman from 1999 to May 2002.

Recently, Bidzos was inducted into The National Cyber Security Hall 
of Fame. He is also one of Time Magazine's "Digital 50" and is in 
CRN's Computer Industry Hall of Fame.
