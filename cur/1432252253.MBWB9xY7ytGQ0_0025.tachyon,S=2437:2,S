Yeah, but there's a big difference. The Israelis probably have actual Agents 
doing this work.
We've got minimum-wage, one-step-above-welfare high school dropouts doing 
the work.

Witness the recent "screening" of a 4-year-old whose name was on the Do Not 
Fly list. That's the kind of quality individuals we have deciding who can 
fly and who can't.
