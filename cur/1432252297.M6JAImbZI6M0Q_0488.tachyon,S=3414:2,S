That doesn't really kill the argumetn. The key word is enforceable. Black
markets do it directly by guns, the society at large needs the legal system
to mediate. The lack of legal enforceability *is* a problem.

OTOH, one could imagine reputations being built without them being linked to
a fixed pseudonym. Whether the necessary crypto exists, or if the resulting
web of trust can be made strong enough, I have no idea.
