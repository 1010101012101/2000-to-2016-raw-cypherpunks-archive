You are *way* too FT based in your thinking.  There are *many* other
measurements and statistics and co-relations.

And the noise I was referring to is in part electronic noise, not image
noise
in either the spatial freq. or poisson sense.  The point being that
there is
info that is perceptually insignificant, that you can replace with
compressed encrypted bits.
