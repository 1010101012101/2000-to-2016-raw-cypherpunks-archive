RUSSIAN VERSION

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's
a fool and laughs, dances, and plays the summer away. Come winter, the
ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so
he calls up his uncle and asks for help. The ants food stores are
inspected and found vulnerable to dry rot. A systemic problem among
ants. For the benefit of the ant, his food stores are placed in a
national storage facility. The grasshopper is given a job managing
the facility. The central store rapidly develops dry rot. Millions
of ants die. But somehow there always seems enough grains left for
the grasshopper. After a while the grosshopper's uncle suggests
that the solution to the dry rot problem is de-nationalisation via
employee ownership. The facility is sold for one grain to the
grasshopper, who then sells it for half a grain to his uncle. The
grass-hopper is re-hired as manager. The uncle becomes fantastically
rich. The ant gives up collecting grain and finds a personal-security
position protecting the uncle from other ants.  All three go
out to a Moscow night club to celebrate and are gunned down by a
group of ants working as corporate-security professionals for Gazcom.

Cheers,
Julian.
