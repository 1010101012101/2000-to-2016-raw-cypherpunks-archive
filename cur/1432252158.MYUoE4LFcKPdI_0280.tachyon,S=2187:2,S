Another of the few powers I'd grant to the US Federal government which 
aren't spelled out in the Constitution is the ability to regulate the 
use of antibiotics. Careless use of them can lead to the development of 
drug-resistent bacteria, which adversely affects the whole population.

I'd gladly trade increased governmental oversight of antibiotic usage 
for elimination of governmental meddling with drugs which don't affect 
anyone but the taker.
