The Onion had a piece a couple of years ago that talked about the 
Police stopping people to search them for drugs when they see a 
Greatful Dead sticker on their car.-  A spoof that is all too real- 
The DEA along with various police training manuals mention to look at 
what kind of bumper stickers are on cars in order to know what to be 
on the lookout for.
