well, arithmetic and algebra are math :)

and still exceptions to this rule. Shor's makes RSA/DH risky but
quantum search in GF(256) is probably too hard for any current lifespan.

improved McEliece is my favorite contender for a post-quantum reality.
hardware entropy sources are plentiful and bandwidth capable...

agreed. though perhaps this just argues for more conservative designs.
the padlock engine on the host i'm writing this with can do 32 rounds
just as easily as 10 or 14.
