Yup, certainly anyone who's thought about paying for, say, grid networks
time, or wireless access, has at least plinked around with the subject, but
it's nice that someone like *Nick* is thrashing some cycles on the problem.

In the interest of "telegraph, telephone, tell Hettinga", I'm just sending

Cheers,
RAH

ted -- Nick).

I desribe an architecture providing usage control (as opposed to access
control)
 for mutually suspicious objects (i.e., objects interacting across trust
boundar
ies), using bearer certificates:
