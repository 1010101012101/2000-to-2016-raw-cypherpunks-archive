My original point was the the technical definition of non-repudiation 
was much narrower that the legal definition.  This draft seems to 
agree. It goes on to say:

My concern is that the vast majority of informed lay people, lawyers, 
judges, legislators, etc. will hear "non-repudiation" and hear 
"absolute proof."  If you doubt this, read the breathless articles 
written recently about the new U.S. Electronic Signatures Act.

I don't think technologists should be free to use evocative terms and 
then define away their common sense meaning in the fine print. 
Certainly a valid public key signature is strong evidence and 
services like that described in the draft can be useful. I simply 
object to calling them "non-repudiation services." I would not object 
to "anti-repudiation services,"  "counter-repudiation services"  or 
"repudiation-resistant technology." Would the banking industry employ 
terms like "forgery-proof checks," "impregnable vaults" or 
"pick-proof locks" to describe conventional security measures that 
were known to be fallible?
