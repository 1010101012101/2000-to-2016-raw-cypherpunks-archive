Probably unrelated to any new satellites, especially as the only once 
since 9/11 was just launched yesterday. Probably some sats have been 
moved to new locations. Even if repositioned, the imaging satellites 
(KH-12s, etc.) usually relay their data to TDRSS and DSCS relay 
satellites, and then down to the ground stations.

Lastly, most of the Blue Cube's duties got transferred to Falcon AFB in 
Colorado some years ago.
