Please explain.

That's no good either.  If he's tresspassing in order to put obsticles
in front of my front door to trip over, expect me to take actions.  I
don't care what's printed.. It could be blank paper for all I care,
but I don't want it on my property.  It's litter that I have to deal
with.

My arguement was that you can't expect free speech to have absolute
protection.  There are many rights that are on the same level with
free speech, and if someone is going to use the free speech protection
in order to violate someone elses right, you're greatly
misunderstanding the purpose of free speech.  You need to study where
free speech came from and why.  

People ideas should not be blocked.  No one objects to the speech or
expression that spammers create.  They can write all the spam they
want.  It's the *delivery* of that speech that we are objecting to.
If they deliver it in a nasty way, that violates other rights, then
that should be actionable.  The first amendment doesn't say anything
about the way in which you can deliver your speech.  Go stand on a
street corner for all I care, but don't enter my home and put it in my
face.. that kind of act should not be protected.  Your disagreement
with this puts you in the minority.

Spammers have the choice to make whatever speech they want, and I
don't intend to take that choice away from them.  But I will take
whatever actions necessary to ensure that they deliver it in a way
that is not intrusive.

This arguement boils down to an ad hominem, and it's empty with no
intellectual content.  Please explain what you mean here.  Give us an
academic argument with merit.
