SUBJECT: We need Book, Software &amp; Consumer
Product Reviewers ob1IN0101<BR>
<BR>
We also will pay you $125 - $500 to write
enhanced user manuals and you can keep the
product.<BR>
<BR>
Here is the gist of this email: We need book,
product and software reviewers. You can request
any title or product. When you receive the
product and post a brief review to our web
site you keep the review title or product
for you own use. It is that simple.<BR>
<BR>
Read on if you are still interested... <BR>
<BR>
Wouldn't we all like to travel the world
and shop for the most interesting and exotic
products? <BR>
<BR>
Instead imagine having quality products,
expensive software and wonderful books shipped
to you via overnight express directly to
you form the publisher!<BR>
<BR>
Unless you are J. Peterman or Mick Jagger,
the first proposition is unattainable for
most of us. <BR>
<BR>
For the rest of us, the second option is
just moments away from anyone who wants to
become a review writer for Focus Group Reviews.<BR>
<BR>
Here is the best part of the deal! You only
pay a modest fee to pay for part of the freight
charge on the items you request to review.
You keep all products after you write and
post a review. This is the absolute best
deal on the Internet today.<BR>
<BR>
We need more reviewers to keep up with our
explosive growth since we moved our review
service to the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
