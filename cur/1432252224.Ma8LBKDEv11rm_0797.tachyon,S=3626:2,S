 >>Extract...during a CATO-sponsored forum on Iraq Wednesday.
The forum's other expert, former CIA Director James Woolsey, favored action 
against Iraq, but only if the United States accomplished certain objectives 
first.
Woolsey said the United States would first have to destroy Iraq's somewhat 
extensive air defenses, so American and coalition aircraft would have 
control of the skies. "If we did that successfully, the Republican Guard or 
any other Iraqi divisions, the loyalty of which in the latter case is 
extremely doubtful as far as Saddam is concerned, but even the Republican 
Guard, about half-strength of what it was in 1991, has no place to hide," 
he said.
The former CIA director said the United States would need essentially only 
one ally  Turkey  for use of its airbases in >>attacks against Iraq.<<End 
extract.

Turkey is an authoritarian police state and united snakes puppet.It 
recently jailed 6 anarchists for handing out leaflets.
So called 'libertarian' think tank CATO is  linked to cypherpunk regular 
declan mccullogh.He may be a mole.Who for?
"I suspect no one yet I
suspect everyone".CI.Clouseu.
