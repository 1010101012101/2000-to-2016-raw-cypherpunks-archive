Internal resistance mediated by cypherpunkly tech can always be
defeated by cranking up the police state a notch.  This is eg why
e-cash systems have anonymity problems.  This is why there are
carnivore boxen aplenty.  The knurls on the police-state knob
are getting worn, it is cranked up so frequently now.

Useful resistance comes from asymmetric physical feedback such
as experienced in Lebanon, S. Arabia, off the coast of Yemen,
in a few embassies somewhere in africa, in the trains of Madrid,
Okla city, and some degenerate US east coast cities a few
years back, the latter indicating that "geographically removed" is less
important,
and the only incident that Joe Voter is likely to remember.  Until the
next one, of course; Joe's buffer is not terribly capacious.
