I wouldn't figure SS payments into my calculations unless I were to 
retire in the next few years. As the SS crunch looms nearer, watch for 
payments to people outside the US to go on the chopping block.

Not that I expect to get anything from SS myself regardless of whether I 
stay in the US. 29 years until retirement, even if the age isn't pushed 
back again.
