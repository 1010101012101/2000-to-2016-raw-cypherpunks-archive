	There's been a lot of talk lately about various sender-pays,
proof of work, and related schemes for dealing with the spam problem.

	I am interested in building a sender-pays anonymous
value-associated stamp system using Wagnerian cash. This would involve a
commercial mint, email client plugins, and all the rest. I have talent,
technology, and time. But I don't have any money.

	Anyone who wants to try it, and has funds available, should
contact me.

Thanks,

Patrick
