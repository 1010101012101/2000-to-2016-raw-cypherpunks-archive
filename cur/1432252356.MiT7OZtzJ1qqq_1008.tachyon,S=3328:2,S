  Really? Why? Am I on their property? Using their property? Breaking some 
sort of public trust? The reality is that people get 'irritated' by the 
silliest things, two guys (or girls) kissing in public for example. Wanting 
to burn a flag or a bible. Going to a different church than they do..<<.

Pulling your dick,yeah,yeah.The question of "property"is one every opponent 
of CACL should know backwards.
As your a seppo try ... 
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG5.html "property is theft!"
Not causing to much offense means you live longer and so you can irritate 
your neighbors longer.You have an inalienable right to irritate people:Smug 
little shits like declan and pompous,pretentious neo-nazis like 
tim  irritate me.I might have them APstered if I can raise enough BUM based 
e-cash.Care to chip in a proffr dollar?.)
