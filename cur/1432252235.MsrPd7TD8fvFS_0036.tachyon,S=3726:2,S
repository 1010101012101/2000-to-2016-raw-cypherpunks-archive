1. "If it do not fit, you must acquit! 'Sides, if de odds a dat DNA 
whack shit be one in a hunderd million, and day be 200 million 
'Mericans, most of dem whiteys, how come day not be lookin' for dat 
utter guy?"

2. "It depends on what the definition of "is" is. And I did not have 
sex with _that_ woman. Besides, there is no controlling legal 
authority."

3. "We want a re-vote until the will of the people is heard. Besides, 
our elderly Jewish voters were confused. 'Sides, dat ballot not be in 
'Bonics so a brudda be unnerstannin' dat whack shit."

The problems are obvious. The solutions equally obvious.
