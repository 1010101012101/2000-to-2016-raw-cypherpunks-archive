Interpol hit by parcel of rotten meat and excrement


LYON, France, June 26 (Reuters) - A suspect parcel delivered to Interpol
headquarters that prompted a three-hour evacuation of the building contained
nothing more lethal than rotten meat and excrement, judicial sources said on
Tuesday.

The parcel, which arrived at the head office of the international police
organisation on Monday, was later taken by police van to a laboratory about
100 km (60 miles) away from the southeastern city of Lyon, where Interpol is
based.

The laboratory found four envelopes in the parcel. They contained a slab of
rotten meat, an empty packet of cigarettes, two rotten eggs and toilet paper
smeared with excrement and urine, the judicial sources said.

The parcel was mailed in Miami and came from a man there who has regularly
sent Interpol such material since 1994. "He's one of their regular
correspondents," a police source said.

The area around the Interpol building was cordoned off for more than three
hours following the parcel's delivery, after which the workers were allowed
back into the building.
