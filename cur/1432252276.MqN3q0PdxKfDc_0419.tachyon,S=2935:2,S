Tim May, Elder Statesdroid of Cypherpunks, quoted someone else:
#    Jim told me he was a graduate of MIT and remembered playing "Computer 
#    Space" on the PDP's there when he was a student, so when he happened 
#    across the SpaceWar at a Tektronix surplus sale he picked it up. It 
#    had then sat in his basement until I showed up.

investigated by the Feds. Tonight, Monday Mar 19, on
either CBS evening news, or local NYC CBS evening news,
I'm not sure. Their WWW is of no help for local news,
nor was tvguide.com.

Didn't Steve Jackson's Games already go through this ringer?
