Depends, I suppose, on a number of factors.

Well, previously there was more importance put towards knowledge, and less
on making money with same.  Today the emphasis is somewhat different.

Everybody does that, or at least those who create knowledge either as a
process of study and synthesis, or as a result of original research.  Some
ideas are prevalent to the extent that it is obvious as to their origin. 
Ideally, someone who presents an idea as his or her own will take some
pains to indicate the fact, and will distinguish their sources by way of
appropriate references.

Opinion:  It seems there is a new trend towards guild-like protection of
scientific and scientific-like diciplines.  People who like the idea of
guilds are working towards making participation contingent upon
membership.

Membership may eventually only be granted to individuals who submit to
arbitrary rules.  And note that I am not referring to ethical restrictions
in this instance.  Ethics -- good ones that dicate a minimum of racism and
like discrimination, for instance -- are becoming somehwat rare.
