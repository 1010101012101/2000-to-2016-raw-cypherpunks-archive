The problem Mr. Howe describes is fundamental, folks:
encryption should be end-to-end even when the endpoints
are functionaries in a company.  Because not all employees
are equal.

So yes Alice at ABC.COM sends mail to Bob at XYZ.COM and
the SMTP link is encrypted, so the bored upstream-ISP netops can't learn
anything
besides traffic analysis.  But once inside XYZ.COM, many
unauthorized folks could intercept Bob's email.  Access Control is
sorely lacking folks.

Link encryption is a good idea, but rarely sufficient.
