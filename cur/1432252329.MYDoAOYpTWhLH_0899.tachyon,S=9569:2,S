NONCOMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The probation officer believes that Carl Edward Johnson has 
violated conditions of supervision by:

Violation 
Number      Nature of Noncompliance

  1.        Failing to report the names and addresses of two 
            Internet service providers, in violation of a 
            special condition of supervision.

  2.        Using the Internet to access the "Cypherpunk" 
            website after being specifically instructed not 
            to use the Internet for this purpose, in violation 
            of standard condition number 3.

U.S. Probation Officer Action; 

On October 18, 2001, this officer received intelligence
information which indicated Mr. Johnson was accessing the 
Internet using two Internet accounts which had not been provided 
to this officer. Mr.Johnson was using these accounts to insert 
himself back into a "Cypherpunk" web site he had been accessing 
during the instant offense. During the probation intake with Mr. 
Johnson on August 20, 2001, he was instructed to use the Internet 
for the purpose of researching his medical condition and legal 
matters only, He was specifically instructed not to access
the Cypherpunk website.

Of particular concern was the content of Mr. Johnson's e-mails, 
which contained derogatory comments about federal officials. On 
October 22, 2001, this officer, along with the investigating 
agent in this matter, conducted an unannounced home visit at 
Mr. Johnson's residence. Mr. Johnson was asked if he had
provided this officer with all Internet accounts he was currently 
using, to which he stated he had two new accounts he forgot to 
report to this officer. He accurately provided the account 
addresses and stated he would not forget in the future. Mr. 
Johnson was questioned in regard to his recent postings to the 
Cypherpunk website after being instructed by this officer not to 

use the Internet for this purpose. Mr. Johnson became highly 
agitated at this point, yelling obscenities and banging his fists 
on the table. After he calmed down, however, Mr. Johnson stated 
he misunderstood and did not realize he was restricted from going 
into this site. He further explained that his messages, in regard 
to federal officials, were simply commentaries to other people's 
messages. Mr. Johnson was reprimanded for the inappropriate nature
of his e-mail messages and again specifically directed not to 
access the Cypherpunk website or make any postings to that site. 
It is noted that a thorough inspection of Mr. Johnson's residence 
was conducted during this home visit which did not yield anything 
unusual.

The Probation Office is giving Mr. Johnson the benefit of the doubt 
when he says he misunderstood this officer's instructions. We will 
continue to monitor him closely, and are recommending that no 
further action be taken at this time. Should Mr. Johnson's 
noncompliant behavior continue, the Court will be immediately 
notified and further sanctions will be requested.

                                     Respectfuly submitted,

                                     [signed]
