I just grabbed a transcript of Osama's remarks and read them.  He raises a
number of valid objections to US and Jewish behavior, and seems to have a
much better grasp of reality than Shrub does.

Osama Bin Laden's Offer For Peace
Apr 17, 2004
JUS News Desk

Editors Note: Here is the complete transcript of Osams bin Laden's latest
address as translated by BBC in which he calls for peace with European
counrries on the basis that they withdraw from the lands of the Muslims
and stop spilling Muslims blood.

Complete Statement Of Osama Bin Laden Address to the European Countries

Praise be to Almighty God; Peace and prayers be upon our Prophet Muhammad,
his family, and companions.

This is a message to our neighbours north of the Mediterranean, containing
a reconciliation initiative as a response to their positive reactions.

Praise be to God; praise be to God; praise be to God who created heaven
and earth with justice and who allowed the oppressed to punish the
oppressor in the same way.

Peace upon those who followed the right path: In my hands there is a
message to remind you that justice is a duty towards those whom you love
and those whom you do not. And people's rights will not be harmed if the
opponent speaks out about them. The greatest rule of safety is justice,
and stopping injustice and aggression. It was said: Oppression kills the
oppressors and the hotbed of injustice is evil. The situation in occupied
Palestine is an example. What happened on 11 September [2001] and 11 March
{the Madrid train bombings] is your commodity that was returned to you.

It is known that security is a pressing necessity for all mankind. We do
not agree that you should monopolise it only for yourselves. Also,
vigilant people do not allow their politicians to tamper with their
security. Having said this, we would like to inform you that labelling us
and our acts as terrorism is also a description of you and of your acts.
Reaction comes at the same level as the original action. Our acts are
reaction to your own acts, which are represented by the destruction and
killing of our kinfolk in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine.

The act that horrified the world; that is, the killing of the old,
handicapped [Hamas spiritual leader] Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may God have
mercy on him, is sufficient evidence.

We pledge to God that we will punish America for him, God willing. Which
religion considers your killed ones innocent and our killed ones
worthless? And which principle considers your blood real blood and our
blood water? Reciprocal treatment is fair and the one who starts injustice
bears greater blame.

As for your politicians and those who have followed their path, who insist
on ignoring the real problem of occupying the entirety of Palestine and
exaggerate lies and falsification regarding our right in defence and
resistance, they do not respect themselves. They also disdain the blood
and minds of peoples. This is because their falsification increases the
shedding of your blood instead of sparing it.
  
Moreover, the examining of the developments that have been taking place,
in terms of killings in our countries and your countries, will make clear
an important fact; namely, that injustice is inflicted on us and on you by
your politicians, who send your sons - although you are opposed to this -
to our countries to kill and be killed.

Therefore, it is in both sides' interest to curb the plans of those who
shed the blood of peoples for their narrow personal interest and
subservience to the White House gang. We must take into consideration that
this war brings billions of dollars in profit to the major companies,
whether it be those that produce weapons or those that contribute to
reconstruction, such as the Halliburton Company, its sisters and
daughters.

Based on this, it is very clear who is the one benefiting from igniting
this war and from the shedding of blood. It is the warlords, the
bloodsuckers, who are steering the world policy from behind a curtain.

As for President Bush, the leaders who are revolving in his orbit, the
leading media companies and the United Nations, which makes laws for
relations between the masters of veto and the slaves of the General
Assembly, these are only some of the tools used to deceive and exploit
peoples. All these pose a fatal threat to the whole world.

The Zionist lobby is one of the most dangerous and most difficult figures
of this group. God willing, we are determined to fight them. Based on the
above, and in order to deny war merchants a chance and in response to the
positive interaction shown by recent events and opinion polls, which
indicate that most European peoples want peace, I ask honest people,
especially ulema, preachers and merchants, to form a permanent committee
to enlighten European peoples of the justice of our causes, above all
Palestine. They can make use of the huge potential of the media.

I also offer a reconciliation initiative to them, whose essence is our
commitment to stopping operations against every country that commits
itself to not attacking Muslims or interfering in their affairs -
including the US conspiracy on the greater Muslim world. This
reconciliation can be renewed once the period signed by the first
government expires and a second government is formed with the consent of
both parties.

The reconciliation will start with the departure of its last soldier from
our country. The door of reconciliation is open for three months of the
date of announcing this statement.

For those who reject reconciliation and want war, we are ready. As for
those who want reconciliation, we have given them a chance. Stop shedding
our blood so as to preserve your blood. It is in your hands to apply this
easy, yet difficult, formula. You know that the situation will expand and
increase if you delay things. If this happens, do not blame us - blame
yourselves. A rational person does not relinquish his security, money and
children to please the liar of the White House.

Had he been truthful about his claim for peace, he would not describe the
person who ripped open pregnant women in Sabra and Shatila [reference to
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon] and the destroyer of the capitulation
process [reference to the Palestinian-Israeli peace process] as a man of
peace.

He also would not have lied to people and said that we hate freedom and
kill for the sake of killing. Reality proves our truthfulness and his lie.

The killing of the Russians was after their invasion of Afghanistan and
Chechnya; the killing of Europeans was after their invasion of Iraq and
Afghanistan; and the killing of Americans on the day of New York
{reference to 11 September] was after their support of the Jews in
Palestine and their invasion of the Arabian Peninsula.

Also, killing them in Somalia was after their invasion of it in Operation
Restore Hope. We made them leave without hope, praise be to God.

It is said that prevention is better than cure. A happy person is he who
learns a lesson from the experience of others.

Heeding right is better than persisting in falsehood.

Peace be upon those who follow guidance.
