One solution I've seen used in 3rd world countries is to require people 
who have just voted to dip a forefinger into a cup of intense, penetrating
dye, which they are very unlikely to be able to remove in one day.

I can state from personal experience that Silver Nitrate solution will 
produce stains on skin which gradually blacken in the light, and
don't come off till your skin wears off. Mixing the dye with a 
transport agent such as DMSO would also work.
