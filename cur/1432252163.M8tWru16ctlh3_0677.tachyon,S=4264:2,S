Hi Adam,
 there is something to be said for NOT having the mentally unstable
controlling the security and integrity of your network... :)
particulary if they are in the middle of a psychotic break and acting
generally unhinged, and having 86 accounts NOT as a yp spread
account(remember the year) the university felt was excessive and had
been looking into his activities for sometime in light of the numerous
complaints they received about him it seems.

The final day engineered by MEDUSA and tentacle #69 was just the straw
that broke the camels back from what I heard..


     gh
ps the real scream of the whole sitrep is that Detweilers ravings and
overactive imagination created the very monster that he feared and
having been created the monster ultimately was his actual undoing.
