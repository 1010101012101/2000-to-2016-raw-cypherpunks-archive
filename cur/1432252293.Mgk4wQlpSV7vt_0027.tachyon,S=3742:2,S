Available at http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mrio/papers/infocom09.pdf

I would summarize their proposal as ripple for bittorrent with a routing  
algorithm.

The paper fails to consider the UI for managing reputation information, or 
the UI for finding and identifying services

With a method for finding torrents and information about torrents, would  
be a major improvement on bittorrent, since it provides seeding incentive.
