Riots spark chaos in Argentina
 From AFP
December 31, 2001
ARGENTINE President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa's week-old cabinet offered its 
collective resignation yesterday following renewed unrest over economic 
policies and unpopular government officials. There was no word on whether 
Mr Rodriguez Saa had accepted the resignations.
Austerity measures led to riots that toppled the previous president, 
Fernando de la Rua, and threaten Mr Rodriguez Saa now the street protests 
have resumed.
However, Mr Rodriguez Saa received an encouraging telephone call from US 
President George W. Bush, who urged him to stick with a strict plan 
approved by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Bush "emphasised the need for the Argentine Government to develop a 
sustainable economic plan and work closely with international financial 
institutions to do so", White House spokesman Scott McClellan told 
reporters at Mr Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
In Buenos Aires, thousands of people took to the streets overnight 
demanding the release of their money, which has been frozen in bank 
accounts. The protests turned violent when a group of young demonstrators 
tried to storm the presidential palace and clashed with riot police, who 
used tear gas and water hoses to break up the crowd.
Another crowd stormed the Congress building, torching curtains and wrecking 
furniture before they were ousted by police. Twelve officers were injured, 
six seriously, and 33 people were arrested.
Mr Rodriguez Saa asked the country's banks to help re-establish peace by 
facilitating the payment of pensions and salaries to workers and retirees. 
He said that in a meeting with business community leaders he had asked 
banks to remain open from 8am to 8pm today to cash cheques of up to 1000 
pesos ($A1900) per person.
In one of the overnight clashes, a retired police officer guarding a 
service station shot and killed three youths after a heated argument, 
according to local media reports yesterday. The shooting sparked violent 
protests, and security officials used tear gas and rubber bullets to 
disperse the crowd.
Lawyer Diego Fumagalli criticised political leaders for missing the point. 
"They didn't understand the people's message," he said.
"The message was that we want a new political system without corruption, 
and then they go and name all these corrupt politicians to the new 
government."
Since taking office for a three-month interim term, Mr Saa has suspended 
payments on the country's $261 billion foreign debt, and announced the 
creation of 1 million temporary jobs as part of an emergency program aimed 
at helping the 2.5 million unemployed.
