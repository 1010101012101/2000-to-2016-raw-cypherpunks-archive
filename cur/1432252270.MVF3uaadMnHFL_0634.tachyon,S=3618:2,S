I see.  I'm sure that Dubbya has his own agenda filled with Shoulds, as
does Bin Ladin, as did Lenin, as did Hitler, as did Nero, as do you.  
Each saw (or see) their views as the way to Utopia.  Trouble is, which one
of you megalomaniacs is/was right?

Further to the point, reality is, and what clearly "should" and makes
sense to to you, clearly "doesn't" to another.  The only difference
between you and the others above is that you lack the power to bend
reality to your whims, and IMHO, that is a very good thing.  It is sad the
the above list contained megalomaniacs who did possess that power and used
it to cause great misery to others, and had to be removed from inflicting
their whims on the world at great expense.  Perhaps in a couple of weeks,
US Citizens will vote one of those out the list as he's already done
plenty of damage in the last four years, and save us another miserable 
four years.

So yes, perhaps, in the fine tradition of what should be instead of what
is, you, sir, should go fuck yourself.
