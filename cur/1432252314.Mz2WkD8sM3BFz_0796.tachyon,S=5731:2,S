I seriously doubt unbreakable snooping software will be made a legal 
requirement in the next few years.  I mean, if you switch to say, BSD, who 
are they going to impose the task of adding features, like 'rights 
management' on?
All i'm trying to say is its pretty easy to screw over any software gimmicks 
they come up with, but levying a fine against you when you by a computer?  
thats crap.  And even if they impose a tax anyway, who is to stop them from 
imposing the dreaded "snooping software" later, under some different 
pretenses.
