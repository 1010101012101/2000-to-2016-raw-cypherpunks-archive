This sounds more like what I was looking for.

Probably someone has already pointed out the url to this, but 
if they did, I when I looked at it I was snowed under by 
verisign oriented shit, which assumes a large budget and ample 
administrator time for face to face contact with certified 
people, a very small number of clients, some hours of work by
each client, a manual, user training, etc, and failed to grasp
it.

Could you point me somewhere that illustates server issued 
certs, certification with zero administrator overhead and small 
end user overhead?

Also, I have many times heard that public key operations were 
surprisingly easy, and have been key administrator for several 
companies, and have unfailingly found that I was the only 
person capable of doing these operations at that company.
