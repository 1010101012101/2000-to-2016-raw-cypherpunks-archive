Such a case (of an individual being charged for clicking on a banner 
ad) will never go to trial, but if it did, an obvious defense would be 
that those who click on an ad are not the ones _paying_ any money to 
anyone. They lack "agency."

And any argument that the act of clicking on a site or ad for "Kach" 
induces _others_ to pay money to Kach and hence is some kind of 
conspiracy to fund Kach would be laughed out of court. This year. Maybe 
not in three years, however, at the rate we are descending into 
Wonderland.
