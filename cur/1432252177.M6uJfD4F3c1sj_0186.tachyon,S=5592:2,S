The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
slight|y, you will still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
