I walked into the local 7-11 today. There was a scanner there and a man
next to it offering a free pack of cigarettes if he could scan your
drivers' license or other form of photo ID *and* you are an adult smoker. 

When I asked what this was all about, he told me that Phillip Morris is
trying to "update their ID database." Various promotional material was
present as well, but I didn't read any of it. 

Does anyone know more about this? Does Phillip Morris have an ID database,
and how often do they update it? 

thanks,
-David
