I wouldn't take that bet because I'm sure you are right.  However, that just
begs the question.  Ultimately those bastards were appointed by someone who
was elected democratically.  (Now don't hang any signs on me.  I'm not
saying this is a "good thing" only that it still falls within the democratic
paradigm.)

No argument there, but I think the barbarians at the gate (the rioters)
would be infinitely worse.

You are right again, but, as above, the rioters' "cure" would be worse than
the disease.  A plague on both there houses.

Theodore Sturgeon once began a speech at a science fiction convention by
saying, "90% of science fiction is crap."  After the stunned silence he
added, "90% of EVERYTHING is crap."

Sure most of the information is wrong; so what?  That's where critical
thinking has to come in.  The rioters are clearly on an emotional trip not
an intellectual one.

Yeah, and I want to fuck Claudia Schiffer.  If wishes were horses, beggars
would ride.  The world is as it is, not as how we would wish it to be.  The
Genoa rioters are throwing a childish tantrum.  When (if) they grow up,
maybe they will do what is really necessary to change the system.

Yup, I'm buying my beachfront property in the Sierras, even as we speak.  My
next door neighbor is Kevin Costner.  :-D
