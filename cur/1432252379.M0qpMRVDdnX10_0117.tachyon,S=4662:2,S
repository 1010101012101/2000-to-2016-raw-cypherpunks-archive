You know I've heard of alot about this today, mostly gibberish which was at
least cleared up by the above link.  Thanks.

I find myself in an interesting position WRT John Walker.  I admire him for
having the strength of his convictions, and volunteering to fight for the
side he believes is right, in the finest American tradition.  But at the same
time, I gotta tell you, I agree that he is a prisoner of war.  Declared or
not, let's face it, he was captured on an active field of battle - he's *not*
a civilian, he's a combatant, and subject to the whims of the military.

This has got to be one of the only times I can ever remember thinking that
our military (much less Shrub) was actually *right* about something.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
