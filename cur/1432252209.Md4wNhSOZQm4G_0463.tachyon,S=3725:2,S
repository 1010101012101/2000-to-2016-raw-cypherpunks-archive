Oh, all you want is enzymes then? I bet we can rig something up with
bacteria.  When it comes to making chemicals - well, chemicals without
annoying heavy metals in them anyway - microbiology is your friend.
Things that want nothing more than to reproduce themselves 3 times an
hour tend to be quite easy to get hold of in bulk :-)  Kinder to the
neighbours as well, unless you are in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Sudan in
which case those nice men from the Pentagon will be sending a cruise
missile your way as soon as they hear that you are getting into
production scale.

On the other hand I had this vague idea that peroxide sort of decomposed
itself. And I bet burnt protoplasm buggers up the exhaust nozzles no
end.
