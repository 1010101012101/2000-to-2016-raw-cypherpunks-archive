Reverse Rendition?

Here's where Liberals can take a stand...let's round up some of these 
fuckers and stuff 'em in a shipping container on a Chinese barge to Italy.

I've done a quick google search and I've only found a couple of the names. 
Is the complete list available?

>ROME, Italy (AP) -- It wasn't their lavish spending in luxury hotels, their
>use of credit cards or even frequent-flier miles that drew attention. 
>Instead
>it was a trail of casual cellphone use that tripped up the 19 purported CIA
>operatives wanted by Italian authorities in the alleged kidnapping of a
>radical Muslim cleric.
>
>Italian prosecutors who have obtained arrest warrants for the 19 -- none of
>whom are believed to be in Italy -- presented evidence that the suspects 
>used
>at least 40 Italian cell phones, some in their own names.

>Experts say that either they were bumbling spies, or they acted with

>because Italian officials had been informed of their plan -- a claim the
>government of Premier Silvio Berlusconi has publicly denied on several
>occasions. (Full story)
>
>"If these were really CIA agents they've made a disaster," said Andrea 
>Nativi,
>research director for the Rome-based Military Center for Strategic Studies.
>"They strained relations between Italy and the U.S. and between the CIA and
>Italian intelligence agencies."

>Italian judges issued a first batch of warrants last month for 13 Americans
>accused of abducting Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, known as Abu Omar, on a 
>Milan
>street on February 17, 2003.
>
>Another court this week issued another six warrants for a group the

>The Egyptian cleric was flown from Aviano, a joint U.S.-Italian air base

>of Venice, to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and then to Egypt, where he was
>reportedly tortured. The operation purportedly was part of the CIA's
>"extraordinary rendition" program, in which terror suspects are transferred 
>to
>third countries without court approval.
>
>In his request for the latest warrants, prosecutor Armando Spataro wrote 
>that
>an analysis of mobile phone traffic showed that most of them were present 
>on
>the route that Abu Omar habitually took from his home to a Milan mosque,
>"including in the days before" the kidnapping.

>A track of their cell phones also showed them on those streets "nearly 100

>to Milan to carry out the operation."

>Why they would use their cell phones so openly has baffled experts,
>particularly since prosecutors are certain that not all the names of the 19
>suspects are aliases.

>One has been identified by prosecutors as the former CIA station chief in
>Milan, Robert Seldon Lady, who owns a retirement home in wine country in

>they did discover a list of hotels where U.S. government employees received

>Nativi, the military expert, called the use of regular cell phone accounts

>The wireless system used in Italy and most of the rest of Europe relies on

>A unique numerical identifier is assigned to every phone and every SIM,

>Bruno Errico, director of consulting for Openwave Global Services, a

>Wireless companies are obliged by law to keep records of the unique data
