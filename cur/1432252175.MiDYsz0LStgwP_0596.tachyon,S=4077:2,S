Nonsense. The problem with the Holocaust was not because people were 
expressing their opinions about Jews, their habits, etc., or having 
"un-PC" thoughts about their neighbors. In fact, the so-called 
anti-Semitism in Germany in the 1920s and 30s was less pronounced than 
in other European countries, notably France.

The issue with the Holocaust, as with the suppression of the Kulaks in 
Soviet Russia, as with the forced starvation of entire provinces of 
tens of millions of people by Mao, was directly attributable to STATE 
POWER. In other words, the problem was that Hitler, Eichmann, Goebbels, 
etc. could have their bureaucrats meet at Wansee to implement the Final 
Solution.

In a decentralized political system, one with constitutional 
protections for speech, movement, association, gun ownership, property 
accumulation, etc., such "purges" and "pogroms" and "final solutions" 
are much more difficult to carry out. And had the Jews spent more time 
on self-defense, on matters martial instead of matters Talmudic, they 
might not have been such easy pickings and gone so readily into the 
cattle cars headed east.

By the way, practically speaking, banning the swastika and outlawing 
any expression of admiration for Hitler just makes these things more 
attractive to young kids. Duh.

--Tim May, who counts more on the Constitution to limit the power of 
government (though these limits are falling, year by year) than he does 
in some ban on putting swastikas in books or on armbands
