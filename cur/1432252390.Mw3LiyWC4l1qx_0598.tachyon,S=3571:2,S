Right. Everyone's forgotten it; books like that (and Crypto, and
Database Nation)  have a short half-life.

He didn't make dismissive comments, and was actually more critical
(though mildly) when we had conversations about it in the past.

The thing, though, is that Crypto only spends a paragraph or two --
really -- on crypto anarchy. It's not a focus of the book, or even the
chapter, its name notwithstanding.
