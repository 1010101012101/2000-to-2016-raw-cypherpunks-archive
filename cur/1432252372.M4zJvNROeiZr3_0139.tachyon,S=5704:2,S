Well, specifically my suspicion was (and to some extent still is) that part 
of Mr Donald's job description may involve posting to cypherpunks...he may 
be part of some Ministry of Love somewhere, probably in the DC beltway.

Either that or perhaps it's not an official part of his job, but he's trying 
to defend the actions he takes as part of his job. I've just never 
encountered anyone who had NO doubt about anything the current regime is 
doing.
