They are powered by authorized access to and useful end use of message
content, not by email. That's not going anywhere, only the intermediate
transport is being redesigned.

Removal is different from introducing competitive alternatives.

MUA's become file readers and composers. They hand off
to a localhost daemon that recognizes different address formats
of the network[s] and does the right thing. Perhaps they compile
against additional necessary network/crypto libs. Whatever it
is, those are not a big change. Ditching centralized SMTP transport
in the clear is... and for the better.

Reread the threads, forget about that old SMTP box, think new.
