A recent article in the Economist points this out:
http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=513031

% of people who were victim of a crime, once or more, in 1999:

Violent crime:
England & Wales: 3.5%
US: 1.9%

Car theft 
England & Wales: 2.6%
US: 0.5%

Burglery (including attempts)
England & Wales: 5%
US: 3.8% 

The article opens:

BRITAIN may have slipped down many world league tables over the
past few decades, but it beats all other rich countries except
Australia in one activity: crime. According to a new victimisation
survey of industrialised nations, people in England and Wales are
at greater risk than anywhere else of having a car stolen. And
apart from Australia, people who live in England and Wales are at
greater risk of being assaulted, robbed, sexually attacked and
having their homes burgled than are people in any other rich
country.
[end quote]

Now, the murder rate in the US *is* substantially higher than 
Britain's, but your overall chances of getting through the day
safely are probably higher in the US.
