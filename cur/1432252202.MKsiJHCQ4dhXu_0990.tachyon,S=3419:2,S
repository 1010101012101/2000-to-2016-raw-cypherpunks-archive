My standard Windows settings are to hide extensions for known file-types --
ignoring questions of sanity, it is prettier and I generally don't run any
program I am unfamiliar with regardless of file extension.

If there is a separate option for changing this behaviour only within Outlook
Express, I am not even aware it exists.
