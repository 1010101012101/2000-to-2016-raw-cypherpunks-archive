Anybody who's come to the Bay Area Cypherpunks Meetings,
which DDT and I send out announcements for,
can also validate that "organization" is a rather strong term for them :-)

We don't have any officers - so the report becomes the null set.
And some of us belong to religions that forbid making oaths,
while the oaths you'd get from other non-officers are more like
   "<expletive deleted!> I'm not filling out this form"

California Secretary of State to look at the registry of
subversive organizations, which the last section of the law
says is public record and open to inspection.
