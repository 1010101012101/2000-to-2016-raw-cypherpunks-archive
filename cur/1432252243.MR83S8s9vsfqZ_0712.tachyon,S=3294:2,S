Good note. But if we apply the "aiding and abetting" clause, they can be
summarily executed together, saving the manpower.

I like this idea. An ounce of prevention...

Do we have the time? In long term, everyone will end up dead. I have
problems and I have them *now*. :(

Individuals, yes. For small subjects, cooperation is favorable mode of
operation, which counteracts the tendency to secretiveness.

Corporations, NO! Once these monsters get too big, they try to do every
dirty trick in the books and then some more to get and keep market share
and to raise the barriers to entry for the others as high as possible, and
to prevent everyone around to learn that their preciousss sssecretsss are
nothing more than poorly tested dirty hacks holding together with duct
tape and blobs of hot-melt glue. During last couple years, I developed
blind hate against them.

If we'll get this, and a set of decent rev-eng tools, I will scale down my
demands for officially sanctioned access. (I don't care how I get the
data, if I get the vendor to fax me the docs or have to visit my local
blackmarket dealer, the important thing is that I have the specs.)

...and the definition of ownership as physical possession. No "licensing".

...and then the Market will finally find some useful use for the
legislators. As a fertilizer.
