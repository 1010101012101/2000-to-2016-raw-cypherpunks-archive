Subject: [discuss] TV ALERT: TechTV Music Wars

Hey kids,

TechTV (Austin Digital Cable 239) is hosting a 2.5 hour special tonight
at 7:00 on file sharing issues, RIAA legal activities, etc.  They are
replaying it tomorrow night at 5:00PM and again Monday at 12:00P and
5:00PM.  I'll be taping it and will figure out the "right way" to share.

Via TechTV.com (techtv.com/musicwars):

Musicians, industry experts, and file traders break down the complicated
issues surrounding digital music. Watch today at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 6
p.m., and Monday 9/15 at 1 p.m. Eastern. By Steve Enders

Admit it: You're freaked out.

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is suing music
downloaders as young as 12 years old. The organization has already
busted college students for downloading. Subpoenas have been served
seeking information on grandparents, mothers, and fathers. No one is
safe, and many don't even know they've done anything wrong.

Friday, TechTV brings you "Music Wars," a special that gets you up to
speed on how we arrived at this point -- and where digital music is
headed. Don't miss this exclusive look at the state of music as only
TechTV can explain it. "Music Wars" also sets the stage for "Music Wars:
Open Mike," TechTV's live, town hall forum featuring industry
executives, legal experts, and artists. If you're a music fan, or if
you're just interested in the groundbreaking legal issues surrounding
the download debate, this is a night of television you won't want to
miss.

You'll meet the ultimate music fans, people who have shaped their lives
around the prevalence of digital music. You'll meet artists including
Liz Phair, Michelle Branch, and others who have put everything at stake
by making their music so readily available online. You'll be surprised
by their varying opinions and openness with TechTV. We'll take you
behind the scenes of the major legal music services available online,
the services trying to fill the vacuum left by the glut of P2P software,
and the trade of illegal, copyright music.

Finally, you'll meet the queen of KaZaA, Nikki Hemming. "Tech Live"
reporter Jim Goldman sat down with Hemming in her Australian
headquarters to discuss the ramifications of what she's helped create,
and the industry she's helped inflame.

Featured 'Music Wars' Segments

Celebrities Sing, Squawk, Swap
>From Ben Affleck to Sonic Youth, celebrities and music artists sound off
on file-swapping, and others just sound good. Check out our recent
interviews and in-studio performances.

Peer-to-Peer Explained
Amazing what some computer code can do. It's the software that nearly
brought the music industry to its knees. It's also the software that has
prompted the industry to come back fighting -- gloves off -- and file
hundreds of lawsuits. The software known as Napster, written by a 17
year old, has evolved since 1999. See where it's been and where it's
going, and find out why the music industry would like to see it stopped.

Download 101
Incoming students normally start college with a tour around campus. At
the University of California, Berkeley, incoming freshmen are getting a
lesson in downloading music from P2P networks. The message: Do it at
your own risk. We visit orientation to see what the program is all
about.

The Artists Speak
Liz Phair, Michelle Branch, Charlie Daniels, The Samples. They're
musicians with a diverse range of sounds, styles, and songs. They're
loved by millions around the world. They've also seen millions of their
songs downloaded from the Internet. But their opinions on file sharing
are as different as their music.

The Legal Alternative
When the RIAA began filing lawsuits against song swappers this week, it
also encouraged music fans to get their music the legal way using
services provided by Apple, BuyMusic.com, and Rhapsody. The services
offer thousands of good-quality songs, but are they the solution music
fans really want?
