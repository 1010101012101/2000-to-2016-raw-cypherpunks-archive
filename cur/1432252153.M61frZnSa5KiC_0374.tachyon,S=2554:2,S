Uhm. That's not really an entire operating system. Moreover it's  
implemented in Javascript, not in Java. Anyone got a reference for  
the Unix-like OS implementation atop of a JVM? I haven't heard of  
anyone trying to do a OS-on-top-of-a-JVM implementation since the  
failure of Sun's JavaOS [1].

Anyway. As far as I know, the JAP source code [1] contains some  
usable Java tor client implementation if you throw out all the GUI  
crap. Writing a TOR server implementation in Java shouldn't be so  
hard either.

Cheers,
Ralf
