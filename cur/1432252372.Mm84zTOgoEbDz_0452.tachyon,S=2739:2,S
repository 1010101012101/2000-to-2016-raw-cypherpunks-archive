I'm not a believer in a tree model, so I'm interested in exploring
residential-scale meshes with cheap (a GBIC is 100 EUR, or so, 
and stackable managed 48-port Netgears are 700 EUR, or around).

I'm interested in 1-10 GBit throughput for each individual customers
to any other individual customer, at least on the local loop. 
Throughput would decline over increased distance, of course.

I understand ATM mesh is an obsolete technology, with very limited
throughput. I heard something recently about Foundry switches with have
an advanced kind of STP, with active loops, not meshes, though.

Probably there are no commercial devices on the market which would
fit the description.
