Something I have seen a lot of is professional promotion of
obviously bogus "conspiracy theories" in forums where some of the
more embarrassing excesses of our Deep State and Security Service
get up to are openly and accurately discussed. Maybe it's just
advertising targeting a demographic; there's always a click-bait
website at the source. Or maybe it's stink-marking to repel fence
sitting Liberals who might be edging toward radicalization, or at
least help them remember that subjects they have been taught to
lie to themselves about are "things those ignorant idiots believe."

Either way, same result: The networks are a battlefield and those
who don't come prepared leave disinformed if not brainwashed. Twas
ever thus; what do you say to a person who asks you for a
"trustworthy and accurate news source"?

I tell them there ain't no such thing, and shove a copy of this in
their general direction in hope that it might occasionally do some
good:

Hope springs eternal...
