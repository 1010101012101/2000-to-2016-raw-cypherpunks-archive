...what does this have to do with cypherpunks?

I'm no fan of much of what this government does, but it gets old.  
Especially when that's not really within the scope of the list, unless 
there is a crypto or code aspect to it.  Also, using Russia Today as a 
primary source is like using Faux News or the National Enquirer tabloid 
(though the latter actually has gotten a few stories right.  Still not sure 
about BatBoy, though ;) )
