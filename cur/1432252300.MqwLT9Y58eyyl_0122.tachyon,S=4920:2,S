 Lessons Learned From the Battlefield

by Michael Gaddy

Recently by Michael Gaddy: Preparation

I continue to receive a large number of emails questioning what would be the
best instrument for communication in the event of a national emergency,
economic chaos or civil unrest on a massive scale. I believe the answer can
be found in what has worked, and not worked, for the Iraqi resistance. (I
refuse to call anyone fighting for their homes and families an insurgent)

In a great number of instances, communications has been the Achilles Heel of
the resistance in Iraq. They have learned to constantly change their modes
and methods of communication in order to keep their opponents off balance.

 The cell phone is the easiest and most preferred method of communication in
use by the modern day 4th Generation Warfare (4GW) participant; it is also
the easiest to exploit. First, remember SIM cards are exploitable and can and
will be used against you. It is possible to exploit a SIM card in 30 seconds
without the holder even knowing it, once your opponent has your phone number.
All that is needed to pinpoint location with a cell phone is 2 towers for
those who do not have a phone with GPS. There are also technologies that
allow the government to create false towers that seek out your phones
specific signal and will allow them to troll around an area until they get a
hit, and then it will lead them right to your location. These techniques have
been developed, tested, and used effectively in Iraq and Afghanistan. All the
opponent needs is your number, which gives them the specific signal to your
phone.

Counter measures are simple; never ever keep the phone on, or the battery in.
Never store numbers in the phone, always use throwaway cell phones and change
them often. Set up prearranged talk times, and always talk on the move. Never
talk in your home, or while you are stationary. Never ever send text
messages, and always talk in code on the phone. Hard line to hard line is the
best way to call if you can still find a pay phone.

 Radios of any kind are the same as cell phones, but will get you located
quicker. The opponents expect them to be used, and almost always have their
ears on. Todaybs military units have the ability to listen and pinpoint the
point of broadcast of any type communication device and jam it. Unless you
hardwire your area of operations (AO) with WWI field phones, keep your
messages short, sweet, and move quickly after you broadcast.

I warned here of new members to your group who advocate violence or offer to
provide weapons and/or explosives. Also be extremely cautious of any members
of your group who are gone for any period of time or those you know have been
contacted by the authorities. Even the most loyal can be coerced with threats
to family, etc.

Read and study 4GW tactics and strategies; these tactics have yet to be
defeated in modern military history. I highly recommend the series of books
written by Colonel John Poole on the subject. The Colonelbs works reveal a
detailed history of 4GW and a wealth of information that could prove
invaluable.

Author, Patriot, and LRC reader, Matthew Bracken, has written a trilogy of
novels on probable scenarios concerning civil unrest and its complications.
There is a wealth of information that can be gleaned from his works, as well
as some disturbing possibilities. Matt has laced his writing with interesting
characters that makes for an informative, entertaining, though sometimes
alarming read.

Those who prepare, educate and equip for the coming chaos will be those most
apt to protect themselves and their families. Remember, those who fail to
plan, plan to fail.
