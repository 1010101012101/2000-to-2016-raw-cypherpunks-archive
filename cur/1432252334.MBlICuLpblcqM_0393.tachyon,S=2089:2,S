lance is talking about encrypted archives, pgp'd messages, ssh and silc.
short version is that his honeypots install a kernelmod to log all the
IO buffers after decryption or before encryption and then fire them out
over the wire. there is another kernel mod to prevent the raw socket /
bpf / lpf / tap / ??? from seeing frames with a certain mac address.

i saw him at cansecwest last week - good talk as usual. the talk he gave
should be posted to www.cansecwest.com shortly...
