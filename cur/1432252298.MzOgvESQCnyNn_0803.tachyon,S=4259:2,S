Nonsense. I wrote a very long essay. Aimee twittered about her "prime 
rib" SS contacts, muttered about going out to "talk to the snails," and 
gibbered about how my mention of BlackNet could expose me to "suicide" 
and was a generally scary idea.

You're being overly paranoid. I was stopped by the SS a few years ago 
and accused of planting a bomb to kill the First Criminal, his 
traitorous wife, and their (mostly innocent, insipidly so) daughter 
Chelsea. When they couldn't make their charges stick, they had to let me 
go.

(This is why I take bomb-making discussions pretty seriously.)

Get an education. Do some reading. These ideas have been discussed many 
times. Aimee's all atwitter over being exposed to ideas that were old 
even in 1992, and you, the "sensitive male" (so I gather from you 
airy-fairy, probably polyamoristic, twit site), are enabling her 
fluttering by saying "Tim, you should not even mention such dangerous 
ideas!"

Fuck that. Read what we were talking about 10 years ago. Not talking 
about things doesn't make them disappear.

You're a disgrace to this list. At lease Aimee has the excuse of being a 
confused chick.
