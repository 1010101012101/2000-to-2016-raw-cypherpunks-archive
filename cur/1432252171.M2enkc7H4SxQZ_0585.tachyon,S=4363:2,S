  The BRCA genes are only transmitted through the mother, but
  there are many others that go through both lines.

  With most genes there is not a 100% chance that any one person
  will suffer, although there are few. One measurement is the PPV,
  Positive Predictive Value, which gets to estimate the probability
  that the problem gene will actually cause the problem. Trouble is,
  it's real hard to get the PPV right. No one really knows how to
  do it, so the insurance companies just say to any possibility, no
  matter how remote.

   While I agree completely, you might be surprised at just how
   many people don't want to know and will get upset if you spoil
   the surprise by telling them.

  Unintended side effects are all but guaranteed :(  The tinkering 
  will resemble eugenics at the building block level. Eliminating genetic
  diseases will be great, but introducing other things might not be, just
  as eliminating some things might be bad.

   This already happens - selecting your mate has more procedures
   if youare in line for a spot as king somewhere.

  I have to disagree here. Medical insurance is not the same as life
  or car insurance. It was all supposed to be a big pool that we would
  draw on when needed. By skimmimng the cream, infant mortality rates
  rise, along with a host of other problems.

  Well, yes, but the corporations are becoming part of their own state...

                cheers, bob
