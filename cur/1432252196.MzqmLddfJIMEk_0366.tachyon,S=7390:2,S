Sure, I agree that 98+% of what's out there is crap. That's why it's useful 
to examine sources (like the book I mentioned) consisting of primary 
documents. Ditch the nutcase exegesis and see for yourself: not perfectly 
reliable by any means but at least it circumvents a lot of the paranoid 
hype...

I think MK-ULTRA is the project the "evil CIA mind rays" people hang their 
hat on; you're even more unlikely to find reasonable commentary on that 
one. Embarassing, really.

True: but then there's always the gray area of exactly what's done in the 
name of "what bad people deserve" that keeps me uneasy about the whole 
thing. Have you read Gordon Thomas' book about the Mossad, "Gideon's 
Spies"? He was allowed to interview all the top agency people, so you can 
be sure nothing got out the agency didn't want out. Even still, it's a 
fascinating, hard-hitting look at what happens when an organization of 
brilliant, ruthless people come to exist in a system with limited 
accountability: hardcore realpolitik at its most elemental. Interesting to 
compare to the way things get done (and don't get done)in the US. For 
instance, they don't have any qualms at all about using state-sponsored 
asassination a tool of policy--it gets the job done, but at what price? How 
much of a difference does it make that they face a near-immediate threat 
from all sides; if the same became true of the US would it somehow become a 
more appropriate strategy? No easy answers.

Besides the obvious hypocricy, part of that comes from the unfortunate 
tendency to care about "what's close to home" at the expense of a more 
significant larger picture. Come to think of it, I can't believe more isn't 
on the web about the horrors of the Stasi; did you catch the stories about 
how they contaminated people with radiation as a form of tracking and had a 
huge collection of little jars containing scent samples of all dissidents, 
in case they needed to round them up? Horrible, check it out.

I don't know if that's really true of the US, I'm sure it depends on which 
agency you're talking about. Given that the NSA is so much larger than the 
rest of the agencies combined, it stands to reason that tips the scale 
toward "foreign", but I could be wrong. Not something you can really know 
without hard data.

No doubt, chalk it up to the crap factor.  The original documents say a lot 
though.
