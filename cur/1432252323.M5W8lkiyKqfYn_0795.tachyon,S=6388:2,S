a choice excerpt:

"""
The FBI—which is listed as the “responsible agency” for surveillance
on the five men—has a controversial record when it comes to the ethnic
profiling of Muslim-Americans. According to FBI training materials
uncovered by Wired in 2011, the bureau taught agents to treat
“mainstream” Muslims as supporters of terrorism, to view charitable
donations by Muslims as “a funding mechanism for combat,” and to view
Islam itself as a “Death Star” that must be destroyed if terrorism is
to be contained.

John Guandolo, a former FBI counterterrorism official who takes credit
for developing a training program for agents on the “Muslim
Brotherhood and their subversive movement in the United States,” told
The Intercept that he participated in investigations of some of the
individuals whose email accounts were monitored. Echoing the “red
under every bed” hysteria of the McCarthy era, Guandolo believes that
“hundreds” of covert members of the Muslim Brotherhood are active in
the United States, that some of them have succeeded in infiltrating
the Pentagon, and that CIA director John Brennan is a secret Muslim.

Other former and current federal officials say such beliefs are not
representative of the FBI or Justice Department. But blatant prejudice
against Muslim-Americans is also documented in the Snowden archive.

In one 2005 document, intelligence community personnel are instructed
how to properly format internal memos to justify FISA surveillance. In
the place where the target’s real name would go, the memo offers a
fake name as a placeholder: “Mohammed Raghead.”
