Not at all.

It does no such thing (unless of course you have a psychological
disposition to the use of force).

Created from what? To create something implies you had something to start
with. Specious point.

It does no such thing. In fact the more stuff you collect the bigger
target you become and a larger percentage of your stuff is needed to
protect your stuff. Not to mention that at some point the amount of stuff
you collect deprives others of stuff they need to survive (or do you
believe you're the only one who as that 'right'? - probably).

The reality is that this viewpoint is a self-defeating view. It may work
in the very short term but in the long run there is no way this will solve
anything.

What society does that? Not even ours guarantees this. It does recognise
that our creator gave us rights and that we create governments to -secure-
(not guarantee) them.

The only relevant question is secure them from whom?

Really, those are the only two options? Somehow I suspect that says more
about you than the world out 'there'.

Really? Why? There are more than one definitions of liberty. The concept
you're completely missing in this line of argument is 'consent'.

Can they? Or do they spend the rest of their life trying to keep it? The
reality is that a lot of the stuff that you think is 'yours' is only
becuase it isn't worth anybody elses trouble to take it from you.

And then one has to ask if that person who is especially good at
collecting stuff didn't do it at the expense of others.

What is this 'retire' you keep talking about, you retiring from life or
employment by others? Not the same thing. Stuff might help you in the
latter case, it's worthless in the former.

And the value and utility of all that stuff rests on one thing, the
stability of the system you used to collect it. If that changes all that
stuff may in fact become worthless. So, at least to some degree to protect
your stuff you deprive others of their opportunity to change the society
they are in to the way they feel most comfortable with.

So, to 'guarantee' your 'stuff' you -must- deprive others of an
opportunity to collect their stuff.
