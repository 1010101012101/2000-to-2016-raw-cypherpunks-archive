But that's not the speech but the consequence of the speech. No, you
should be held to an a priori 'no lie' standard. But if by that
lie you are damaging, and intent should aggravage the crime, another
person by the change in behaviour of anonymous 3rd parties then how is
holding the speaker accountable for those consequences a limit on their
speech? How does that justify saying 'you can't lie'? Aren't there times
when lying is the only way not to hurt persons (rare as it is, if it
exists we must allow that if we hold that hurting people is wrong).

You're an asshole (not really, keep reading). Ridicule is political speech
and should be protected. Now my stating to another 3rd party that you're a
baby raper and as a consequence you lose your business is a whole other
situation. It's not the speech that should be punished, it should be my
acting with intent to harm. That speech might be involved is really
irrelevant.

As long as it exists the work is not done.

It's worth observing that to Hitler, he made sense. (and no, I am NOT
drawing any sort of conclusion, simply saying the 'I and I' is not the end
all).
