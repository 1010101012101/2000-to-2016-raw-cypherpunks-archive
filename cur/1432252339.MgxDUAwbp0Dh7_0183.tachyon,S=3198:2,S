Cool.

Hmm, I wonder if the VoIP standard is open enough that fully compatible 
linux implementations could be made and integrated with ALSA...  I'm sure a 
simple analog circuit could be used to get an rj11 phone jack attached to 
audio in/out once this is done...

Shouldn't be a problem if you go the Solaris route and use tmpfs/swapfs 
with no real swap.  (For those that don't know, Solaris mounts /tmp into 
virtual memor space, so if you've got tons of RAM, data written in /tmp is 
actually written in RAM.)

I've had very good luck with OBSD so far (knock on fake wood?)...  I'm very 
happy with pf... much nicer than iptables...  I haven't used SELinux as a 
firewall, but have experimented with it.  It's excellent in terms of 
security (if you don't mind the huge failure logs), but, it's a bitch to 
configure properly...

I'd go for something between UML (User Mode Linux) and SELinux.  Use 
SELINUX as the main host and UML to partition off untrusted applications in 
sandboxes (i.e. to run apache, etc.)
