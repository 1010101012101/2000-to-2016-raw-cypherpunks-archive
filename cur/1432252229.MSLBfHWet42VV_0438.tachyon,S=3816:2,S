It's a link from the ebay splash page,
so it's "high profile".

Is it DeCSS?

There is no practical way to "just" burn DVDs onto CDs for subsequent viewing. 
 Without compressing, and lowering the resolution, the data volume is prohibitive 
(6GB or more).  That's not to say this compression will yield poor results 
if done properly.  Most consumer DVD players support the Video CD format 
(VCD) and many an enhanced format SVCD.  SVCD, a standard from Philips, 
has a peak data rate of about 2.6Mbps, compared to DVD's 8Mbps.  Feature 
length movies generally fit on three 80 minute CDs. Audio quality is excellent 
(Dolby surround is supported).  Subjectively, I think SVCD video quality 
(if mastered correctly from a DVD) is better than SVHS.  These SVCDs can 
also be viewed on PCs.

free) and techniques.
