Well, I think this is the case 99% of the time, but I don't think it has to 
be. When most of the earlier scriptures were written, they probably served a 
function vaguely similar to modern Journals now....a place were insights 
were recorded so that others could build on the knoweldge base (if we ignore 
considerations of whether the 'insights' correspond to reality, the analogy 
with Journals is even more apropos.

Mostly, though, I agree. No wait, maybe I don't. Modern organized religion 
is more about stegoing control commands into 'religious' teaching so as to 
get the masses to support the status quo. For instance, "God wanted us to 
invade Iraq because he loves us and our Christian country and hates Saddam 
because he is evil". Actually, more than control signals there are messages 
that inform the pious that their self-interest is at stake, and they don't 
need to bother themselves with the morality of the war on US foreign policy, 
etc...
