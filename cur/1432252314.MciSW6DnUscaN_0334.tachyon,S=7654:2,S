Microsoft won because of superior reviews? Come on, how stupid do you 
think we are?  So if a company pays for glowing reviews that would be 
okay?  Obviously they have never tried to sell a product.  It's very 
dificult to get consideration such that you could prove the technical 
merits when there is a large existing supplier.  It's much worse when the 
client knows that that supplier has a long history of targetting 
'upstart' companies and destroying them.  Support and upgradeability are 
important features that require a company to continue operating.  

I'll admit that the trial was fucked up from the start by the decision to 
center it around netscape rather than something more blatant like stac.  
Anyways, this has nothing to do with FC, unless you think that enterprise 
is fundamentally expressive and Microsoft's vicious suppression of 
competition has limited the ability of others to be heard.
