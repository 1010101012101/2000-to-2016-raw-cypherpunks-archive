There is indeed a private toll road, Highway 73 going from a point near 
San Juan Capistrano to a point near Irvine. It passes mostly through 
part of the former Irvine Ranch, mostly uninhabited. Basically, 
contiguous with part of the Laguna Hills. (Consult a map if interested. 
Yahoo will show it by entering "Irvine, CA".)

I've taken it a few times, at the suggestion of my younger brother, 
ever-impatient with any delays. We did not take it during rush hour 
periods. Frankly, it cut a few miles off the normal I-5 route, and was 
slightly faster.

This private toll road would be very hard to build in any other place, 
as the ownership of the large tract of undeveloped land made it 
possible. Private developers rarely are granted eminent domain (seizure 
of lands or property for the people's democratic socialist use) and it 
is virtually impossible to conceive of a developer acquiring rights of 
way for a highway through thousands of farms, houses, ranches, schools, 
shops, etc.

(I know about auctions, but there are some markets that don't "clear." 
There are people who simply refuse to sell. Even when The Donald 
(Trump) sought to build a casino in Atlantic City there was one parcel 
owner who refused to sell. Once the state of NJ refused to condemn the 
property to give it to the Donald, he built _around_ it on three sides.)

Even when the population was a fraction of what it is today, this was a 
problem building railroads. Of course, though the books on free 
enterprise are light on mentioning this, the private railroads got the 
land rights by coercion, threats, burning out settlers, bribing state 
officials, etc. "Blazing Saddles" was not far off the mark.

Today, a private toll road could basically not been be built in areas 
where they are most needed. Q.E.D.

As I discussed in my reply yesterday, people don't rally enthusiasm for 
things which are just not going to  happen anyway, anywhich, anyhoo.

And any emergent enthusiasm would be met with a vast counter-reaction 
from the neighbors, the affected land owners, etc.
