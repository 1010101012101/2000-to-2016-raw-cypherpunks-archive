The US military has issued a most-wanted list of 55 former leaders in 
Saddam Hussein's regime to be pursued, captured or killed.

...
Brooks did not identify figures on the list, except to suggest they 
included Saddam and his minister of information, Mohammed Saeed 
al-Sahhaf, who boasted of battlefield successes right up to the time he 
disappeared Tuesday.

Information ministers as war criminals?   Careful with that hegemony, 
George.
