I think, that one important and simple tool that will remain useful for
the next decades is Analog Audio Encryption.
Radio & Analog communications are simple to implement and very useful
for good and for bad, but I think that what will keep this technology
live for situations, like wars, conflicts, protests etc, will be the use
of Audio Encryption over Radio & Analog communications.

Best Regards

Yap
