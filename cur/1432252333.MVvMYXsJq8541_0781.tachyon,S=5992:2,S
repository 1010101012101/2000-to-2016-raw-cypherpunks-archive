I think it's unclear, perhaps even intentionally ambiguous.

One way of reading the executive order (that section of it, at least)
is that it preserves the ability of the DoD to try members of the
military in a different form of tribunal that might have more
procedural safeguards, and that it preserves the authority of civilian
courts. That is the more, um, benign interpretation.

The other interpretation is that Bush does not want to limit the power
of the military to try civilian U.S. citizens in some cases, subject
to "lawful authority."

The thing is, though, that if Bush intends to try the second approach,
focusing on that paragraph is maybe misguided: If he's daring enough
to do it without explicit Congressional sanction, then he can just
sign another exeucitve order. Only take him a few minutes to write one
and scribble his signature.
