I'm missing something here.  How is it even possible for an anonymous 
plaintiff to show defamation?  Defamation is identity-linked.

Hrm.  Okay, "related case" - so this company isn't actually anonymous, 
it's pseudonymous.  Still, unless they've got reputation capital in 
the pseudonym (and it doesn't sound like they do), defamation against 
it just doesn't scan.

Duh.  They expected him to betray trust, I suppose?

Hmmm.  I'm not a lawyer, but I think that's over-broad.  I'd agree 
with an anonymous plaintiff having no subpeona power in a *defamation* 
case, because until the identity is known the crime cannot be 
assessed.  But this reads like they intend for this test to apply 
in *all* cases, and that's probably not right.  Also, this sounds 
more like a pseudonymous plaintiff than an anonymous one, and there 
*is* such a thing as defamation against a pseudonym. 

Also, there's a real question here.  Say I've got a pseudonym such 
as my unsigned PGP key, and I've been using it for years.  Now 
someone says "messages signed by this key are from a child 
molesting sodomite." 

On the one hand, there's a defamation case because the pseudonym's 
value is reduced.  It loses a lot of reputation capital.  

On the other hand, if I now step forward and say "Excuse me, that's 
my key and I never molested a child in my life -- and I've also 
never been to the mideast, let alone the city of Sodom...", my 
identity is linked to the pseudonym, which damages its value 
further.  Also, I may suffer "extraordinary harm" as a result -- 
there still being people here and there who think stoning anyone 
suspected of child molesting is better than finding out whether 
it's actually true.  

The precedent seems to indicate that a pseudonym cannot be defended
under the law.  It can only be destroyed.

The wording of the decision seems to indicate that the judge does 
not understand the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity.
