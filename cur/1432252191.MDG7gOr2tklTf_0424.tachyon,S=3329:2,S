It all depends on your view of intellectual property.

I license photos to news organizations and other publishers. I've
licensed about $250 worth of them in three (admittedly relatively
low-value each) transactions today. If forced by the government to
license my photos at a certain rate, in principle I wouldn't be
thrilled. In practice it would depend on the per-photo rate, but
somehow I think I can do a better job of negotiating on my own. Also I
would not expect to be able to influence the Copyright Office to see
things my way in the first place.
