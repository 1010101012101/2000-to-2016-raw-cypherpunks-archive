My first thought:  What's to prevent the markets for contract hits
on websites and public figures from being monitored by potential
victims, and the bounties stolen by 'anonymous' parties, a.k.a.
the proposed victims themselves, by simulating the trigger
conditions for payouts?

Really unpopular people could anonymously crowdfund actions
against themselves then collect the loot, a nearly perfect crime.

Ultimately, human judgment must have veto power over the automated
decision processes - which would void the concept of an
impersonal, automated payout process, bringing the reinvented
wheel full circle.
