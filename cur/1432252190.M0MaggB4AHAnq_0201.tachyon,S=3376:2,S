Also, designing new crypto protocols, or analyzing old ones used in odd
ways, is mostly useful for companies that are offering some new service on
the net, or doing some wildly new thing.  Many of the obvious new things
have been done, for better or worse, and few companies are able to get
funding for whatever cool new ideas they may have for the net, good or bad.
 And without funding, people are a lot more likely to either decide to do
the security themselves, apply openSSL and a lot of duct tape and hope for
the best, or just ignore security.  Sure, it may cost a lot later, but
they're going broke *now*.
