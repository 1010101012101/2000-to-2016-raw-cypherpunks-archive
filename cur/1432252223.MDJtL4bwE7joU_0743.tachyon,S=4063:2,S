 >>What I am arguing in this book is that the major source of structural 
change
in this society--the change in the mode of innovation in the relation of
science to technology and in public policy-- is the change in the character of
of knowledge: the exponential growth and branching of science, the rise of a
new intellectual technology, the creation of systematic research through R&D
budgets, and as the calyx of all this, the codification of theoretical
knowledge."
Any thoughts? Also, I'd be interested in any other authors (and recommended
works)you find useful re. these issues... thanks!
