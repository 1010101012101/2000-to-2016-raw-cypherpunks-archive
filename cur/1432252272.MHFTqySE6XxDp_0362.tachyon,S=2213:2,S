A challenge that these days most people meet, and a 
distressingly large number of people more than meet.  iIt used 
to the be that the third world was visibly getting less skinny. 
Now it is visibly getting fatter.

I could post statistics, but better still, you should look 
through the photos posted by a chinese introduction agency. 
Search for Indonesian and Chinese.   They are not as fat as us 
westerners, but they are still too damned fat.
