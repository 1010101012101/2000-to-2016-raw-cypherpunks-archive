Worldbs First Flying File-Sharing Drones in Action

March 20, 2012

https://torrentfreak.com/worlds-first-flying-file-sharing-drones-in-action-120320/

A few days ago The Pirate Bay announced that in future parts of its site  
could be hosted on GPS controlled drones. To many this may have sounded  
like a joke, but in fact these pirate drones already exist. Project  
bElectronic Countermeasuresb has built a swarm of five fully operational  
drones which prove that an baerial Napsterb or an bairborne Pirate Bayb is 
not as futuristic as it sounds.

In an ever-continuing effort to thwart censorship, The Pirate Bay
plans to turn flying drones into mobile hosting locations.

bEveryone knows WHAT TPB is. Now theybre going to have to think about  
WHERE TPB is,b The Pirate Bay team told TorrentFreak last Sunday,  
announcing their drone project.

Liam Young, co-founder of Tomorrowbs Thoughts Today, was amazed to read  
the announcement, not so much because of the technology, because his group 
has already built a swarm of file-sharing drones.

bI thought hold on, we are already doing that,b Young told TorrentFreak.

Their starting point for project bElectronic Countermeasuresb was to  
create something akin to an baerial Napsterb or bairborne Pirate Bayb, but 
it became much more than that.

bPart nomadic infrastructure and part robotic swarm, we have rebuilt and  
programmed the drones to broadcast their own local Wi-Fi network as a form 
of aerial Napster. They swarm into formation, broadcasting their pirate 
network, and then disperse, escaping detection, only to reform elsewhere,b 
says the group describing their creation.

In short the system allows the public to share data with the help of  
flying drones. Much like the Pirate Box, but one that flies autonomously  
over the city.

bThe public can upload files, photos and share data with one another as  
the drones float above the significant public spaces of the city. The  
swarm becomes a pirate broadcast network, a mobile infrastructure that  
passers-by can interact with,b the creators explain.

One major difference compared to more traditional file-sharing hubs is  
that it requires a hefty investment. Each of the drones costs 1500 euros  
to build. Not a big surprise, considering the hardware thatbs needed to  
keep these pirate hubs in the air.

bEach one is powered by 2x 2200mAh LiPo batteries. The lift is provided by 
4x Roxxy Brushless Motors that run off a GPS flight control board. Also on 
deck are altitude sensors and gyros that keep the flight stable. They all 
talk to a master control system through XBee wireless modules,b Young told 
TorrentFreak.

bThese all sit on a 10mm x 10mm aluminum frame and are wrapped in a vacuum 
formed aerodynamic cowling. The network is broadcast using various 
different hardware setups ranging from Linux gumstick modules, wireless 
routers and USB sticks for file storage.b

For Young and his crew this is just the beginning. With proper financial  
support they hope to build more drones and increase the range they can  
cover.

bWe are planning on scaling up the system by increasing broadcast range  
and building more drones for the flock. We are also building in other  
systems like autonomous battery change bases. We are looking for funding  
and backers to assist us in scaling up the system,b he told us.

Those who see the drones in action (video below) will notice that theybre 
not just practical. The creative and artistic background of the group 
shines through, with the choreography performed by the drones perhaps even 
more stunning than the sharing component.

bWhen the audience interacts with the drones they glow with vibrant  
colors, they break formation, they are called over and their flight  
pattern becomes more dramatic and expressive,b the group explains.

Besides the artistic value, the drones can also have other use cases than 
being a bpirate hub.b For example, they can serve as peer-to-peer  
communications support for protesters and activists in regions where  
Internet access is censored.

Either way, whether itbs Hollywood or a dictator, there will always be  
groups that have a reason to shoot the machines down. But letbs be honest, 
who would dare to destroy such a beautiful piece of art?
