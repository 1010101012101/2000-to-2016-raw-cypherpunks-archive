Wouldn't be surprised if they just "re-adjust" to a new market equilibrium.
Windows10 easily has the best usability and compatibility. Reliability
seems nominal (on par with other OS'es), meaning horrid.

Office is still an absolute bestseller.

Microsoft is a big player in the console/games business.

The .net ecosystem is the most evolved/advanced of all ecosystems -
 encompassing pretty much all types of programming, platforms, etc. powered
by the amazing Visual Studio.

They finally rebranded Internet Explorer into Edge, and decided it's also a
good time to push the browser old-school style.

Bing is offering better and better search results. (Maybe just because
Google seems to be getting worse, and definitely less interesting)

Windows Phone and that whole mess still has the potential to do what
Microsoft always does: slowly but steadily improve to acceptable. People
are surprisingly eager for it to work out; many being burned either on
expensive Apple hardware with wacky limitations, or glitchy and
inconsistent Android devices.

This can change really fast - one or two manufacturers offering Windows
Phone can provide significance pretty fast. If the device is right, and the
price is low.

This is an interesting statement. Certainly Microsoft is "the evil we
know". It's evil is the salesmanship that made it huge - and the software
not as geeky as we like.

I think most users do not lack the intelligence/capability to understand,
merely the desire to. They do not see any need, and do not have the "means
to learn". When is the last time a manual told you anything useful? The
best kind of education most people employ isn't even articles - it's poorly
produced youtube videos.

We've lost the "complete broadcast" that TV and newspapers pretty much
guaranteed. The mediums we got in return are exceedingly confusing (unclear
in intent and purpose) and "narrow" (little bandwidth). I'm still waiting
for #nextgen newsreporting.
