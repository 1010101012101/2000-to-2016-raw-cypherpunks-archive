Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.

Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
<https://www.torproject.org/> is tantamount to false advertising:

| Anonymity Online
|
| Protect your privacy. Defend yourself against network surveillance
| and traffic analysis.

Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
bullshit.

| Tor prevents people from learning your location or browsing habits.

It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.

Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.

It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.

Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)

I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.

It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.

Which VPNs have received NSLs?

Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.
