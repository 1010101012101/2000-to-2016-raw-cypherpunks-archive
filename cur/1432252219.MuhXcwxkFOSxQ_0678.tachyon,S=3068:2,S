Munich Re sounds more likely. Let me check the Web...

Yep, Munich Re was one of them:

"The stocks of the three reinsurance companies  AXA in France, Munich
Re in Germany and Swiss Re in Switzerland  dropped 13 percent to 15
percent in the week before the attack.
       Analysts suggested at the time that the drops were anomalous 
unexplained  since the reinsurance business was healthy and premium
payments were on the way up. "
