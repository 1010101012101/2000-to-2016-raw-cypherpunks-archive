Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. If in doubt, mumble He who wants to do good, knocks at the gate, he who loves finds the gates open Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  All beginning is difficult The first million is the hardest  The first step is the hardest. Life is just a bowl of cherries Imagination is the highest kite you can fly A child is a person who can dismantle in 5 minutes the toy it took you 5 hours to put together.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth Christmas comes but once a year What goes up must come down Turtle can't walk if he nah push he head outa he shell. There is no time like the present Revenge is a dish best served cold A hairy man is a happy man, a hairy wife is a witch. 

Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing All good things come to he who waits  A stitch in time saves nine. Spare the rod and spoil the child Lend your money and lose your friend Procrastination is the thief of time Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit  Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you The devil tempts all, but the idle man tempts the devil He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped Everything comes to him who waits Faith will move mountains. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. The Best Fish Swim Near the Bottom
Nothing is interesting if you are not interested  There but for the grace of God go I  Nah every big head get sense. You get what you give as wrinkled as an elephant's hide I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face.  Nothing succeeds like success 
He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard Fight truth decay, read the bible  God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers  The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.  A person who can smile when things go wrong has found someone to blame it on.
