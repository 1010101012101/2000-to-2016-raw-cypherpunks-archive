Dave Cummings posts: If any of you have involved any government authorities 
in any aspect of the past emails from pornstar hater, zodia killer (aka: 
bryan sullivan?), please let FBI Special Agent Mike Wagoner at the San 
Diego FBI office (858-499-7736) know so that he can contact those agencies 
and integrate information and coordinate with them on any ongoing 
investigations the San Diego FBI has now opened an active investigation 
into the below email, and others of a threatening nature that seem of 
concern to them. I've advised FBI Agent Wagoner that there was a posting a 
few months ago about the St Louis FBI office supposedly having contacted 
the individual; I also advised him that I reported the below email to the 
Army's Criminal Investigative Division and Department of Defense, in case 
"war crimes" might be involved. And, that my copy of the "Chad Luke" latter 
was faxed, as requested by them, to Postal Inspectors (just in case, as 
some folks have speculated, the letters many of us received might possibly 
have actually been from bryan sullivan). The FBI asked that I place my 
letter and envelope into a sealed plastic bag in case it might later be 
needed for examination for fingerprints and
other tracings of evidence--if you still have your copy, you might want to 
do likewise? If sullivan gets wind of this email, I imagine that there 
might soon be emails forthcoming from him (possibly disguised as another 
name/sender?) with disparaging remarks about me; but, though I strongly and 
wholeheartedly defend his right of free speech and right to voice his 
opinions, I feel that we all have a responsibility to report info of a 
possible criminal nature to the authorities.
Again, so that the FBI has access to ALL info that might be being processed 
presently by other agencies, please advise FBI Agent Wagoner of anything 
you might have initiated--to email him, use sandiego@fbi.gov and make the 
subject "For Special Agent Mike Wagoner", or phone him at 858-499-7736
If any of you have received any emails from Mr Sullivan in the last three 
weeks (I have NOT), would you forward them to me---I'll then forward one 
copy of each new email to Agent Wagoner (in that way, he's not getting 
separate emails from many of us, all with the same info).
I also advised the FBI that one of the Internet writers might have a copy 
of the (posted) email Sullivan sent to him regarding the past visit he 
received from the FBI--they are interested in seeing Sullivan's comments. I 
gave him the phone number to the writer who probably has it in his files. Dave
Gene sez: Coincidentally to the fact, I just received a call from agent 
Wagoner and will be of assistance in any way possible. Now I have a reason. 
Person or persons [Sullivan?] is using my name to send viruses to select 
people in the business.End.
As long as the filth is there,why not use the fucks for some honest labor.I 
have done this myself once when assaulted and its Mongo approved.Mind you 
APster IS the future of law enforcement.
