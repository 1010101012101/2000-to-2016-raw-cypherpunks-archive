I'll see you your email address and raise you a non-published one.
I'd like to thank Earthlink for leaving SMTP VRFY on for so long after
I signed up with them just to have a way to dial-in while on the road
constantly (read: never, ever used the address anywhere except
internally to Earthlin).  I also get tons of spam to it.  A few days
ago, I got a bounce to it, from Yahoo, about a bunch of disabled
addresses I supposedly sent mail to...

Relevant link to someone else who's been more vocal about this:
"My Short Life As An Unintentional Porn Spammer" by Mike Masnick
<http://www.politechbot.com/p-04445.html>

(though I originally saw it on slashdot, but then, people who give a
damn about slashdot have already seen the /. url, while everyone else
is likely sick to death of message after message being sent here with
just a /. link and a title, if they haven't killfiled the most
prolific sender already)

My opinions are mine alone, even if you should be sharing them.
