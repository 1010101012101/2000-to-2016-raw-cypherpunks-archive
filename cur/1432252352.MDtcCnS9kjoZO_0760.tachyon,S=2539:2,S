In the area of electronic design, there are an estimated 100 reverse engineering shops in the US
approximately 70 percent of these are funded by government(s), and many of the techniques developed are
leaked, or even published, to the industry. The American Society for Industrial Secrets estimates that in the
US alone, trade secret theft is in excess of $2 billion per month.
