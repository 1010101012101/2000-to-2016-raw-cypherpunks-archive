Hi!  If it's a major milestone, can you tell us what the system is,
and something about the difference between the old and new?
I don't have a login, and guessing trivial passwords didn't get me in,
and the "News" section mainly referred to bug fixes etc.

I'm guessing it probably has something to do with payments?
