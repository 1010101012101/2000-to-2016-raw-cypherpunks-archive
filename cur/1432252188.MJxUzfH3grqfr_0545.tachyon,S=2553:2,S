UTSA sponsoring Texas Security Symposium

The University of Texas at San Antonio Center for Infrastructure Assurance
and Security (CIAS) is sponsoring a Texas Security Symposium on Aug. 8 in
the Laurel Room of the University Center at the school's Loop 1604 campus.


Speaking at the symposium will be Robert Weaver, deputy special agent in
charge of the New York Electronic Crimes Task Force for the United State
Secret Service. At the symposium topics covered include reports on the state
of Texas' infrastructure protection, security exercises and the "Dark
Screen" project. Breakout sessions will be offered in both executive and
technical tracks.

In 2001 CIAS was established to leverage San Antonio's infrastructure
assurance strengths and to bolster research and educational initiatives in
this field. The multidisciplinary research center partners with the San
Antonio community to address the technical and policy issues of information
assurance.

The registration cost of the daylong conference is $100. For more
information and to register for symposium, visit the CIAS web site at
