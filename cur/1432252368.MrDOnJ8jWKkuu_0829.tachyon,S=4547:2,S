Tim said that in a free society she wouldn't be able to sue.
Jim said that Tim is entirely wrong, that in a free society
she wouldn't be able to sue.   It's true that they give different
reasons, but I can't see that there's a fundamental conflict here.

Also, Jim says that "Democratic theory demands that..."
Theories don't demand things, people do, but most people who
like democracy demand that whatever the majority wants, it gets.
(And some say, it ought to get it good and hard.)

Some theories about democracy say that this will always be good,
because most people are mostly good; some say that this will be
inherently right because it's what Da People want; some say that
it may not be all that good but you can do a lot worse with most
of the available alternatives, and that if you don't settle for that
the worse alternatives will take over.


Tim, on the other hand, believes that in a free society
that if you want to run a business you can (or at least you can try).
Jim repeatedly asserts that running a business is a privilege
that somebody, I guess Da Majority, graciously grants you,
and can take away if they want, and that it's somehow not 
part of freedom.
				Thanks!
