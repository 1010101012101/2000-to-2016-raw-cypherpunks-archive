Terrorist attacks in US - Intelligence memo points to Mossad link

LONDON: A US military intelligence source revealed details of an internal
intelligence memo that points to the Israeli Mossad intelligence service
having links to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.

The intelligence source, who requested his name be withheld, confirmed the
internal US intelligence memo circulated four weeks ago described
information that pointed to the threat of a covert Israeli operation on US
soil to turn mass public opinion against Palestinian Arabs via an apparent
terrorist attack on US interests that would give Israel the green light to
implement a large scale military onslaught against the Palestinian Arab
population.

The 11 September attack has been described by experts as being too
sophisticated for a lone terrorist group to execute.

"This attack required a high level of military precision and the resources
of an advanced intelligence agency.

In addition, the attackers would have needed to be extremely familiar with
both air force one flight operations, civil airline flight paths and aerial
assault tactics on sensitive US cities like Washington, Stated David Stern
an expert on Israeli intelligence operations.

The attacks targeted the Pentagon, World Trade Center towers, with the White
House and air force also being targets according to the FBI.

"The attacks have certainly turned US public opinion firmly back in Israel's
favour after 11 months of Palestinian uprising, heavy criticism of Israel
over war crimes allegations and racism by a UN conference in Durban.

The attacks serve no Arab group or nation's interests but their timing came
in the midst of international condemnation of Israel for its policy of death
squad assassination of Palestinian political and police figures", added
Stern.

If verified, the news of Israel's involvement in the US attack welcome as no
surprise to intelligence experts.

The state of Israel has a long history of covert operations against Western
targets with attacks on the King David Hotel, USS Liberty, murder of a
Scandinavian UN envoy as well as espionage against the US during the
Jonathan Pollard case.

On Wednesday the US defence Department issued a warning to its officials to
halt the leak of information on the investigation which it says is happening
on a daily basis since the attacks occurred.
