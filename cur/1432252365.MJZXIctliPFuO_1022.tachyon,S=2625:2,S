One of the ways to mitigate this risk is to set up your remailer in
middleman mode (at least in 2.9beta23). To quote from the installer: 

     Mixmaster can be installed in the low-maintenance 
     `middleman' mode. In that mode, it will send mail to 
     other remailers only, to avoid complaints about 
     anonymous messages.
                                      
Obviously this isn't a perfect solution, but it helps somewhat. It's what
I'm planning on doing until I can familiarize myself with the legal
ramifications of running an "open" remailer.
