The Portuguese newspaper Expresso, in reporting yesterday
on various documents discovered in Kandahar (including a
plan to Daisy Cutter London) says there was a manual for PGP. 

The paper commented that Congress had tried to ban PGP 
because it might be used by terrorists.

Wonder if there are publics keys in the registries for AF?

Better, will Zimmermann at long last face a tribunal for
perfidy?
