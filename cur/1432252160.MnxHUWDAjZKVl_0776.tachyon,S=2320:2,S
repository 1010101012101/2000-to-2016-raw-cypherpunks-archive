Don't ever respond to a jury summons by showing up or calling
in. If you do then you'll forever be in the sucker-responsive data 
base.

The warnings in summons are shinola shit, effective only on those
who are indoctrinated to fear official warnings printed on paper.

If you get a summons in the form of a subpoena, served by
an official, and you accept it in person, that is different, that
is grounds to initiate action to overthrow law and order, to
sidle to the jury room and piss on the the following-are-prohibited 
sign, to go nuts, to be unreliable, to be not-jury worthy. 

The simply mailed kind of summons are ignorable. There is no 
benefit, anymore, to serving on a jury for it only to legitimates a 
bloated justice system which most often serves itself, not justice. 
The justice crowd is no longer answerable to the citizens it was 
intended, and paid handsomely, to serve.

No doubt, if you have nothing better to do, then go forth and
be treated as a sub-human by the jury-calling adminstrators
who act especially trained to make citizens despise government,
until appearing before a judge who will make citizens hate, nay,
lust to guillotine, tax-suckers. Period.
