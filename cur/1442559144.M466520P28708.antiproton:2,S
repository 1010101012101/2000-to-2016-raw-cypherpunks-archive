Again, I must disagree. =C2=A0Rowhammer errors are, presumably, exceedingly=
 rare. =C2=A0But when they do occur, one-bit errors are probably millions o=
f times more common than two-bit errors, which are themselves going too be =
millions of times more common than three bit errors.. =C2=A0But ECC accesse=
s will automatically correct all one-bit errors, and detect all two-bit err=
ors, and will either log only the 2-bit errors or both single and double-bi=
t errors. =C2=A0I won't try the math, but I suspect that the vast majority =
of three-bit errors (for 64-bit words) are also detected. =C2=A0 Wikipedia =
says =C2=A0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory#Erro=
rs%5Fand%5Ferror%5Fcorrection=C2=A0 , "Parity allows the detection of all s=
ingle-bit errors (actually, any odd number of wrong bits)". =C2=A0 =C2=A0So=
, the smallest number of error bits that might not be detected would be fou=
r.
=C2=A0Since any serious rowhammer attack will generate millions of correcta=
ble single-bit and uncorrectable double- and triple-bit errors, per actual =
single 4-bit error, any system operator will get a huge amount of warning t=
hat the attack is underway before even as many as a single 3-bit error will=
 appear. =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Jim Bell

"Work published between 2007 and 2009 showed widely varying error rates wit=
h over 7 orders of magnitude difference, ranging from=C2=A010=E2=88=9210=E2=
=80=9310=E2=88=9217=C2=A0error/bit=C2=B7h, roughly one bit error, per hour,=
 per gigabyte of memory to one bit error, per millennium, per gigabyte of m=
emory.[4][5][6]=C2=A0A very large-scale study based on=C2=A0Google's very l=
arge number of servers was presented at the SIGMETRICS/Performance=E2=80=99=
09 conference.[5]=C2=A0The actual error rate found was several orders of ma=
gnitude higher than previous small-scale or laboratory studies, with 25,000=
 to 70,000 errors per billion device hours per megabit=C2=A0(about 2.5=E2=
=80=937=C2=A0=C3=97=C2=A010=E2=88=9211=C2=A0error/bit=C2=B7h) (i.e. about 5=
 single bit errors in 8 Gigabytes of RAM per hour using the top-end error r=
ate), and more than 8% of DIMM memory modules affected by errors per year.

The consequence of a memory error is system-dependent. In systems without E=
CC, an error can lead either to a crash or to corruption of data; in large-=
scale production sites, memory errors are one of the most common hardware c=
auses of machine crashes.[5]=C2=A0Memory errors can cause security vulnerab=
ilities.[5]=C2=A0A memory error can have no consequences if it changes a bi=
t which neither causes observable malfunctioning nor affects data used in c=
alculations or saved. A 2010 simulation study showed that, for a web browse=
r, only a small fraction of memory errors caused data corruption, although,=
 as many memory errors are intermittent and correlated, the effects of memo=
ry errors were greater than would be expected for independent soft errors.[=

Some tests conclude that the isolation of=C2=A0DRAM=C2=A0memory cells can b=
e circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to =
adjacent cells. Thus, accessing data stored in DRAM causes=C2=A0memory cell=
s=C2=A0to leak their charges and interact electrically, as a result of high=
 cells density in modern memory, altering the content of nearby memory rows=
 that actually were not addressed in the original memory access. This effec=
t is known as=C2=A0row hammer, and it has also been used in some=C2=A0privi=
lege escalation=C2=A0computer security=C2=A0exploits.[8][9]
An example of a single-bit error that would be ignored by a system with no =
error-checking, would halt a machine with parity checking, or would be invi=
sibly corrected by ECC: a single bit is stuck at 1 due to a faulty chip, or=
 becomes changed to 1 due to background or cosmic radiation; a spreadsheet =
storing numbers in ASCII format is loaded, and the digit "8" is stored in t=
he byte which contains the stuck bit as its eighth bit; then a change is ma=
de to the spreadsheet and it is saved. However, the "8" (00111000=C2=A0bina=
ry) has silently become a "9" (00111001)."
