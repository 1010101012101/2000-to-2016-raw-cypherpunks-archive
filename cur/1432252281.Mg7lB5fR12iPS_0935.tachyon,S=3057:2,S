I used FirstClass sometime around 1989-90, maybe '88. I had a service 
called "PC-Pursuit" which allowed me to dial-in to my ISP at no 
charge.

However, dialing-in to bulletin boards was not very interesting 
compared to using Usenet, then mailing lists and gopher and archie. 
Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
