I guess bifurcation points and speciation seem very clear because of the aliasing 
problems in our sampling methods. The speciation exists but is prolly ( probably ) often 
fuzzier than we think. Almost everyone would say that an American Bison and a Scot's 
Highland are two different species but they can hybridize. Maybe we non-Biologists 
measure the distance between "species" inaccurately.

Choose your measure : population? power? innovation? environmental impact? rate of 
change?

The US seems more vital by some measures. Less so by others. More dangerous to 
the species by others.

Is the evolution towards a more efficient language an active or passive process? Is it 
driven by an internal inclination towards expansion, freeing up system resources as it 
were, or is it a coping mechanism for sensory overload?
