Professor Dershowitz has always walked a thin line between being a civil
libertarian and being a apologist for Israel and Zionism.  In all cases
that I can remember where there was a conflict between the two, he was the
latter.

Israel tortures, and what's good for Israel, is apparently also good for
the United States.

Kind of like circumcision.  If you can get everyone doing it, the chances
it will be outlawed, or that you will be criticized for doing it, grow
remote.
