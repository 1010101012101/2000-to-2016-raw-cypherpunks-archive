CAs do not work very well, because no one knows or trusts the CA, the CA 
does not know anyone, and it is a lot jumping through hoops to persuade 
the CA to trust anyone.

As a result, any procedure that has the step "First the end user gets a 
certificate from the CA and installs that certificate" never flies. It 
is just too much of a pain in the ass.

This is not matter of people fearing vast powerful quasi governmental 
conspiracies. (Though in view of recent leaks, you should fear vast 
powerful quasi governmental conspiracies)

The problem is that the CA model itself does not work.  The problem is 
not that they are in bed with your enemies, though they probably are. 
The problem is that they are not in bed with you.

x.509 is evil.

x.509 is designed for universe ruled by a single state, that state the 
fount of all trust, all nyms, and all relationships.

Reality, however, is that relationships and trust are predominantly peer 
to peer, thus anything touched by x.509 somehow always develops an 
absolutely horrid user interface.

When we apply x.509 to a universe far more anarchic than it was designed 
for, bad things happen to the UI.



What your proposed system intends to provide is reputational 
information.  You need some entity, a server, likely a tor hidden 
service, to curate reputational information, and charge a fee for doing 
so:  You are competing with ebay, whose main asset is their large 
collection of other people's reputational information.

Let us call such entities, entities that collect and curate reputational 
information, reputational servers, ebay being the big example of a 
reputational server.

You would like to be able to transport reputational information, so that 
it is public domain, not the private property of a given reputation 
server.  So you don't want reputational information to be information 
about joe@ebay.com, though of course you should present it that way, 
rather than displaying public key information directly in the UI (employ 
Zooko's triangle, and never throw 256 bit random numbers in the end 
user's face)

So, has to be the reputation of the owner of a bitcoin wallet, not the 
reputation of the owner of x.509 certificate.
