Yes and no.  For people who are very concerned about their privacy and
anonymity, chances are their standard OPSEC process is a lot more
involved than this.  Look at Anonymous' OPSEC handbook, for example.

However, this doesn't do much to help legitimize Bitcoin as a
currency.  OPSEC like this screams 'shady' to average folks and
doesn't shine a particularly favorable light upon Bitcoin.  Moreover,
average folks aren't going to want to do this just to pay for an ebook
or cover their AWS bill for the month, they're going to want to click
on a webpage and be done with it.

There is room for both ultra-paranoid OPSEC and having all little mad
money stashed away in Bitcoins.  The two user communities have to grow
at roughly the same rate, though.
