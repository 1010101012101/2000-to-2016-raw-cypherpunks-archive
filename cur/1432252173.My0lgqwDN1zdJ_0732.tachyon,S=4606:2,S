In the case In re United States, Judge Mosman ruled that there is no
constitutional requirement of notice to the account holder because the
Fourth Amendment does not apply to e-mails under the third-party doctrine.
'When a person uses the Internet, the user's actions are no longer in his or
her physical home; in fact he or she is not truly acting in private space at
all. The user is generally accessing the Internet with a network account and
computer storage owned by an ISP like Comcast or NetZero. All materials
stored online, whether they are e-mails or remotely stored documents, are
physically stored on servers owned by an ISP. When we send an e-mail or
instant message from the comfort of our own homes to a friend across town
the message travels from our computer to computers owned by a third party,
the ISP, before being delivered to the intended recipient. Thus, bprivateb
information is actually being held by third-party private companies."

"The case is In re United States, b F.Supp.2d b-, 2009 WL 3416240 (D.Or.
2009), by District Judge Mosman. The issue in the case is whether the
government must notify a person when the government obtains a search warrant
to access the contents of the personbs e-mail account. Judge Mosman
concludes that Rule 41 and 18 U.S.C. 2703(a) require the notice to be served
on the ISP, not the account holder, as a statutory matter. He then rules
that there is no constitutional requirement of notice to the account holder
because the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the e-mails under the
third-party doctrine. Herebs the relevant analysis: ..."

I don't really know what this means for peer-to-peer in general, given email
is a peer-to-peer technology.
