and i think im done cutting kits for a while


it was the first time i realized that things dont always go how you think t=
hey will and that it all can turn out better than you imagined


like this one for instance my older brother uploaded it while reminiscing a=
bout the old buggie he rebuilt in the 80s=20


where are neighborhoods like that anymore with bushes big enough to hide in=
 and kids that go around the block together all afternoon and normal sized =
houses and the old winkfields next door ok i dont need the winkfields but i=
d sure love to give my kids the rest


me um we didnt have disney games when i was five


do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to thi=
nk that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen=20


remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy g=
ot home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for di=
nner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come me=
et us for some wild rides down the slide=20


but the commonality between each experience was- it was out of my hands i o=
ccasionally fell in love with someone who couldnt be had i occasionally had=
 to run from someone who wouldnt let me go


ready to share the love


and then that got me thinking that really its not just while laying in bed =
that she is watching out for me=20


project 31 is rolling along i have donations for every single item i need f=
or the 31 newborn kits and lots of fabric donations and i will sew until th=
ere are 31 baby quilts too thank you SO much i was overwhelmed by the aweso=
me response packages are starting to arrive i will be sure to post some pic=
tures when i get it all together and ready to take to the humanitarian cent=
er my heart is happy


how have you been surprised what can i say


i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles=20


what im listening to this morningagain


and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penn=
y and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me=20


guess what i finally put in the shop


but the main thing i love about this picture is tree cover you can see in t=
he upper right corner thats how it was all around the block even on really =
hot days you could find a great place to play in some serious shade everyon=
e had a huge tree or trees somewhere on their property and bushes and ivy a=
nd a great variety of things the only reason we had those young trees on th=
e corner was because my mom sold our big palm tree to some palm springs lan=
dscapers ha


cate (incredulously) what were you a child of adam and eve


from brora


i have never been an animal person i swore id never have a dog who wants to=
 pick up poop not me but somehow in my baby hungry weakness i was convinced=
 to relent by the other two mccalebs who said they desperately needed a pup=
py fine whatever just take care of her and pick up the poop
