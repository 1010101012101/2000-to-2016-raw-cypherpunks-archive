US law is often construed as encompassing the whole world.  US judges tend to believe they can punish anyone anywhere for violating US law.  This failing is not limited to the US.  The french tend to the same delusion.

It is quite difficult for government officials to comprehend the concept of dealing with equals, and often they just do not get it.
