It isnt for wintel proper, but you can run wget under cygwin
(cygwin.com) and use wget -m which will give you a full mirror and if
you run it in any kind of timely interval, will even update the
differences for you to keep your mirror up to date. cygwin is very nifty
too, a (semi)full unix enviroment under windows. command line anyway.
hope it helps. --gabe
