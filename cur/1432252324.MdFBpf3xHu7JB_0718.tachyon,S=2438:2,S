Hi!

I have just visited your site http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.1999.04.26-1999.05.02/msg00274.html and liked
it very much, especially your list of international search engines.

Here is another search engine for your page: 

Multimeta: (http://www.multimeta.com/) 

This is a fast meta search engine (simultaneous searches in the major search engines, free URL submission service). 

There is even an e-mail feature that allows to receive the search results by e-mail.

Best regards,

Mehul Trivedi
