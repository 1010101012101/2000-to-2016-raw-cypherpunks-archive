It's by no means feature complete and certainly prone to bugs.Tell us what you think and report any issues you have using the "Feedback" link in the app.

DISCLAIMER: I quickly browsed both and well might be wrong.

Here are some remarks about augur.

Basically I don't think the crowd can make good predictions because of
lack of skills and in addition sufficiently many "crowd actors" might
turn the dice the other way.

There is a local saying that "one woman in general can give birth to a
child in approximately 9 months" BUT "9 women can't give birth to a
child in approximately one month".

Since augur mentions "market", likely the lovely NSA can put a lot of
bots on it, possibly just burning inflated virtual money.

I would recommend to them to try their skills on the lottery or on some
sport betting site ;)
