I, like Tim May, call for the death of those who violate our
rights, who attempt to destroy our liberty, those within
America, and those outside it.  So would almost all of us, if
it were not that you damn cops would use fragments of our
words out of context.  If there is no chorus endorsing Tim,
it is because of well founded fear that it is dangerous in
America to speak certain views.
