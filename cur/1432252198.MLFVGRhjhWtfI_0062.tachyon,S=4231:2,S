If this was a live conference stream with media types, direct Skype
may have been used since:
- Training a bunch of idiots to use something secure is a pain.
Perhaps traded off with a disposable location and/or that Snowden
is now diplomatically safe in Russia.
- Tor's network characteristics are usually ok for some voice,
but insufficient for live media video.

That said, Skype is closed source, carries no future guarantees,
and has a controversial track record... therefore it should not be
trusted under any circumstances. Far better options exist for
approaching your private comms needs...
