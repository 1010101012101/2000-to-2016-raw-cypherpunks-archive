Normally I would make some cynical remark about the appropriateness of
Constitution Avenue as a venue for violating the second amendment,
but this sounds like a case of Darwin catching up with the guy
in a way that only eliminates *him* from the gene pool
rather than taking out innocent bystanders when the
gas can falls off his car roof....

He's clearly from the clue-deprived side of the street
about a variety of issues.
