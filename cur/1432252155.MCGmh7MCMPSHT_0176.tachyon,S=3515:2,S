Another way to do the math:

-- 3 to 5 million Afghanis on the move, abandoning tiny farms and 
villages

-- 40,000 orange food packlets, of which maybe 10,000 will be found in 
the mountains and  ravines

However, showing technicians pushing these orange packlets out the back 
of a transport plane made for good PR.

Fact is, the peasant population of Afghanistan needs to be reduced by 
another 5-8 million. The West Nile and Crimea viruses introduced into 
the camps cannot do the whole job. Starvation must do its part as well.
