HP to pay antipiracy fee for CD
               burners

               FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  Computer giant
               Hewlett-Packard has become the first company to be snagged
               by a German law requiring firms to pay fees for making CD
               burners that are being used to illegally lift the latest hits off the
               World Wide Web. 

               The case sets the stage for other European countries to possibly
               adopt similar rules to stem an epidemic that cost the music
               industry an estimated $5 billion last year. But analysts blasted
               the agreement reached Thursday as another example of
               Germanys notorious thatch of regulations.
