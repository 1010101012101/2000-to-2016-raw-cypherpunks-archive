No, it would not.  But then, this is the United States, land of the "Big
Fucking Mouth" - not the "Land Of Action" we so desperately want to be
perceived as.

Since the real chances of the populace "rising up" is just shy of zero,
don't go looking for changes any time soon.  Or, for that matter, any time
in the far future either.

'The right of self defence is the first law of nature: in most governments
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest

the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext
whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the
brink of destruction.'
