My comment was limited to radiant energy weapons. As to those, the
critical vulnerability exists during launch and boost phase. The target is
slow, bright, large, has fuel on board and a nonarmored hull, which (as
other posters observed) can be weakened with enough flux.

The warhead in transit is fast, small, silent, and very, very hard to hit
critically (well, it is designed to withstand reentry and nuclear
antimissile near-hits), especially if it has a high-albedo coating, and if
it is accompanied by a cloud of decoys. Either radiant energy weapon or
kinetic kill, you're on the losing side here.

True, but irrelevant.

A missile in boost phase is not a satellite. A cloud of decoys is not a
satellite. An armored warhead is not a satellite.

The problem assymetry makes star wars a very expensive proposition. Using
airborne hardware instead of LEO is a good move, but it falls orders of
magnitude short of the target.

The demos are just that: demos. Given that a limited strike is best
conducted with remotely operated civilian aircraft, or plain old UPS, star
wars seems like effect of industrial lobby.
