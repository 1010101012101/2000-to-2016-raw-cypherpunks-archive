It is biometric.

It should. Realize the IBIA has been very responsible, in comparison to
other industries. They had some problems with the CA bill, but left a lot of
the safeguards. The industry wants to see safeguards - but yes, they serve
their own interests.

Go look at the IBIA membership - where are the privacy advocate positions?
They do have some noted advisors. They offer a membership for end-users but
it is more expensive than one of their lower-tier vendors. I see the reasons
for it, common in many industry associations. However, I wish more of them
(specifically, the IBIA and the SIA - Security Industry Association) would
establish formal advisory relationships with privacy advocacy groups.

I advocate a *new* privacy advocacy group for security-privacy and
surveillance.

That's a big medical privacy issue. Interesting cases on that.

First Monday just had an interesting paper on blind research
infomediaries...I was trying to turn it into something we had talked about
privately...go over there an look....didn't look like it would work.

Ah, fair information code of practice - yes, indeed. However,
security-privacy is a unique juncture. I argue that they should incorporate
more of these standards. I don't like their principles approach. Show me
exemplar guidelines that are comprehensive in nature. Show me a
accountability.

Are we moving to a biometric crypto-passphrase? Good/bad? Why?

No hypo, but I just heard something about ANONYMOUS biometric digital cash.
How the hell do you do that?
