I'm dubious about the "anonymous mathematical algorithms that cannot be

reverse engineered" part, and I'm skeptical about the "we're gonna cork

up the mind of God and bottle it for those worthy/rich enough to afford

it" aspect. Sounds like snake oil to me.

Data mining, pattern-recognition, AI, ubiquitous surveillance, etc. are

just tools. The biggest danger, beyond flawed premises in the code, such 

as, for instance, ignoring second-order and higher observer loop effects,

or  beyond willful misuse, is GIGO. The central issues are still 

political, anyway. None of this matters if I'm not bothering you and you

come fuck with me, in other words. And, hey, two can play the same game. 

Thank you, Mr. Felsenstein, et al.

Choate, feel free to forward to psychohistory.
