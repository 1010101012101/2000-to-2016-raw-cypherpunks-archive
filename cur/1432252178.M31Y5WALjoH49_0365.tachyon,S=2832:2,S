Yes, but...trying to factor using trial division is not the best currently
known method of factoring. In order to be worth a look, this method should
have a running time better than the general number field sieve.

Rivest also makes this point in his response, and in more detail than I
have here. Unless I've misunderstood what you mean by "trying to factor a
number using multiplication/division" ?
