You're out of the loop.  Here's how you play the propoganda drinking
game:

You and a friend get a bottle of <whatever> and watch a Bush speech.
*You* drink whenever he says "terror"; *she* drinks whenever he says
"freedom".

If he says "warlord", "constitution", "regime" or "WoMD" you both drink.

If he says "occupation", "election", "oil" or "Quisling" you skip a
drink.

If he mentions "viet nam" or "guerilla" you take 2 drinks.

Whoever is left standing gets to clean up.
