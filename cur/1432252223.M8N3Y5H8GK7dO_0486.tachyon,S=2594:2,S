   [1]PCOL writes "The [2]Baltimore Sun reports that Delcan technology
   will soon begin fullscale deployment of a system in Maryland that
   [3]will mine cellphone data to determine traffic conditions such as
   jams and slowdowns. As long as a user's phone is turned on, the
   cellphone network notes the time of handoffs from cell to cell [4]to
   calculate the location and speed of vehicles. Researchers say the
   program will reduce congestion by quickly delivering alerts on road
   conditions to drivers. The company says they will not track the
   movement of individual drivers. However, a staff attorney for the EFF
   says that tracking might violate federal law and 'increases the
   chances that information will be used for more invasive purposes in
   the future.'"
