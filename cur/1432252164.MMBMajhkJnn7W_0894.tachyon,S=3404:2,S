April 1st is many months off, so why this?

Tools for making envelopes transparent have been in use for many 
decades, perhaps a century or more. Bamford and Kahn, IIRC, discuss 
varius government agencies during WWII and later steaming 
envelopes--the so-called "Flaps and Seals" folks. They may have 
alluded to freon sprays and all the newer methods, but it was pretty 
clear that Flaps and Seals was not limited to just "steaming."

I saw sprays used for making envelopes transparent sold in novelty 
stores and catalogs back in the 70s.
