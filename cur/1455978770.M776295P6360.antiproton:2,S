/a><br>
<br>
</span>Awesome insights from Eben. Here&#39;s a very rough summary:<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
- disintermediation<br>
<br>
- make it all open, universal access to hack, read, learn, experiment, and =
share<br>
- libre software, the commons and the licenses that facilitate this<br>
commons, underlies all modern commerce, every major &#39;recent&#39;<br>
corporation<br>
- there will never be another commercial encyclopaedia<br>
- for the cost of 600km of roads (1000s built every year), every book<br>
in every European library can be scanned and made available to all,<br>
and they should be<br>
- free software is most advanced tech education - anybody anywhere,<br>
can get to the state of the art, by downloading, reading, experimental<br>
and sharing freely - true computer science, more knowledge for the<br>
human race<br>
- bulk of human learning was not recent<br>
- all knowledge should be universally available, not doing so will<br>
stunt further growth and innovation which permits further growth - a<br>
social requirement for growth<br>
- &quot;copyright bargain&quot; is not an immutable bargain, just a conveni=
ence<br>
for monetizers, not even relevantly apply to almost all of important<br>
human knowledge in most fields - Plato not owned by anybody<br>
<br>
- what will 21st Centure education systems be like?<br>
- 3billion of the 7billion people in the world are children - how many<br>
Einsteins or Shakespears do we want to throw away today?<br>
<br>
- the universalization of the access to knowledge, is today the single<br>
most important force available for increasing innovation and human<br>
wealth on the planet - nobody should be afraid to advocate for it<br>
because someone might shout &quot;copyright!&quot;<br>
- this also allows young people to take their economic and<br>
professional destinies into their own hands - an absolute requirement<br>
for social and political stability in next generation<br>
<br>
- more jobs outside hierarchies, less jobs inside hierarchies<br>
- young people know the rules have changed, its governments that don&#39;t<=
br>
<br>
- &quot;privacy&quot; means:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A01) secrecy - content of a message is obscure to all but its ma=
ker<br>
and intended recipient<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A02) anonymity - messages are not obscure, but the points genera=
ting<br>
and receiving those messages are obscure<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A03) autonomy - the opportunity to live a life in which the deci=
sions<br>
that you make are unaffected by others access to secret or anonymous<br>
communications<br>
<br>
- there&#39;s a reason that cities have always been engines of economic<br>
growth - not because bankers live there - they live there -because-<br>
cities are engines of economic growth (since Sumer), because young<br>
people move there to make new ways of being, taking advantage of fact<br>
that the city is where you escape the surveillance of the village and<br>
the social control of the farm<br>
<br>
- the city is the historical system for the production of anonymity<br>
and the ability to experiment autonomously in ways of living - govts/<br>
&quot;we&quot; are closing this<br>
<br>
Some great personal historical anecdotes.<br>
<br>
- We are on the verge of eliminating the human right to be alone, to<br>
do your own thinking, in own place, in own way, without anybody<br>
knowing<br>
<br>
- prices, offers, commodities, opportunities, are now being based on<br>
the data mining of everything<br>
- senior govt official of current administration/govt, said to me<br>
after US rules changes of length of time for keeping all info about<br>
citizens for whom nothing is suspected, that the &quot;minor&quot; changes =
in<br>
the Ascroft rules, all minor details of those for whom nothing is<br>
suspected, will now be kept not for 180 days but for 5 years (an<br>
approximation for infinity)<br>
- Eben: should we have a law, based on the constitution, for this?<br>
Govt official just laughed. Complete despotism.<br>
<br>
- One of the problems of innovation under conditions of complete<br>
despotism - one of the problems of 20th century totalitarianism, is<br>
that it eliminates the possibility of free markets and innovation.<br>
- the network is an extraordinary platform for social control<br>
- USA and China have adopted almost identical points of view/ actions<br>
- robust full society network people graph, connecting people to<br>
everybody they know, and exhaustive data mining of society, is<br>
fundamental govt policy for both governments for &quot;stability<br>
maintenance&quot;<br>
<br>
- we, who understand what&#39;s happening, need to be very vocal about this=
<br>
- not just our civil liberties at stake - I shouldn&#39;t need to say<br>
this, that should be enough, but of course it&#39;s not - we need to make<b=
r>
clear that the cost, the other part, is the very vitality, vibrancy,<br>
of invention, culture and discourse, that wide open, robust,<br>
uninhibited public debate that the US Supreme Court so loved in NYT v<br>
Sullivan, and that freedom to tinker, invent, be different,<br>
non-conformist, for which people have always moved to the cities that<br>
gave them anonymity, that gave people a change to experiment with<br>
anonymity and to experiment with who they are and what they can do<br>
(the loss of this is the cost close to being paid by us all)<br>
- this opportunity to experiment anonymously in being, thinking and<br>
doing, more than anything else, is what will sustain social vitality<br>
and economic growth in 21stCentury<br>
- of course there are other reasons, protection for the integrity of<br>
the human soul, but that&#39;s not govt&#39;s concern<br>
- precisely for the glory of how we understand civil society that that<br>
is NOT govt&#39;s concern<br>
- precisely our commitment to the idea of individual&#39;s development at<b=
r>
own pace, and in own way, that has been centerpiece of OUR society&#39;s<br=
>
fundamental commitment, that means that protection of the integrity of<br>
the human soul is OUR business and NOT govt&#39;s business<br>
<br>
- we must be clear to govt that there is no tension between<br>
maintenance of civil liberty in the form of the right to be left<br>
alone, and economic policy of securing innovation under austerity -<br>
they require the same thing:<br>
=C2=A0- free software<br>
=C2=A0- free hardware we can hack on<br>
=C2=A0- free access to information<br>
=C2=A0- right to share freely<br>
=C2=A0- free spectrum to communication without &quot;let&quot;? or hindranc=
e<br>
- to everyone on earth without regard to the ability to pay, to<br>
provide a pathway to an independent ,economic=C2=A0 and intellectual life<b=
r>
for every young person<br>
<br>
- we have the tech we need<br>
=C2=A0- cheap micro servers<br>
=C2=A0- the right software<br>
- need to retrofit the first law of robotics into current society, in<br>
the next few minutes, or we&#39;re cooked<br>
=C2=A0- this is CIVIL innovation<br>
- must continue the long lifetime of personal computers that everybody<br>
can hack on, by using them, needing them, spreading them around<br>
- use our own force as consumers and technologists to deprecate closed<br>
networks and locked down objects<br>
- without clear guidance in public policy, we will remain a tiny minority -=
 8.3%<br>
<br>
- innovation under austerity is our battle cry, not for things we care<br>
about, but for the things the other people care about, our entree to<br>
social policy, and our LAST chance, to do in govt what we&#39;ve NOT been<b=
r>
able to do by attempting to preserve our mere liberties, which have<br>
been shamefully abused by our friends in govt as well as by our<br>
adversaries<br>
- we&#39;ve been taken to the cleaners with respect to our rights, and<br>
with respect to everybody&#39;s money<br>
- nobody will run in this year&#39;s US election on the basis of the<br>
restoration of our civil liberties<br>
- but they will all talk about austerity and growth, and we must bring<br>
our message<br>
- this is my first draft, inadequate in many ways, but it&#39;s a place to =
start<br>
- if we lose, the night will be very long, and very dark<br>
