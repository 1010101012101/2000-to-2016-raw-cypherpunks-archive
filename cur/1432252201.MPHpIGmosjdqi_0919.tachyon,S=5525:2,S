	If you mean promises from the government, or from their
	corporatist partners, no, of course, I don't.

	Regarding your quote below,

	It may be possible, in the not-so-distant-future, to record
	people in ultra high definition from a mile away, but the
	'technology'  can be rendered rather useless with somthing
	like...this

	http://ramitia.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/japan-face-masks.jpg

	Of course, at that point, google and general dynamics are going
	to knock on the pentagon's door and ask them to ban masks.
