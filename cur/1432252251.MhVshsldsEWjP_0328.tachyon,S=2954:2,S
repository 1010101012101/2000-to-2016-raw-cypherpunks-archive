While I don't agree with most of the "anti-trust law" in general (another
issue entirely), in order to have an anti-trust settlement, there would
have been an anti-trust lawsuit. The company being stripped of its patents
would have had a chance to defend itself.

If the US begins arbitrarily lifting patent restrictions in order to steal
from foreign companies, expect retaliation in kind.
