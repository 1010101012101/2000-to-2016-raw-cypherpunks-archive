Our father, who's art is in porn ; Halloween by Thy name; Thy kingdom 
Cum; Thy wife will be done, on earth as she were in a whore house. 
Give us this day our daily blow job; and forgive us our sales taxes, 
as we forgive those who tax against us, and lead us not into D.C. ; 
but deliver us from Church. Amen.
