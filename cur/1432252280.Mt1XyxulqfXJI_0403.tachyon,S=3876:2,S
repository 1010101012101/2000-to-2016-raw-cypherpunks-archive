Rant at Start of Chapter on Society

I write this book during a dark time. America.s government is in the hands 
of criminals and morons.

I.d like to break through to a radically different way of talking about 
society, to throw a bucket of ice-water in the face of the sleep-walking 
sheep who think that history is about presidents and kings.

A baby filling a diaper is infinitely more significant than a congress 
placing a movement on the floor.

Twin Towers

Facts: The twin towers fell. The terrorists were Saudis. Bush invaded 
Iraq.

.Ah,. someone might say, .if nobody wanted to fight, we.d be invaded. Look 
at the twin towers. The world.s not safe... And I would submit that the 
administration.s reaction to the twin towers was exactly the wrong one. 
Instead of jumping into the repetitive tit-for-tat class two 
Israelis-versus-Palestinians mode, the government should have gone class 
four. What would make men kill themselves while destroying a part of our 
lovely New York City? What system produced them? Isn.t there a way to get 
in and jolt it in some totally unexpected way, something more original 
than rocket fire vs. car bombs?

Emigration

Before virtually every American presidential election, I.ve heard people 
say, .If so and so wins, I.m leaving the country.. But they never do. The 
only time my friends eve remigrated was during the Viet Nam war, a time 
when the hive mind was undertaking the wholesale slaughter of a 
generation. But most of the time, for most of us, things aren.t bad enough 
to make emigration seem reasonable.

If the election is stolen again in Fall, 2004, the answer could be armed 
revolution, not emigration. If the Bush faction tries to retain power, a 
significant number of people may feel compelled to go to D.C. and fight in 
the streets until the tyrant is deposed. However long it takes, however 
dearly it costs. Would it be worth it?

Hopefully he'll lose the election by too great a margin to fudge. But for 
that to happen, we have to vote. The popular vote margin matters, if not 
in the electoral college, then in the hearts and minds of our oppressed 
populace. If the margin were big enough, the house of cards could 
collapse.
