You might. It's not like that where I live. I don't think I'd ever seen
a handgun other than on TV until I was over 20, & that was in a foreign
country. I've still never held one. Shotguns yes, people kill birds with
them. Rifles - very occasionally with the military or armed police, but
most people don't live near military bases & most police don't carry
rifles in public. I doubt if I see more than one or two a year (*). 

Heck. I've had more to do with moonrock than revolvers.

Not everywhere is as gun-obsessed as the USA.

(*) Contrary to popular belief British police *do* use guns, quite a
lot, but they don't carry them openly (but check out the patrol cars), 
they tend to be rifles rather than handguns, they only issue them to
specially trained officers (about 1 in 5 in London I think, fewer in
other forces), & they always try to ensure that the "first contact" with
a suspect is an unarmed  police officer. If they think the suspect is
armed they tend to try to have a sniper out of sight. Fewer cops get
killed that way - 17 in the last 35 years I think. The USA can lose that
many in a bad summer.
