It is possible that the intelligence community, front-covered the CIA,
dream of a Putin-like takeover, not to continue "serving the President,"
and taking orders as demanded toady by David Brooks in the New York 
Times.

US citizens allowed the intel monster to grow in secrecy and it will 
likely devour the American experiment in democratic openness, 
utilizing the same methods forever employed by secret orgs: national 
security FUD.

To be sure, most of the monster hides behind the DoD facade
of "our troops," not at Langley, and it is this warmongering majority
that has the biggest stake in inventing enemies of the state, and
promising economic benefits to local, state, and national interests.

Secrecy is the WMD that is killing the US, not the puny terrorists,
as demonstated by the UK, Russia, China, Cuba, all around the
apple.

What Bush and Blair cooked up in the last day or so could well
determine whether lists like this and much of the Internet remain 
open or get shut. The boys and girls who daily brief the Ps are
not going to go back to the downslide of pre-911.

No doubt some might say that is why 911 was cooked up, precursing
Beslan and more to come. 1200 troops dead in Iraq is not much
of a blip on big sines of expendables.
