<<A letter containing a powdery substance was also received today in The
New York Times offices in mid-town Manhattan. In a statement, the Times
said that Judith Miller, a reporter at the newspaper, received the
envelope and the substance was being tested. The Times said that the New
York Police Department was called and is currently investigating the
incident. Employees were moved from the newsroom on the third floor to
other floors in the building while testing was done, according to the
Times. >>
