***NEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY***

* Mining ST0CKS have outperformed both the S&P 5OO and the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average over the last three years.

* Profits by mining companies have doubled for the second year in a 
row.  Return on equity has increased nearly three-fold over the past two 
years

* Price Waterhouse Coopers calls for "...another bumper year for the 
global mining industry in 2O05."  They go on to say, "The sustained 
upturn in commodity prices has caught investors' attention, creating a dash 
for mining ST0CKS.  Add the unprecedented profits and free cash flows 
and we have a very buoyant industry."

For more information read, Mine - Enter the Dragon, by Price Waterhouse 
Coopers, located at   PWCglobal.com              


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER WSRM***


* Western Sierra Mining has a very profitable business model in which 
they avoid the highest cost associate with mining: Exploration.  
Essentially, Wester Sierra operates mines on sites that have been previously 
explored and found to be "too small" for the largest mining companies, 
yet still produce handsome profits.

* The global mining industry boom will continue for the foreseeable 
future due to the impact of China-driven demand on commodity prices and 
long supply-response lead times.

* News! News! News!  Read on to find out why we expect WSRM to take off 
this week!

 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:


PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent 
with ASDI Corp. providing WSRM the right to develop the ASDI property 
located in Crescent Valley at Battle Mountain, Nev.



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 1O, 20O5--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) and OreTech Inc. (Pink Sheets: ORTE - News) 
announced today that their respective boards of directors have agreed to enter 
into an agreement to develop the Silver Plume and Pittsburg mines 
located in Colorado. 

Commenting on the proposed transaction, the president of Western Sierra 
Mining, Michael Chaffee, said, "The new alignment with OreTech will 
allow each of the companies to utilize their specific expertise to the 
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing its 
propriety extraction technology and Western is expanding its mining 
activities in the U.S. We have started our due diligence on the property 
and look forward to taking a proposal back to OreTech by the end of the 
month. 

"We also will pursue an agreement to use the OreTech extraction 
technology at the Colorado site in the event we can assure ourselves and 
OreTech that the values exist in Colorado at a commercial level."



We cannot stress enough the significance of this news.  That a small 
company such as this would have the rights to these rich properties 
speaks volumes for their management and near-future earnings.  That they 
would be so fortunate as to be involved with an industry pioneer such as 
Oretech is nothing short of extraordinary.

These fortuitous events have made WSRM our HOT PICK of the week!

We love this company!

As with many micro-cap ST0CKS, today's company has additional risk

stockholder, supplies ninety-seven percent of the company's raw 
materials:  
reliance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business and 
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital.
