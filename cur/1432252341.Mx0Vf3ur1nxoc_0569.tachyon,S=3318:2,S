I checked it out. When I open any pdf or ppt from my gmail(persistent https) using google documents, the certificate is issued by Google Internet Authority and issued to Google Inc. From the firefox trusted certificate list it is seen that Equifax is a root CA and has issued certificate to Google Internet Authority.

This being said why does google gets certified from thawte and prsents us its certificate when we open gmail.com? The firefox browser trusts Google Internet Authority and doesnot warn of a potential untrusted site when i open a pdf from gmail(https) with google docs.

Thanks,
Sarad.
