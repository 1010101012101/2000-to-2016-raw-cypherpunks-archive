Anarcho socialism has been dead since 1938.  (It had the misfortune of 
being actually tried in 1936, whereupon it instantly became apparent that 
socialism requires a vastly powerful state in order to apply ruthless 
terror.)  Today's "anarcho" socialists, such as Chomsky, believe that the 
best way to arrange for the state to wither away is to first make it vastly 
powerful and all encompassing.

Where have we heard that theory before?
