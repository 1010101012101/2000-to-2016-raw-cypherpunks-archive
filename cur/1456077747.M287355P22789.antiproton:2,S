Or something stoopid like that.

A few years ago when I was still writing news copy for an alt radio news
personality I was personally following the Waxman investigation into
Blackwater. Publicly over the Nisoor Square shooting, but they were
going to cover other issues behind closed doors such as Blackwater's
gun-running  (CPA Glocks w/o serial numbers to Turkish city crime gangs
for a start), which had been followed by McClatchy news service, and I
was using their copy on my blogger posts.

One morning, right before the hearings were about to begin, I was
checking my site counter and discovered a hit from PentagonMil on one of
those posts... What? Me worry?

But what followed next should disturbing to anyone who thought the feds
understood infosec or had someone on payroll who understands.

Apparently the person who viewed it first saved it to their desktop
complete with the site counter jscript, and the next few hits after
that, instead of showing a typical http path, showed the path through
pentagonmil to the desktop names of people the original viewer had
passed the page around to. The pentagon was letting my saved blog page
'phone home'. They hadn't blocked outgoing script action.

Pretty pitiful hunh?
