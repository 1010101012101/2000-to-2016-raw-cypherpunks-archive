Accepted.  Kerry is possibly the single worst candidate the dems had to
offer - and I don't think it's any accident that he made it through.

Nevertheless, I'll take the evil untested over the evil well known and
thoroughly despised at this point.

BTW - I just got back from F9/11: good movie, regardless of your stance on
shrub.

I find it interesting that (a) Although it is raking in money like crazy
(my performance was close to 100% full, no passes are being accepted,
etc.), (b) only a single theater within 50 miles of St. Louis, yes, you
saw that right, a major city, has booked this show, and, (c) the movie
plays only through tonight - a three day run.  You close a movie thats
making money?
