Thanks for the article, but i have some questions/comments that perhaps
require some clearing up.... even if it were in perfect working order, this
technology sounds to me like another coup for crypto... what i mean is,
simply, bits are bits, and the data on the drive could be read in a part by
part basis (perhaps i don't have the vocabulary for this, but the idea is
here).... sorta like "ta hell with the security, if i just take the drive,
or the platter even i can just read it raw and then all i have to contend
with is the encryption"

well, sorry for my ignorance... perhaps you could clear it up if needed :)
