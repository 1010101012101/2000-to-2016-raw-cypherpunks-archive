This is done somewhere already.  I can't quite remember where, but I
suspect that it's in the EBay registration process.

"For security purposes, retype the numbers to the left."

The numbers aren't vertically aligned, have erratic horizontal
spacing, and are presented against a grid-pattern background.  I'm not
sure if this actually helps much against standard OCR, although I'm
pretty sure that the SVMs I work with could be easily trained to
translate the GIFs to text.
