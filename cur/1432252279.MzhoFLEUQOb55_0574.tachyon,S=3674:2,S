"You're either with us or you're with the pretzels! " Bush announces.
by The Snack Food Conspiracy.
10:48am Mon Jan 14 '02
Bush addresses the nation.
This morning, Bush made a public announcement on the terrorist pretzel 
attack.  In front of an anxious group of reporters, Bush stated, "You're 
either with us, or you're with the pretzels."
This came after announcing the military operation, "Enduring Crunch," 
earlier in the day, where pretzel factories around the world will be bombed 
regardless of whether they produced the actual terrorist pretzels or not.
"This will be a long battle and we must stand united against terrorist 
pretzels."

How could one of the most wealthy and powerful corporations in the world go 
bust overnight? It turns out that the 7th largest US business was mostly 
smoke and mirrors.Like the whole system of Govt actually.
