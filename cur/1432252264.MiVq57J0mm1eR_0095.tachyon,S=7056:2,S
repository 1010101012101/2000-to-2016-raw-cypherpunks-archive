Aiya...shit. Things are rather worse than I thought. Hey...I'm getting the 
idea for a Sci-Fi story...imagine "official" war casualties in Iraq get bad 
enough that the US government decides to simply hire private forces to do 
all the work (then the official casualty #s they can report are basically 
zero from then on). Eventually some of the big Mercenary multinationals 
start instigating wars so they can keep their stock prices up...
