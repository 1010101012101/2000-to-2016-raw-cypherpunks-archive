I have seen a passive tap on a gig line used for IDS, true, but that's
pretty close to the state of the art right now.  There's an issue with
getting the interfaces for the 1U Dell, and then you have the secondary
issues of just how much encapsulated crap do you need to strip off, and
how fast.  Remeber, you only get 1 shot, and you *can't* ask for more time
- if your buffer runneth over, you be screwed.

It's not as easy as it feels.
