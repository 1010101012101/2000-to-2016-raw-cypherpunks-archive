 Malaysia has launched an amnesty for illegal immigrants.

The Malaysian government hopes some 160,000 Indonesians, working illegally
in the country, will head home during the 17 day amnesty program to mark
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

If not, they face jail sentences of up to five years or fines of more than
$US2,600, or both, plus whipping.

Thousands of illegal immigrants have reportedly been whipped in Malaysian
prisons since harsh new laws were introduced two years ago.

Immigration officials say there's been little response so far, but they say
they expect more people to leave in the coming days.

Illegal immigrants can only depart if they have valid travel documents and
a ferry ticket, and all those leaving are fingerprinted.

Under the amnesty, 6,000 illegal immigrants held at detention centres in
Malaysia will also be allowed to return to their countries, if they are not
involved in court cases.

There are about 1.2 million illegal immigrants in Malaysia, mainly from
Indonesia and the Philippines.
