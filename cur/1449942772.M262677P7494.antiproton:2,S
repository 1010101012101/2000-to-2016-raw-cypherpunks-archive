Collection of metadata sufficient to reconstruct all of the above
activities in detail is not compatible with privacy.  Neither is
full take collection triggered by rule sets defining "interesting"
behavior, i.e. the use of 'privacy enhancing' technologies,
reading about Linux, etc. (per published USG docs that are
"generally accepted" as real).  You don't have to act like an
idiot to lose your "privacy," and relative to State actors it
already happened.

You can have some semblance of privacy on the Internet, for
instance reducing the take of commercial surveillance operations
by selectively blocking ad servers and whitelising a limited
number of sites to run Javascript in your browser.  You can have
more by using technologies that are "too hard" or "too
inconvenient" for non-specialists to put up with, i.e. TOR, i2p,
GPG, etc.

Privacy supporters who understand network security, understand
that any activity they want to conceal from all surveillance
actors must either be conducted off the network, or via
"anonymizing technology" that degrades network access to a lesser
or greater extent (100% in instances involving two way
communication with people who do not know or care about these
matters), while being observed and recorded by actors hostile to
privacy.

If CPunks subscribers don't know that, what chance of 'privacy'
does the greater unwashed publick stand?
