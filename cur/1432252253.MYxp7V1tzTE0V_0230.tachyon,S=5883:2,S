FBI Warns Storage Unit Operators
Terrorist  alert is extended to self-storage units

Joyce Lavoy is a manager for South Toledo Self Storage.  Lavoy says she was
stunned when an FBI agent walked into her office and told her  to be on the
lookout for possible terrorist activity. Local FBI agents are  visiting
about 350
storage places in 19 northwest Ohio communities, including  Toledo, Lucas
County, and Sandusky. They're handing out alerts to owners and  employees on

potential terrorist activity in storage facilities.
Federal sources tell 13 Action News in the past, terror suspects have been
known to use storage units to devise their plans. Everytime Joyce Lavoy
unlocks
 an empty storage unit and lifts the door, she's looking for the warning
signs of  possible terrorist activity. Lavoy has worked in the storage
business
for five  years. She says she's never had an FBI agent walk into her office.
"I
thought  there was someone renting a storage unit he was looking for." That
wasn't the  case.
Lavoy says FBI agents wanted to put managers on alert that terrorists have
been known to store and mix deadly chemicals in storage units. The FBI alert

cautions storage owners and employees to be on the lookout for:  suspicious
people who visit the storage facility late at night or at unusual  times.
unusual fumes, liquids, residues or odors emanating from their storage unit.

explosives, blasting caps, fuses, weapons, and ammunition.  flight manuals
or other
similar materials.
Lavoy says security cameras are in place and she's taking extra trips around

the building with her employees looking for anything suspicious.
