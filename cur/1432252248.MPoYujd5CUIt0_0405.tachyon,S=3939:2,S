You're being quite creative with alternative spelling and punctuation.
However, if you think that provides sustainable stealth cover against a
competent attacker (TLA agencies must by now be really good with
linguistic forensics) you're fooling yourself.

For executable binary verification it is obviously necessary to use
compilers/linkers which don't write crap into the binary. Speaking of
which, given the size of the code blob one could as well use handcrafted
assembly. Also, using a standartized build environment is not exactly
rocket science, since one can checksum ISO images, too. Platinum Group 
Linux would be a good name for the distro.
