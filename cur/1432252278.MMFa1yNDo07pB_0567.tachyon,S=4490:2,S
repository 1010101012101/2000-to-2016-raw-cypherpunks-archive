"U.S. Developing 'Remote Frisk' to Seek Weapons in a Crowd"
Cox News Service (06/07/01); Emling, Shelley
NLECTC Law Enforcement & Corrections\Copyright 2001, Information Inc.,
Bethesda, MD.

Engineers at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's laboratories in Boulder, Colo., are developing a
device that police might one day use to spot people carrying
dangerous weapons in unruly crowds. While engineers will
likely develop a working prototype by year's end, U.S.
officials have no immediate plans for deploying the system.
The National Institute of Justice and the Federal Aviation
Administration is funding the development of the "remote
frisk," and the agencies have already spent about $200,000
annually on the project over the past three years. News of the
system comes during a growing concern over domestic terrorism,
but it also raises concerns over the constitutionality of
high-tech policing practices. Kristian Miccio at Western State
University College of Law in California says that using
high-tech devices among crowds is a violation of the Fourth
Amendment, an issue similar to a recent Supreme Court ruling
involving an Oregon man. Rebecca Trexler, an FAA spokeswoman,
says the FAA has reservations about a scanner that could peer
through clothing. NIST spokesman Fred McGehan states that the
agencies hope the device would provide only a rough silhouette
of the person's body. (www.coxnews.com)

I note that a sizable industry is dedicated to not only keeping my
silhouette private through advanced camoflauge techniques, but also morphing
it out of its natural proportion.

Can it detect a body-bound knife? A grenade? A minute explosive device? A
"push-up" bra? Does their "rough silhouette" subject me to the same exacting
tracing knife as those reclining ladies on 18-wheeler mud flaps? (Is this
blue paint?)
