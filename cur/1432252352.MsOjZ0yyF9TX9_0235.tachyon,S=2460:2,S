Thats not how it works. The idea is that you make your choices on
the machine, and when you lock them in, two things happen: They
are electronically recorded in the device for the normal count, and
also, a paper receipt is printed. The voter checks the receipt to
see if it accurately records his choices, and then is required to
put it in a ballot box retained at the polling site.

If there's a need for a recount, the paper receipts can be checked.

I imagine a well designed system might show the paper receipt through
a window, but not let it be handled, to prevent serial fraud.
