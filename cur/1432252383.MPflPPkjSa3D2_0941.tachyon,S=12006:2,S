John, that was a beautiful email.

I sincerely hope it is both the introduction and the coda to this
intersection of cpunks and GamerGate. Let's just move on from here.

Games are a reflection of the this much greater conceit<br>
of male dominance in all institutions, all of them, even those<br>
which spout diversity and affirmative action and grant minimal<br>
access to privileged male sanctuaries -- no matter the skin<br>
color, ethnicity, faith, location on earth.<br>
<br>
It is argued that male aggression inherent and can at best<br>
be somewhat controlled by law and social compact. That is<br>
a comfortable apologia by male supremacists in law and<br>
social compacts dominated by them with intellectual and<br>
economic arrogance. All institutions measure accomplishment<br>
by male-derived standards to tip the balance in favor of those<br>
rigged games.<br>
<br>
GameGate is too limited in scope, so much that it should<br>
be seen as a male-dominated diversion, a game, to avoid<br>
addressing the origin and sustaining influence of male<br>
way of thinking, doing, making, competing, surviving, by<br>
lying, cheating, killing, ruling in all aspects of existence,<br>
simulated in games, trained for in games, monetized by<br>
games designers and producers, applauded and lauded<br>
in halls of power and control, in prizes and awards, in<br>
cemetaries and statues, in art and science, in accumulation<br>
concentration and monopolization of wealth.<br>
<br>
No game this larger world, this wargame of &quot;ballsy&quot;<br>
potentates in military, policy, spying, media, sports,<br>
taxation, playing obsessively the &quot;law of men enforced<br>
by lawmen.&quot;<br>
