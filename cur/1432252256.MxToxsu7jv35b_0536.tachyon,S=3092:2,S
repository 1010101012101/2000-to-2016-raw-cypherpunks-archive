Exactly - not every attacker represents law enforcement, and not every
law enforcement attack is performed with the intention of creating
admissible evidence. The US' exclusionary rule is the exception, not
the rule, worldwide - most courts take more or less whatever evidence
they can get. And thugs and goons and spies of many flavors don't
give a shit about even pretending to cover their tracks when they're
not following the rules.
