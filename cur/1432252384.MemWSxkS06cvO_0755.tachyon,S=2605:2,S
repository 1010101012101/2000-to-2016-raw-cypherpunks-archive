The chilling effect is that libraries will get the message and remove 
"seditious" and "questionable" books.

I'm not spending much time in public libraries, favoring the UCSC 
Science Library, but I'll bet that after 9/11 a lot of the old stand-by 
books on rocketry, explosives, hydroponic gardening, etc. were removed 
by helpful librarians. (A "lot" meaning at least 5% of the libraries 
doing at least some removal of books. In some states, if not in large 
cities.)

Librarians are our first defense against terrorism!

Ignorance is strength.
