I think that would be an excellent idea.  The best thing for this case
would be to see what was actually on the web site.

Of course, I would suggest showing it to everyone, and not just the
Curley family lawyers.  Because of NAMBLA had nothing to do with the
murder, I'm sure you wouldn't want to see them falsely found liable.

So your printouts of the NAMBLA web site show where they encourage
people to rape and/or murder children?

Do you have any quotes?

Always a good quote.  So what is the truth about what was on the
NAMBLA web site?  Yell it from the rooftops.
