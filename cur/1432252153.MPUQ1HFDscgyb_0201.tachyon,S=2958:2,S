The feds have been working for years on higher speed, government access only, Internet alternative.  Once they have this in place, or even before with this new approach, they could close the Internet down of filter our undesirable traffic as they see fit.  Forcing the U.S. Internet though one location would destablize the entire network.

A few of the alternatives are: 
- to support the smaller ISPs doing local peering and who cannot afford to use the major peering points
- re-awaken FidoNet
- Purchase and offer 802.11 public access points
- write letters and emails to the major ISP CEOs warning of the dire technical and personal consequences should their networks surcome to this fed pressure
