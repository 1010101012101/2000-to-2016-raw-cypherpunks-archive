Use google.  Search for @*.mil  Also large bureaucracies use
standard forms like First.Surname@blah or FSurname@blah

Be subtle.  Ask them to disable their weapons and defect.
Tell them you don't hate americans, just the regime.

Make sure you don't post such info where furringers
will see it ---they might abuse it.  Also all that furringer mail
coming into .mil will annoy DIA
