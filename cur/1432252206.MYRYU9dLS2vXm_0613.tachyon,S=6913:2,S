This is truely humorous. 

As BU said earlier "You overestimate the average contextual awareness level of the typical cypherpunk reader I think."

He's right.

	Were these destructions ordered because investigations were *known to be* imminent, or because someone was looking ahead and figured that someday someone might start an investigation, and it would be better if that stuff was already gone. 

	Context. In one case you have a reasonable assumption that someone *is* going to look for that stuff. In the other, you don't have that assumption. 

	It's not whether you commit the crime, it's whether you assume you're going to get investigated for it.

	That's not what he said at all. 

	A book store owner has no expectation of being investigated for a selling a perfectly legal book, and no obligation to track the purchasers of it.

	However, if that conversation was between the "State Board of Equalization" (for those outside California this is the department that deals with state sales tax apparently):

SBOE: We'd like to see your sales records for 1997-1999. 
STORE: "Sorry, can't do that, see there was this *really* weird fire on my desk last night, and wouldn't you know, all those records are gone". 

You're going to be talking to a judge about this, and no, they won't be happy.

	No, that is not what Unicorn said. 

	It is not "if one ever expects to be charged" although it could be argued that be suspecting that you were going to be charged you knew you were committing a crime, but I suspect that is tangental. 


>I say this is bullshit. By your vague (no plausible cites, just some 1L literatlisms), whispering is spoliation. Failure to archive tape recordings of conversations is spoliation. Use of encryption is spoliation. Drawing the curtains is spoliation.

	No, but destroying audio tapes, or blanking over bits of them *is*.

>They didn't get John Gotti for whispering, so I doubt "spoliation" is nearly the tool you and Aimee Farr seem to think it is.

	There is a singnificant difference between Gotti and your bog-standard CP. Gotti could afford *really* good lawyers, and was making *real* money doing what he did. 

	Most of us here aren't making anywhere near what Gotti did. If the Feds come after one of us, it's either for harassment--in which case a spoliation charge is as good as any (it doesn't matter whether they win or lose, they've raised the cost of whatever joe CP is doing enough that he's going to take up a cheap hobby like Golf or Sailing instead), or it's for something in which they already have a good amount of evidence, and the "spoliation" will be a bargaining chip in the proceedings (cop to <x> and we'll drop <a>-<v>).
