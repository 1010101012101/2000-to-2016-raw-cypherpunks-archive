none of the rep's claims are true.  note that AOL-Hong Kong would be in
violation if this were true.  the rep is probably confusing laws regarding
export of encryption/munitions.  also note that it's nearly impossible to
detect encrypted email anyway as the methods (obfuscation, steg., etc.)
available outnumber detection techniques available to isps.
