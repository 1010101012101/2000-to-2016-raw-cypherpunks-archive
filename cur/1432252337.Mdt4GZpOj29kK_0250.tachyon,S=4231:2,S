Close, but no cigar. 64.164.25.91 != 64.164.156.82, but both are PacBell DSL
static IP addresses. 64.164.156.82 used to belong to the corporate DSL line
going into my office building. Not long ago, the DSL service was upgraded
and was assigned a new IP address, and about the same time, we set up a mail
server attached to the DSL line and I got a new mail address on the new
domain.

  Not too useful when Yahoo records your IP address.

  And when there are only a couple of regular posters using similar
connections to adsl-64-164-25-91.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net

  I'd guess that there is a moderate probability of you being "Jonathan
Wienke" <mis@itiaccess.com> - JonathanW
(adsl-64-164-156-82.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net [64.164.156.82]) from a couple of
recent postings.

  Of course this is all rampant speculation on my part.
