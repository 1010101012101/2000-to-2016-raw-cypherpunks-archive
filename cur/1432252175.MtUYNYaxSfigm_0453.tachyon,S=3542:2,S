Religion (of any form that posits an afterlife) is a terrorist weapon.

Faith in the man with the silly hat is a WMD.

1. The UN doesn't let Rogues (tm) into the Security Council and thus
a nuke is only *de facto*, not diplomatically useful in deterring
colonial
regime-changing.

2. Far more likely is that a decade's worth of work, a lot of money, and

a few scientists will be vaporized by an Israeli Hellfire, made in the
USofA
by those proud flag-flying folks at Raytheon Death, Inc.

The counter to 2 is to have two or more, one mounted on a missile on a
mobil platform,
how do you say MX in Farsi, and keep everything really really secret.
The first nuke is for demonstration purposes, which
might be a waste if its a U-gun type
(except in making abundantly clear how far along your R&D is :-).
(Remember the
Hiroshima bomb was *not* tested, so sure were the scientists.  Trinity
was
a Pu-implosion finesse job.)

The interesting thing is that Iran isn't buying a few from Pakistan.  Oh
that's right,
the U$ bought the Paki 'leadership'.  Also means that Al Q isn't willing
to share
their stash with Iran.  They probably think they have higher-priority
uses for them.
