``-Helping needy children and parents AND at the same time supporting your=
 own family very well financially.<BR>
<BR>
Every day in your community there are single parents struggling to make en=
ds meet and wondering where the money will come from to cover their childr=
en's basic expenses.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these parents are hard working people who just need help from the =
person who has a legal responsibility to give it to them.<BR>
<BR>
Every day a large number of parents call us for help in collecting their c=
hild support. Many more than we can possibly handle. We need the help of c=
aring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prest=
igious profession.<BR>

The court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caselo=
ads are so large that the results are that there is over $32 Billion dolla=
rs worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today and this amount grow=
s by millions every week.<BR>
<BR>
If you would be interested in helping us, then we have all of the training=
 that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession=
 of "Child Support Processing!"<BR>
<BR>
We have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat par=
ents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to c=
ome into contact with them!<BR>
<BR>
We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the proces=

You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of w=

One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent =
parent "is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration an=
d futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and aut=
horities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case." But th=
is same mother's outlook changed after reviewing our course: "I would have=
 given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $249.00=
 I have ever spent."<BR>
