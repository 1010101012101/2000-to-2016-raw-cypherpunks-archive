By legislative compliance, we mean compliance with laws.  There are no 
key escrow laws in Canada.  There is a privacy law, bill C-6, and we
will help companies comply with that.  We also will help companies
with HIPPA, GLB, the EU privacy directive, and other laws.  There is
also no key escrow law in the US or the EU to date, and we spend time
and energy lobbying to keep it that way.

Umm, so if we split a key three ways (or use three keys to
sequentially encrypt a blob), then no party can decrypt without the
cooperation of the others.  By three keys to sequentially encrypt, I
mean the stored cyphertext is (E_a(E_b(E_c(data)), not that we store
(E_a(data), E_b(data), E_c(data), which would be silly.

Sorry to hear that.  I guess your porting the code isn't enough for
you to trust it.  Odd.
