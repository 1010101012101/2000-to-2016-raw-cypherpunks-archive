This is not new. Al Gore was enthusiastic about "The Matrix" and then 
the Columbine shootings happened. He back-pedalled and began 
explaining away his enthusiasm, with language like the above, about 
it being suitable for adultsbutnotchildren, etc.

This says more about the culture of political correctness in politics 
than about his actual views.

(Sort of comparable to the demands by some on our own list who 
periodically demand that list members "denounce" acts of terrorism or 
whatever it is they don't like. "If you don't come out against the 
bombings of federal buildings, then you are as guilty as the 
bombers.")
