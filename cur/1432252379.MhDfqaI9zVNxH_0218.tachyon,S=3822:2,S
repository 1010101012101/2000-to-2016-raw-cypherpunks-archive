Note that it was the United States Attorney's office which
first published the criminal complaint on July 17 while the case 
records remained sealed until August 6, 2001. The judge's
Minute Order of August 6 stated: "Complaint is ordered unsealed,"
three weeks after the USA deployed the complaint for its exclusive 
spin, and perfectly timed for Mueller's hearing as FBI head --
Mueller's name is on the sealing motion.

For those unable to download the Sklyarov images, here is what
the USA's request to seal said:

-----

The United States of America, through undersigned counsel, requests
that the criminal complaint and arrest warrant to be issued on this date
in the above styled matter remained [sic] sealed until further motion by 
the government. The government requests that the criminal complaint
and arrest warrant be placed under seal to avoid compromising the
investigation or placing any of the agents involved in the investigation
in danger during the completion of the investigation.

Dated July 10, 2001            Respectfully submitted,
                                                ROBERT S. MUELLER, III
                                                United States Attorney

                                                JOSEPH SULLIVAN
                                                Assistant United States
Attorney

-----

The Judge's order to seal:

For the reasons set forth in the government's application for a
sealing order, it is ORDERED that the criminal complaint and
arrest warrant issued on this date in the above styled matter
be sealed.

Dated: 7/10/01                     Patricia Trumbull
                                                United States Magistrate Judge
