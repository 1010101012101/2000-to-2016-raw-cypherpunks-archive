This reminds me of the gunpowder/explosive taggants debate.

Essentially, once tags get small enough, they blow around so much that
they're forensically useless, especially in places where a lot of different
taggants show up together, like, say, a forensic lab. :-)

Remember how the claim was made a decade or so ago, that at small enough
concentrations that just about every bill of any cash denomination had
cocaine on it if it had traded hands more than a few times?

Same idea.

Cheers,
RAH
