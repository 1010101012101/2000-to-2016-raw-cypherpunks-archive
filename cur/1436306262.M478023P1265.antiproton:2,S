	What? Bitcoin exists so that rich people in western countries
	especially the US can become even richer. So far it worked
	pretty well.

	Bitcoin hasn't led to any meaningful political/economic
	change yet, apart from possibly triggering the demise of
	government cash, which would be a complete disaster. Talk about
	'unintended consequences' (unintended?)

	A likely scenario exists in which there wouldn't be any
	independent crypto-currency. There would be fully 'traceable'
	electronic currencies controlled as always by the state and the
	banking mafia.
