But PFF is also a Pundit-Con - it gets its value not only from the speakers
and attendees but also from the reporters who attend, and they're as 
important a
part of the business expenses of the conference as booze and rubber chicken,
and there'd probably be fewer paying attendees without them.
Similarly, at PR-oriented computer conferences (Comdex et al.) that's the case,
while at academic conferences (Crypto in Santa Barbara, for instance),
they're not, and obviously at journalism-oriented conferences they're
the target paying audience so they're not comped.

I suspect Tim's objection to paying high rates for conferences where
journalists are comped is partly due to the content and style of the 
conference...
