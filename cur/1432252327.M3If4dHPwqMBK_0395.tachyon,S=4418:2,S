Clearly Congress isn't following it's own Constitutional directive.

Thank you for conceeding my 'unconstitutional' point.

Why is it that a STOP sign is clearly understood but 'make no law' isn't?
What is the thinking that the government has the authority to break the
law but nobody else does? How can a government which doesn't recognize or
respect its own laws be a honest government? If the government isn't
honest why should it expect anyone to conform?

Actually not, it will be ignored at any and every opportunity. Pretty
reliable mileage in my book.

Which is clearly against 'equal protection' and 'make no law ...'.

[ a bunch of prima facia evidence the US Government is acting
extra-Constitutionaly.]

Yep, clearly the best way to protect democracy is to ignore it.
