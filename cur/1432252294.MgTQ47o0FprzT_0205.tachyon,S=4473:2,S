The wise general will plan his defences according to his opponent's
capabilities, not according to his opponent's avowed intentions.

However, in this case the intention to attack with all available weapons has
not been well hidden. There may be some dupes who honestly profess that no
attack is planned, and some naif's who cannot or will not see the wood, but
they will reap the whirlwind.
