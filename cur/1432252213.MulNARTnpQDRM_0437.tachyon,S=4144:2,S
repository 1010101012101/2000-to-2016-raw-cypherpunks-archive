Crime prevention effects of closed circuit television: a systematic review 
(PDF)
'Across the three settings, mixed results were found for the crime 
prevention effectiveness of CCTV. In the city centre and public housing 
setting, there was evidence that CCTV led to a negligible reduction in 
crime of about two per cent in experimental areas compared with control 
areas. CCTV had a very small but significant effect on crime in the five UK 
evaluations in this setting (three desirable and two undesirable), but had 
no effect on crime in the four North American evaluations. More schemes 
showed evidence of diffusion of benefits than displacement. The four 
evaluations of CCTV in public transportation systems present conflicting 
evidence of effectiveness: two found a desirable effect, one found no 
effect, and one found an undesirable effect on crime ... it was noteworthy 
that the poorly controlled (excluded) studies produced more desirable 
results than the better controlled (included) studies'
