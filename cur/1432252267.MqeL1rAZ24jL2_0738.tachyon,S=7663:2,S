It imported my ascii armored RSA public key just fine. Upon testing, it
correctly sent a signed and encrypted message to my RSA key's associated
email. I was not able to verify the signature though since gpg doesn't
support elliptic curve keys (I wonder why not). Presumably (hopefully)
gpg will be adding EC support in the future and this will no longer be
an issue.
