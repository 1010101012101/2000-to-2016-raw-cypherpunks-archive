And all westerns have some level of aquired imunity, for we are the 
descendents of the plague survivors. (Actualy, in the dark ages, it wasn't 
only one plague.. it was several plagues (mutants and new pathogens) that 
spread wavelike through europe... the populations died mainly because of 
sistematically reduced imunity)
