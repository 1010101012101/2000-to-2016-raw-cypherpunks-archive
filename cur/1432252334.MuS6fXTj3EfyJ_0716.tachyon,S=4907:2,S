Redhat 7 Deluxe contains an offer for a "free" BSafe SDK for 
Linux.  (Redhat 7 contains a number of crypto tools, including OpenSSL, 
Kerberos 5 (real, not the damaged version MS ships), OpenSSH, GnuPG, and a 
bunch of other stuff. A good sign, if they did not ship with a beta version 
of GCC.)

As for RSA marketing... i think they have some serious personal issues they 
need to seek counselling for.  (What is it with the psycho-chick in their 
ads anyways?  Ex-girlfriend? A stab at Dourthy Denning? Some latent BSDi 
fetish?)
