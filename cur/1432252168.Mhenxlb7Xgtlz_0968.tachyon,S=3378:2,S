     Whooooieee! Question authority, you *MUST* be a village idiot. Pretty
strange attitude for someone on cpunks --- but pretty normal attitude for a
lawyer.  It's a sickness that comes from spending all that time reading such
boring crap. Or maybe it's congenital --- maybe you have to be born with a
predisposition to pomposity to be even able to spend all those hours absorbing
all that case law. Gag!
      And, of course, judges are the logical extension of this.
