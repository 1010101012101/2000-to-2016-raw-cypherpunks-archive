OK, I keep getting this shit. Right now, I can't tell if it's anti-agit-prop 
or simply a well-intentioned but idiotic muslim chick (something about the 
wording made me assume this was a female).

Listen up. Cypherpunks is a cryptography list, and al-qaeda.net is a node. 
The subscribers to this list may or may not sympathize with the activites of 
the "Real" "al-qaeda". The name al-qaeda is, I suspect, more or less 
tongue-in-cheek, and at the least (or perhaps the most) a head-nod at some 
of the gripes that real organization has with the US government, and those 
that continue to support it's activites abroad. However, there does not 
appear to be any regular posters to this list that are involved with 
al-qaeda the "terror" network. (Actually, if there are, it would be 
interesting to hear from them via the remailers.)

Cypherpunks is an extremely diverse group of indivduals, that do not appear 
to agree on a great many number of things. What binds us together (if 
anything) is the interest in cryptographic techniques that would appear to 
offer the capability of secure communications, with "communications" meaning 
any kind of transaction that can be transmitted by data over electronic or 
optoelectronic networks. Another thing that seems to bind us (and again 
"bind" is probably a poor choice of words) is an extreme tolerance to 
opinions very different from that of any one subscriber.

Therefore please get a fuckin' clue. If you want to discuss the role of 
"Radical" Islam in contemporary world politics, I'm sure there are those 
that would be interested in doing so. Otherwise, please fuck off.

Sincerely,
Tyler S. Durden
