When you put it like that, sure. When you put it like it's not "overruling the 
chain of command", but "correcting operator mistakes in accordance with 
procedures", it's a whole different story!

The latter creates the appearance as if a drone would not be be able make any 
"wrong" decisions, as all it would base its decisions on would be procedures 
written and implemented by "the right people". What gets hidden in such a 
scenario is that (obviously):
 - procedures are bound to have mistakes themselves (oh, the irony of
   unintended consequences!);
 - people implementing them will make mistakes.

But that will not stop the introduction of such drones, if properly packaged 
in marketing mumbo-jumbo.

Never underestimate the power of new shiny toys for the uniformed (just one 
letter away from "uninformed", eh?) boys!
