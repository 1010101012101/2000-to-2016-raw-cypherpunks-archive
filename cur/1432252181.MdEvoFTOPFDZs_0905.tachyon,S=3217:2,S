On the OpenCM webpage, it proclaims on the right hand side:

    OpenCM is designed as a secure, high-integrity replacement for CVS. 

    Briefly, OpenCM provides ... 
		cryptographic authentication and access control,...
   
	The OpenCM project was originally started because we needed a 
	secure, high-integrity configuration management system 

and on the left hand side of the page it says:

	At the moment, we do not support non-Javascript browsers.


If they are concerned about security, Shouldn't they be avoiding
javascript?
