Yep. I just thought people might appreciate the link. I'd be interested to 
hear from anyone actually running the Cplant to see how it stacks up with 
the other programs out there.. I'll save it for another list, I suppose.

My phrase "interesting possibilities for cryptographic applications" wasn't 
by any means referring to factoring alone.

I wouldn't rule anything out just yet! Fascinating stuff.  And as for the 
problem of it being hard to round up enough Pentiums, plenty of businesses 
upgrading their systems might be willing to donate their old boxes to 
your "good cause" if you find a convincing way to explain what you're 
trying to do. I've been toying with the idea myself on and off for awhile: 
the idea of having your own supercomputer in your basement that you put 
together yourself out of next-to-nothing is just so appealing! Oh well, 
thanks for the links.
