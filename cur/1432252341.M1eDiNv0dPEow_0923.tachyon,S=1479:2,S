If you're not the driver and you don't drive you don't have to have an ID.  
And you can't show what you don't have. In general this is a bad idea however, 
as it makes you more suspicious to the police.  I'm afraid we've entered a new 
era of police state fascism, and it might be better to appear to be someone 
else than the fire breathing Sons of Liberty we imagine we are.
