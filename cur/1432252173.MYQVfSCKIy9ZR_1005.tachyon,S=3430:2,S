Nathan: look at it this way: it's evolution in action.  Except these days
the ability to earn money is one of the requirements of staying alive for
longer periods of time.

If Bob can't afford daily bread, than Bob has far more serious concerns 
than being able to pay for healthcare.  Yes, it's too bad, and yes he
may die, but that's what evolution is about.

Money has aritificially become a requirement of guaranteeing survival.

Sorry, no, I won't pay for Bob's bread nor his healthcare (unless I
personally chose to do so.)  Force me (and everyone else who is able to
earn money) to do so at the point of a gun in the form of taxes and it
becomes a far greater crime.

Yes, there are charities who may help Bob, and donations to these are
and should remain purely voluntary.

We're not commiepunks, and we're not socialistpunks. We're cypherpunks.
