And to increase campaign contributions from high tech companies, 
including MS, to algore. This also didn't work. A handful of 
simp-wimp feminista techies contributed to the Dems. Oh, and 
Microsoft's market rivals...state capitalism at its best.

But the tech heavyweights are only contributing token amounts to the 
Dems. Why should Cisco and Intel donate money to the inventor of the 
Internet?

Now the Dems are seeing that a "breakup of Microsoft" will, if it 
goes through, be remembered as the act which destroyed a U.S. company 
for being too successful and handed the market to others.

So now the Dems are back-pedalling.

Janet Reno and algore will soon be reprising their Wen Ho Lee words: 
"We are very troubled by what our subordinates were doing. We shall 
begin an investigation. Pay no attention to your earlier comments. 
Those statements are no longer operative."
