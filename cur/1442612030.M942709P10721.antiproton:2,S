Within the last couple of months, I think somebody was arrested for plannin=

Microwaves, OTOH, can be focussed rather easily. =C2=A0The frequency is 2.4=

I'd have to consult a Radio Amateur's handbook, but a modern dish (intended=

with isotropic. =C2=A0An old-style 8-foot dish probably would do 30 db gain=
. =C2=A0That would be 100 kilowatts ERP.
Such an unshielded =C2=A0(open) device would probably impair WiFi at 2.5 Gh=

Ordinary microwave ovens are probably 75%-80% efficient. =C2=A0Thus, if you=
 need to supply a 1 kilowatt microwave, you'll probably need 1250 watts of =
AC power.
