  Issue 8                                                June 20, 2001

   Editor's Note                                              [Image]
   Today, StockNight brings to you a substantial press release from a
   company with a business plan a little different from those we
   normally feature. The release, issued close to the end of trading
   today, announces the listing of The Neptune Society on the OTC
   bulletin board. The company had been trading on the Pink Sheets in
   the $5 range before this long awaited announcement.

   The Neptune Society (otcbb: NTUN).                         [Image]

   Headquartered in Burbank, CA., The Neptune Society Inc. is one of
   North America's largest cremation specialists, and is the only
   publicly traded company dealing solely in cremation services. The
   Neptune Society, operating for nearly three decades with locations
   in California, Florida, New York, Washington, Iowa, Oregon and
   Arizona has provided thousands of cremation services and currently
   has close to 60,000 active contracts and nearly $40 million in
   trust in its unique Pre-Need program. The Neptune Society's goal
   is to provide a simple, dignified and economic alternative to the
   traditional funeral burial service system.

              The Neptune Society Receives Approval on Its
                               Form 211.
              Company Now Listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.

   BURBANK, Calif., June 20 -- The Neptune Society (OTC Bulletin
   Board: NTUN), one of the country's largest publicly traded
   cremation specialists, announced today that the Form 211 that has
   been filed by Herzog Heine Geduld, a Merrill Lynch Company, has
   been approved and The Neptune Society has returned to trading on
   the National Association Securities Dealers Over-The-Counter
   Bulletin Board.

   The Neptune Society Inc. is one of North America's largest
   cremation specialists, and is the only publicly traded company
   with a business strategy that focuses solely on providing
   cremation services. The Company believes its competitive strategy
   coupled with a selective acquisition and expansion program will
   enable the Company to establish itself as a leader in the
   cremation service industry and maximize shareholder value.
   Neptune's plan is to become the largest and most trusted name in
   the cremation service industry. During the last 12 months, the
   Company completed three strategic acquisition/mergers in
   Washington, Oregon and Iowa and opened one new office in the
   Seattle, Washington area, resulting in a market presence serving
   approximately five million people in Washington, Oregon and Iowa.
   As a result of these acquisitions, the Neptune Society now has a
   market presence in seven different states, including California,
   Florida and New York. The Neptune Society is currently planning
   two additional ``start-up'' locations, which are anticipated to be
   opened this year. The targeted market areas have a total
   population in excess of another two and one half million people.
   In addition, the Company is examining four new states as possible
   locations for ``start-up'' locations during 2002. The Company
   believes that continued growth and development of The Neptune
   Society brand name will assist the Company in achieving its goal
   of becoming the largest provider of cremation services in the
   United States.

   An added benefit to the Portland, Oregon transaction is that The
   Apogee Companies, Inc. has become a major shareholder in the
   Neptune Society. Roy P. Disney (of the Disney family), and
   Apogee's Chairman said, ``We will miss having CMC as one of our
   Apogee Companies, but we are looking forward to becoming part of a
   much bigger effort with our new friends down the street at
   Neptune.''

   Marco Markin, President and CEO of the Neptune Society, said, ``I
   am happy that the Neptune Society is now a full reporting company
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more importantly
   with the growth that Neptune has achieved over the last 18 months.
   Market share in Washington, Oregon and Iowa has surpassed our
   expectations and we foresee continued growth in these states.''
