Cool story bro.

Anyone else who downloaded it care to share/compare hashes? If hashes differ, can then check diffs?

Cryptome does not pretend to provide illusory security, that is
security.<br />
It is a vile, rotten, corrupt endeavor, like life. Chuckle.<br /><br />
Visitors, readers, consumers must be skeptical of security, and not
rely<br />
upon security promoters, their followers and investors who exploit <br />
dependency by fear uncertainty and doubt. <br /><br />
Skepticism of security claims and methods is one of the purposes of <br />
these lists. Perhaps the main purpose, although it is commonplace
for<br />
these lists to be used for soliciting befuddled consumers to hop
aboard<br />
the gravy train. Now and then skeptcism of the security arises but is
usually<br />
suppressed during times of crisis when incentive is rich to promote
poor<br />
products and services. Governments, commerce, orgs, experts
cooperate<br />
to foster crises under guise of opposition.<br /><br />
This applies to all forms of security, safety, protection, defense,
hygienic<br />
pharma. <br /><br />
Still, Cryptome endorses the continuing struggle to improve citizen<br />
protection, not only as a job, career, industry, but as citizens'
obligation <br />
to bear responsibility for the commonweal against its inside and outside
<br />
enemies, if you will, common math against the deadly germs.<br /><br />
One way to do that is to not oversell it, tone down the threats,
reduce<br />
drumbeating, avoid hyperbole for and against, forego advertising,<br />
gang-bang hectoring, circle jerk conferencing, TEDing, prize
bestowing,<br />
to quietly invent, improve, critique, test, apply, re-test often, expect
to<br />
be deceived by colleagues witting or unwitting, especially by sales,<br />
politicians, authoritarians -- the persistent germs.<br /><br />
