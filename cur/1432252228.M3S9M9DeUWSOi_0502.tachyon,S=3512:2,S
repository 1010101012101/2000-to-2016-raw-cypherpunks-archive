So:  our free speech -- our ability to express ideas -- is now subject
to the imprimature of the US copyright office, who we need to appeal to
for "exemptions"?? 

How many *other* Federal Agencies do you think will step forth to claim
this power, as well???

One would certainly hope the courts would figure this one out as
blatantly unconstitutional....

If we give in [to the impulse to censor and 
instill speech codes] then we are giving to 
the bigots the gift of our freedom. If you 
give in, what you're saying is that Freedom 
is less important than not being offended. 
What a disaster for a country whose *soul* 
depends on Liberty.
