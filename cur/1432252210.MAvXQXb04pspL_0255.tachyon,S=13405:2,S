The Growing Power of Networks

The tragic events of September 11th made brutally clear that the 
fight for the future is not between the armies of leading states, nor 
are its weapons those of conventional armed forces. Rather, today's 
combatants come from terrorist groups like Osama bin Laden's 
al-Qaeda, or drug smuggling cartels like those ravaging Colombia and 
Mexico. On the positive side are non-violent, civil-society activists 
fighting for the environment, democracy and human rights. What all 
have in common is that they operate in small, dispersed units that 
can deploy nimbly-anywhere, anytime. They know how to penetrate and 
disrupt, as well as elude and evade. They all feature network forms 
of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the 
information age. And, from al-Qaeda to the Intifadah to the drug war, 
they are proving very hard to beat...

Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy, by 
John Arquilla and David F. Ronfeldt, Editors, (RAND, 2001) examines 
this new spectrum of conflict emerging in the wake of the information 
revolution. Netwar includes conflicts waged, on the one hand, by 
terrorists, criminals, gangs, and ethnic extremists; and by 
civil-society activists (such as cyber activists or WTO protestors) 
on the other. What distinguishes netwar is the networked 
organizational structure of its practitioners-with many groups 
actually being leaderless-and their quickness in coming together in 
swarming attacks.

Completed shortly before terrorists attacked New York and Washington, 
the volume includes an Afterword analyzing the Attack on America. The 
events of September 11, 2001, tragically reinforced Arquilla and 
Ronfeldt's conclusion that in order to confront this new type of 
conflict, it is crucial for governments, military, and law 
enforcement to begin networking themselves.

"Just as a half century ago, researchers at RAND sought to understand 
the profound changes in strategy brought about by nuclear weapons and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles," says Brian Michael Jenkins, one 
of the world's foremost experts on terrorism and crime, "Arquilla and 
Ronfeldt explore the strategic implications of new information 
technologies in the latest installment of their seminal work... 
Networks and Netwars obliges us to think in new ways."

In Networks and Netwars, the editors and their colleagues examine the 
major instances of netwar that have occurred over the past several 
years-from Osama bin Laden's networked terrorists to the Battle of 
Seattle's social activists-and find, among other things, that netwars 
have generally been successful from the protagonists' perspective.

The authors also find that, despite their diversity, all networks 
built for waging netwar may be analyzed in terms of a common analytic 
framework. There are five critical levels of theory and practice: the 
technological, social, narrative, organizational, and doctrinal 
levels. A netwar actor must get all five right to be fully effective. 
The most potent netwarriors will not only be highly networked and 
have the capacity for mounting "swarming" attacks, they will also be 
held together by strong social ties, have secure communications 
technologies, and project a common "story" about why they are 
together and what they need to do. Like Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda, 
these are the most serious adversaries. But even those networks that 
are weak on some levels may pose stiff challenges to their 
nation-state adversaries.

With this in mind, it is necessary to go beyond simply diagnosing the 
nature of the networked nonstate opponent in a given conflict. "A 
particular challenge for the cumbersome American bureaucracy will be 
to encourage deep, all-channel networking among the military, law 
enforcement, and intelligence elements whose collaboration is crucial 
for achieving success," Arquilla and Ronfeldt explain in the 
Afterword. "U.S. agencies have been headed in this direction for 
years-in the areas of counter-narcotics as well as 
counterterrorism-but interagency rivalries and distrust have too 
often slowed progress."

Writers who focus on the technological aspects of netwar often miss 
the point. As the editors point out, "At its heart, Netwar is far 
more about organization and doctrine than it is about technology. The 
outcomes of current and future netwars are bound to confirm this."

Nathan Gardels, editor of New Perspectives Quarterly, and author of 
The Changing Global Order, says "Arquilla and Ronfeldt are a rare 
breed: strategic thinkers of the information age. In Networks and 
Netwars they grasp an emerging reality still lost on those 
preoccupied with the geostrategic balance of power: War in the future 
will be waged by leaderless networks that can come together quickly 
out of cyberspace to 'swarm' an opponent. Like few others, they 
recognize that the flipside of the celebrated global civil society 
born of the Internet is the 'uncivil society' of terrorists and 
criminals who will use the same means to spread havoc and 
instability."

"Rushing into an increasingly complex world, we need ways to probe 
the road ahead, to find the quicksand and pitfalls before falling 
in," says David Brin, author of The Postman, Earth, and The 
Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between 
Privacy and Freedom? "Arquilla and Ronfeldt have taken on this hard 
task, searching for technological threats to a society that has grown 
reliant on data-based infrastructure... In this collection of cogent 
articles, by experts in the field of netwar, they clarify some of the 
dangers that await us-and reveal possible ways to avoid them. It's 
obviously an important and seminal work. I especially like their 
analysis of the key features that enable groups to be effective in 
this new arena of conflict."
