Personally, I'm going with D but with some caveats. Snowden has long
preached the 'encryption works but the endpoints are so weak that it
often doesn't matter'. I've always read this as 'encryption works when
it's done right. And it's almost never done right'. This might have
been a hint about Heartbleed, but I doubt it. I don't see Snowden as
the type of man who'd put the entire world's security at risk just in
the interests of US National Security.

This is why I've long been an advocate of total disclosure. I think
the document holders should publish everything they have. After they
do that, they could continue to 'leak release' documents with detailed
explanations for those who are too lazy or too confused by the
documents to sift through them and read them but having a document
dump out there would make the process of disclosure /much/ faster. And
it would freak the NSA out - a happy plus. I say fuck national
security. These guys are burning down the entire world just to further
their agenda. They deserve no consideration, even if it does put them
at a disadvantage.
