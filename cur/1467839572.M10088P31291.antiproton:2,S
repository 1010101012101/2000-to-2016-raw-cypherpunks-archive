I have long considered this a minor but common cognitive error:  It
present a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. My
suggestion:  When you do drugs, don't drink and drive.

That's on the record via a non-Snowden leak of NSA filter rules
published by a German paper.

But obsessive avoidance of surveillance takes one out of the game of
propaganda and networking for IRL political actions.  It also limits
one's ability to monitor opposition propaganda and team building
efforts.  That's a big win for the opposition:  The so-called chilling
effect of mass surveillance that makes Liberals run and hide while the
Radicals laugh and high five each other.

It is also beneficial to use evasive tools and tactics on a regular
basis whether you need to or not, both to maintain the tools, stay
current on the state of those arts, and so that occasional use of such
tools for practical purposes will not stand out as red flag indicators
that you are doing something especially interesting.
