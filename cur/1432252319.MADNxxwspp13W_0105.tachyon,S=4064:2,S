Yes:  Windows has one documented public key that it uses to 
check software that gets, eg, mailed to it via outlook, or 
downloads in a webpage via Explorer, or etc, to decide whether 
it is "trusted" software or not.  If it is trusted software 
(presumably from Microsoft) then it can be run without 
popping up a dialog box and getting the user's attention/
permission. Otherwise, "normal" security methods apply. 

People with debuggers long since discovered that there is more 
than one key ( though there are conflicting reports about 
whether there are two or three), but had no idea why there 
would be more than one unless  Microsoft wanted to enable 
some third party to create "trusted" applications without 
Microsoft's knowledge or review.

Recently when a windows system was made available in a debug 
build (ie, with the symbolic names etc still in the code), it 
was discovered that one of the "extra" keys was named NSA_key, 
which gives at least a strong hint as to who else is allowed 
to create "trusted" downloadable software.
