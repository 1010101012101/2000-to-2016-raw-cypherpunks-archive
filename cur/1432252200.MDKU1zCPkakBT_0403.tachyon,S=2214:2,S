This is idiotic.  You're claiming that the definition of "terrorist" is
dependent not on the act, but on why the act was committed.  So if I was
to go out tomorrow and spread 2000 curies of Ci into the local subway
system "As payback for Ruby Ridge", this would not be an act of terrorism?

You're a fucking moron.
