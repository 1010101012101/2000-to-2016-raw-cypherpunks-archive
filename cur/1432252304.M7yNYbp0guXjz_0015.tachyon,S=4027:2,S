Oh?  Name one please.  After all, it would sort of defeat the 
purpose...  As to your comment about having a database mapping 
pseudonyms to names, if one of those exists for a given remailer, 
it's not an ananymous remailer.  I certainly hope none of the 
remailers in use by users here do such things.
