Well, to be fair to moxie, TextSecure uses a modified OTR that uses ECC,
afaik.

I think this criticism is also a bit unfair. The scheme of using
generating prekeys for later key agreement is pretty clever. With this,
moxie is not trying to solve, or claiming to have solved, the larger
problem of binding user account to public key. For the binding problem,
he is completely punting, and relying on a central authority, afaik,
which is awful and horrible for all the reasons you state. But the key
agreement part is cooool.

If you could solve the binding problem some other way, then moxie's
prekey approach could be used for all kinds of things, even email.

For the user public key binding problem, you have a proposal [0], I have
a proposal [1], Paul Wouters has a proposal [2], there are probably
several more people on the list with proposals too. One of them will
probably work, eventually. And when one does, the prekey approach to key
agreement could come in very handy.
