   It's not setting up tls itself that's the problem, really, it's the cert
generation that got me bogged down and so everytime I've tried it, first with
sendmail and then with postfix, I've ended up with "okay, when I've got more
time I'll finish this". 
    Of course, ipsec is the same way. Setting up ipsec on a cisco router is sure
a lot easier.
