You forgot to include the part where the drones follow each of the 100,000 
Mexicans all the way to the farms they work for 50 cents an hour. Come to 
think of it, to multiply the real purpose of the drones, there should be a 
picture of a taco and a fuck-you middle finger painted on each of the 
drone's belly.
