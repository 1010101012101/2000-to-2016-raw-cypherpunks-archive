No serious person could have believed that even a swimming pool full of 
Adleman's DNA would have made a dent in crypto. I know I discussed this 
shortly after the publicity about Adleman's work hit.

Check the archives.

I don't think you'll find any of us, or any cryptographers, arguing 
that it was "substantial breakthrough for crypto."

If you do, please post.

Silly words.
