USG wins by assault, PR, obscurity, secrecy, and sanctification of 
the justice-court system.

No substantiation yet of USG access to Farook's phone. The claim 
could be a ploy to raise doubt about Apple security, and have the 
same effect as if access was successful. This would
take the public and political pressure off USG without having to 
disclose how access was obtained. As well as improve USG reputation 
for prowess, determination and triumph.

Deception, lies, bluffs and ploys are obligatory in legal proceedings 
and all stripes of security. Doubt, braggardy, obscurity and secrecy 
are essential features of defensive and aggressive security whether 
governmental, commercial or personal.
