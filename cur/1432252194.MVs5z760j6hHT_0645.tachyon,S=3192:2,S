You are full of shit.  The smallpox vaccine is not made from cowpox
or from smallpox (variola) virus.  It is made from the vaccinia virus.
Did you ever wonder where the word "vaccine" comes from?

The reason routine smallpox vaccinations ended was because some people
have a bad reaction to the vaccinia virus, even though a strain is used
that is generally benign.  Since the vaccination was thought to confer
no benefit and does carry some risk, it was discontinued.

Do a google search on "smallpox vaccine" next time before you spout off
with ignorant garbage like this.
