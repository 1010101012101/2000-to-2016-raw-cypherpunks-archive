That was certainly one of the most overt reasons for the war.  An equally 
plausible reason has it as an inevitable climax of a centuries-long 
philosophic development, preaching three fundamental ideas: the worship of 
unreason, the demand for self-sacrifice and the elevation of society or the 
state above the individual.  These three ideas spewed forth from some of 
the most respected philosophers of the late 19th Century (e.g., Kant).  An 
excellent book "Ominous Parallels," by Leonard Peikoff builds the case that 
the rise of Nazism was facilitated by the philosophical content of 
mainstream German culture, and that the basic anti-individualist, 
anti-reason orientations of this culture are also apparent in modern 
American culture (hence the "Ominous Parallels").
