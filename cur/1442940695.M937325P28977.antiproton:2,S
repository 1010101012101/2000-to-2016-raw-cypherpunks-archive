Either find a local broker (cash for bitcoin) or learn to use the wot (
https://bitcoin-otc.com/
http://www.btcalpha.com/blog/2015/explore-the-web-of-trust/). Everything
else is generally a scam, at least in the sense that you'll be giving your
ass to a unknown number of agents, even if you don't get robbed right away.

Circle, Bitpay, Xapo, GoCoin etc etc etc can't be trusted. They deal in
fiat, have to submit to governments, to banks, to many parties whose
interests aren't your best. And that assuming they will not run away with
the coins, which shouldn't be unexpected, considering for instance that
gold has been confiscated by governments before.
