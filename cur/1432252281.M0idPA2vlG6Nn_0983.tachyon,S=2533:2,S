Should be amusing wordplay to see Bush deal with this...

     Israel, incensed at Wednesday's assassination of right-wing cabinet
minister and former
      general Rehavam Zeevi, threatened to invoke the war on terrorism
to justify attacking the
      Palestinians if they fail to hand over Zeevi's killers.

Lets repeat our training:
    I fight for freedom
    You are a guerilla
    They are terrorists

And don't plan on vacationing in Indonesia for a while...
