There's talk about using regular army troops at the Capitol:

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Authorities at the nation's Capitol building are
considering bringing in military troops to supplement U.S. Capitol police

That means the troops involved could be National Guard troops or they
could be regular Army troops or from another branch of the military.
