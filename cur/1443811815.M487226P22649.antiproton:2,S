Good to hear someone being healthily sceptical about it.
If you think of Bitnation of inspirational/theoretical arts project its kind=
 of cute. Though proof of existence that was the only thing that they were s=
howing of is definitely not a Bitnation thing.=20
The problem is if a project like that claims to provide or at least to try t=
o build any infrastructure - is misleading. I also find it sad when someone p=
uts a brand on ideas and concept developed by someone else.
A problem is that a lot of blockchain-romantic kids rave about Bitnation and=
 just get excited about the wrong thing really - a shiny turd.=20

&gt; It's documentation is overly verbose, speculative, assuming and unclear=
.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I love the idea of providing services that the government usually tends=
 to.<br>
Everyone loves ideas that Bitnation put their brand on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I somewhat know what marriage before God means. I somewhat know what<br=

&gt; marriage before the State means. I have no idea what marriage before th=
e<br>
&gt; Blockchain means. Probably no more than lovers' tree-carvings.<br>
Exactly. Proof-of-existence. I don't understand what it has to do with Bitna=
tion brand. Someone just wants to look cool. What exactly Bitnationare build=
ing?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Relationship to reality is the hardest part - it's also where things li=
ke<br>
&gt; enforcement starts turning it's ugly head.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'd argue marriage before state is an artifact of the marriage between<=
br>
&gt; church and state. Relationships, commitments, etc, these would be bette=
r<br>
&gt; explained in contract.<br>
Yes. Obligations can be explained. Still people go to courts and dispute con=
tracts. These are text.<br>
&gt; Contracts can go onto a blockchain.<br>
Contracts which go on the blockchain have nothing to do with legal contracts=
. Parts of the text (legal) contracts can be hooked to a smart contract I gu=
ess.<br>
I guess if a married couple has a dispute over digital property or btc in a w=
allet, let's say a script can manage it, but how the script (smart contract)=
 will know who in this particular dispute did what. Even with no details and=
 subtleties involved.<br>
&gt; Generic. Neat.<br>
&gt; Unpretentious.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Bitnation is fascinating, thought provoking, but it seems somewhat off.=
<br>
Ideas are nice. They're not necessarily coming from Bitnation. Proof of exis=
tence, or Blockchain ID for example were existing ideas which had functionin=
g prototypes. They just don't make it sound grandiose.<br>
<br>
Bitnation has a claim to be a software project and afaik has a presale of a c=
urrency - either premined or non existent - I don't remember. I'm fine with t=
hat type of crowdfunding if there is some sort of product or a service behin=
d it or an attempt to build it. I don't think that contemporary art project s=
hould pretend to be a software project or pretend that it can realistically o=
ffer serious services or replace existing ones. It's cool as a concept proje=
ct.<br>

&gt; We're happy to announce the release v0.0.2 of Repbin:<br>
&gt; The replicated, encrypted, distributed and anonymized pastebin.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Changes include: Better terminal usability, sqlite/mysql backend,<br>

&gt; About Repbin:<br>
&gt; Repbin is an encrypted pastebin for the command line that runs over Tor=
!<br>
&gt; Repbin servers form a distributed network where nodes sync posts with<b=
r>
&gt; each other (like in Usenet or BBS/Fido systems). This makes Repbin<br>
&gt; resilient and scalable. Repbin focuses on privacy (encrypted messages)<=
