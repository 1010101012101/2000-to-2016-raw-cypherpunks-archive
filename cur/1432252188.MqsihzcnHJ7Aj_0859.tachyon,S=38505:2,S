1. Hadopi 2's final vote is postponed till 15 September
============================================================

The French deputies had only a few days before the summer vacation to debate
the new text of the three strikes law (called Hadopi 2) that was adopted by
the Senate on 8 July 2009. As the opposition introduced a very large number
of amendments, a vote for the entire text was not possible and the National
Assembly President's decision was to postpone the vote until September.

The Assembly had 894 amendments to discuss but the text was not basically
modified, but rather adjusted. One of the good decisions was that the
surveillance of electronic communications will not be possible so e-mails
were excluded from the investigation field. The access to the Internet will
be cut off only in case of recurrent alleged illegal file-sharing or in case
the Internet connection was not secured after a first warning from Hadopi
authority.

The deputies also approved the penal ordinance procedure meaning that the
alleged illegal downloader can be sanctioned in his (her) absence, according
to a rapid procedure, by a sole judge. The user in case could be given a
fine but can also ask for a classical procedure. The text is different from
the one voted by the Senate which means that a Mixted Paritary Commission
will be needed in order to find a compromise between the two versions.
Anyway, the text still ignores the presumption of innocence which is
contradicting the Constitution, as previousely ruled by the Constitutional
Council.

The amendment regarding the two euro "creative contribution" to the
Internet subscription in order to finance the creators was again rejected
but during a meeting with the socialists, the new Minister of Culture
Fridiric Mitterrand, while stating that he supported the Government 
position
on Hadopi, also admitted that the draft law was not solving the issue of the
financing of culture.

And as the opposition has already promised to appeal again to the
Constitutional Council in case the draft law is voted by the National
Assembly, the text might also have to pass the constitutionality test as
well.

2. EU wants to share more bank details with the US authorities
============================================================

The dispute between EU and the US on access to the bank transfer details
has come again to the public attention after the Belgium company SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) that
intermediates the international banking transactions has decided to open
a new server in Switzerland that will focus on European customers.

SWIFT has now two servers in the Netherlands and in the state of
Virginia, with identical data. After 11 September 2001, US intelligence
services had gained access to the system, including to European
inner-transactions. This became public in 2006 and led to a data
protection outcry. In 2007, a first agreement was reached between the US
and the EU to establish what set of SWIFT data can be accessed by US
authorities and under what circumstances.

The European Commission also appointed the French judge Jean-Louis
Bruguihre to examine if the US really use the data only for the
anti-terrorism fight. The report, that has never been made public, was
presented to the European Parliament on 17 February 2009 and concluded
that the data was deleted when no longer necessary and that the US
authorities fully respect the agreement with the EU. But Bruguihre, the
Vice-President of the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, has in the
past 25 years gained a reputation as France's "leading terrorist
hunter", so the outcome of the report was predictable.

SWIFT will open a new server in Switzerland for inner-European
transactions in September, which would exclude US authorities from
accessing these. While this would have eased a lot of the criticism from
data protection commissioners and the European Parliament, the European
Commission is now drafting a new agreement with the US authorities
before the new server starts operations.

This met heavy cricism from MEPs, as the European Parliament would again be 
sidelined by this. MEPs as well as national-level politicians alsocriticized 
the plan on substantial grounds, citing fundamental privacy concerns. The 
chairman of the Austrian social democrats in the EP said: "the EU is not a 
colony of the US". Some MEPs have already questioned the re-election of 
Commission president Manuel Barroso. Because of the upcoming federal 
elections and the rising worries about surveillance among the German 
population, vocal criticism came especially from German politicians, 
including many Greens, the chairman of the Liberal Party, the conservative 
Bavarian head of government Horst Seehofer, and others.

EU justice commissioner Jacques Barrot denied these accusations in a
meeting on 23 July with the members of the newly formed European
Parliamentary Committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs. He
also concluded that he wants in fact a better deal: "We must negotiate
an agreement based on reciprocity rather than allowing the US to
continue as they have up until now as if they were top dog." According
to a Commission spokesperson, the deal will not include EU access to US
banking transactions, though.

Jaques Barrot confirmed that the Commission wants to re-negotiate this
agreement after one year. By then, the Lisbon Treaty, which would give
European Parliament a much more important role in this field, is
expected to be in force. But an interim agreement was needed to be
rapidly concluded in order not to stop the anti-terrorism fight.

The Council of Foreign Ministers gave a green light on 27 July to the
project, by unanimously agreeing to allow the Swedish Presidency to
negotiate a temporary agreement with the US regarding access to data
held by SWIFT. According to news reports, the mandate includes that the
data would be given to US authorities on a per-request basis and could
be stored in the US for five years.

Apparently, the EU bodies want to built their own system of banking
surveillance, that might include the SEPA (Single Euro Payment Area)
transaction system. This may be done in connection with the proposed
"Stockholm Programme", the EU's justice and home affairs work plan for
2010 to 2014. The draft already stipulates:

"The instruments for combating the financing of terrorism must be
adapted to the new potential vulnerabilities of the financial system and
to the new payment methods used by terrorists. We must have a mechanism
that allows both adequate monitoring of financial flows and effective
and transparent identification of people and groups likely to finance
terrorism. "

3. EC hearing on Google book deal
============================================================

The European Commission (EC) will hold a hearing on 7 September 2009 to
evaluate Google's proposed deal with U.S. publishers and authors granting
Google the right to digitize and publish out of print copyrighted books and
its possible impact upon copyright issues.

Spokesman Oliver Drewes said EU officials wanted to get the opinion of
European publishers, authors and consumers in order to be able to "draw
provisional conclusions on the Google Inc.'s book-scanning settlement." The
EU launched a formal inquiry in the matter after the German delegation,
supported by UK and France, submitted an information note in May 2009,
asking for action against Google's online library project.

In the US, Google reached an agreement in October 2008 with the Authors
Guild and the Association of American publishers in which Google accepted to
pay about 88 million euro to create a Book Rights Registry, where authors
and publishers can register works. Google would get rights in return for a
share of any revenues collected by selling access to online books.

The agreement is criticized for giving Google preferential rights especially
in case of the "orphan works" (books for which the copyright owners cannot
be identified). The regulators might also tackle the issue of the
"most-favoured nation" clause guaranteeing Google terms that are at least as
good as those offered to other Internet companies in future.

Google executives argue that the company will have no unfair advantages
while providing increased access to books. In support of their cause, the
company will probably bring as argument Viviane Reding's position who,
earlier this month, stated that EU needed to urgently standardize its
copyright laws to encourage book digitization.

Another argument that might be in Google's favour is that this is the only
initiative to scan millions of books and make them available on the
Internet. Also, Google's leading lawyer David Drummond said that Google
would be open to changing the terms of the deal if it received a "compelling
argument" from regulators.

The U.S. Justice Department is also looking now into this settlement.

4. UK ISP gave up direct disconnection of file-sharers for a three strikes
============================================================

UK ISP Karoo belonging to Hull based KCom telecom company, announced on 24
July it would change its policy and apply a three-strikes system for the
customers allegedly infringing copyright.

Within the agreement with the entertainment industries, the UK ISPs have
agreed to send out warning letters to users suspected of downloading
copyrighted material from the Internet. Karoo, holding the monopoly in Hull
as the only ISP in area, has been exceeded this procedure for some time now,
having directly disconnected its users for suspected file-sharing. In order
to get their service restored, customers had to sign a document admitting
their guilt and promising not to repeat the offence. Therefore, the method
not only ignored the presumption of innocence but actually blackmailed users
by obliging them to admit guilt in order to be reconnected.

Following the exposure of the company's policy by BBC which made public the
case of a customer having been disconnected and asked to fill in a form
admitting her guilt in order to be reconnected, Karoo decided to adopt a
three-strikes rule in which suspected file-sharers will receive three
written warnings before action is taken.

The major issue is that Karoo takes its actions without any court decision,
based only on accusations made by anti-piracy organizations which use
evidence gathering methods that are far from being accurate or reliable.
Although rights holders have stated that their data was never wrong, a
report made last year by the University of Washington, Department of
Computer Science and Engineering has clearly shown the vulnerabilities of
the methods.

"Whether a false positive sent to a user that has never even used
BitTorrent or a truly infringing user that relies on incomplete IP
blacklists, there is currently no way for anyone to wholly avoid the risk of
complaints.(...) We have further demonstrated that IP blacklists, a
standard method for avoiding systematic monitoring, are wholly ineffective
given current identification techniques and provide only limited coverage of
likely monitoring agents" says the report.

Therefore, as the report and reality have shown, there is a large risk that
innocent people are accused of illegal file-sharing.

5. Finnish CSS case application lodged in the European Court of Human Rights
==========================================================

Finnish Activist Mikko Rauhala has lodged an application to the European
Court of Human Rights versus the Finnish state, regarding his right to
freedom of expression.

The appeal is a follow up to the lengthy court process against Mr. Rauhala
in Finland. The process started when Mr. Rauhala started a discussion board
on the Internet, on which people could talk about the DVD copy protection
method Content Scrambling System (CSS). Mr. Rauhala's motivation for this
act was to criticize the implementation of the EU Copyright Directive in
Finland which came into force in 2006. According to the implementation of
the directive, "organized discussion" regarding circumventing technological
protection measures, like the CSS, was prohibited. Mr. Rauhala's motivation
was to display the disbeneficial nature of the directive. Thus, he himself
reported his actions to the Finnish police in the first place, thinking that
the police would not investigate the issue or that the public prosecutor
would not press charges.

However the Police started its investigation with the public prosecutor who
was supported strongly by the Finnish Anti-Piracy Association which
arranged the "expert" testimonies for the prosecutor. Soon thereafter, the
case was referred to the Helsinki District Court which decided in Rauhala's
favor; that CSS was not a type of protection measure covered by the
Directive and therefore the ban did not apply. The district attorney
appealed to the Helsinki Appellate Court, which stated that Mr. Rauhala was
guilty of illegally circumventing a technological protection measure and of
providing an illegal service for the circumvention of protection measures.
The Supreme Court of Finland denied Mr. Rauhala's application.

Mr. Rauhala had no other choice than to make an application to the European
Court of Human Rights, because in all the court instances his argument that
the discussion he was administering was within the confines of the Right to
Freedom of Speech, as enshrined in the Finnish Constitution, was not
considered. Mr. Rauhala is represented by the Helsinki, Finland based law
firm Turre Legal.

6. EDPS: New privacy issues in relation to intelligent transport systems
============================================================

Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS),
issued on 22 July his opinion on the European Commission's proposed plan,
adopted in December 2008, to accelerate and coordinate the deployment of
intelligent transport systems (ITS) in road transportation in Europe, and
their connection with other modes of transport . The deployment includes an
Action Plan establishing priority areas for action and a Directive proposal
laying down the framework for their implementation.

Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are applications using Information and
Communication Technologies embedded in different modes of transport that
interact between them (such as GPS systems), meant to make transport safer
and cleaner and to reduce traffic congestion. ITS applications and services
are based on the collection, processing and exchange of a large range of
data and allow for the tracking of a vehicle and the collection of personal
data such as driving habits. As such, they raise several privacy and data
protection issues.

"The problem is not what the data tells the state, but what happens with
interlocking information it already has. If you correlate car tracking data
with mobile phone data, which can also track people, there is the potential
for an almost infallible surveillance system," said Simon Davies, director
of the watchdog Privacy International.

While welcoming the fact that the proposed ITS deployment plan aims at
harmonising the data processes throughout Europe, the EDPS however warned
that the proposed plan raised a series of issued related to privacy and data
protection.

Hustinx believes there is a lack of clarity of the proposed legal framework
that might create diversity in the implementation of ITS in Europe thus
leading to different levels of data protection in Europe. "The EDPS
emphasizes the need for further harmonisation on these issues at EU level to
clarify outstanding issues (such as definition of the roles and
responsibilities of ITS actors, which specific ITS applications and systems
must be embedded in vehicles, the development of harmonised contracts for
the provision of ITS services, the specific purposes and modalities of use
of ITS etc)."

One important aspect in his opinion is that data controllers must be clearly
identified "as they will bear the responsibility to ensure that privacy and
data protection considerations are implemented at all levels of the chain of
processing."

Also, the data controllers providing ITS services should implement
appropriate safeguards "so that the use of location technologies is not
intrusive from a privacy viewpoint. This should notably require further
clarification as to the specific circumstances in which a vehicle will be
tracked, strictly limiting the use of location devices to what is necessary
for that purpose and ensuring that location data are not disclosed to
unauthorized recipients".

The interconnection of the systems and applications must also be done "with
due respect for data protection principles and practical safeguards on
security," and personal data must be processed only if necessary "for the
specific purpose for which ITS is used and pursuant to an appropriate legal
basis".

The EDPS emphasizes the importance of not using the processed personal data
"for further purposes that are incompatible with those for which they were
collected" and he recommends the introduction of an explicit reference to
the notion of ''privacy by design'' for ITS applications and systems saying
that data "may not be used for purposes other than the ones for which they
were collected in a way incompatible with those purposes."

The EDPS recommends that privacy and data protection should be considered
during the early design stages of any ITS. "Privacy and security
requirements should be incorporated within standards, best practices,
technical specifications and systems."

His final recommendation is that data protection authorities, such as
Article 29 Working Party and the EDPS should be closely involved in all the
initiatives related to the deployment of ITS "through consultation at a
sufficiently early stage before the development of relevant measures."

7. France: CNIL's opinion on LOPPSI draft law
============================================================

The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) has now made public its opinion
of 16 April 2009 on seven articles belonging to LOPPSI, the French draft law
on orientation and programming for the performance of the domestic security
that may give the police the possibility to spy on electronic communications
and which introduces Internet filtering by administrative decision.

The draft law was presented on 27 May by Minister of Justice Michhle
Alliot-Marie to the French Council of Ministers but it's only now that CNIL
can make its opinion public due to new legal provisions introduced in May.
The Minister did not choose to take CNIL's opinion into consideration.

In its opinion, CNIL was expressing fears related to several provisions of
the draft, especially in relation to the collection and retention of data,
installation of Trojan horses on computers as well as the surveillance of
public access to the Internet.

CNIL considered that such instruments should be installed and used by
"guaranteeing the proportionality of the surveillance measure with the
targeted objectives" and warned on problems that might be caused to
professional users dealing with sensitive data such as lawyers, politicians,
medical staff, or journalists.

The opinion also stated that the legislator was the one who had to
"provide conciliation between, on the one hand, preventing disturbances to
the public order and finding infringers, both necessary for the preservation
of the rights and constitutional principles and, on the other hand, the
exercising of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms amongst which there are
the freedom to come and go and the respect of private life, protected by
articles 2 and 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of
1789, as well as the individual freedom, that article 66 of the Constitution
places under surveillance of the legal authority."

In the meantime, the digital rights campaigners continue to fight laws such
as LOPPSI or Hadopi. Thus, ODEBI league, an Internet users association,
launched on 20 July a "numerical army" meant to fight the lack of
information or disinformation in the presentation of projects with a final
objective to protect the rights of Internet users.

8. Russian copyright law will apply to news reports
============================================================

A new modification in the Russian copyright legislation was drafted by the
Government in order to extend the protection to news reports.

The new draft was pushed by the biggest Russian news agencies which were
claiming that other regional and online publications are plagiarizing their
news reports. The law could be submitted to the Russian Parliament in the
fall.

The draft presented by the Communications and Press Deputy Minister
Alexander Zharov foresees fines from 10 to 20 000 rubles (approx. 230-460
euros), but also the confiscation of the production as sanctions for
plagiarism for an agency. The plagiating reporter of the agency could also
be fined with 1 - 5 000 rubles (23 - 115 euros). The present draft is still
unclear on how the fines will be applied and under what specific
circumstances the confiscation will be enforced, thus causing critics to say
that the new law could be used to shut up the unwanted voices.

Andrei Richter, head of Moscow's Media Law and Policy Institute, considered
the law a step forward and commented: "Currently, news agencies have to go
to court and prove that they have suffered financial losses because of the
plagiarism."

But other news editors, such as Moscow Post editor Alexei Kozlov were not
too happy. He called the bill "an opportunity to punish a rival media
outlet."

As a consequence of the financial crisis, the European newspapers and
magazine publishers are also trying to lobby for tougher copyright laws. A
public call to the European Commission in this respect was signed at a
meeting on 26 June in Berlin, convened by the European Publishers' Council
and the World Association of Newspapers. The letter was based on a German
initiative called the "Hamburg Declaration' adopted by 149 German
publishers earlier that month.

The letter stated that: "Numerous providers are using the work of authors,
publishers and broadcasters without paying for it. Over the long term, this
threatens the production of high-quality content and the existence of
independent journalism. For this reason, we advocate strongly urgent
improvements in the protection of intellectual property on the Internet."

The new call is also trying to have the Automated Content Access Protocol
(ACAP), pushed by the publishers industry as the perfect solution to avoid
copying news, imposed by law

ACAP is a meta data standard that aims at specifing how online aggregators
(including search engines) handle a publisher's work by defining usage by
third parties rights.
