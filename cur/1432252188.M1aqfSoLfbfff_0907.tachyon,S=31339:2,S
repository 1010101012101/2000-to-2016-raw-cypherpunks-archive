          While we generally bring you profiles of undiscovered
          stocks, we also want to provide follow up on
          companies we have profiled in the past.
          VirtualSellers.com Inc. (OTCBB: VDOT) is one such
          company.  VDOT issued some very interesting news
          today about the release of a new version (v5) of its
          TAME(tm) software.

          The release states that TAME V is an alternative to
          the popular Java programming language and that it
          saves significant programming time -- which equates
          to direct cost savings to Web developers, network
          programmers and software developers.  This is a
          powerful, yet simple-to-use programming tool that
          automates and streamlines some very complicated
          tasks.

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

          VIRTUALSELLERS.COM RELEASES AN ALTERNATIVE TO JAVA
              -Virtualsellers’ Releases Version Five Of Its
               Proprietary TAME™ Pure Scripting Language -

          CHICAGO, Ill., March 21, 2001 – VirtualSellers.com,
          Inc. (OTC BB: VDOT), a developer and provider of
          software and technology used to automate and
          streamline Web and e-commerce applications, announced
          today that it has completed development of version
          five of its TAME software.  “TAME V” is now available
          for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Web developers
          and networking programmers.

          The new version of TAME™, is a faster, easier, and
          more powerful version than its predecessors. This
          high performance, platform independent, server-side
          programming package is used to produce Web pages,
          Web-based applications, and e-commerce applications.
          It serves as the “glue” between many Web-based
          platforms, languages and legacy systems including XML
          and XSL applications, and in the future, Microsoft’s
          .NET.

          As a leader in platform independence, TAME V can be
          deployed on Linux, UNIX, or Windows NT. Its distinct
          advantage lies in reducing the complexity of
          accessing application programming interfaces (APIs),
          ODBC and most other files systems.  “TAME is the most
          productive Web development tool on the market,” said
          Dennis Sinclair, PhD., president and CEO of
          VirtualSellers. “TAME’s simplified language and the
          ability to use previously developed code makes
          transition seamless and requires minimal training.”

          TAME V simplifies how systems and software work
          together and requires 25 percent less code than Java
          Script.  The smaller code package reduces the amount
          of space required for files to move through a
          network, reducing bandwidth usage.  Programming in
          TAME is consistent, requiring less programming time
          and a lower level programming skill set resulting in
          lower labor rates.

          Its interfaces can eliminate bugs, errors, and other
          programming flaws. At the core of the system is a
          concise, proprietary engine that provides the
          language interpreter and basic functionality. “That
          means less overhead and a smaller memory footprint,”
          said Sinclair. “TAME only employs what is required in
          an application, instead of redundant and unnecessary
          tools. The result is an efficient, but flexible
          software that makes loading easy, development fast
          and cost savings routine.”

          With these new enhancements on TAME V, lesser-skilled
          programmers can produce results immediately. If a
          unique or complex problem arises, an average C
          programmer can be brought in to identify and solve
          the problem. The solution can then be given to the
          script coders for manipulation.  TAME software also
          provides additional core functionality that is easily
          inserted into the language, allowing script
          programmers to tackle the application scripting and
          continue with the creative process to make the
          application attractive to the end user.

          The Installation of TAME is very simple, utilizing
          fully automated standard installation software that
          is familiar to most Web-servers allowing for quick
          installation and configuration of the product. Once
          installed, no further action is required, except,
          perhaps, when adding any optional application
          modules.

          TAME is based on objects and is extensible, so new
          objects or functions may be created in C or C++ and
          will result as an extension of the Web-server as
          dynamic libraries. This gives the TAME software
          unlimited flexibility and control. For the most part,
          the developers may replace or add objects, file
          routines, database access, or any other functions as
          they see fit, thus avoiding interface problems that
          invariably arise with other less flexible scripting
          languages. And any code developed as business rules,
          are now reusable among many applications, providing a
          greater and quicker return on investment.

          TAME has the ability to converse with multiple
          databases on any platform, using ODBC connectivity.
          This eliminates the need for custom connections with
          custom software specific to those connections. And
          moving to another platform becomes a non-issue.

          The new features of TAME V include:

          · Universal concepts found on APL, C++, Java and
          other scripting languages.
          · “Flextype” Variables that are non-declarative, yet
          strongly typed.
          · Syntax checking.
          · Generalized arrays (arrays of arrays) have been
          implemented.
          · Session management allows for persistence of
          objects, variables, and page connections.
          · A configuration file allows for multiple instance
          control of applications.
          · A configuration file allows for specific control of
          loading only the required object modules.
          · Script library files that are loaded and parsed
          only once.
          · Script library files that reside in memory for
          faster access.
          · Support for XML and XSL for processing data and
          connectivity to other XML systems.

          VirtualSellers.com has two synergistic business units
          that develop solutions for its client base.  As a

are now reusable among many applications, providing a greater and quicker
return on investment.
<p>TAME has the ability to converse with multiple databases on any platform,
using ODBC connectivity. This eliminates the need for custom connections
with custom software specific to those connections. And moving to another
platform becomes a non-issue.
<p><b>The new features of TAME V include:</b>
<p>&middot; Universal concepts found on APL, C++, Java and other scripting
languages.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; “Flextype” Variables that are non-declarative, yet strongly
typed.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; Syntax checking.
<br>&middot; Generalized arrays (arrays of arrays) have been implemented.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; Session management allows for persistence of objects, variables,
and page connections.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; A configuration file allows for multiple instance control
of applications.
<br>&middot; A configuration file allows for specific control of loading
only the required object modules.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; Script library files that are loaded and parsed only once.
<br>&middot; Script library files that reside in memory for faster access.&nbsp;
<br>&middot; Support for XML and XSL for processing data and connectivity
to other XML systems.
