There is no defense of such patents. You are correct that patents are 
intended to encourage disclosure and yet protect inventors for some 
limited period.

(Not all of us even support patents. Namely, ideas are just ideas. 
Making it illegal for some to use ideas, which they may well have 
thought of on their own, is thought control.  In a crypto anarchic 
society, patents will mostly be moot.)

Granting patents to work done in the 1930s is bizarre.
