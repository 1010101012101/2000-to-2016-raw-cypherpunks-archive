>  CONTACT: Mike Bodine (518) 656-3578
>  DOJ and the U.S. Congress Officially Commit to Send IRS Tax and  Legal
> Experts to Appear on Capitol Hill. Public Hearing to be Conducted 
> by Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and Rep. Henry Hyde to Answer Citizens' Challenges 
> of IRS Jurisdiction and Illegal Enforcement of U.S. Tax Law.
> < Washington D.C. -- We The People Foundation For Constitutional  Education,
> Inc. announce that the Department of Justice and the U.S. Congress 
> have committed, in writing, to appear with IRS representatives in a 
> recorded, public meeting to officially answer to charges challenging the 
> legal jurisdiction of the IRS and the enforcement of U.S. income tax 
> laws against U.S. citizens.
>  Department of Justice U.S. Assistant Attorney General Dan Bryant 
> and Congressmen Roscoe Bartlett (MD) signed the written agreement 
> Friday that commits the government to send their top tax and legal experts to 
> a two-day September hearing to be conducted on Capitol Hill. These actions 
> are in response to a proper petition for redress of grievances brought by 
> Robert Schulz, Chairman of the Foundation. Schulz ended his 3-week hunger 
> fast mid-afternoon today after having secured official commitment from
> representatives of the U.S. Government that his formal petition 
> will be answered.
> Schulz has been in Washington since July 4th on a hunger fast 
> until death, if needed, to force the government to respond to his legal 
> Remonstrance, a petition for redress of grievances. These grievances include 
> challenges of IRS jurisdiction, routine and gross violations of due process by 
> the IRS, the refusal of the IRS to cite the specific law that requires 
> employers or employees to withhold taxes and the fraudulent ratification of the 
> 16th (Income Tax) Amendment.
>  DOJ's Bryant is quoted, "The American people are entitled to 
> answers. It is in our nation's interest that we participate and answer these 
> questions."
> While largely ignored by the media and other government 
> officials, Rep.
> Bartlett has stood alone on the Hill (until recently) in public 
> defense of Schulz's absolute Constitutional Right to petition for redress and 
> be answered by the government. On Tuesday, Bartlett initiated a 
> formal Congressional Inquiry to the IRS demanding official government 
> responses for Schulz.
>  Today, DOJ's Dan Bryant agreed to Rep. Bartlett's requirements 
> that the "congressional briefing-like hearings" be conducted in public and 
> be recorded and broadcast live. The meetings will have appropriate 
> procedural controls and security. It is expected Rep. Henry Hyde (IL), former 
> Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee will gavel the sessions.
>  Schulz was "elated that government officials have finally 
> responded as they are required by both the 1st Amendment to the Constitution 
> and their oaths of office."
> The agreement, penned on Congressional letterhead, was signed at 
> the Department of Justice headquarters. Bryant assured both Rep. 
> Bartlett and Schulz there is "virtually no chance of being overridden on this 
> matter." Bartlett promised Schulz, "I assure you. The IRS will be there at 
> those meetings."
>  Schulz continued, "I have met with these gentlemen face-to-face 
> and have looked in their eyes. I am satisfied they are men of honor. We 
> have cemented our agreement with a handshake. The fast ends today.
> After decades of obfuscation, avoidance, creative restructuring 
> and 'simplification' of the 9,500-page tax code, the truth is about to 
> be revealed. The Sovereign Citizens have exercised their Right to 
> petition. It is no coincidence that President Bush revealed in this week's 
> New York Times that the government has begun to publicly discuss 
> alternative tax systems, including disposal of the entire tax code. The internet 
> and talk radio have facilitated detailed research, documentation and 
> discussion of these charges across the nation.
> If our income tax system is publicly confirmed to be without 
> force of law upon the People, and is truly as 'voluntary' as the IRS so often 
> advertises, it is highly likely that the government may move quickly to 
> implement a replacement tax such as a national sales tax. The People must 
> remain vigilant that one illegal tax is not replaced by another.
> The taxing powers granted to the federal government by our 
> Constitution are explicit, limited and must be complied with. Since 1787, the 
> mechanism for an orderly and peaceful transition to a legal tax system has 
> resided in Article 1 Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. This is a states' 
> Rights issue. The day that our government has shunned has arrived. The 
> Sovereign Citizens have formally demanded and exercised their Rights. We The People 
> have been heard."
