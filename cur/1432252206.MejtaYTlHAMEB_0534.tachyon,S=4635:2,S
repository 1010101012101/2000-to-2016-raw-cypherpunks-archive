All non-windows OS's are less likely targets due to a lower market share.
Linux has complete rights management, although using it properly is the
user's (or his/her root's) responsibility. Mac has a good reputation but I'm
not an expert on it.

What's even better is chrome/chromium OS. Don't install anything, browser
only. No place to install spyware.
