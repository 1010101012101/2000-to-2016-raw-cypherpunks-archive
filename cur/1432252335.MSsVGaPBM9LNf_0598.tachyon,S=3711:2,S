This kind of scheme falls apart as soon as even a few people _don't_ put 
up the separate boxes. Or tell the company they have them, but then take 
them down.

Because the billing company, or any other deliverer of mail, is swamped 
by keeping track of who has special boxes, who needs their bills mailed, 
etc.

Anyone can build and mark a box with "W.A.S.T.E." or some other label.

Calling it "Unites States Mail" is where the sticky issues come in.
