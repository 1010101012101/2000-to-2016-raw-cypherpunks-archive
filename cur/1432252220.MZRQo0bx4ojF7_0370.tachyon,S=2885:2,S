The only thing close that I've seen is Bestcrypt, which is commercial
and has a Linux and Windows port.  I don't recall if the Linux port
came with source or not.  I had problems with the init script hanging
the boot process, or at least delaying it significantly, so I
uninstalled it until I could devote the time to analyze what was going
on.  Right after installation I tried using it to read a container
copied from a corrupted Windows machine, but was not successful.  It
is unclear to me if this was due to the corruption which occured, or
some kind of incompatibility between the Windows and Linux ports.
