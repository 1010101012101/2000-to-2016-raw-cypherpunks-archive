Gosh - doesn't anyone like the United States anymore?  Give the fuckers
$3 billion a year in aid, and they elect a war criminal as their Prime

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The chairman of the militant Jewish Defense League and
a follower have been arrested on suspicion of plotting to blow up a Los
Angeles mosque and the office of an Arab-American congressman, federal
authorities said today. Irv Rubin, 56, and a member of the group, Earl
Krugel, 59, both of Los Angeles, were arrested last night after the last
component of the bomb -- explosive powder -- was delivered to Krugel's
home, U.S. Attorney John S. Gordon said. Authorities said the two planned
to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and the office of freshman
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
