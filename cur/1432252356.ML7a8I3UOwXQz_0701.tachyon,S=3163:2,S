While he certainly could have been being humorous, I can't see why he
would have indicated 'yes' for any reason. I mean, he could have made a
funny comment or something sarcastic or any number of other responses.
The shaking his head yes while saying now would seem to indicate that
he's been told not to say that he's been asked.

It would seem logical that he would have been approached though. I mean,
they want total tech coverage. Why would Linux escape their attention?
