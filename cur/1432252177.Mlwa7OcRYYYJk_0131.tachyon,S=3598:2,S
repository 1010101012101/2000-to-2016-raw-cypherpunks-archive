"...Noam Chomsky, a remarkable US political thinker. He demands radical 
changes in US foreign policy or the country will face a "revolution from 
within." He has advised successive US governments since the Carter 
administration of the need to change the colonialist and supercilious 
approach to the rest of the world.

"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can 
change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead
