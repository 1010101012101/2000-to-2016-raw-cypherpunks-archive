Since there are so many ways to protect the contents of the message the
freon topic is not all that interesting. It would be mildly amusing if
there were a way to detect that freon had been used on a piece of paper.
I would guess that it could be done by either finding an "ink" that was
dissolved by freon or some other material that would sit happily in
place until lifted and dispersed.

useful here

interesting

Freon seems to be ( or have been ) used mostly for degreasing. Could you
make some sort of nondrying oil-based marker that would blur or weaken
when drenched with freon? Probably. Buy some raw artist's pigment and
mill it with a non-drying grease that is too thick to migrate
appreciably over the time period of interest when applied to paper.
Wetting with solvent would probably cause damage to a mark.

Sounds like a good explanation.
