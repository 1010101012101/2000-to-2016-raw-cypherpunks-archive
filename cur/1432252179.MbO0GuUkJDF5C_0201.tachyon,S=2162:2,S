Just assume braindeath and it becomes obvious.

No tla with any dignity left would bother e-mail providers or try to get your
password. All it need to do is fill gforms and get access to tapped traffic at
major nodes (say, 20 in US is sufficient?). Think packet reassembly -> filter
down -> store everything forever -> google on demand.

Concerned about e-mail privacy? There is this obscure software called 'PGP',
check it out. Too complicated? That's the good thing about evolution, not
everyone makes it.
