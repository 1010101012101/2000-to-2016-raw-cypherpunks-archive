Cryptome offers 2 court orders and 22 formerly sealed documents 
in the case of Abdallah Higazy, an Egyptian national in the US to 
attend school, who was detained as a material witness based 
on a false accusation by a hotel guard of possessing an air-to-ground 
communcation device while staying in a hotel across from the World 
Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Higazy was also allegedly 
coerced by an FBI agent during a polygraph examination to admit 
possessing the device, and an investigation of this coercion is 
underway.

The documents were unsealed on August 14, 2002 in response to a 
request by reporter Ben Weiser of the New York Times.

Related news reports in the New York Times, August 16, 2002, and the 
Village Voice, August 28, 2002 provide some of the information redacted. 
The Voice writes:

  It was dumb luck, not good police work, that freed Higazy. But the two 
  FBI agents named in papers making the botched case against him are 
  likely still investigating the September 11 attacks. The FBI's New York 
  office would not comment on personnel questions, but a knowledgeable 
  law enforcement source says neither of the agents -- Christopher Bruno 
  and Vince Sullivan -- was ever disciplined or retrained.
