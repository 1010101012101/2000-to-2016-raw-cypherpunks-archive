I'm afraid, unfortunately, that the head start we got by jumping on thi=
s=20
Internet thingy early on and figuring shit out is slowly running out. T=
he NSA=20
and the rest of Five Eyes figured this shit out now, too -- along with =
"oh=20
wait, there was no privacy-by-design anywhere? that's cute".

And they have a much, much bigger budget.

Between that, and the populace being herded by "EHRMAHGEHRD TEHRRISTS!"=
 on one=20
hand and "privacy is gone, baby" on the other, we are not winning this =
one=20
right now.

That's why "hackers", "hacktivists" and "Anonymous" are used as synonym=
s of=20
"terrorists" by the powers that are. And the media.
