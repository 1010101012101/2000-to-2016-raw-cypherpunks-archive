I thought I'd fill in the details for any of the skeptics:

In the anthrax story:


"LANTANA, Fla. (AP) - Health officials have begun tracing the steps of a 
Florida man to pinpoint how he became the first person in the United 
States in a quarter-century to contract an inhaled form of anthrax, a 
disease with a much higher profile since the terrorist attacks. "

And here's the connection to the flight schools and where Atta and his 
partners rented apartments:

"U.S. agents followed Atta's trail from flight training in Venice on the 
west coast to an apartment in Coral Springs to another in Hollywood to 
Lantana, a town on the state's east coast..."


Yeah, mere coincidence that the first reported case of inhalational 
anthrax in 25 years happened at this time, and in the same small town 
where several of the WTC attackers were living and training. (And that 
Atta was one of those trying to rent a crop-dusting plane.)

It would be paranoid to speculate that the strain is India-1967, the 
virulent form of inhalational anthrax developed by Biopreparat/Vector 
and weaponized and tested at Voz. Island in Kazahkstan, north of 
Afghanistan.

When U.S inspectors finally got to the Stepnogorsk facility, weeds were 
growing in the paths between buildings, the doors were flapping in the 
wind, and the stockpiles of smallpox, anthrax, Marburg, tularemia, and 
pneumonic plague had presumably already been sold to the highest bidders.

Have a nice day!

By the way, with reference to the quote from the enemy of liberty below, 
it is tempting for those who have not thought about the issues deeply to 
opine that the horrors of biological terrorism mean that even _more_ 
civil liberties must be sacrificed (no doubt "Reason" is already 
preparing a "germs are scary!" piece to explain why there are no 
libertarians in biohazard suits).

Bear in mind it was GOVERNMENTS who spend billions of dollars and rubles 
finding ways to kill certain ethnic groups with biological vectors, ways 
to gas cities of millions, and ways to create superbugs uncontrollable 
by vaccines. (The U.S. government fears the Sovs devoloped variants of 
smallpox using recombinant DNA techniques that will not be controllable 
by vaccines.)

I speed-read Tucker's "Scourge" several days ago, and yesterday I sat 
down at my local Borders and speed-read the new Judith Miller, William 
Broad, etc. book "Germs." (When I "speed-read" I read for the important 
parts; I can usually absorb a book like this in an hour or so. I would 
read the book at my leisure, but I hate paying $30 for a book I can skim 
and get the gist of.)

Nothing we didn't already know, except some stuff that goes beyond Ken 
Alibek's "Biohazard." Especially about the weapons plants in Uzbekistan, 
Kazakhstan, and other places very close to Afghanistan! I'd thought from 
Alibek's book that most of the Biopreparat facilities were in Sverdlovsk 
and other places in Siberia. (Not that shipping a flask of India-1967 or 
anthrax another 2000 miles is difficult.)

Like I said, "Have a nice day."

Quote of the Month: "It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; 
perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks."
