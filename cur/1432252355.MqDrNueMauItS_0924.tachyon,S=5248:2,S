OK, I'll bite.  How did the Omaha World Herald on October 1, quote the
Washington Report from October 3, in response to a reader question
of October 27?

Also, he doesn't debunk the quote.  He just expresses his opinion that no
Israeli leader could be so stupid, and continues merrily on to say that
one magazine that reported the remark is "influenced" by Arabs.

If it appeared in a bylined article in a mainstream American newspaper,
and everyone involved has not been fired, and no retraction has been
issued, many months later, I would tend to believe that the authenticity
of the quote is not in question.

I'll pass on the 1,000:1 compression software, but I'm pretty sure about
the quote.  Anyone in Israel care to confirm or deny?
