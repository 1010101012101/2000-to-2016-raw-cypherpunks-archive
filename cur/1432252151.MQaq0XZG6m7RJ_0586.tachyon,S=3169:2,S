       True, except that it's not a good idea in most cities and towns to walk
around carrying a rifle. Or, maybe it is a *good* idea, but some people don't
like it. And then you're much more likely to have to use it when you really
didn't want to.
       Trust me, carry a pistol -- concealed --- everything will go much
better. And trying to carry something like a Desert Eagle concealed, in the
Summer wearing shorts and tanktop ain't easy. Life is full of conflicts like
this. Should I, or shouldn't I?
