>the New York Times that thousands had also gathered in San Francisco.

>Perhaps if it had turned violent... But probably not. As I said in my last

>The puzzling question to me is, why are the media going along with George 
>II on this. What the hell is in it for them?
>
>I mean, we know that the war sells papers. William Randolph Hearst, a 
>pioneer in this regard, told his photographer in Cuba - where the

>Spanish-American War - "You get the pictures. I'll get the war."

>I've been on the road with Mountain Girl Garcia. We have been staying at 
>her daughter Trixie's Julia Morgan house in Oakland and decided to take 
>BART across the Bay rather than experience the agony of looking for a 
>parking place in a city that doesn't have parking places even when nothing 
>unusual is going on in town.  When we got to the north Oakland BART 
>station around 11:00, there was already a line for the ticket machines 
>that snaked half an hour out into the parking lot. The train, when we 
>finally got on it, was breathing room only. There was a line to get out of 
>the station at the Embarcadero.

>I'm not keen on being in line, but these experiences were not at all 
>unpleasant. There was a lovely energy among the protesters, who seemed to 
>be of all social sorts. It was not just the usual suspects. There were 
>children, old people, men in suits, as well as people who will never wear 
>a suit. A lot of tweedy academic types. Not so many with darker skins, I 
>regret to say, but some. The only truly common element seemed to be a 
>pleasant civilization.
>
>And there were one hell of a lot of us.
>
>When we finally got up to Market Street around noon, the march had already 
>launched toward the Civic Center. Market was dense with humanity as far as 
>I could see in that direction. We counted several different cross-sections 
>of the moving populace, and the parade seemed to be about 20 people 
>across. Assuming that each phalanx of 20 moved though per second, this 
>would be about 72,000 people per hour. The march continued unabated for at 
>least 2 and a half hours. If our calculations are even a little accurate, 
>this would be over a hundred fifty thousand people who had gathered to 
>protest a war that has barely begun.
>
>I remember the first anti-war protest I ever attended. It was in the fall 
>of 1965 and it took place on Boston Commons. I'd be surprised if there 
>were more than a hundred people there, though they included, as I recall, 
>Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky. It was not until after Kent State, five 
>years later, that I saw anything like the assembly of protestors I 
>witnessed yesterday.
>
>Furthermore, on that occasion, in May of '70, it seemed that just about 
>everyone filling the Mall in DC looked pretty much like me. We were not 
>The People. Not to say that scruffy, dope-smoking kids weren't well 
>represented in yesterday's march. But they were certainly not the 
>majority, even if you counted the scruffy, dope-smoking seniors like me. 
>Mostly the marchers seemed like Just Plain Folks.
>
>There were some great signs. Like "Impeach the Uber-Goober." Or "No 
>Weapons of Mass Distraction." Or "If Tim McVeigh caused 911, would we bomb 
>Michigan?" Or "Chez Panisse for Peace." Or "Stop The Bushit!" Or "Stay 
>Glued to the TV, You Hysterical, Brainwashed Fool!" One showed a concerned 
>looking whale with a thought balloon that said, "Save the Humans."
>
>It seems important to me that this many Just Plain Folks could come to 
>together on such short notice. It seems important that so many could 
>gather in indignation without any violent or rude behavior. It seems 
>important  to me.
>
>But it's not important to the media. Why?
