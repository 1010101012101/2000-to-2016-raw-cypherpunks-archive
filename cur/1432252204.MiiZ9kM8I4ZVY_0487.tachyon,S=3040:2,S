Except, apparently, in Iraqi Kurdistan:

Wherein Ryan Lackey's boss has left Baghdad for a nice hotel upstate...

:-)

Ryan, apparently remains downtown where all the fun is...

<http://www.livejournal.com/users/giantlaser/59447.html>

page down to see Ryan in all his former dry-suited Sealand glory...

I recommend Tyler <http://www.livejournal.com/users/giantlaser/> and
Jayme's <http://www.livejournal.com/users/slownewsday/> Iraq Livejournal
blogs as a wonderful example of inadvertant anarchocapitalism in action.

Inadvertent, because, of course, they *really* wanna be statists, liberal
ones in fact, in spite of evidence all around them to the contrary.

I still think they're heroes. Hell, as far as I'm concerned, *Ryan's* a
hero at this point.

Nick Berg lives.

Cheers,
RAH
