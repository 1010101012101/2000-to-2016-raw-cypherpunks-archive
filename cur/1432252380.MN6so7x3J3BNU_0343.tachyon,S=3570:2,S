Of course, this is the way the US government loves to operate.  Convict
people on bullshit, get them "in the system," and then impose conditions
of probation which prohibit them from exposing what was done to them.

Both the Jim Bell and Carl Johnson trials were examples of this method in
action.

We'll see a lot more of such antics in the "terrorism" trials of the many
current detainees.  They will be convicted of bullshit, like transposing
two digits of their social security numbers, or failing to report they
were unemployed on a savings account application.  They won't be able to
defend themselves on terrorism charges, because they won't be on trial for
it.

Then, in the sentencing phase, the government will get to say anything it
likes about the person being a terrorist, with no opposing point of view
able to be presented, and the 30 year sentences will be rolled out.

It's the new AmeriKKKa, where everyone is guilty of something.
