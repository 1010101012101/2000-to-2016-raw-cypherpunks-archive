   [1]Snap E Tom writes "According to a Washington Post poll, a majority
   (63%) of Americans 'said they found the NSA program to be [2]an
   acceptable way to investigate terrorism.' A slightly higher majority
   would not be bothered if the NSA collected personal calls that they
   made. Even though the program has received bi-partisan criticism from
   Congress, it appears that the public values security over privacy."
