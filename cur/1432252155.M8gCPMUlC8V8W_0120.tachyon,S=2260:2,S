Accuris - Company History

Accuris is a specialist provider of lawful interception solutions in the communications field. 



Based in Dublin, Ireland - the software capital of Europe - Accuris continues to lead the market in its niche field. 

Established in 1997 as a product provider in the telecommunications arena, Accuris grew rapidly as a result of the input from its founders - KPN, Eircom and Telia. 


In 2002 the company was purchased by a group of investors and charged with becoming the European leader in Lawful Interception, as well as extending its expertise in other areas of the telecommunications sector. 

Accuris has a core specialist workforce that provides the full range of services from initial consultancy through development and ongoing customer support.
