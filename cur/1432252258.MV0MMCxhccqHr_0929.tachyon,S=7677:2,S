Subject: [johnmacsgroup] Thompson: Kingdom of Fear - 2003

----snip--snip--snip----
>From "Kingdom Of Fear " 2003
By Hunter S. Thompson

Let's face it, the yo-yo president of the U.S.A. knows nothing. He is a
dunce. He does what he is told to do, says what he is told to say, poses
the way he is told to pose. He is a fool.

No. Nonsense. The president cannot be a Fool. Not at this moment in
time, when the last living vestiges of the American Dream are on the
line. This is not the time to have a bogus rich kid in charge of the
White House.

Which is, after all, our house. That is our headquarters, it is where
the heart of America lives. So if the president lies and acts giddy
about other people's lives, if he wantonly and stupidly endorses mass
murder by definition, a loud and meaningless animal with no functional
intelligence and no balls.

To say this goofy child president is looking more and more like Richard
Nixon in the summer of 1974 would be a flagrant insult to Nixon.

Whoops! Did I say that? Is it even vaguely possible that some New Age
Republican whore-beast of a false president could actually make Richard
Nixon look like a Liberal?

The capacity of these vicious assholes we elected to be in charge of our
lives for four years to commit terminal damage to our lives and our
souls and our loved ones is far beyond Nixon's. Shit! Nixon was the
creator of many of the once-proud historical landmarks that these dumb
bastards are savagely destroying now: the Clean Air Act of 1970;
Campaign Finance Reform; the endangered species act; a Real-Politik
dialogue with China; and on and on.

The prevailing quality of life in America-by any accepted methods of
measuring-was inarguably freer and more politically open under Nixon
than it is today in this evil year of our Lord 2002.

The Boss was a certified monster who deserved to be impeached and
banished. He was a truthless creature of former FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover, a foul human monument to corruption and depravity on a scale
that dwarfs any other public official in American history. But Nixon was
at least smart enough to understand why so many honorable patriotic U.S.
citizens despised him. He was a Liar. The truth was not in him.

Nixon believed, as he said many times, that if the president of the
United States does it, it can't be illegal. But Nixon never understood
the much higher and meaner truth of Bob Dylan's warning that "To live
outside the law you must be honest."

The difference between an outlaw and a war criminal is the difference
between a pedophile and a Pederast: The pedophile is a person who thinks
about sexual behavior with children, and the Pederast does these things.
He lays hands on innocent children, he penetrates them and changes their
lives forever.

Being the object of a pedophile's warped affections is a Routine feature
of growing up in America, and being a victim of a Pederast's crazed
"love" is part of dying. Innocence is no longer an option. Once
penetrated, the child becomes a Queer in his own mind, and that is not
much different than murder.

Richard Nixon crossed the line when he began murdering foreigners in the
name of "family values"- and George Bush crossed it when he sneaked into
office and began killing brown skinned children in the name of Jesus and
the American people.

When Muhammad Ali declined to be drafted and forced to kill "gooks" in
Vietnam he said, "I ain't got nothin' against them Viet Cong. No Cong
ever called me Nigger."  I agreed with him, according to my own personal
ethics and values. He was right.

If we all had a dash of Muhammad Ali's eloquent courage, this country
and the world would be a better place today because of it. Okay. That's
it for now. Read it and weep....See you tomorrow, folks. You haven't
heard the last of me. I am the one who speaks for the spitit of freedom
and decency in you. 

Shit. Somebody has to do it.

We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world-a nation of
bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are
not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear
in our hearts. We are human scum, and that is how history will judge
us... No redeeming social value. Just whores. Get out of our way, or
we'll kill you. 

Well, shit on that dumbness. George W. Bush does not speak for me or my
son or my mother or my friends or the people I respect in this world. We
didn't vote for these cheap, greedy little killers who speak for America
today- and we will not vote for them again in 2002. Or 2004. Or ever.

Who does vote for these dishonest shitheads? Who among us can be happy
and proud of having all this innocent blood on our hands? Who are these
swine?

These flag-sucking half-wits who get fleeced and fooled by stupid little
rich kids like George Bush? They are the same ones who wanted to have
Muhammad Ali locked up for refusing to kill "gooks". They speak for all
that is cruel and stupid and vicious in the American character. They are
racists and hate mongers among us-they are the Ku Klux Klan. I piss down
the throats of these Nazis. And I am too old to worry about whether they
like it or not. 

Fuck them.
