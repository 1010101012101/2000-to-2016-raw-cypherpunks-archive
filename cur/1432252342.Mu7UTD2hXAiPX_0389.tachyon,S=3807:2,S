Curiously, US law enforcement feels it already has the general laws it
needs. Yet it needs the talent base to use them, aka: SS is hiring.

The US is behind in its guidance to business... US companies
large and small very much want to play and lead just as soon as a
compliance/certification framework appears in which they can safely
build a business. Unofficial regulatory 'guidelines' and failure to issue
business accounts/licenses due to that are not helping. Predicted that
virtual currencies will be regulated, tax reported, etc at the exchange
level as usual. US financial/consumer markets will evolve normally as
with any fiat currency. Was felt US needed to be on par with and peer
internationally for global regulation.

The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse, Tor, etc were all in effect, yet
business and finance seemed to be the leaning and balancing interest
of the hearing.

A couple statements regarding "anonymity can be catastrophic", anonymity
regulation, etc were made that were left open without further comment.

Al Gore created Bitcoin.

Bitcoin markets continued their rise after the hearing.

Add/Correct/Discuss.
