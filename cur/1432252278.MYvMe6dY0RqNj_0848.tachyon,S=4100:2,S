I looked, and I can't find the mail we exchanged, though I do remember
exchanging mail at the time.  Spell out what it is that you think we've
agreed to, and I'll report back with how well I intend to comply, and you
can decide what you want to put on your homepage.

Or not, as you wish.

If it helps, my thoughts on how things should work are in pretty close
alignment with Eric's, and my node is now running his code.  (Eric has
done a nice job of making Majordomo pass only messages from subscribers
to one of the CDRs, plus known remailers.  His work also makes it easy to
scan a bunch of messages looking for mail that didn't make it and add
the message and the user to the node.  The list is substantially more
readable as a result, as many others have remarked.)
