Um, you should review the 60's groups like the SDS and such. And while
Ghandi certainly didn't believe in violence the same can't be said for the
rest of the Indian freedom movement (not all hailed to Ghandi). As to
women sufferage, you need to do some more research there as well, not all
women are pascifist. they burned more than bra's...

You paint with too broad a brush (typical of the indoctrinating education
of the day - going all the way back to when I was a kid in the 60's).

Every ilk assassinates every other ilk if given the oportunity and the
personality.

The Indians are a free country. You and blacks can vote.

The reality is, your example of the 'troops in the street willing to gun
'em down' (a paraphrase) is apt. The only thing stopping them is knowing
that the majority of people don't believe it. They still believe in the
'kindly policeman who's there to help you' of their youth. Want to see the
other side? Kent State.

Yeah, you need to study history more.

No shit? That is true of everything!!!!

You're trying to sit on the fence and at the same time stand on both
sides.
