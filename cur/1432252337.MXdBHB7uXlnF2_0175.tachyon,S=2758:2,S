Anarchy was featured in an old 'High Times' issue,the one with jimmy carter 
snorting coke on the cover.
It was a pretty hacked synopsis of anarch hirstory,however it led to some 
hope that at least some synergies might spring up there.HT got banned 
and  now the 'tech tv'' are sniffing around.Laid off dot bombers whose 
yuppification nearly destroyed SF.They just asked for an interview,Im going 
to reluctantly if they stump up some sprucing up money.I dont expect much 
to come out of this but I want my latitude back.
