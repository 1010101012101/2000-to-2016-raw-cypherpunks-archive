Ms Anaya:

We respond to your June 11, 2001 letter.

You write

 RE: Morales and Payne v. Theodore C. Baca. et al.,
 Civil No. 01-634 JP/DJS

Harassment is not a federal question.

Your law firm has issued a fraudulent document to federal court stating
that harassment is a federal question.

New Mexico state court realizes this and issued Clerk's certificate on
June 12, 2001.

Your law firm harasses us.

You write

 Pursuant to D.N.M.LR-Civ. 7.4(a), the purpose of this letter is to
determine whether you
 will concur with or oppose the motions I intend to file on Monday, June
18, 2001.

 The first motion will seek the dismissal of all your claims against
Judge Baca on the basis
 of absolute judicial immunity. The second motion will seek a stay of
discovery pending the
 Court’s ruling on Judge Baca’s motion to dismiss. Please let me know
your position, in writing,
 on or before Friday, June 15, 2001.

Our position is that your firm harasses us.  Harassment is not a federal
question.

We ask that you forward a copy of this letter to  William Haas  RMD
Claim No.: 0101299-000
Date of Loss: 10-20-00 in hope that we can reach a monteary settlement
of your acts of harassment with your law firm's insurance carrier before
we are forced to file a fourth lawsuit for harassment in New Mexico
state court.

Sincerely,


Arthur R. Morales

Thank you SO MUCH for the legal advice if going to state court you gave
me by phone in pullman, washington.

It looks like it is working for Morales and me.

It doesn't look good for Svet and Vazquez.

To bad about Vazquez.
http://www.nmcourt.fed.us/dcdocs/judges/vazquez.html

She should have known better than to sign what the feds gave her.

Morales points out that Vazquez is not exactly flipping burgers for a
living.

MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR FILING ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION
REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING

1 Defendant lawyer Robert St. John writes

 Counsel for Defendant Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb, P.A., has
expressed
 an intention to participate in electronic filing of pleadings and
documents in this case.

and signs

 SUBMITTED BY:
 RODEY, DIKASON, SLOAN, AKIN & ROBB,P.A.

 Telephone: (505) 768-7337
 Facsimile: (505) 768-7395

Exhibit A.

St. John is a defendant in this case.

St. John has not filed ENTRY OF APPEARANCE in this lawsuit.

St. John's filing ORDER is more than frivolous.  It is a malicious
intentional attempt to set the stage for

possible digital document alteration.


2  Lawyer St John writes


 3. In addition to serving on all parties, the parties shall file
directly with the
 Court, any motions, briefs in support, responsive briefs, reply briefs
and exhibits relating
 to them whether filed electronically on the ACE serve or in paper form.

with "shall file directly with the Court" high-lighted in bold text.

Paragraph 3 appears to be frivolous in that St. John appears to want
something from plaintiffs by bold

high-lighting which St. John does not explicitly state.

Plaintiff's have always filed directly with the court.

Paragraph 3 is frivolous.

3   Lawyer St John writes


 5. Upon completion of the briefing process, the movant shall file with
the Court
 and serve on all parties a “Notice of Completion” specifically
identifying the pertinent
 motion ready for decision and any briefs or other documents which have
been filed relating
 to that motion.

St. John apparently writes this because of previous motion of plaintiff
Payne for filing MOTION FOR

SANCTIONS FOR FILING "NOTICE OF BRIEFING COMPLETION."

St. John attempts to overrule Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

St. John's paragraph 5 is frivolous.

4   Lawyer St John has the gall to have defendant magistrate Don F Svet
sign

 IT IS SO ORDERED.

 Dated: June ____,2001.
 UNITED STATES JUDGE

Svet does not date filing.

5 St. John and the Rodey law firm by submitting ORDER WAIVING PACKET
SUBMISSION

REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING have established  pattern
and practice of

malicious intent to subvert the federal judicial process by the
frivolous ORDER.

Moreover, harassment is NOT  a federal question as recognized by New
Mexico state court.  Exhibit B.

6 Rule 11.  Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers;
Representations to Court; Sanctions

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states

 (b) Representations to Court.

 By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or
later advocating) a  pleading, written motion, or other paper, an
attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to  the best of the
person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable  under the circumstances,--

 (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to
harass or to cause unnecessary  delay or needless increase in the cost
of litigation;

 (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are
warranted by existing law or by a
 nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law or the  establishment of new law;

 (3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary
support or, if specifically so  identified, are likely to have
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
investigation or discovery; and

 (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence
or, if specifically so  identified, are reasonably based on a lack of
information or belief.


7   Rule 11 goes on to state

 (c) Sanctions.

 If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court
determines that subdivision (b)  has been violated, the court may,
subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate  sanction
upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision
(b) or are  responsible for the violation.

 (1) How Initiated.

 (A) By Motion. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made
separately from other  motions or requests and shall describe the
specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It  shall be served
as provided in Rule 5 , but shall not be filed with or presented to the
court unless,  within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other
period as the court may prescribe), the  challenged paper, claim,
defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or
appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party
prevailing on the motion  the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.  Absent exceptional
circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for
violations  committed by its partners, associates, and employees.

 (B) On Court's Initiative. On its own initiative, the court may enter
an order describing the  specific conduct that appears to violate
subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or  party to show
cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.

 (2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations. A sanction imposed for violation
of this rule shall be limited  to what is sufficient to deter repetition
of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly
 situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the
sanction may consist of, or
 include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty
into court, or, if imposed  on motion and warranted for effective
deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of  some or all of
the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a direct
result of the  violation.

 (A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party
for a violation of  subdivision (b)(2).

 (B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative
unless the court issues its  order to show cause before a voluntary
dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against  the party
which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.

 (3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the
conduct determined to  constitute a violation of this rule and explain
the basis for the sanction imposed.

8 The best way to insure that this malicious and intentional judicial
conduct does not occur again is

for this court to levy a substantial monetary penalty again the law firm
of Rodey, Dickason, Sloan , Akin

& Robb PA for violation of Rule 11 by the filing.  And, of course, for
continue harassment of plaintiffs by

this state issue continue to be heard by THIS COURT.

9 WHEREFORE sanction Rodey, Dickason, Sloan , Akin & Robb PA $3,000,000
for having filed

ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC

FILING.

MOTION TO STRIKE ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO
FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING


1 ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO FACILITATE

ELECTRONIC FILING was written by defendant Robert St. John employed by
defendant Rodey,

Dickason, Sloan , Akin & Robb PA.  Exhibit A, page contains lawyer St.
John's signature.

St. John is a defendant in this lawsuit.  St. John has not filed ENTRY
OF APPEARANCE in this lawsuit.

St. John's filing ORDER is more than frivolous.  It is a malicious
intentional attempt to set the stage for

possible digital document alteration.

2   ORDER was signed by federal magistrate judge Don F Svet.

Svet is  defendant in New Mexico state lawsuit cv - 2000 10289 and
federal harassing lawsuit 00-1574

mv/wwd. New Mexico state lawsuit is still active jury trial matter.

Svet's signature is judicial misconduct because he is involved as
defendant in plaintiffs'  federal and state

lawsuits.

3 ORDER is docket entry 10 filed 06/08/01.  Exhibit B.

Case is reassigned from judge Bruce Black to chief judge James A Parker
on June 7, 2001, docket entry 4

filed 06/07/01.  Exhibit B.

Svet was presumably removed along with Black on June 7, the day before
he signed ORDER  on June 8.

4 Magistrate judge Don F. Svet has established, along with some in
federal court's clerk office,

a pattern and practice of  court document fraud as seen in attach,
Exhibit C,

 MOTION AND MEMORANDUM OF SUPPORT TO CORRECT DOCKET: (3) FRAUD  (WHETHER
HERETOFORE DENOMINATED INTRINSIC OR EXTRINSIC),  MISREPRESENTATION, OR
OTHER MISCONDUCT OF AN ADVERSE PARTY;

with electronic filings.  The gross and incompetent publication of two
digital file stamp documents with the

same digital file stamp but one dated December 06, 200 10:19 and the
other dated December 04, 2000

10:39 show that digital file stamping can and has been defeated.

Electronic filing in courts cannot work for the reason that digital
documents are too easy to fake, as seen

in Exhibit C.

5 The cases involving Morales and Payne are largely a result of the US
government misconduct

involving hardware and software "spiking" of computers.  Some references
on Internet are

http://orlingrabbe.com/speccoll.htm
http://jya.com/nsasuit.txt
http://www.caq.com/CAQ/caq63/caq63madsen.html
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/8327/buehlerpayne.html

The US government has the financial resources to fund such modification
of computer hardware and

software.  And has established an unfortunate track record of having
spiked computers and gotten caught.

6   WHEREFORE ORDER WAIVING PACKET SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT TO

FACILITATE ELECTRONIC FILING must be stricken from the docket as an
improperly filed document

by two defendants.

In addition, electronic filing cannot be made to work because it is too
easy for an organization with

financial resources to fake.  The  US federal government has both the
financial resources and

demonstrated history of  'spiking' computer hardware and software.

7 Harassment is not a federal question.

New Mexico state court employees are no longer fooled by fraudulent
removal of the Morales and Payne

cases to federal court.

New Mexico second judicial chief judge W John Brennan along with clerk
Bennina Armijo-Sisneros have

forwarded harassment complaint to chief justice Patricio M. Serna to
appoint a judge to preside over a

state jury trial plaintiffs Morals and Payne have paid for.  And is
guaranteed under the constitution of the

State of  New Mexico.  Exhibit D.

The act of  Morales and Payne having to file this document is therefore
another act of harassment using

the US federal court system.

Discontinue harassment.

Remand to state court this and other two state lawsuits for harassment
and replevin and harassment and

defamation.
