Do you masturbate at work?  Which female/male do you think about

those activities?

Some people want to see dead people even though that could cause
shock
to face. Believe it or not, Americans want to see Dead Terrorists*.
*insert all names of people americans* have wanted to see dead.
*not necessarily you.
- This is not justification for death. I don't believe in justice per
se.

You're trying to censor us by applying your world morals on us.
Say, make it law - be bold, please.

A big no no. Words do not kill. Only People or Guns kill People.
Posers use words. We are Posers. Why be a moral poser? Do we have to
succumb
to your political Bullshit Jay Leno Far Edge Funniness Once in a
while or can you let
us exist in this high vibration of satanic flow? Your Eden, The Earth
may not represent
us, but why recognize it if we can't see it.
