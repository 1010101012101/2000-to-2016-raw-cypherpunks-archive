     CCTV Cameras



Pervasive security cameras don't substantially reduce crime.  There are 
exceptions, of course, and that's what gets the press.  Most famously, 
CCTV cameras helped catch James Bulger's murderers in 1993.  And earlier 
this year, they helped convict Steve Wright of murdering five women in 
the Ipswich area.  But these are the well-publicized exceptions. 
Overall, CCTV cameras aren't very effective.

This fact has been demonstrated again and again: by a comprehensive 
study for the Home Office in 2005, by several studies in the US, and 
again with new data announced last month by New Scotland Yard.  They 
actually solve very few crimes, and their deterrent effect is minimal.

Conventional wisdom predicts the opposite.  But if that were true, then 
camera-happy London, with something like 500,000, would be the safest 
city on the planet.  It isn't, of course, because of technological 
limitations of cameras, organizational limitations of police and the 
adaptive abilities of criminals.

To some, it's comforting to imagine vigilant police monitoring every 
camera, but the truth is very different. Most CCTV footage is never 
looked at until well after a crime is committed. When it is examined, 
it's very common for the viewers not to identify suspects. Lighting is 
bad and images are grainy, and criminals tend not to stare helpfully at 
the lens. Cameras break far too often. The best camera systems can still 
be thwarted by sunglasses or hats.  Even when they afford quick 
identification -- think of the 2005 London transport bombers and the 
9/11 terrorists -- police are often able to identify suspects without 
the cameras. Cameras afford a false sense of security, encouraging 
laziness when we need police to be vigilant.

The solution isn't for police to watch the cameras. Unlike an officer 
walking the street, cameras only look in particular directions at 
particular locations.  Criminals know this, and can easily adapt by 
moving their crimes to someplace not watched by a camera -- and there 
will always be such places.  Additionally, while a police officer on the 
street can respond to a crime in progress, the same officer in front of 
a CCTV screen can only dispatch another officer to arrive much later. By 
their very nature, cameras result in underused and misallocated police 
resources.

Cameras aren't completely ineffective, of course. In certain 
circumstances, they're effective in reducing crime in enclosed areas 
with minimal foot traffic.  Combined with adequate lighting, they 
substantially reduce both personal attacks and auto-related crime in car 
parks. And from some perspectives, simply moving crime around is good 
enough. If a local Tesco installs cameras in its store, and a robber 
targets the store next door as a result, that's money well spent by 
Tesco. But it doesn't reduce the overall crime rate, so is a waste of 
money to the township.

But the question really isn't whether cameras reduce crime; the question 
is whether they're worth it. And given their cost (500 million pounds in 
the past 10 years), their limited effectiveness, the potential for abuse 
(spying on naked women in their own homes, sharing nude images, selling 
best-of videos, and even spying on national politicians) and their 
Orwellian effects on privacy and civil liberties, most of the time 
they're not. The funds spent on CCTV cameras would be far better spent 
on hiring experienced police officers.

We live in a unique time in our society: the cameras are everywhere, and 
we can still see them. Ten years ago, cameras were much rarer than they 
are today.  And in 10 years, they'll be so small you won't even notice 
them.  Already, companies like L-1 Security Solutions are developing 
police-state CCTV surveillance technologies like facial recognition for 
China, technology that will find their way into countries like the UK. 
The time to address appropriate limits on this technology is before the 
cameras fade from notice.

A new study claims that insiders aren't the main threat to network 
security.  The whole insiders vs. outsiders debate has always been one 
of semantics more than anything else.  If you count by attacks, there 
are a lot more outsider attacks, simply because there are orders of 
magnitude more outsider attackers.  If you count incidents, the numbers 
tend to get closer: 75% vs. 18% in this case.  And if you count damages, 
insiders generally come out on top -- mostly because they have a lot 
more detailed information and can target their attacks better.  Both 
insiders and outsiders are security risks, and you have to defend 
against them both.  Trying to rank them isn't all that useful.

     Kill Switches and Remote Control



It used to be that just the entertainment industries wanted to control 
your computers -- and televisions and iPods and everything else -- to 
ensure that you didn't violate any copyright rules. But now everyone 
else wants to get their hooks into your gear.

OnStar will soon include the ability for the police to shut off your 
engine remotely. Buses are getting the same capability, in case 
terrorists want to re-enact the movie Speed. The Pentagon wants a kill 
switch installed on airplanes, and is worried about potential enemies 
installing kill switches on their own equipment.

Microsoft is doing some of the most creative thinking along these lines, 
with something it's calling "Digital Manners Policies." According to its 
patent application, DMP-enabled devices would accept broadcast "orders" 
limiting their capabilities. Cell phones could be remotely set to 
vibrate mode in restaurants and concert halls, and be turned off on 
airplanes and in hospitals. Cameras could be prohibited from taking 
pictures in locker rooms and museums, and recording equipment could be 
disabled in theaters. Professors finally could prevent students from 
texting one another during class.

The possibilities are endless, and very dangerous. Making this work 
involves building a nearly flawless hierarchical system of authority. 
That's a difficult security problem even in its simplest form. 
Distributing that system among a variety of different devices -- 
computers, phones, PDAs, cameras, recorders -- with different firmware 
and manufacturers, is even more difficult. Not to mention delegating 
different levels of authority to various agencies, enterprises, 
industries and individuals, and then enforcing the necessary safeguards.

Once we go down this path -- giving one device authority over other 
devices -- the security problems start piling up. Who has the authority 
to limit functionality of my devices, and how do they get that 
authority? What prevents them from abusing that power? Do I get the 
ability to override their limitations? In what circumstances, and how? 
Can they override my override?

How do we prevent this from being abused? Can a burglar, for example, 
enforce a "no photography" rule and prevent security cameras from 
working? Can the police enforce the same rule to avoid another Rodney 
King incident? Do the police get "superuser" devices that cannot be 
limited, and do they get "supercontroller" devices that can limit 
anything? How do we ensure that only they get them, and what do we do 
when the devices inevitably fall into the wrong hands?

It's comparatively easy to make this work in closed specialized systems 
-- OnStar, airplane avionics, military hardware -- but much more 
difficult in open-ended systems. If you think Microsoft's vision could 
possibly be securely designed, all you have to do is look at the dismal 
effectiveness of the various copy-protection and 
digital-rights-management systems we've seen over the years. That's a 
similar capabilities-enforcement mechanism, albeit simpler than these 
more general systems.

And that's the key to understanding this system. Don't be fooled by the 
scare stories of wireless devices on airplanes and in hospitals, or 
visions of a world where no one is yammering loudly on their cell phones 
in posh restaurants. This is really about media companies wanting to 
exert their control further over your electronics. They not only want to 
prevent you from surreptitiously recording movies and concerts, they 
want your new television to enforce good "manners" on your computer, and 
not allow it to record any programs. They want your iPod to politely 
refuse to copy music to a computer other than your own. They want to 
enforce *their* legislated definition of manners: to control what you do 
and when you do it, and to charge you repeatedly for the privilege 
whenever possible.

"Digital Manners Policies" is a marketing term. Let's call this what it 
really is: Selective Device Jamming. It's not polite, it's dangerous. It 
won't make anyone more secure -- or more polite.

     LifeLock and Identity Theft



LifeLock, one of the companies that offers identity-theft protection in 
the United States, has been taking quite a beating recently. They're 
being sued by credit bureaus, competitors and lawyers in several states 
that are launching class action lawsuits. And the stories in the media 
... it's like a piranha feeding frenzy.

There are also a lot of errors and misconceptions. With its aggressive 
advertising campaign and a CEO who publishes his Social Security number 
and dares people to steal his identity -- Todd Davis, 457-55-5462 -- 
LifeLock is a company that's easy to hate. But the company's story has 
some interesting security lessons, and it's worth understanding in some 
detail.

In December 2003, as part of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions 
Act, or FACTA, credit bureaus were forced to allow you to put a fraud 
alert on their credit reports, requiring lenders to verify your identity 
before issuing a credit card in your name. This alert is temporary, and 
expires after 90 days.  Several companies have sprung up -- LifeLock, 
Debix, LoudSiren, TrustedID -- that automatically renew these alerts and 
effectively make them permanent.

This service pisses off the credit bureaus and their financial 
customers. The reason lenders don't routinely verify your identity 
before issuing you credit is that it takes time, costs money and is one 
more hurdle between you and another credit card. (Buy, buy, buy -- it's 
the American way.) So in the eyes of credit bureaus, LifeLock's 
customers are inferior goods; selling their data isn't as valuable. 
LifeLock also opts its customers out of pre-approved credit card offers, 
further making them less valuable in the eyes of  credit bureaus.

And, so began a smear campaign on the part of the credit bureaus. You 
can read their points of view in New York Times article, written by a 
reporter who didn't do much more than regurgitate their talking points. 
And the class action lawsuits have piled on, accusing LifeLock of 
deceptive business practices, fraudulent advertising and so on.  The 
biggest smear is that LifeLock didn't even protect Todd Davis, and that 
his identity was allegedly stolen.

It wasn't. Someone in Texas used Davis's SSN to get a $500 advance 
against his paycheck. It worked because the loan operation didn't check 
with any of the credit bureaus before approving the loan -- perfectly 
reasonable for an amount this small. The payday-loan operation called 
Davis to collect, and LifeLock cleared up the problem. His credit report 
remains spotless.

The Experian credit bureau's lawsuit basically claims that fraud alerts 
are only for people who have been victims of identity theft. This seems 
spurious; the text of the law states that anyone "who asserts a good 
faith suspicion that the consumer has been or is about to become a 
victim of fraud or related crime" can request a fraud alert. It seems to 
me that includes anybody who has ever received one of those notices 
about their financial details being lost or stolen, which is everybody.

As to deceptive business practices and fraudulent advertising -- those 
just seem like class action lawyers piling on. LifeLock's aggressive 
fear-based marketing doesn't seem any worse than a lot of other similar 
advertising campaigns. My guess is that the class action lawsuits won't 
go anywhere.

In reality, forcing lenders to verify identity before issuing credit is 
exactly the sort of thing we need to do to fight identity theft. 
Basically, there are two ways to deal with identity theft: Make personal 
information harder to steal, and make stolen personal information harder 
to use. We all know the former doesn't work, so that leaves the latter. 
 If Congress wanted to solve the problem for real, one of the things it 
would do is make fraud alerts permanent for everybody. But the credit 
industry's lobbyists would never allow that.

LifeLock does a bunch of other clever things. They monitor the national 
address database, and alert you if your address changes. They look for 
your credit and debit card numbers on hacker and criminal websites and 
such, and assist you in getting a new number if they see it. They have a 
million-dollar service guarantee -- for complicated legal reasons, they 
can't call it insurance -- to help you recover if your identity is ever 
stolen.

But even with all of this, I am not a LifeLock customer. At $120 a year, 
it's just not worth it. You wouldn't know it from the press attention, 
but dealing with identity theft has become easier and more routine. 
Sure, it's a pervasive problem. The Federal Trade Commission reported 
that 8.3 million Americans were identity-theft victims in 2005. But that 
includes things like someone stealing your credit card and using it, 
something that rarely costs you any money and that LifeLock doesn't 
protect against. New account fraud is much less common, affecting 1.8 
million Americans per year, or 0.8 percent of the adult population. The 
FTC hasn't published detailed numbers for 2006 or 2007, but the rate 
seems to be declining.

New card fraud is also not very damaging. The median amount of fraud the 
thief commits is $1,350, but you're not liable for that. Some 
spectacularly horrible identity-theft stories notwithstanding, the 
financial industry is pretty good at quickly cleaning up the mess. The 
victim's median out-of-pocket cost for new account fraud is only $40, 
plus ten hours of grief to clean up the problem. Even assuming your time 
is worth $100 an hour, LifeLock isn't worth more than $8 a year.

And it's hard to get any data on how effective LifeLock really is. 
They've been in business three years and have about a million customers, 
but most of them have joined up in the last year. They've paid out on 
their service guarantee 113 times, but a lot of those were for things 
that happened before their customers became customers. (It was easier to 
pay than argue, I assume.) But they don't know how often the fraud 
alerts actually catch an identity thief in the act. My guess is that 
it's less than the 0.8 percent fraud rate above.

LifeLock's business model is based more on the fear of identity theft 
than the actual risk.

It's pretty ironic of the credit bureaus to attack LifeLock on its 
marketing practices, since they know all about profiting from the fear 
of identity theft. FACTA also forced the credit bureaus to give 
Americans a free credit report once a year upon request. Through 
deceptive marketing techniques, they've turned this requirement into a 
multimillion-dollar business.

Get LifeLock if you want, or one of its competitors if you prefer. But 
remember that you can do most of what these companies do yourself. You 
can put a fraud alert on your own account, but you have to remember to 
renew it every three months. You can also put a credit freeze on your 
account, which is more work for the average consumer but more effective 
if you're a privacy wonk -- and the rules differ by state. And maybe 
someday Congress will do the right thing and put LifeLock out of 
business by forcing lenders to verify identity every time they issue 
credit in someone's name.

  The First Interdisciplinary Workshop on Security and Human Behavior



The First Interdisciplinary Workshop on Security and Human Behavior (SHB 
08) was held at MIT earlier this month.  From the website:

"Security is both a feeling and a reality, and they're different.  There 
are several different research communities: technologists who study 
security systems, and psychologists who study people, not to mention 
economists, anthropologists and others.  Increasingly these worlds are 
colliding.

"*  Security design is by nature psychological, yet many systems ignore 
this, and cognitive biases lead people to misjudge risk. For example, a 
key in the corner of a web browser makes people feel more secure than 
they actually are, while people feel far less secure flying than they 
actually are. These biases are exploited by various attackers.

"*  Security problems relate to risk and uncertainty, and the way we 
react to them. Cognitive and perception biases affect the way we deal 
with risk, and therefore the way we understand security -- whether that 
is the security of a nation, of an information system, or of one's 
personal information.

"*  Many real attacks on information systems exploit psychology more 
than technology. Phishing attacks trick people into logging on to 
websites that appear genuine but actually steal passwords. Technical 
measures can stop some phishing tactics, but stopping users from making 
bad decisions is much harder. Deception-based attacks are now the 
greatest threat to online security.

"*  In order to be effective, security must be usable -- not just by 
geeks, but by ordinary people. Research into usable security invariably 
has a psychological component.

"*  Terrorism is perceived to be a major threat to society. Yet the 
actual damage done by terrorist attacks is dwarfed by the secondary 
effects as target societies overreact. There are many topics here, from 
the manipulation of risk perception to the anthropology of religion.

"*  There are basic research questions; for example, about the extent to 
which the use and detection of deception in social contexts may have 
helped drive human evolution.

"The dialogue between researchers in security and in psychology is 
rapidly widening, bringing in more and more disciplines -- from security 
usability engineering, protocol design, privacy, and policy on the one 
hand, and from social psychology, evolutionary biology, and behavioral 
economics on the other."

About a year ago, Ross Anderson and I conceived this conference as a way 
to bring together computer security researchers, psychologists, 
behavioral economists, sociologists, philosophers, and others -- all of 
whom are studying the human side of security.  I've read a lot -- and 
written some -- on psychology and security over the past few years, and 
have been continually amazed by some of the research that people outside 
my field have been doing on topics very relevant to my field.  Ross and 
I both thought that bringing these diverse communities together would be 
fascinating to everyone.  So we convinced behavioral economists 
Alessandro Acquisti and George Loewenstein to help us organize the 
workshop, invited the people we all have been reading, and also asked 
them who else to invite.  The response was overwhelming.  Almost 
everyone we wanted was able to attend, and the result was a 42-person 
conference with 35 speakers, including Nicholas Humphrey, Frank Furedi, 
and James Randi.

     The Truth About Chinese Hackers



The popular media conception is that there is a coordinated attempt by 
the Chinese government to hack into U.S. computers -- military, 
government corporate -- and steal secrets. The truth is a lot more 
complicated.

There certainly is a lot of hacking coming out of China. Any company 
that does security monitoring sees it all the time.

These hacker groups seem not to be working for the Chinese government. 
They don't seem to be coordinated by the Chinese military. They're 
basically young, male, patriotic Chinese citizens, trying to demonstrate 
that they're just as good as everyone else. As well as the American 
networks the media likes to talk about, their targets also include 
pro-Tibet, pro-Taiwan, Falun Gong and pro-Uyghur sites.

The hackers are in this for two reasons: fame and glory, and an attempt 
to make a living. The fame and glory comes from their nationalistic 
goals. Some of these hackers are heroes in China. They're upholding the 
country's honor against both anti-Chinese forces like the pro-Tibet 
movement and larger forces like the United States.

And the money comes from several sources. The groups sell owned 
computers, malware services, and data they steal on the black market. 
They sell hacker tools and videos to others wanting to play. They even 
sell T-shirts, hats and other merchandise on their Web sites.

This is not to say that the Chinese military ignores the hacker groups 
within their country. Certainly the Chinese government knows the leaders 
of the hacker movement and chooses to look the other way. They probably 
buy stolen intelligence from these hackers. They probably recruit for 
their own organizations from this self-selecting pool of experienced 
hacking experts. They certainly learn from the hackers.

And some of the hackers are good. Over the years, they have become more 
sophisticated in both tools and techniques. They're stealthy. They do 
good network reconnaissance. My guess is what the Pentagon thinks is the 
problem is only a small percentage of the actual problem.

And they discover their own vulnerabilities. Earlier this year, one 
security company noticed a unique attack against a pro-Tibet 
organization. That same attack was also used two weeks earlier against a 
large multinational defense contractor.

They also hoard vulnerabilities. During the 1999 conflict over the 
two-states theory conflict, in a heated exchange with a group of 
Taiwanese hackers, one Chinese group threatened to unleash multiple 
stockpiled worms at once. There was no reason to disbelieve this threat.

If anything, the fact that these groups aren't being run by the Chinese 
government makes the problem worse. Without central political 
coordination, they're likely to take more risks, do more stupid things 
and generally ignore the political fallout of their actions.

In this regard, they're more like a non-state actor.

So while I'm perfectly happy that the U.S. government is using the 
threat of Chinese hacking as an impetus to get their own cybersecurity 
in order, and I hope they succeed, I also hope that the U.S. government 
recognizes that these groups are not acting under the direction of the 
Chinese military and doesn't treat their actions as officially approved 
by the Chinese government.

     Man-in-the-Middle Attacks



Last week's dramatic rescue of 15 hostages held by the guerrilla 
organization FARC was the result of months of intricate deception on the 
part of the Colombian government. At the center was a classic 
man-in-the-middle attack.

In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker inserts himself between two 
communicating parties. Both believe they're talking to each other, and 
the attacker can delete or modify the communications at will. The Wall 
Street Journal reported how this gambit played out in Colombia:

"The plan had a chance of working because, for months, in an operation 
one army officer likened to a "broken telephone," military intelligence 
had been able to convince Ms. Betancourt's captor, Gerardo Aguilar, a 
guerrilla known as "Cesar," that he was communicating with his top 
bosses in the guerrillas' seven-man secretariat. Army intelligence 
convinced top guerrilla leaders that they were talking to Cesar. In 
reality, both were talking to army intelligence."

This ploy worked because Cesar and his guerrilla bosses didn't know one 
another well. They didn't recognize one another's voices, and didn't 
have a friendship or shared history that could have tipped them off 
about the ruse. Man-in-the-middle is defeated by context, and the FARC 
guerrillas didn't have any.

And that's why man-in-the-middle, abbreviated MITM in the 
computer-security community, is such a problem online: Internet 
communication is often stripped of any context. There's no way to 
recognize someone's face. There's no way to recognize someone's voice. 
When you receive an e-mail purporting to come from a person or 
organization, you have no idea who actually sent it. When you visit a 
website, you have no idea if you're really visiting that website. We all 
like to pretend that we know who we're communicating with -- and for the 
most part, of course, there isn't any attacker inserting himself into 
our communications -- but in reality, we don't. And there are lots of 
hacker tools that exploit this unjustified trust, and implement MITM 
attacks.

Even with context, it's still possible for MITM to fool both sides -- 
because electronic communications are often intermittent. Imagine that 
one of the FARC guerrillas became suspicious about who he was talking 
to. So he asks a question about their shared history as a test: "What 
did we have for dinner that time last year?" or something like that. On 
the telephone, the attacker wouldn't be able to answer quickly, so his 
ruse would be discovered. But e-mail conversation isn't synchronous. The 
attacker could simply pass that question through to the other end of the 
communications, and when he got the answer back, he would be able to reply.

This is the way MITM attacks work against web-based financial systems. A 
bank demands authentication from the user: a password, a one-time code 
from a token or whatever. The attacker sitting in the middle receives 
the request from the bank and passes it to the user. The user responds 
to the attacker, who passes that response to the bank. Now the bank 
assumes it is talking to the legitimate user, and the attacker is free 
to send transactions directly to the bank. This kind of attack 
completely bypasses any two-factor authentication mechanisms, and is 
becoming a more popular identity-theft tactic.

There are cryptographic solutions to MITM attacks, and there are secure 
web protocols that implement them. Many of them require shared secrets, 
though, making them useful only in situations where people already know 
and trust one another.

The NSA-designed STU-III and STE secure telephones solve the MITM 
problem by embedding the identity of each phone together with its key. 
(The NSA creates all keys and is trusted by everyone, so this works.) 
When two phones talk to each other securely, they exchange keys and 
display the other phone's identity on a screen. Because the phone is in 
a secure location, the user now knows who he is talking to, and if the 
phone displays another organization -- as it would if there were a MITM 
attack in progress -- he should hang up.

Zfone, a secure VoIP system, protects against MITM attacks with a short 
authentication string. After two Zfone terminals exchange keys, both 
computers display a four-character string. The users are supposed to 
manually verify that both strings are the same -- "my screen says 5C19; 
what does yours say?" -- to ensure that the phones are communicating 
directly with each other and not with an MITM. The AT&T TSD-3600 worked 
similarly.

This sort of protection is embedded in SSL, although no one uses it. As 
it is normally used, SSL provides an encrypted communications link to 
whoever is at the other end: bank and phishing site alike. And the 
better phishing sites create valid SSL connections, so as to more 
effectively fool users. But if the user wanted to, he could manually 
check the SSL certificate to see if it was issued to "National Bank of 
Trustworthiness" or "Two Guys With a Computer in Nigeria."

No one does, though, because you have to both remember and be willing to 
do the work. (The browsers could make this easier if they wanted to, but 
they don't seem to want to.) In the real world, you can easily tell a 
branch of your bank from a money changer on a street corner. But on the 
internet, a phishing site can be easily made to look like your bank's 
legitimate website. Any method of telling the two apart takes work. And 
that's the first step to fooling you with a MITM attack.

Man-in-the-middle isn't new, and it doesn't have to be technological. 
But the internet makes the attacks easier and more powerful, and that's 
not going to change anytime soon.
