Exactly. These are the same people who gave mortgage-backed securities the
same rating. And we saw what happened the last time a ratings agency tried
to downgrade US government debt: they got "investigated." All the ratings
agencies have privileged standing in US law; many entities, in particular
government pension plans, are only allowed to invest in "investment grade"
instruments, with "investment grade" being determined by one of a specific
set of corporations. Given that they're paid by the people selling the
instruments rather than by investors, they'd just evaporate if they lost
their special standing under US law.

And this is after they were discussing default in congress and candidate

Yup. The Ponzi scheme most of the world's financial system is built on (is,
really).

So the question is, what form will its collapse take, and how long will it
take? I'm not sure if I'd prefer that it be quick and extremely painful or
slow to give people who have a clue what's going on time to insulate
themselves.
