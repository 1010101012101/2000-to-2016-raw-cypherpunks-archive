Perhaps he knew that you would keep the ‘conversation’ raging, therefore bringing it more ‘into the light’ than silence itself would prompt. Since you’ve been ‘on the case’, cypherpunks is 90% this subject matter, and 10% other cruft.

Again, perhaps that was the intended purpose.


Ie, in a different thread about the same subject (after he poked and prodded you earlier in said thread…)

I don’t know; neither do you. Selling old ass log files on purpose isn’t full of much sense if you’re constraining yourself into thinking ‘inside the box’. JYA doesn’t seem very in the box to me, but hey…
