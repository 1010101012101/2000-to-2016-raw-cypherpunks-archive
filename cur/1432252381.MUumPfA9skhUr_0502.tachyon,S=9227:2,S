Undoubtedly, the bruises on the suspect's body and the electrical burn
marks on his testicles were self-inflicted... Oh, I see. The FBI will
release the suspect's body only after cremation. "For the public's
safety". Never mind my comment.

I didn't see it mentioned on this list, though I may have overlooked the
post, but the recent statements by the FBI that the agency is
considering torture of suspects stubbornly exercising their 5th
Amendment rights after 6 weeks of questioning is solid proof that the
subjects do not have legal representation. Even the most incompetent
public defender would by now have requested that the FBI stop question
their client.
