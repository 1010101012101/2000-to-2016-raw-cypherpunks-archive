Even worse is if the "encryption" is in bad faith to begin with. (i.e. They 
know it is broken and/or worthless, but don't want the general public to find 
out.)

Imagine some of the usual snake-oil cryto-schemes applied to copyrighted 
material.  Then imagine that they use the same bunch of lawyers as the 
Scientologists. 

This could work out to be a great money-making scam!  Invent a bogus copy 
protection scheme.  Con a bunch of suckers to buy it for their products. Sue 
anyone who breaks it or tries to expose you as a fraud for damages.


I mean if they can go after people for breaking things that use ROT-13 
(eBooks) and 22 bit encryption (or whatever CSS actually uses), then you can 
go after just about anyone who threatens your business model.

I guess we *do* have the best government money can buy.  We just were not the 
ones writing the checks...
