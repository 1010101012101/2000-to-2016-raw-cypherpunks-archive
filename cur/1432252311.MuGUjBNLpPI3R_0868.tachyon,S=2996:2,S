I agree with this as far as "crypto" protocols go. But one thing to keep
in mind is that almost all protocols impact security, whether their
dsigners realize it or not. Especially protocols for file transfer, print
spooling, or reservation of resources. most of these are designed without
people identifying them as "crypto protocols."

Another thing that makes it worse -- composition of protocols. You can do
an authentication protocol and prove you're "you." Then what? Does that
confer security properties upon following protocols, and if so what?
