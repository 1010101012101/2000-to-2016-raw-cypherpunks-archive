Actually there was an IP battle fought over mice.  See, some mice cost
$150 a pop, and at the same time, mice are easy to copy.  And the community
of mouse-users (aka biologists) likes to share.

In the end, the NIH (the largest buyer of these specialty mice) used its
leverage
to allow biologists to share without legal hassles while also protecting the 
interests of the mouse manufacturers who were asserting their IP.
