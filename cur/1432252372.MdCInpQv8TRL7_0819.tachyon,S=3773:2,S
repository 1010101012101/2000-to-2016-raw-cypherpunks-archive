Then my comments won't affect their actions one way or the other.

Tim already is a target.  My minor comments do nothing to change his status.

Are those the only possible explanations you can come up with?  I find most
of Tim's insights useful and think he is a valuable member of the list.
Pointing out that he has his head up his ass on certain subjects is hardly
equivalent to having a "personal vendetta."  As to "crappy personality"
well, that's why there are horse races; differences of opinion.

Huh?  Maybe I'd know what you were talking about if you'd actually answered
my question.

No warrant is friendly.  I've had the FBI stop by my house for a friendly
visit (no warrant).  Just for the fun of it (and to see what they were
after), I let them sit down in my living room.  After I asked them a few
questions and gotten some answers, they started asking ME some questions.
That's when I kicked their sorry asses out.

MUCH better, but why don't you tell us how you REALLY feel?  :'D
