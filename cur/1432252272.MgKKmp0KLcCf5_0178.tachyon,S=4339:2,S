Might that not just be because the VCs have a different interest than
the inventors? Also, for the VC, the inventors & patent holders are (in
a sense) sitting tenants. They would prefer to get hold of the property
unencumbered.  OTOH, the inventor (who may well be distrustful or
ignorant of business) wants to be sure that whoever ends up running the
show remembers to pay them

Of course the lawyers will go for patenting because they get paid more
the more paperwork there is.
