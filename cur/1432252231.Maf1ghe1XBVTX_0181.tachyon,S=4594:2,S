I don't buy into conspiracy theories often but I really can't see how
you can fail to follow your own RFC. If he had a check in there to make
sure the payload_length wasn't too large I would say "hey, he forgot to
make sure it wasn't too small and he never even mentioned checking if it
was too small that in the RFC"... but he actually never checked for
anything.. so maybe it is just a mistake. He definitely failed to follow
his own RFC which never mentioned making sure the length was correct,
just that it wasn't too big, and that's something he never did.

I don't get how the reviewer can miss it too, like it's code for an RFC
the reviewer is COMPLETELY new to... so at first the code looks a bit
mad until you read the RFC, then you realize right away that he's
missing shit. Seems silly, i don't think the reviewer ever read the RFC.
