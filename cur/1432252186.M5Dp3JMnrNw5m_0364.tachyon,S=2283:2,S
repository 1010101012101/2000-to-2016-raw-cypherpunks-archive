   denis-The-menace writes "According to an article from newscientist,
   scientists have devised a system to [1]use microwave energy for
   surveillance. If people are speaking inside the room, any flimsy
   surface, such as clothing, will be vibrating. This modulates the radio
   beam reflected from the surface. Although the radio reflection that
   passes back through the wall is extremely faint, the kind of
   electronic extraction and signal cleaning tricks used by NASA to
   decode signals in space can be used to extract speech. Although, I
   doubt it would work in [2]this room"
