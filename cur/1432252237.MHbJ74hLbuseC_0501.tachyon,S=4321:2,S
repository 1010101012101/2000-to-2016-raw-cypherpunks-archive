Lee,



I have been receiving multiple emails from you and I do not understand what
you are trying to communicate in regards to terrorism, cybercrime, organized
crime, lava flows, White House scheduling and DCCA complaints.



It appears that you are now falsely reporting to the Internet Crime
Complaint Center various US agencies and appointed officials as sponsors of
terrorism.



Stop what you are doing, if you continue to send the types of communications
you have been, you will draw further attention to yourself from Law
Enforcement and I and/or another agent(s) or Officers of the Hawaii County
Police Department will be forced to locate and interview you. This will
prove to be very inconveniencing to you.



I am aware of the fact that you have been diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia and have a history of refusing or being negligent in your
medication. I also understand that you are a very intelligent individual and
that your present and past email communications are most likely a symptom of
your illness. I hope that you do not waste any more of the governments time
and choose to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
