Not very, I think. It seems it's RAH's specialty. It's quite poetic,
actually.

Although 'geodesic' does have, through its use in general relativity, some
faint echo of 'operates purely based on local information', I think it's a
misnomer. People should rather use the term 'distributed' literally, as it's
used in computer science. That's the meaning RAH is after, not true?
