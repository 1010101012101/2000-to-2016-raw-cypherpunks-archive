as a matter of fact, it does. the quantity of it, you know. if your 1
mio spam mails cause every receipient half a sec (on average) to
discard, you've just wasted roughly a week of worktime.

time every evening *willingly* subjecting themselves to advertisement
(and a little entertainment between the spots) on tv anyways.
