   Not really.  To that extent, a gnutella scanner is probably 
already in the hands of any law enforcement types that are 
interested, and there's no reason gnutella itself ought not 
benefit from the same technology.  Better points, since I need 
to spell them out, are:

	(a) If scanning is done in a clumsy way it generates a lot 
	    of network traffic and twangs a lot of alarms at various 
	    firewalls.

	(b) scanning is a "hot button" issue with a fair number of 
	    people and could generate complaints.

	(c) complaints about gnutella scanning would be "legal ammo" 
            for people who wanted to shut it down.


I think that all network applications ought to be able to find other 
nodes running other copies of the application - but be very careful 
how you design it, so as not to piss people off.

A nice low-overhead scanner that doesn't generate complaints, would 
be a request and response on some other protocol.  If you write a 
little cgi program, say IsGnutellaThere.cgi, and have gnutella users 
drop it into their apache (or iis, or whatever) directory, then you 
can make an HTTP request on port 80.  IsGnutellaThere.cgi would run 
and check to see if the gnutella server is up and what port it's on, 
maybe check a table to find other gnutellas that it knows about,
and return that information in an http response.  

Then gnutella users who wanted to be scannable (and not all of them 
will) could drop the program into their CGI directory, and scan-enabled 
gnutellas could just learn how to make a simple HTTP request and keep 
that table up-to-date for IsGnutellaThere.cgi to access.

HTTP is low-overhead and innocuous, and there's already a hole for it 
in most firewalls.  It won't generate alarms.  A straight-up "scanning" 
approach most definitely will.
