This cryptanalysis of Microsoft/Skype is applicable to the whole
Internet -- by design purpose-made to spy and lightly obfuscate
with patently false denials and illusory privacy and comsec --
blessed by security wizards in public, chuckled, rued and
reneged in private, usually under NDA and secrecy bonds --
flimsy, false bonds which themselves are chuckled, rued
and reneged as the experts race to turn on each other's
betrayal and grab for market share by doing the same.

Cybersecurity is the latest adverting billboard for this (leached
from WMD spying and national security long coddled by top
secret national laboratories complicitly aiding each other while
pretending opposition).

To paraphrase Jon Callas, criticism of cybersecurity is
a key escrow part of the script.

(What Jon said was "Remember, the only difference between
lawful access and espionage is whose jurisdiction it is.")

And cybersecurity wizards, like all security whores, work
for law enforcement and spies, whether Spamhaus, Spothaus,
or CyberBunker, wittingly or unwittingly showing how to attack
under light defense -- the very reason for creating and promulgating
the Internet, aka: pick your favorite and most trusted communications
medium against which even implacatory silence, getting off the grid,
pleading a deal, lovers ratting on lovers, Schmidt shitting on JA,
Manning induced to shit on himself, Swartz induced to shit on
himself, a stream of others induced to shit on and be shit on,
to wit social media, chat, Jabber, Anon, paste, backdoored encrypt,
nym, false front, megaload, the latest trick to beat the competition
while being meticulously tracked, profiled, archives, mined, targeted,
siphoned, accused with perfect evidence, APT'd, Monsegured,
Barrett Browned, slew of others like them, just when least exptected.

To paraphrase Emmanuel Goldstein, at least 25% of Internet users
are informants.
