Hello, Mr. Kojo, I would be happy to assist you with this
financial peccadillo; unfortunately, all my liquid assets
are tied up in the 15th Circuit Tax Court and I require a
substantial advance to free them up.  If you could arrange
the transfer of USD 1,000,000.00, I'll be happy to see
what I can do to help you get your 14,000,000.00.
