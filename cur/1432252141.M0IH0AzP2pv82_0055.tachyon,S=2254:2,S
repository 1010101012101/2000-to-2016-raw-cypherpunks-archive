How about that .3 kiloton AN explosion in France a little after 11.9.01?

But you don't get much crater with an airburst --think about Trinity,
where the tower was left standing.  To get a crater, you have to
bury the nuke (see SEDAN, PLOWSHARE), which BTW
couples the shock very nicely into the ground.  (You *can*
destroy an underground bunker with a nuke, you just bury
a 10 MT device.  The fallout prevents its deployment though.
Easier just to bomb the ingress/egress.
http://www.fas.org/rlg/20.htm has some good ideas on this.

In any case, you won't see the surface until the smoke clears.
But the gamma, seismic (quakes don't start instantly), and
opticals (double-pulse) will tip a nuke quite clearly.
