"The ultimate in paranoia is not when everyone is against you but when
everything is against you." ---PKD

An appeals court this week put the brakes on an FBI surveillance
technique that turns an automobile driver's on-board vehicle navigation
system into a covert eavesdropping device, after finding that the spying
effectively disables the system's emergency and roadside assistance
features

...in which agents obtained a court order compelling a telematics
company to secretly activate the stolen vehicle recovery feature in a
customer's car. The feature, designed to listen-in on car thieves as
they cruise around in a stolen auto, turns on a dashboard microphone and
pipes conversations out over a cellphone connection -- normally to the
company's response center, but in this case to an FBI listening post.
