AF and NN have also claimed that we, as a list,  are complicit in making 
bombs because we "tolerate" the clueless bombz d00dz who are probably 
cops.

AF talks about how close he/she lives to the Bush ranch in Texas, he/she 
talks about bombs and judge killings...he/she is clearly attempting some 
sort of incitement or entrapment.
