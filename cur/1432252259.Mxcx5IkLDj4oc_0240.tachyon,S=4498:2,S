To be addressed in my next, which, likely, will be my last, to you.

Considering how you've read things into my posts, I am, shall I say, 
dumbfounded.  </blood-dripping sarcasm>

I'm critiquing you and your allegations, not defending Chomsky.

This is where I sign off.

By my way of calculation, I owe you one more reply.  Barring some epiphany 
resultant from a coronary or other life-changing event, I expect it will
be the last time I reply to you, on this topic.
