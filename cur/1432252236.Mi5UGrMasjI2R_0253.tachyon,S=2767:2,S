This is actually the running fantasy in Marxism since the 1950's, when it
turned out that that, instead of the "workers" eating the "bourgeoisie" by
the firelight or some Glorious Revolution or another, would instead be come
"bourgeoisie" themselves.

So, seeing their utter failure to create "workers" paradise in the
industrial West, they decided to change their unit of "analysis" from
people to nation-states.

Of course, India, various parts of broken up legislated or
forcibly-conquered pseudostates, like Slovenia, the Baltics, even Mongolia
and China itself, have shown that "capitalism" -- Marx's word for
"economics", or "markets", or "individual freedom" depending on your scale
of "analysis" -- has the same effect there that it did in the US and Europe
in the 1950's. Or the 1850's, for that matter.

Marxists, and their fellow-travellers of all dilutions, from actual
card-carriers to "liberals" in the US are such worthess assholes, and such
"state-is-a-person" "analyses" are so much projectile excrement from same.

Cheers,
