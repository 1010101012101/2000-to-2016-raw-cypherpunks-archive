<p>THE SCALE MOVED!!!<br>
<br>
Hello! My name is Tami McPherson and I would like to share my experience a=
s an inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope.<br>
<br>
It is amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simpl=
y do not want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight problem for the=
 better part of a decade.<br>
<br>
My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the refrig=
erator.<br>
<br>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked=
. At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or ener=
gy to respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder...  If tha=
t thin, sexy, woman, in that short black dress was really me? (My husband =
proposed to me in that dress 10 years ago) I did not even feel like that h=
appy woman in the picture, I was exhausted and so depressed.<br>
<br>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I wa=
s too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I=
 was tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day.<br>
<br>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting "care=
er. " Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, &amp; even Phen-Ph=
en, and the list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few days, then=
 it was only a matter of time until I reached my breaking point and ended =
up eating vast quantities of the very foods I had been denying myself. NOT=
HING worked for me until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try a produ=
ct that was nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That product was=
 called
<i><b><font color=3D"#3366CC"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b></i>.<br>
<br>
After about five days on <i><b><font color=3D"#3366CC"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</f=
ont></b></i>, I began to experience a sense of "well being" with increased=
 energy - I did not feel tired, irritable or sluggish. More Importantly, I=
 did not feel Hungry, something I had not felt for months, maybe years.<br=
>
<br>
I have been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought I ha=
d tried<br>
everything when...<br>
<br>
The Scale Moved!! I mean, really Moved! .<br>
<br>
I lost 126 pounds in 6 months.<br>
Within 6 months I dropped down to 156 pounds.<br>
<br>
Today, I can do many activities that I could not when I weighed 282 pounds=
. The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was! My doctor has examin=
ed me, and my weight loss has blown his mind! People that I used to work w=
ith and even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas! I truly wish=
 everyone who is overweight knew about this program ... I plan to tell eve=
ryone I can who has struggled with his or her weight, like I have. I can f=
eel your pain, believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the
<i><b><font color=3D"#3366CC"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b></i> program! It =
has given me a new lease on life!  After losing 126 pounds so far, I feel =
very confident, happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I recently wore that same bl=
ack cocktail dress I wore when my husband proposed - 10 years ago! (I gues=
s that woman in the picture really was me!) I thought I would never look a=
nd feel like that again!<br>
<br>
<i><b><font color=3D"#3366CC"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b></i> is a powerfu=
l gift from nature that has touched every aspect of my life! And from the =
bottom of my heart, I will always thank my dear friend Judy for telling me=
 about this wonderful product and giving me back the joy of living.<br>
<br>
IF I COULD DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT TOO!<br>
<br>
I was sick of being fat. I did not like the way I looked and I did not lik=
e the way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my four children,an=
d myself to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you need to lose a fe=
w pounds, more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, click through this=
 website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for=
 so many people like you and me!.The proof is in the pudding (so to speak)=
 so take a look at the many success stories from others who have gained be=
tter health, improved their relationships, and of course, lost weight and =
are keeping it off for good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if=
 you decide this is something you are willing to try - GO FOR IT!!!!! You =
won't be sorry.. Do take the time to read them. Many are simply AMAZING!<b=
