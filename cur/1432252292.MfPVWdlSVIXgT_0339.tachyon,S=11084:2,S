We are doomed not only as a country, but as a world, if this non-sense 
'war' continues. We have so much technology to take us forward in our 
world TOGETHER, but instead, we use it to rip away any (remaining) sense 
of humanity that we may have left.

I am curious Mr. John Young's take on this article...
