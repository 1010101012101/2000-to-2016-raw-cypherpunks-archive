Believing something doesn't make it so.

Me too.  Probably much more than you, my dear Mirimir.  To find the truth,
you must believe.  I always wanted to believe.  I still believe in a better
world for everybody, but it is becoming pretty hard to discover what means
a "better world" and "everybody", uh!  :-/

Being a hard headed person makes me waste a lot of time following variables
because Law is not an Exact Science and persons are not exact and precise
at all, haha!!  ;)

No truth.  It hurts.  And it is probably true.  :(
