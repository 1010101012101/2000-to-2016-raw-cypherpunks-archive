(I'm cc'ing this to the cypherpunks list as well)

The easy solution to this is to put up a web page with information 
*about* the NAMBLA site, and instructions on how to request that the 
site be delivered anonymously--as a gzip, zip, or stuffit archive.

If one has access to a web server that allows cgi, this is fairly 
trivial to do with two way anonymity.

Another solution would be to create a newsgroup like 
alt.websites.censored.binary and post the archive there every two or 
three days, and just link that from the web site.

While I am not willing to take the heat for posting the NAMBLA site 
on my server (for fear of getting my connectivity yanked) I am 
willing to assist in working out a system where this information can 
be made available to those who wish it without having to deal with 
the public scrutiny.

Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government

Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let
