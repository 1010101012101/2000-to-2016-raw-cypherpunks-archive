Sure are - it's a followon to Peter Trei's message dated
Tue, 3 Oct 2000 10:48:07 -0400 which said

That's a remailer checking outgoing mail to be sure it's encrypted,
as well as checking incoming mail.

On incoming messages, it's easy to tell if it's encrypted to *you* -
decrypt it with your private keys, job's done.  If you don't recognize
the algorithm, the message wasn't for you.

Hmmm.  That's a more interesting problem - this does seem to have the
tradeoff that if you want to get messages sent to you using stego,
you shouldn't use a remailer that has a PGP-out-only policy.
On the other hand, mail from a known Cypherpunks Anonymous Secret
Message Remailer adds a certain amount of suspiciousness anyway.
You want to get your stego messages from "Fred's GIF-of-the-Day" or
"Pirate-Muzick-R-Us" or something that's a better cover story -
so make sure those sites accept incoming PGP mail.

>What algorithm will reliably find stego data?

If you can reliably find it, it's not very good stego :-)
Open source stego that's not key-based has inherent weaknesses -
the eavesdroppers can easily extract the message from the cover text,
so the message needs to be binary random-looking noise which
somewhat plausibly belongs in the message (e.g. low bits of sound samples.)

				Thanks!
