Sparring with Choate is about as useful as beating oneself with a
rubber baton, just far less rewarding.

I never said animals should be trained to fear an owner or any other
human; to say otherwise is simple Choatian exaggeration. But my "show
of force" point is perfectly reasonable, and I stand by it.

PS: I don't have pets. I travel too much. I had a fish once.
