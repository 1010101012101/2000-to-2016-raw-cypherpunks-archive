I believe DARPA sought and received an opinion letter from the SEC and DoJ 
regarding this venture which provided that, being the government, they were 
"immune" from prosecution for violation of gambling and unregistered 
securities violations.  You are correct, however, that should the DoD 
venture have gone forward there would have been quite an uproar from 
domestic and international gaming companies questioning the authority to 
grant this sort of dispensation to the Feds.  Fo example, the WTO (World 
Trade Organisation) this week granted Antigua and Barbuda the right to a 
hearing over its long-standing complaint against the United States, which 
has restricted the right of US citizens to gamble online - a major lifeline 
for the Caribbean jurisdiction's economy.
