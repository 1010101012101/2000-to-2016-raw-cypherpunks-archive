Does anyone know of a manufacturer of FIPS 140 certified or
certifiable 1u/2u rack mount chassis?

For a seperate project, does anyone know of a small linux-ready/able
box with ethernet?
Gumstix looks cool but I need hardwire networking.


Last, I'm looking for a Linux expert security engineer in the SF
bay area.  (I'm managing a security group at a startup that has
been shipping products to paying customers for a few years.  No its
not lne.com, this just address I use to post).

This person will need to know linux/unix OS security/hardening _in
depth_ and also have an understanding of crypto APIs (writing them not
using them) plus significant industry experience.  Sorry, no relocation
assistance.


Eric
