I have been meaning to do this for a while.
I need some help from the existing CDR node operators though so
that my node can get the subscriber lists from theirs- a number of
CDR nodes don't have open who commands.
Could y'all contact me off-list?

I'll post to the entire list once I get it running.

I'll probably also add my spam-recognition stuff, which sticks
a rating of the likelyhood of the contents being spam in the headers.
(i.e. X-spam: 100).  It doesn't drop the mail, just rate it.
What recipients do with the information will of course be
up to them.

SSZ's CDR web page (einstein.ssz.com/cdr/index.html#) says:

<The idea was to have multiple remailers, usualy using majordomo and
<procmail, that members could subscribe to and individual remailer
<operators could impose just about whatever type of moderation policy
<they desired.

which is what I'm doing here.
