Hi Keith,
     In short, the entire white-hat security community guessed what
"prohibitively expensive" meant.  They guessed too low.  Now we
know, and everyone (including the white-hats and the surveillance
industry) are scrambling to recover from the revelation.

Some are thinking of it as the tinfoil hats coming off.  I think of it as
tinfoil hats appearing on every head of every person who has a device
connected to the internet.  I like it that way because "paranoid" becomes
a synonym for "human", and all those previous "paranoid options" that
are cordoned off with scant documentation suddenly become "bad
human interfaces" which were prohibitively complicated to have actually
provided security or privacy to the user when it turned out that they
needed it.

So to me, "paranoid option" now either means a) core feature which should
be implemented cleanly, by default, or b) a dead coal mine canary that
says the
interface itself is too complicated, so start over and rethink it.

Best,
Jonathan
