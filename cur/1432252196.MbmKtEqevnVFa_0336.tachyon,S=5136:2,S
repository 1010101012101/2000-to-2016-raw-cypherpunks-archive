The KML file works great in Marble
(<https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Marble_%28software%9>),
a free software Google Earth-like program. It's also available in Debian
and derivatives under the package "marble".

Apologies to anyone who got this twice, but I wanted to make sure that
both lists were aware of this (since I don't really like the "look at
the Tor network on Google" thing).
