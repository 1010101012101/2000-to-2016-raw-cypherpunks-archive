There's actually plenty of work on incentives to cooperation in P2P  
systems that can actually interest you. The keywords to look for in Google 
Scholar are probably "p2p incentives", "p2p reputation".

The papers about the topic that I like most are: "Incentives build  
robustness in BitTorrent" by Bram Cohen (P2PEcon 2003) and "Sybilproof  
reputation mechanisms" by Alice Cheng and Eric Friedman (P2PEcon 2005).

I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on incentives to cooperation in P2P, and you might 
be interested in the Background chapter:

cheers!
