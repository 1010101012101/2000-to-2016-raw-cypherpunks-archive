Of course, optical signals could never be remotely detected by air or even 
without an optical tap. I doubt even aerial optical cable readiates enough 
or in such a way as to be remotely detectable.

However, the vast majority of "last mile" installations are still copper, 
and copper does radiate. But I can't see how that could be detected by air 
either. Even if there's enough radiation, it's going to get scattered and 
diffracted to hell and gone as it passes through the sheath, concrete, and 
then air.

ANd of course, there's the bandwidth issue. In even a medium sized metro 
area the sheer number of landlines will be huge, and any businesses will be 
shipping out their traffic via T1 or fractional T1. Hence, one of those 
airplanes would practically need a small CO to demultiplex all that traffic 
(although even off-the-shelf silicon has come a LONG way from the 5ESS days, 
so the size factor will not be something to sneeze at).

Nah. Any such AWAC-type recon 'surveys' must be seeking out targeted 
information somehow. Perhaps there's some kind of electronic 'red dye' that 
allow a specific set of users' calls to stand out? Is it possible that 
'interesting' landlines are dropped-and-continued on to some narrowcasting 
point for air? This might be their way of getting around the TIRKS and 
provisioning issues related to moving those lines a long distance, and 
possibly through multiple carriers (but then again, that just might be what 
DISAs' recently announced GIG-BE network is supposed to solve!)
