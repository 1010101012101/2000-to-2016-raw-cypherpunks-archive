Law enforcement personnel and public officials may be at increased risk of
being targeted by hacktivists. Hacking collectives are effective at
leveraging open source, publicly available information identifying officers
and public officials, their employers or associates, and their families.
With this in mind, officers and public officials should be highly aware of
their email account security and their online presence and exposure. For
example, posting images wearing uniforms displaying name tags or listing
their police department on social media sites can increase an officer's
risk of being targeted or attacked.

Many legitimate online posts are linked directly to personal social media
accounts. Law enforcement personnel and public officials need to maintain
an enhanced awareness of the content they post and how it may reflect on
themselves, their family, and their employer, or how it could be used
against them in court or during online attacks.
