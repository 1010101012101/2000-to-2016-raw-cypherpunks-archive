It's good to confirm you're as sloppy in reading email and geology
as you are in composing your usual half-baked COTUS rants.

It says waterfall. Nothing about the "1000 feet", the claim I
repeatedly questioned. To confirm this, use your self-proclaimed
search skills on the page for "1000" and "thousand".

Big claims require big proof. Not, "Yes, I'm sure" - your initial
response.
