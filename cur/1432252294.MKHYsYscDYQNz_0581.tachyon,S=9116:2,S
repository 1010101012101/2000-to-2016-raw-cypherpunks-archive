Trillions?


---------- Forwarded message ----------

Subject: Re: [tor-talk] Questions about NSA monitoring of Tor users.
To: "tor-talk@lists.torproject.org" <tor-talk@lists.torproject.org>


I can answer this:

1.  The IP addresses can be connected to an ISP and physical address
should the need arise.  It allows the NSA to "rewind the tape" so to
speak.  That is why there has been a push for data retention at ISPs.
Given that in the EU governments are seeking 2 years, it would
indicate that the platform can rewind internet activity for at least
that long.

2.  Tor is a communications platform, the NSA's job is to monitor
communications and intercept military planning that effects either
itself or its partners.  Secure global communications and computing is
now a commodity, whereas it was mainly a state-only capability.  Thus,
the average user is now coming up against intelligence agencies,
rather than state actors alone.  Leaving blind spots would be
dangerous to national security as it provides opportunities for
planning and coordination.  So, there is a legitimate case here and no
one denies it.  The real problem is that in the absence of a genuine
international threat and by that I mean someone on the scale of
Russia/China, these systems are being directed against groups with
limited capabilities.  Those groups are now being defined as national
security threats to justify budgets and to filter money into
particular black projects.  Revelations by Snowden and other releases
are merely a distraction to where the money is really going.
   Did no one notice trillions are being drained from the US economy
into some unidentified military project for the last decade or more???

It would seem to indicate that there is a Manhatten-style project underway.

Regards,

Mark McCarron
