Diebold completes e-voting printer prototype


NORTH CANTON, Ohio (AP) - Diebold said Thursday it has completed a
prototype printer designed for use with touch-screen electronic voting
machines, allowing voters to print, review and verify ballot selections.

 "Voter verified paper receipts are something new," said David Bear, a
spokesman for subsidiary Diebold Election Systems in McKinney, Texas.

 "No other type of voting provides a receipt for voters. But some states
are asking for it, so we needed to develop a product that meets standards
for functionality," he said.

 Voters can view their selections, but will not be able to remove the
printout. The voter's printed selections would be placed into a secure
enclosure, stored and numbered with a security tag. The printer weighs less
than three pounds.

 The printer will be submitted to independent testing authorities to ensure
that it meets federal standards as a prerequisite to certification in
states, Bear said.

 The printer would be an optional component to any new or existing Diebold
AccuVote TSx touch-screen voting machine. Bear said a per-unit cost and a
time frame for possible sale are not yet determined.
