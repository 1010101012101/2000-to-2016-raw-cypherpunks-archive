In 1801 Thomas Jefferson said:

"Considering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies, and to increase expense to the ultimate term of burden which the citizen can bear, it behooves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that it never may be seen here that, after leaving to labor the smallest portion of it earnings on which it can subsist, government shall itself consume the residue or what it was instituted to guard."

I wonder how many policians can be found that agree with this sentiment?
