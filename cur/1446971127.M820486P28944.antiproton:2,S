Bollocks to Lazy People.

In the UK, when someone learns to drive a car they take an average of 25
lessons because its not easy to drive a car safely and skillfully.
After they pass a relatively difficult theory and practical test they
appreciate that they are now only truly beginning to get to grips with
the skills required to drive well.

To learn to use GPG/PGP sufficiently to sign and encrypt mail isn't even
a fraction of the skill level or time required as learning to drive and
there's plenty of free guides on the internet.

So, the issue is one of motivation, not difficulty.

Can GPG be easier to use, I think so, is it too difficult to use by
ordinary people - no, they're just too fucking lazy and lack motivation.

You want people to use crypto, scare the fucking living daylights out of
them about how their governments and corporations are becoming way too
powerful and just maybe they'll become motivated enough to overcome
their laziness.

Otherwise, the only option is to make GPG transparent by getting the
email providers to automatically create key pairs and automatically
handle signing and encryption by integrating their mail services with
GPG behind the scenes.
However, if we wish to promote choice then this isn't a good way to go
about it.
This method would also have implications for privacy and anonymity too
as communications between the email client and mail servers may occur
when a user is not expecting it.
