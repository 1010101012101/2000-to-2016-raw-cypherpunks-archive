Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies
Nomination period: March 4, 2004 through March 7, 2005
Nomination instructions: http://petworkshop.org/award/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy and anonymity are increasingly important in the online world.
Corporations, governments, and other organizations are realizing and
exploiting their power to track users and their behavior, and restrict
the ability to publish or retrieve documents. Approaches to
protecting individuals, groups, but also companies and governments
from such profiling and censorship include decentralization,
encryption, distributed trust, and automated policy disclosure.

This 5th workshop addresses the design and realization of such privacy
and anti-censorship services for the Internet and other communication
networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from
around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of privacy
technologies, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems.  We
encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business
that present their perspectives on technological issues.  As in past
years, we will publish proceedings after the workshop in the Springer
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:

* Anonymous communications and publishing systems
* Censorship resistance
* Pseudonyms, identity management, linkability, and reputation
* Data protection technologies
* Location privacy
* Policy, law, and human rights relating to privacy
* Privacy and anonymity in peer-to-peer architectures
* Economics of privacy
* Fielded systems and techniques for enhancing privacy in existing systems
* Protocols that preserve anonymity/privacy
* Privacy-enhanced access control or authentication/certification
* Privacy threat models
* Models for anonymity and unobservability
* Attacks on anonymity systems
* Traffic analysis
* Profiling and data mining
* Privacy vulnerabilities and their impact on phishing and identity theft
* Deployment models for privacy infrastructures
* Novel relations of payment mechanisms and anonymity
* Usability issues and user interfaces for PETs
* Reliability, robustness and abuse prevention in privacy systems

Stipends to attend the workshop will be made available, on the basis
of need, to cover travel expenses, hotel, or conference fees.  You do
not need to submit a technical paper and you do not need to be a
student to apply for a stipend.  For more information, see
http://petworkshop.org/2005/stipends.html

Papers should be at most 15 pages excluding the bibliography and
well-marked appendices (using an 11-point font), and at most 20 pages
total.  Submission of shorter papers (from around 4 pages) is strongly
encouraged whenever appropriate.  Papers must conform to the Springer
LNCS style.  Follow the "Information for Authors" link at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Reviewers of submitted papers are not required to read the appendices
and the paper should be intelligible without them.  The paper should
start with the title, names of authors and an abstract.  The
introduction should give some background and summarize the
contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist
reader.  A preliminary version of the proceedings will be made
available to workshop participants.  Final versions are not due until
after the workshop, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their
papers based on discussions during the meeting.

Submit your papers in Postscript or PDF format.  To submit a paper,
compose a plain text email to pet2005-submissions@petworkshop.org
containing the title and abstract of the paper, the authors' names,
email and postal addresses, phone and fax numbers, and identification
of the contact author (to whom we will address all subsequent
correspondence).  Attach your submission to this email and send it.
By submitting a paper, you agree that if it is accepted, you will sign
a paper distribution agreement allowing for publication, and also that
an author of the paper will register for the workshop and present the
paper there.  Our current working agreement with Springer is that
authors will retain copyright on their own works while assigning an
exclusive 3-year distribution license to Springer.  Authors may still
post their papers on their own Web sites.  See
http://petworkshop.org/2004/paper-dist-agreement-5-04.html for the 2004
version of this agreement.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings.

Paper submissions must be received by February 7.  We acknowledge all
submissions manually by email.  If you do not receive an
acknowledgment within a few days (or one day, if you are submitting
right at the deadline), then contact the program committee chairs
directly to resolve the problem.  Notification of acceptance or
rejection will be sent to authors no later than April 4 and authors
will have the opportunity to revise for the preproceedings version by
May 6.

We also invite proposals of up to 2 pages for panel discussions or
other relevant presentations.  In your proposal, (1) describe the
nature of the presentation and why it is appropriate to the workshop,
(2) suggest a duration for the presentation (ideally between 45 and 90
minutes), (3) give brief descriptions of the presenters, and (4)
indicate which presenters have confirmed their availability for the
presentation if it is scheduled.  Otherwise, submit your proposal by
email as described above, including the designation of a contact
author.  The program committee will consider presentation proposals
along with other workshop events, and will respond by the paper
decision date with an indication of its interest in scheduling the
event.  The proceedings will contain 1-page abstracts of the
presentations that take place at the workshop.  Each contact author
for an accepted panel proposal must prepare and submit this abstract
in the Springer LNCS style by the "Camera-ready copy for
preproceedings" deadline date.
