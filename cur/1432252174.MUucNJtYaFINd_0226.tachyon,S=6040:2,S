What went wrong is that all the banks were cuddling up to the regulators 
and telling the regulators what they wanted to hear, and in particular 
and especially, Washington Mutual was doing so.

Jim Bell's denial of disservice program is the opposite of cuddling up 
to the regulators.   Banks that cuddle will be punished, but banks that 
fail to cuddle will be punished more, thus he is unlikely to get support 
for denial of disservice, unless he disguises it as some sort of public 
good program to ensure that black rapists and muggers get off.

Here is a bit of background on the illegal acts committed by Washington 
Mutual, and how JP Morgan wound up with responsibility for these illegal 
acts.  I don't know what happened with Bear Sterns.

The law required equal outcomes for blacks, hispanics, and whites.

The law also required that the banks only lend to people with income and 
savings.  However, banks that followed that law, for example the Bank of 
Beverly Hills got in trouble because they were violating the equal 
outcomes law.

To make the regulators happy, Washington Mutual lied that its customers 
had income and savings.  All the banks lied, some more than others.  The 
bigger the lies, the happier the regulators.  The biggest liars, and the 
most blessed by the regulators, were Washington Mutual and Countrywide.

In 2005 November, all the lies blew up horribly in people's faces. 
However, from 2005 to 2008, the government required a big game of 
pretend and extend, in which everyone pretended the lies were true.

And, as part of the pretense that the lies were true, even though the 
shit had already hit the fan, JP Morgan was forced to buy Washington 
Mutual even though everyone knew that Washington Mutual was a stinking 
pile of toxic assets.

JP Morgan is now being punished for the lies told by Washington Mutual.
