Is it a lie to neglect to mention that Adolf Hitler was kind
to dogs? Or that Stalin was courageous and did well in
school?  Or that there were lots of women that Jeffrey Dahmer
did not torture, kill, and eat?  It is certainly true that
all sorts of nice people had all sorts of good intentions in
Catalonia, but when they attempted to implement those good
intentions, they mostly found themselves using the old
familiar methods of recently existent socialism, and when
they did not use those methods, socialism did not work.  That
is the important truth about Catalonia, and all the other
truths, the truths that some people were sincere, the truths
that some people had good intentions, are irrelevant.   I do
mention those truths, briefly.  Unlike the sources you prefer
I do not go into lengthy spiels describing those wonderful
good intentions while ignoring the actual outcome.
