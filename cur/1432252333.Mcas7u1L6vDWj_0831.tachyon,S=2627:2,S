You didn't even read the posting did you?

That isn't what he said at all.

He said that the problem with ALL use of computers (which for this
purpose include mobile phones, car locks, smart-cards, ATMs etc. etc.)
for authentication is the binding between the person & the system that
does the authentication. It doesn't matter a dam whether you use PKC,
DES or the Great Seal of the Holy Roman Empire. If the equipment isn't
tamper-proof, or if the signer doesn't understand how the process works
or if the software isn't provably valid, there can be a problem.
