Population crash is only true for the populations that cannot 
conceive of shared abundance. We've gone from 95% of the population
working on farms to less than 1%, and with the right tools, 5% of
the population with a little AI and distributed production tools 
is more than sufficent to feed, fuel, and house the rest.

That, however, doesn't help those who won't eat because they 
believe, ever so fervently, in the doom of humanity. Which is 
fine, we just have to wait them out and contain the damage, 
possibly by sticking them in a simulation of their chosen rapture.
Who knows, maybe that will be the source of organ donors in the
next millenium.

If you insist on being slaughtered, who am I to stop you from 
walking into the blender. But I will politely point out the 
clearly labeled door number two if you can stop to see it.
