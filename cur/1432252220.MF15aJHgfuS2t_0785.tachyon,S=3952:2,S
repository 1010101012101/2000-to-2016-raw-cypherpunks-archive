Of course, the system also exposes the currency to fluctuations in world
wide supply of gold. It's not sane policy to tie one's unit of currency to
any particular good -- think about what it would mean if the chosen good
was unrefined oil, a particular crop or electrical power. One'll get the
picture fairly soon.

It's not really sane to opt for a tie-in to the supply of a particular
currency, either -- that's actually even worse, since the people printing
the bills can cause fluctuations in the exchange rate even easier than
they could if they were just digging up precious metals up from the crust.

Hence, private, floating currency, which, again, is old news on the list.
