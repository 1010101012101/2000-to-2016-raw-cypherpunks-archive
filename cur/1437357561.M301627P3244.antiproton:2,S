Traditional corporate onsite compute, storage, network, security, software (Oracle etc.) is almost always extremely expensive.  
While a raw hard drive may be inexpensive, if you buy it in an EMC or mainframe storage array, you are going to pay many 
multiples more per GB, compute minute, etc.  And, if you bought anything more than you actually use, you're being very 
wasteful.  Parts of the cloud revolution are rapid just in time purchase, deployment, change, new scalable methods, etc., but 
economically, it is often tremendously less expensive than a commercial solution plus the support staff to make it work.  In the 
most efficient traditional local deployment possible, this may not be true initially, but for the vast majority of mediocre 
corporate IT departments, it is very true.

If you are large and/or savvy enough, the thing to do is to borrow cloud system methods and run a cloud for yourself.  
Currently, that's not completely easy or turnkey.  At some point, we should get to a clean utility computing model, but it will 
take a few more generations of evolution.

The same thing we did in the old days.

Install an IBM mainframe.

The only place the 'cloud' makes sense is if you are Amazon or Google
and you want to sell your excess computing capacity to suckers who can't
afford to buy their own computers.

If you actually do capacity planning and maybe do something like apply
modern devops to mainframe platforms, you can actually get some economies=

of scale running your mainframe on-site.

It will probably cost less than what that CxO's got paid under-the-table
in a rigged altcoin pump-and-dump orchestrated by the cloud service
provider.
