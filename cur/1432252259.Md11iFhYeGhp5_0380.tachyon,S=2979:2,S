         Well, I watch a lot of DVD's, probably at least 2, sometimes 4-5 a
week. Not having a TV or VCR, I watch them on my computer, and, at least on
there, I haven't noticed any problems with skipping the ads and trailers.
You have let them start, then hit the menu icon and then play the movie. On
some, the menu also gives you the choice of playing the trailers -- seems
to be a lot of difference depending on company.
