"Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love uranium."

I forgot to mention in my last message that another prime use of DU 
is for radiation shielding. No, not an example of Simpson's Paradox 
(not O.J.). Rather, DU absorbs very well, and only gives off very 
slight amounts of radiation.

Uranium, either the ore, or the metal, or the depleted form, is 
remarkably harmless. I used to handle blocks of the stuff. One of my 
associates had some dice made out of DU...I always wanted a pair of 
these, but I never got my own set.

Ah, the years of slaving away in the thorium mines...


(A line out of a Heinlein juvenile, I vaguely recalled at the time. 
Something significant about learning about thorum, slide rules, and 
tensors from reading Heinlein novels in the 6th grade.)
