Is it too much to ask, that you include a url when you post news
articles you comment on?  I guess that would show you up when you
spoof news articles, wouldn't it?  Isn't this situation of such a
nature that those rules can be set aside, if only temporarily?

I know you are fond of saying America needs formatting, but come
on already - it's one thing if we do it ourselves, quite another
if it is done to us.
