Well, the Visor GSM phone plugin creates a relatively small increase in the
size of the visor, based on photos. I carry both a cellphone and a Palm 
constantly, and the Visor device looks less bulgy than carrying both. It
might
be helpful from that point of view.

The earlier Qualcomm PDQ phone/palmpilot is like carrying a 
brick in your pocket by comparison (I've got one in my desk - I don't use
it).

I'd use it, but the price point sucks.

Well, on the visor speech input comes through the Visor's built-in
mike, so it may be available to the processor for manipulation.
The sound output is on a speaker built into the GSM phone module,
and I kind of doubt if the data is available to a user program.

You really need to get into a funny place in the stack - below A/D
conversion, but above GSM packetization. 

I have greater hopes for doing encrypted voice-over-ip, if we want
something that 's open source and user-verifiable.
