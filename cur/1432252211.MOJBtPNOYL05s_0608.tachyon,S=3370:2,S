Yeah, that announcement just ran over the slashdot ticker. Someone posted the
following insightful link subsequently:

ftp://ftp.abit.com.tw/pub/download/fae/secureide_eng_v100.pdf

Looks like that sucker only does key-truncated version of DES called DES-40.
Right... did they say weeks? I'd say minutes, unless ABIT means [insert some
impoverished 3rd world country] government supercomputers.

It's snakeoil, move on, nothing to see here.

Cheers,
