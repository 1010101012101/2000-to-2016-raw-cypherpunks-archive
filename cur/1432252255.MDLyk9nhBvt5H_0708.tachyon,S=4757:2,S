  "After shrinks found Elledge competent, [William]
Jaquette 
[Elledge's Court Appointed Attorney] represented his
client's 
death wishes, which was difficult because of his
passionate
opposition to the death penalty.
  "Everybody in a free society, Jaquette says, has the
right 
to choose and direct his own defense."
~'Witness To An Execution,' Michael Hood
Seattle Weekly, September 6, 2001

  What a CrockOfShit!!!

  During my trial, Judge Robert Bryan forced Court
Appointed
Counsel (Gene Grantham) upon me, against my wishes,
and the
"right to choose and direct [my] own defense,"
disappeared
faster than Jalapenos screaming through a Rat's
AssHole.
  Contrary to all legal precedent, Judge Bryan decided
that
I was FitToBeTried, but not fit to represent myself,
clearing
the way for Court Appointed Counsel to refuse to mount
a
viable defense, and thus ThrowingMeToTheDogs.
  Three judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
also
declared a defendant's "right to choose and direct his
own defense" to be a LaughAbleJoke easily circumvented
on
the smallest of pretexes in the Ninth Circuit.

  Thus, Mr. Jaquette's lame excuse to having
"represented
his client as his professional ethics require" is
nothing
more than an obvious attempt to deny his own willing
complicity in the MURDER of his client.
  Would Mr. Jaquette have us believe that his ethics
are
of a higher than those of Judge Bryan and the members
of
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?  That the Judges
of
the Ninth Circuit Court can ethically refuse a
defendant
charged with merely threating someone the "right to
choose and direct his own defense," but Mr. Jaquette
cannot ethically refuse to participate in the MURDER
of a client charged with murder?

  When Mr. Jaquette stated "the death penalty makes
killers of us all," he was obviously not speaking for
the Judges of the Ninth Circuit Court, but merely for
himself.
  I find it ironic that Mr. Elledge could be
'ethically'
MURDERED by his Court Appointed Attorney, but not by
the Ninth Circuit Judges who participated in my case,
since their view is that the 'right' Mr. Jaqauette
cites to excuse his complicity in the MURDER of his
client does not exist.

  I can't help but wonder if, had Elledge chosen
hanging
instead of injection, Mr. Jaquette would not have been
one of the 'witnesses' hollering, "Jump! Jump!"

Sincerely,
Carl E. Johnson
