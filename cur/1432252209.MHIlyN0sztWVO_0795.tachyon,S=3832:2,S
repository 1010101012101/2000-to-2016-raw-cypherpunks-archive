Jeez, why waste time on such an old-hat idea?

I'm serious. The latest factoring and RC5 challenges do nothing new. 
Neither does using a bunch of machines. Been there, done that, got the 
tee-shirt.

Better that you and other programmers spend effort on exactly what this 
thread is about: putting interesting features into Morpheus, Gnutella, 
etc. Better yet, using this P2P power to do a better version of either.

But factoring challenges are old news. You're about 5 years too late 
(not that it was terribly interesting even 5 years ago...).
