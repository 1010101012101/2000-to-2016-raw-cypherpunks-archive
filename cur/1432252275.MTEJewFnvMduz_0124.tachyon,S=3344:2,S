Sirs!

We would like you to consider using/reviewing the Next Generation File Sharing tool. 

It is called Grokster and can be seen at www.Grokster.com

Grokster accesses over 400,000+ online users through the FastTrack P2P Stack.

Grokster is the latest generation of file sharing software. The Grokster generation of file sharing presents these exciting features:

* Peer-to-Peer: True person to person file searches and transfers.

* Fast Searches: Unlike Gnutella type programs, Grokster's SuperNode technology provides for very fast searches.

* Detailed Searches: The Grokster technology tracks detailed file info and allows detailed searches on it.

* No Incomplete/Failed Downloads: Grokster automatically removes incomplete  downloads.

* Auto Resume: Grokster will automatically seek out the same file from multiple sources and continue downloading until complete.

* Fastest Downloads: Grokster will download the file from multiple sources  with the fastest connections as fast as you can download, automatically.

* File Preview: Preview files as you start downloading them.

* All File Types: Share any type of file.

* Full Bandwidth Controls: Grokster allows for full contol  uploads/downloads and total bandwidth.

This is a one time email. You will receive no other emails from us.


Thank you for your time.


Cheers
