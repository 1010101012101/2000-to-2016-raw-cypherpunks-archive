   attempts of Hollywood and the music labels to curtail file-swapping
   networks while promoting sweeping new anti-copying laws and standards.

   E-mail campaigns are easily ignored, and transforming online ire into
   effective political action is hardly a trivial task.

   Geek armies have always been eager to vent in online forums and clog
   the e-mail inboxes of errant congressional types. As far back as 1995,

   Clinton administration's privacy-invasive Clipper Chip.
