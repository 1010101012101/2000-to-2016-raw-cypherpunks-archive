The reason for laying you own F2F physical network is that the
existing "internet" one is owned and monitored by entities who
have absolutely zero loyalties to, or care about, you.
Now if you link up to your neighbor, and they theirs... there is
some notion of chain of loyalty or trust or whatever there.
If it's not strong enough for you then run the logical overlay
nets on top of it. But at least remove the physical layer
that you use for "free speech / thought / sharing / markets" etc
out of the practical physical reach of "the man"... he has no business
there, and you are giving him too much insight / control of you by
using the internet instead of whatever you build within your
own physical meshes. And to reach between cities you could
even use some of your split horizon subscriptions to the "internet" to
terminate a bunch of VPN's across and between them as link aggregation.
