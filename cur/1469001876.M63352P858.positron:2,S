What's your evidence for that? I doubt that it's technical, from what
you've shared. So it sounds like just an assumption.

That's the fallacy about backdoors ;)

So are you arguing that well-designed backdoors are OK? Or are you just
arguing that US military are dumb enough to think so. That they're so
confident about their superior capabilities?

Let's assume, hypothetically, that Tor is secure for everyone. And let's
acknowledge that US military uses it for evil.

If that were so, would you use and recommend Tor?

Or would you reject it, because it's used for evil?
