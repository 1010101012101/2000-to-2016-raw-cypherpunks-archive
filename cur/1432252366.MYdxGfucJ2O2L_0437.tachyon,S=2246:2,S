Content-Type: text/plain

What if you eliminated the anonymity of caller to receiver, and only
tried to achieve traffic analysis resistance.  That is, a receiver can
find out who is calling him, but if the caller and receiver are honest
and desire privacy, a third party cannot find out they are communicating.

Does this allow for a more efficient design?  Can the intermediate switch
nodes now handle delays by inserting dummy traffic, which can only be
recognized as such by the other end (caller or receiver)?
