You don't actually think that Folks Who Care use interesting keywords,
do you?
You *at least* use codebooks.  As Dr. Teller wrote, "its a boy".

Correct.   The text-stego channel is *much* more subtle.  In fact, it
doesn't even require
the recent perceptual-linguistic fnidnig, fascinating as it may be.

Only some stego binary codes that are translated after recovery, so

Folks, you 1. compress 2. encrypt 3. stego, in that order.  You probably
use
an ECC in between 2 & 3; this is vital if Mallory messes with
your spelling [1].  You probably also add misspelling "chaff" just to
make it
harder for the adversary to undo the stego.  (E.g., you're using a keyed

PRNG to determine which words to misspell.  So you misspell others too.
You use your choice of misspellings to encode the cargo.  Maybe have
multiple
misspellings map to 0 or 1.)

Note that its harder to do this in Hebrew, since it has a higher
bit:symbol ratio, thanks to vwl drppng.

The notion of using "bmob" or "hroien" in a message to avoid keyword
nets is just *comical*.  (Note that ammo, beer, and weed cannot be
stego'd this way :-)

Note that these newfangled blog thingss are very good broadcasting (ie,
traffic-analysis resistant)
media, assuming you write something interesting enough to have a
nontrivial audience.  So, more traditionally, are posts to usenet or
lists like this.
