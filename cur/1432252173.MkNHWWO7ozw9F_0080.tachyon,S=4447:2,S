Corporations are people.

If you grant lesser rights to corporations than to natural people, then 
the state can, and will, make corporations fire anyone suspected of 
thinking politically incorrect thoughts.

Turned on the news last night, they were interviewing some silicon 
valley people, and the interviewer asked about how corporations viewed 
this and that.  One of the interviewees replied "I am a corporation". 
He complained that he was subject to secret orders by a secret court, 
which lawless orders he could not tell anyone about, that he himself was 
being spied upon, that as well as being required to turn over 
information officially, his information was being stolen unofficially, 
and that foreign customers had (correctly) come to distrust him.

A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree 
together to act as one.

In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective 
assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one 
of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people 
agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people 
agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.
