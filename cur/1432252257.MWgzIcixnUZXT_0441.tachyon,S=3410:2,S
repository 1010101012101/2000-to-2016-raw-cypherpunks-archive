And if we place food on the market, we no longer have a 
guarantee that anyone will be able to eat  :-)

Observer that in the real world, food and clothing is 
provided by the market, and no one goes hungry or naked, but 
school and protection is provided by the government, which 
theoretically spends the same money protecting and educating 
the poor as the rich, and many people are not educated or 
protected.

In America today many do not get an education.  In North 
Korea today many do not get to eat.  That is because in 
America, the state guarantees education, in North Korea, it 
guarantees food.   If the state guaranteed sand for all in
the sahara, there would soon be sand shortage.
