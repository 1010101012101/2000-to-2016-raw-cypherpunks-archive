Well, there are the following options:

      * John plays at level 0: he is insane
      * John plays at level 1: he is sane, pretending to be insane, and
        we are deceived by this (in this world, you play at level 2,
        Greg)

But it's also possible for a mask to lie beneath the mask, for him to be
insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane. And so on and so
forth all the way down the rabbit hole.

I'm sure if we asked him what level he played at, he'd only respond "one
level higher than you." 

It's definitely a great show.
