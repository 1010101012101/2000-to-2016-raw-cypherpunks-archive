Common terms used in computer security:
-Virus: A program that replicates itself across a network, or the Internet 
as a whole. The virus payload may be destructive, like deleting files, or 
it could simply try to overwhelm a network by copying itself.
-Worm: A virus that replicates itself without human intervention. If the 
victim has to open an e-mail attachment to get infected, it's a virus. But 
if it scans for new victims and attacks by itself, it's a worm.
-Trojan horse: A program that doesn't necessarily replicate itself, but 
like the legendary wooden horse is much more than it appears. A Trojan 
horse program might look like a game, but instead it steals your personal 
information and sends it to a criminal.
-Password sniffer: A file that seeks out passwords on your computer, then 
sends them to a hacker. A keylogger can also grab anything typed on the 
keyboard.
-Blended threat: A program that combines the characteristics of viruses, 
worms and Trojan horses. A blended threat, like the recent Nimda outbreak, 
is a recent phenomenon.
-Exploit: A program that takes advantage of a security hole in a computer 
program, like Microsoft Windows or AOL Instant Messenger.
-Spyware: A general term for a program that surreptitiously monitors your 
actions. While they are sometimes sinister, like a remote control program 
used by a hacker, software companies have been known to use spyware to 
gather data about customers. The practice is generally frowned upon.
These are all good as long as they have Federal Bureau of Investigation 
approval like the magic lantern.
