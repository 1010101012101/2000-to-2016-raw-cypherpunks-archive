SHEESH!  Are these anti-secure-crypto advocates REALLY that 
INCREDIBLY stupid and naive?!

The thing that continues to drive me bonkers about this kind of 
simplistic crap is that pretends aht Trade Center bombers, 
international terrorists, child molesters and murders will stop using 
globally-available strong crypto just because a law prohibits it, or 
give up ("escrow") their crypto keys just because a law requires it!

EVERY time we circulate yet-another idiot's message like this -- 
calling for limits on secure crypto or forced key escrow -- ALL of us 
NEED to attach a head-note pointing out that terrorists et al, are 
HARDLY likely to obey that law ... that instead, it will ONLY be 
law-abiding businesses and citizens who will LOOSE the ability to 
protect their sensitive corporate and personal communications (*and* 
files!) from competitors, foreign spies, and nosy voyeurs.
