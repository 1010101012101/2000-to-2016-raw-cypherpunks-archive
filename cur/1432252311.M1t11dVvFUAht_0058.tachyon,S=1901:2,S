300Mbits (using Eugen's quote), is 2xOC-3.  (OC-3 carries 155Mbit/sec ATM,
but if it's IP/PPP/OC-3 you use more of the 155Mbits/sec).

A couple of hacked university zombie armies can generate that kind of
traffic.  I'm *not* a telecom guy, but don't most U's have at least an OC-3
out to the backbones today?

I'm surprised that the target node has that much INBOUND bandwidth, quite
frankly.
