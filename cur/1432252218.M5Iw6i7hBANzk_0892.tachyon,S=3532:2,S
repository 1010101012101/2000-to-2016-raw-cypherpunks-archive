At least as "helpful" as most of the other crap here.

One man's signal is another man's noise.

I think I can make my own decisions as to who I killfile, and whom I 
consider a troll.  I've known James a very long time now (early-mid '90s 
IIRC), and in my opinion he may have non-sensical beliefs on some things, 
but, he is most certainly NOT a troll: He comes by his beliefs and 
arguments honestly as far as I can tell.  That may make him misinformed, 
or possibly worse, but he's certainly no troll.

"We" don't have to accept *anything* except our own *personal* beliefs!  I 
will not participate in mob tactics such as having some loner (you or 
anyone else) "suggest" that "we" follow any particular course of action.  

If you believe that Jim or anyone else is non-productive (???), you are 
free to add them to YOUR killfile.  But for you to try and influence 
others to follow your personal world view makes *you* the defacto troll 
here.
