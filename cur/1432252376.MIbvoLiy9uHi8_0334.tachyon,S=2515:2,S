Attempting to obtain information from primary sources, I have been trying to
track down a bin Laden or al Qaeda website without any success. Does anybody
on this list have a URL?

I suspect that Afghanistan may not recognize US and EU blind signature
patents and thus would be suitable as a jurisdiction to distribute ecash
client software to help bypass the unconstitutional ban on American citizens
assisting the courageous warriors of Allah in their just fight.
