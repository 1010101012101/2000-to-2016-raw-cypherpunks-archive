it is the problem of analysis: focus on the person who takes a gun
and shoots people, not on the pills they were prescribe, the failed
institutions surrounding them, etc. too simplistic, inaccurate model
does not distinguish symptoms from disease, allows it to continue

(lose accurate, empirical logical reasoning, no way to address this,
thus loss of language, no matter encrypted comms, this situation;
because it cannot be modeled or related to in realistic framework,
and thus short-circuits into power games and political engineering,
which is inherently violent and leads to those terms of resolution)
