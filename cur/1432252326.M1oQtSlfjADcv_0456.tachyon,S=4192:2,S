A sensible strategy is to set one up, stay small
(micropayments) until the momentum starts building, then move
to some place that still permits bearer bonds -- Antigua or
Nauru.

If they try to close you down in the micropayment stage, the
judge, being unfamiliar with crypto anarchist theory, is
likely to microfine you.  The law is not concerned with
trifles.
