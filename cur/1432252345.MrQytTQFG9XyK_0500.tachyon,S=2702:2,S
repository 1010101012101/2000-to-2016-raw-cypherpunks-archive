Handbook of Applied Cryptography 
Posted by michael on Wednesday September 11, @12:24PM

cconnell writes "The Handbook of Applied Cryptography is now available 
free (for personal use) on the Internet. This is a $100 book. Note also 
the companion C source code for most of the crypto algorithms, written by 
James Pate Williams. There is some very cool code here!"
