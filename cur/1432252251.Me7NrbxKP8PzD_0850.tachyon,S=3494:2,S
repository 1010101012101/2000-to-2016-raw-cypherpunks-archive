The Whig Party's platform was called, by Clay, the American System.  Today 
we call it mercantilism.  The Whigs pushed their internal improvements 
agenda (building unneeded and/or grossly overpriced roads, bridges or 
canals supplied by political contributors) across all the states in the 
early 1800s.  Everywhere it was a disaster bankrupting several.  So much so 
that by 1850 all state constitutions banned internal improvement 
activities.  This was the downfall of the Whigs, but many of its leaders 
resurfaced in the Republican party whose first presidential candidate was 
Lincoln.
