Why, in (egyption) situations like this, would you want location data 
embedded in your addressing scheme ?

It seems like one would do hard work to ensure such encapsulation was NOT 
happening...

Or is this just a scheme for fair and reasonable address allocation in an 
anarchy to avoid collisions ?
