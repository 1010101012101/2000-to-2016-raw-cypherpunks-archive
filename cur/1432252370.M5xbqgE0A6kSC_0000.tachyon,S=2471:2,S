It has long been said that obscurity is not security (except
that in modest doses it is).  At the same time, obscurity most
assuredly *is* a species of privacy.  In other words, the
quotation above has it exactly backwards.

In the meantime, everyone on this list is above world median
income (USD 1,225 per annum) and almost everyone is in the
world's 1% (USD 34,000 per annum).  I commend Branko Milanovic's
_The Haves and the Have Nots_ to your reading in that regard.
