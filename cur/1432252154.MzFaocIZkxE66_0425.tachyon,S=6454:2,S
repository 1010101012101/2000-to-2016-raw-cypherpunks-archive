   Workshop on Data Surveillance and Privacy Protection

   Saturday, June 3, 2006
   Harvard University


   On June 3, 2006 Harvard University's Center for Research on
   Computation and Society will hold a day-long workshop on Data
   Surveillance and Privacy Protection.

   Data Surveillance is quickly moving from the world of research to the
   world of practice. While the media is preoccupied with NSA wiretaps
   and the accidental release of names and social security numbers,
   information is increasingly being collected, correlated and data-
   mined for use by law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and commercial
   marketers.

   Although there has been significant public attention to the civil
   liberties issues of data surveillance over the past few years, there
   has been little discussion of the actual techniques that could be
   employed in any but the most restricted settings. Likewise, there has
   been little discussion of methods and technologies for conducting
   data surveillance while respecting privacy and preserving civil
   liberties.

   Keynote speaker:

   Bob Popp, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Aptima, Inc., and
   formerly Deputy of the Information Awareness Office and Total
   Information Awareness (TIA) program, Defense Advanced Research
   Projects Agency (DARPA).
   "A Vision for Countering Terrorism Through Information and Privacy
