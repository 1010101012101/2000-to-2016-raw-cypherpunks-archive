The US government is re-visiting the beaten path of behaviour control, by incriminating genital actions and instilling fear in its subjects - whenever you get an erection or get wet, you may be doing something illegal, so to cure the guilt after a nice orgasm pay taxes, turn in your neighbour and participate in polls.

This works very well. Most sheeple will automagically condemn "child porn" (that is recording visible-light illuminated genitals of humans of various ages below government-sanctioned limit and displaying them.) US Government owns the copyright to penises and vaginas of all its subjects and will diligently pursue all infringements.

No such thing as fair use here.

The copyright is enforced by exploiting sex-guilt brainwashing deeply embedded into american sheeple and combining in with "for the children" scam that has developed nicely in recent decades.

The only way to combat this is to refuse the premise. The moment you agree that "child porn is bad" you have co-opted into the scam. Until you are able to say and act on the premise that "child genital display and sex" is OK you will be fucked, and your progeny as well. Very few can do this, and the government knows it. And you will continue to be fucked.

You deserve it.

For a long time I thought that "stupid americans" is just another generalisation. But now I begin to suspect that there is something genetic about it. Something in the food or in the air.
