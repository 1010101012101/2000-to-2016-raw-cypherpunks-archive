Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I have heard of it. I'd even use it for
more than attempting to read .docs, if I didn't find vim to be superior
for just about everything I do with text.

OO even parses some documents well, most of the time. Which is of course
not good enough.

When you're dealing with folks that edit, re-edit, pass around, turn on
revision tracking, fast save, pass the document around some more, turn
off revision tracking, and then email you the file, It chokes. Hard.

As Bill said, input formats are not output formats.
