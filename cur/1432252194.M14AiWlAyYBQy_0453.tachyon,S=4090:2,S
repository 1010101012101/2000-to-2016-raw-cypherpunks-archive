They rarely just dismiss a case...that redounds negatively on the 
government's side (and the judge would not be paranoid in thinking 
that one of the many covert ops ninjas might make a car bomb 
mysteriously appear under his seat one fine morning).

Lee had no power. He was being held in solitary confinement, in 
shackles at times. The government held all the cards, though there 
hand was falling apart as time passed. They wrote the plea agreement, 
Lee signed it, the judge then accepted it.

Again, this was all covered ad nauseum in the articles.
