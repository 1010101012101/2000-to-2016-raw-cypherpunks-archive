I was surprised to see that the EFF listed ADCs as endangered tech.
Because
the hollywood nazis regard (and damn rightly so) the analog hole as
real.  That a fairly stead
organization as EFF would regard the desparate death-sounds of hollywood

as a serious threat to such basic tech was astounding.

I've had cross-compiled code (for the MMC2107) identified as a virus
(and
therefore erased) by an antivirus program on a PC.  This only lost an
hour or two of work.
Imagine that your medical measurements, or kids'
performances, happen to match an ADC's copy protection codes.

Imagine that all your silicon belongs to us, us=hollywood=congress.

Imagine that all your printing presses belong to the State, for the
protection of
the commercial merde.
