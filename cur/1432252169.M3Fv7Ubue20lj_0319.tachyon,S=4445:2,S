Anyone who doesn't wish to use Microsoft operating systems is perfectly 
free to use the Macintosh OS, as I do, or one of the many flavors or 
Linux, or one of the three flavors of BSD, or to buy a machine running 
Solaris, or AmigaDOS, or whatever.

The fact that most of the sheeple pick Windows is not a criminal act by 
Microsoft.

I happen to know a _lot_ about Intel, for historical reasons, and I can 
tell you that Intel is in a vastly stronger "monopoly position" than 
Microsoft is. Lots of reasons. I can write a short article explaining 
why if there's sufficient real interest.

Do I argue that Intel should be sanctioned? Far from it. In fact, I 
argue that anyone who tries to interfere in Intel's ability to sell 
products has earned killing.

Nonsense.
