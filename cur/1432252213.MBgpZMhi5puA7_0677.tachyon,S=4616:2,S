i see your point.  by 'targeted' in my comment, i meant looking for
transmissions from a particular person.  i suppose 'targeted' could also
mean looking at messages sent to a particular destination.

my specific comment is simply that I don't believe that either the
competency or the computing power necessary to watch every financial
transaction ($16T/day), fax, e-mail, phone call, ssl connection, etc. exists
in the areas we might think it exists.  whereas i do believe it's feasible
to track traffic to/from servers (and other destinations/data origins).

Regularly intercepting POTUS' international email is hardly
"untargeted".  I figure that's probably a fairly routine, if
small, part of Echelon.

POTUS = "President Of The United States" for all who aren't
up on spook jargon.
