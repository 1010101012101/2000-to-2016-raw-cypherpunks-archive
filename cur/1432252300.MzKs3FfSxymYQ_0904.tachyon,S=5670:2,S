The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparably sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
s|ightly, you wi|l sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
