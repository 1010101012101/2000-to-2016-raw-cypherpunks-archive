It would be a shame to solve all the practical problems and only then 
discover that your architecture is wrong. :-) That's why I think people 
are interested in doing thought experiments first. (OTOH, it's kind of 
pointless to discover the right architecture if you'll never have the 
resources to implement it right.)

Personally, the TFS paper convinced me to give up on P2P storage until 
we get FTTH. http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/TFS.pdf
