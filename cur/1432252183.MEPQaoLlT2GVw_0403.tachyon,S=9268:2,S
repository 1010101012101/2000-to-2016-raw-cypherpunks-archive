[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Seth Finkelstein is to be congratulated. 
I've probably traded thousands of messages with him over the years, 
sometimes pugnaciously, but Seth has worked doggedly and effectively 
against filtering [censorware] software blacklists that ban free 
access to information.  Seth's an extremely bright fellow with 
degrees from MIT and was a finalist during his high school years for 
White-Westinghouse's National Science Fair.  Again, let me publicly 
thank Seth for all of his hard work.- ]

Electronic Frontier Foundation Press Release March 5, 2001

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

    Monday March 5th, 2001

    ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION (EFF) PIONEER AWARDS HONOR INTERNET
    LUMINARIES

    Ennis, Finkelstein, and Perrin Presented Awards at EFF's Tenth Annual
    Pioneer Awards Ceremony

    Contact: Katina Bishop, Electronic Frontier Foundation
    (415) 436-9333 ext. 101 or
    (617) 492-1234 - during CFP from 3/5 - 3/9

    Monday, March 5, 2001, Boston, MA -- The ceremony for EFF's Tenth
    Annual Pioneer Awards will take place at the New England Aquarium on
    March 8, 2001, in conjunction with the Computers, Freedom and Privacy
    conference this week in Cambridge, MA. The online civil liberties
    group chose to honor Bruce Ennis, in appreciation of his lifelong
    commitment to the legal defense of free expression and the First
    Amendment; Seth Finkelstein, for his dedication to raising the level
    of public awareness about the dangers to free expression posed by
    Internet content blocking and labeling systems; and Stephanie Perrin,
    for her instrumental and long-term role in advancing understanding and
    protection of privacy internationally and in her home country of
    Canada.

    Since 1991, the EFF Pioneer Awards have recognized individuals who
    have made significant and influential contributions to the development
    of computer-mediated communications or to the empowerment of
    individuals in using computers and the Internet.

    Bruce Ennis - Described by the legal press as one of the most
    influential attorneys in the country, Bruce Ennis devoted much of his
    life and practice to defending intellecual freedom. Bruce argued many
    crucial First Amendment cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and lower
    courts, including the landmark free speech victory in ACLU v. Reno
    (the "Communications Decency Act" case). Sadly, Ennis passed away
    earlier this year, but his contributions to free expression on the
    Internet live on but his contributions to free expression and press in
    the Internet, news reporting, political and other spheres live on.

    Seth Finkelstein - Anti-censorship activist and programmer Seth
    Finkelstein spent hundreds of unpaid and uncredited hours over several
    years to decrypt and expose to public scrutiny the secret contents of
    the most popular censorware blacklists. Seth has been active in
    raising the level of public awareness about the dangers that Internet
    content blocking software and rating/labeling schemes pose to freedom
    of communication. His work has armed many with information of great
    assistance in the fight against government mandated use of these
    systems.

    Stephanie Perrin - internationally recognized privacy and freedom of
    information expert Perrin spent 5 years engineering Canada's inspiring
    new privacy law (PIPEDA), among 15 years of important privacy and
    cryptography policy work, and has bridged the government, nonprofit
    and commercial sectors in privacy technology, policy, standards and
    education. Perrin has also been involved in privacy protection issues
    at the global scale, on the OECD Security and Privacy Committee, and
    made signifcant contributions to understanding technical privacy
    protection issues.

    "We, as a community of people respecting rights in technology, do not
    take enough opportunity to honor our own," stated Shari Steele,
    Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Bruce,
    Stephanie and Seth are shining examples of the spirit and energy that
    makes good things happen. We're proud to present them with this year's
    Pioneer Awards."

    The judges for this year's EFF Pioneer Awards were: Herb Brody (Senior
    Editor, Technology Review) Whitfield Diffie (Distinguished Engineer,
    Sun Microsystems) Moira Gunn (Host, "Tech Nation", National Public
    Radio) Donna L. Hoffman (Associate Professor of Management, Vanderbilt
    University) Peter G. Neumann (Principal Scientist, SRI Intl.;
    Moderator, ACM Risks Forum) Drazen Pantic (Media & Tech. Director, NYU
    Center for War, Peace, & the News Media) Barbara Simons (past
    President, Association for Computing Machinery, & U.C. Berkeley
    Distinguished Alumnus) Karen G. Schneider (Technical Director,
    Shenendehowa Public Library, NY)

    The Tenth Annual EFF Pioneer Awards ceremony will be held on the
    evening of March 8th, 2001, at the New England Aquarium. The ceremony
    and reception are made possible by contributions from Guardent,
