My comment was basically a musing, but nonetheless technically since it is a crime 
to reveal that the feds have gotten information, it would seem that declaring that they 
have not provided information is in itself a declaration about fed activity and so 
covered.

You are right, that librarians are upset. However the situation is such that librarians 
have been specifically warned that if they call the ALA about such a visit, they cannot 
say anything in their conversation that they are calling in regards to such a request. 
The most they are allowed to say in such phone conversations is that they would like 
to talk to a lawyer.

This is a very bad precedent.
