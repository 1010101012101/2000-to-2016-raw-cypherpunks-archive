Well, this is probably a lot better than nothing, particularly for a young 
person.

But for someone older I would suggest that this is, to some extent, a dodge.

Why? Because who is it you are pledging TO? The notion of the Pledge of 
Alleigiance as we know it is a public proclamation of one's affinities. And 
in this case, if no one in authority can make out that certain portions of 
the Pledge are not being stated, then I would argue that not stating them is 
almost as good as useless. It's kind of like a kid crossing his fingers 
behind his back while telling a promise, to negate the "lie" of the promise.
