I dunno...seems like the man had his priorities straight, at 
least....imagine bonin Marilyn Monroe high to the gills on painkillers and 
speed...come ON, gotta love the guy.

Funny, though, how the American public idolizes and fetishizes that 
guy...George W would have slaughtered "commie" JFK in the last couple of 
elections. It seems we can't get enough of star-spangled myths.

Anyone seen "Born on the 4th Of July"? The opening scene of a pastel 
American flag waving in the breeze is absolutely brilliant, given the rest 
of the film (I'm thinking this is John Young's favorite film!)
