No, it's more like the US in ~1870 or 1890 - the big neighboring territory
had pretty much been conquered, though a lot of them still spoke Spanish,
and the other big neighboring territory had been reconquered,
but a lot of larger minority ethnic groups like the Navajo hadn't been
totally wiped out, though the smaller tribes were gradually getting
killed off or having their land stolen and getting forced onto smaller
reservations and having US military forts put in the middle to govern them
(which was bad) or whatever the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent out to
"help" them and "civilize" them (which was ultimately more devastating),
and there was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the local economy
(there's no real equivalent to killing off the buffalo,
but periodically "taxing" all their livestock is sort of similar.)
