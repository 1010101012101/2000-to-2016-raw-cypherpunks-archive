   And the Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes ....
   By [32]Paul Rosenzweig

   For quite some time, it has been apparent that the announcement of the
   [33]NIST Cybersecurity Framework would be a seminal event.  Though
   couched as a voluntary program, many expected that [34]the Framework
   would become the de facto ground for liability.  After all, if the
   National Institute for Standards and Technology has determined a
   baseline framework for optimal security in the cyber domain, [35]what
   could be more negligent than failing to meet that minimum standard?

   Unsurprisingly, the penny has begun to drop.  Not, as one might have
   expected, in private sector tort suits, but in public sector regulatory
   action.  Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission[36]
   announced its intention to conduct an examination of the cybersecurity
   of 50 broker-dealers and investment advisers subject to its
   jurisdiction.  The [37]questionnaire derives much of its content from
   the NIST Framework--so now the Framework will be the likely potential
   ground for regulatory action.

   How ironic then, that in the same week, [38]the GAO issued a report
   critical of the SEC for its own [39]lack of adequate cybersecurity and
   oversight.  Perhaps the cobbler's children don't have any shoes ....
