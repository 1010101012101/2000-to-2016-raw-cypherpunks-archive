Earlier, in fact. The phrase "tragedy of the commons" derives from 
nobel-prize-winning research that found that unregulated commons more 
often than not are abused to the point of collapse. It's hard to see how 
this can happen to a source-code commons, but only as far as you see the 
"commons" in source code being the code itself, rather than the free 
labour it represents on the part of well-meaning programmers.

By propping up proprietary shitware with your lovingly crafted code, you 
are undermining not only yourself, but the others out there lovingly 
crafting and then freeing their code. Of course, the shitware doesn't 
develop as quickly as the "real" curated stuff, so we see Linux thriving 
in so many ways technically versus Windows and Mac..but then, the lack 
of protections against theft of the commons is the reason Mac is doing 
so well in the first place. Where'd they get that Kernel again? Hmm.
