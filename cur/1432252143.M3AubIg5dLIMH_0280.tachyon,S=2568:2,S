Reason has improved mightily after Nick Gillespie took over from Postrel as 
editor. After the Cathy Young statement I raised holy hell with Reason and to 
their credit both David Nott (President, Reason Foundation) and Mike Alissi 
(Publisher) both wrote me and promised, which they delivered, pro encryption 
articles.

Around ten years ago I had a heated argument with one of the deep pocketed 
Trustees of the Reason Foundation about what I considered the magazine's 
divergence from libertarian thought. He basically said that if the magazine went into 
a more overtly libertarian direction, they'd lose subscribers-  I thought 
then that was bs, and even let my subscription lapse.  I resubscribed a couple of 
years ago and have found the magazine much improved.
