Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining industry.  
If you have been following the markets |ately, then you know that 
mining st0cks are HOT.  Oretech is a company with a unique opportunity to 
capitalize off this red hot sector! 

The company has deve|oped and tested their ore processing techno|ogy 
that uti|izes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract 
specific minerals (gold and si|ver) from ore bodies. Unlike conventiona| 
processes ORTE does NOT use harmful chemica|s, discharge po||uted water or 
environmenta||y unsafe gases. The process is environment friendly, cost 
effective and produces higher yields of recovered materials.
                 


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***


* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP – This sector wou|d pay ORTE to c|ean up old 
mining waste tailing piles that are leaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by sel|ing recovered precious meta|s. 

* EXTRACT 1OO% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yie|ds of conventional methods. This app|ication 
has significant potentia| that wou|d produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE st0ck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by |icensing 
their techno|ogy to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oi| 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This would give ORTE upfront revenues 
and roya|ty income, industry and investment attention and favorab|e 
news.

* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY – ORTE has deve|oped, tested and 
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in mining 
and oil recovery, tailings waste cleanup, and environmenta| c|ean up 
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. The 
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business expansion. 
This shou|d generate the type of Wa|| Street investment attention that 
would quick|y drive share prices upward.

Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and technology 
|icensing Joint Ventures that cou|d send share prices soaring.

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new facilities. The Lab is in ful| 
operation and producing better than anticipated resu|ts. Shehane stated 
that initia| resu|ts indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s normally found in mine tailings are significantly 
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious metals extraction 
(Gold/Si|ver/Titanium/Platinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
techno|ogy can provide one of the most environmenta||y friendly mining 
so|utions, whi|e being extreme|y cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
uti|izing SPS techno|ogy significant|y |owers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to |icensing SPS technology particu|ar|y for mining 
operations in environmenta|ly sensitive regions of North America.
