Actually, I think you were right the first time.  We may feel 
symapthy for the malum prohibido convicts and contempt for
the in se ones,  but odds are pretty good that a convict
of either catgeory is likely to be complicit in his own convition.
In fact, small quantity non violent drug offenders are probably
among the most likely to fall for the "we'll go easier on
you if we cooperate" line.
