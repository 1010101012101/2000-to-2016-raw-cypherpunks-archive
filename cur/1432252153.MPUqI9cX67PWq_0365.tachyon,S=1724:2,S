Freedom is the ability to conduct ones affairs, and pursue ones goals,
without interference from government.

Democracy is the right of the government to impose the will of 51% of your
neighbors on you by force every time the neighbors don't like what you are
doing.

I am constantly surprised and amazed that there are people on this list
who think democracy and freedom are the same thing.

The ideal government is dictatorship, under the ideal dictator.
