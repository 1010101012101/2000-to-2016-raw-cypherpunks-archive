'Twas meant for the list, I just hit "reply" instead of "reply all" without
looking. 


@lne.com and @minder.net don't set a Reply-To: header, but @einstein.ssz.com
does. I don't get any mail from other nodes, if there are any.

So some list mail needs a "reply" to get to the list, and some needs a
"reply to". 

Personally I prefer to hit "reply", ie with a Reply-To: header set to the
list (confusing, eg!). That way, if I want to reply to the list (which is my
default preference) then the sender of the mail I'm replying to doesn't get
two copies. But then I use OE...

Perhaps @lne.com and @minder.net could do this? Or, if people prefer,
@einstein.ssz.com could stop setting the Reply-To: header?


Or would having all the nodes do it the same way be too conventional for
cypherpunks...
