Everything you ever wanted to know about CPRM, but ZDNet wouldn't tell you...

<SNIP>

11. Won't an encrypted file system, or a virtual file system bypass CPRM?

Of course it will. In any operating system, device driver authors are free to reject the CPRM calls made by a software application.
So the OS need not store CPRM digital media. Virtual file systems simply add another rejection point at which CRPM can be bounced
off the system, and you're clean. With a software libre operating system (a BSD, Linux or AtheOS) let's assume that this is more
likely to happen than with a commercial operating system (Windows, MacOS, Solaris). 

But what then? We hear a GNU...
