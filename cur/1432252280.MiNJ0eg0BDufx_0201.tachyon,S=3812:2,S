I have no problem being characterized as an "advocate."

(Just today there was discussion on CNN about how technical papers on 
cloning may need to be restricted. More forbidden knowledge. Cf. 
discussions in 1992 on medical information data havens. In the words of 
the Big Brother fan we heard from recently, "The government should 
certainly follow and monitor anyone who buys books on cloning.")
