"John Wehrung"<jwehrung@tidewaterinc.com>  and SirCam volunteered to
this list
the script of an advert *against opening comm monopolies to others*,
excerpted below.

JW, your "communication network" was built using the State's Eminent
Domain
'powers'.  Therefore the historical monopoly company must open its
racks to whoever wants to hook up.  Buy a clue.

Extracted Script:

Attached are two scripts currently in
production and a New script idea for a :60 second TV spot.  Please let
me know what you think.  Thanks!               IN ENGLISH & SPANISH--
The
following :30 second Spot is being cut in English & Spanish by the
Univision folks sometime before tomorrow @ noon.

“Imagine Government Taking your Car.   Sound Ridiculous?” :05:23 SECONDS
OR
LESS      [Pause HASTA LAVISTA FRED] TIME:05 Seconds      “The County
is considering Internet regulation,    Which forces one company to hand
over its    communication network to competitors”       It’s a bad
idea that government just shouldn’t do. :10:23 SECONDS OR
LESS                                                   NEW RADIO :60
Second in English
& Spanish-- This spot has been cut in English and a cassette will be
here tomorrow.  The Spanish version will be cut also sometime tomorrow
and be available for us Wednesday.         Imagine if you had a company
that gave people a product they liked at a price they could
afford.      You invest your time and money.  Your company creates jobs
& helps the economy.  That’s what American Free Enterprise is all
about.      But what if the government forced you to surrender your
business to your competition, so your competitors could make and sell
their products at your company.  Would that be fair?  Of course
not.      But local Government is talking about taking one Companies’
communication network and handing it over to competitors.      It’s
called the Open access plan & it’s a bad idea that will slow down
high speed internet access and will raise prices.      Call the
Miami-Dade County commission today @ 305/375-5124…375-5124 and tell
them the Open Access plan is a bad idea that Government Just
shouldn’t do.      This message is brought to you by Florida Fast Net
Now, committed to keeping government toll booths and roadblocks off
the Information Super
Highway.
This is a
BRAND NEW :60 Second Spot for TV that incorporates all changes up to
date.      CAR SCENARIO--#19 TUESDAY 9/28—11:30AM   :60 SECOND TV

Would that be fair?…Of course not.      :05--HASTA LA VISTA
FRED      :10--But the County Commission is being    lobbied on an
Internet Regulation that    would force one company to hand over its
INTERNET TAKE OVER IS UNFAIR    communication network to
