That is true, but it is also predictable. Popular journalism follows
cycles: Shock, horror, glorify the leader, ask when the bombing's
going to start, demand to know when the bombing's going to end, and so
on. If it weren't for the anthrax attack the media may not be as harsh
on Bush, but because of the administration's apparent incompetence in
that area, expect to see more of this soon.
