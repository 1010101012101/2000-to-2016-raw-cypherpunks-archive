Actually, that's an interesting point. Let's first of all remember that 
Gilmore was allowed onto the plane in the first place, so airport security 
didn't care or notice. And it doesn't seem that onboard Gilmore was causing 
a ruckus or creating the sense of insecurity. And I'm willing to bet that 
none of the staff actually felt/believed that the guy was a threat (let's 
assume they have the right to remove somebody that perceived to be a 
threat). So clearly this was punitive.

No don't get me wrong, I would have thought the guy was a little bit of dick 
for "spooking the straights", and I would have been tempted (note the word 
tempted) to punch that button off of him so we didn't have to turn around.

But it sounds like a rehash of the mall incident...had he walked onto the 
flight with a button that said "I support our troops", he wouldn't have been 
thrown off. Thus everyone has become a kind of thought cop....but what 
they're enforcing is not the collective perceived reality, but what most 
people believe the collective perceived reality is supposed to be. There're 
cracks already though, and the fact that NY Times ran that photo on the 
front page the other day means a lot, actually...
