I think that's what boils down to the "bottom line".  Because there are
so many units in place that can do the bypass, there will be enough time
to create a backlash.  There's already a backlash on "protected" CD's,
mostly by consumers who can't play them on older CD players.  It's just
not gonna fly with the public, so that may be all it takes to stomp
hollywood on this one.  Time will tell I guess.

Patience, persistence, truth,
