OK OK I acknowledge this was cheesy. Thought it was worth a mention, if for 
no other reason then to kick the crap out of it.

BUT, true to my "Local Authorities" rant these days, it MIGHT snag a local 
MwG in your area, if not NSA. (My assumption continues to be that NSA and 
that echelon of extra spooky spooks doesnt share info with local 
authorities.) And frankly, unless youre actually WOMD-type dangerous, the 
state police or whatever are going to be what you have to worry about, if 
you are the identifiable Cordian type.
