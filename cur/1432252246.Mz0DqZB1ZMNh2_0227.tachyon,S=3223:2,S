Korea. Yes. Korea.

Hell, the entire Cold War, John. Including your beloved Viet Nam, which was
a *battle*, not a war in same. When Castro, and North Korea, etc., finally
fall, then the cold war will be over. Heck, when China's current
gerontocracy dies off and has an *election*, the war will be over. They're
already starting to have private property. So much for "communal"
ownership. Once property is completely transferrable, the last nail will be
in the coffin.

Just because, like some ancient techtonic seafloor, your political compass
ossified in the general direction of Moscow, ca 1965, doesn't mean that the
magnetic pole's there anymore, John. Heck, that pole's actually flipped
polarity, last time I looked.

The current war against western civilization started in the 1920's, when
Qutb started writing his Moslem triumphalist blather in reaction to the
complete collapse of the Turkish Caliphate in the wake of World War I.
It'll be finished when the residents of its modern equivalent has property
rights and personal freedom.

As for the the article that started this thread, I'm merely pointing out
that we're entering a period of *Republican* triumphalism. That it has
gotten completely up your nose is no surprise, of course.

Cheers,
RAH
