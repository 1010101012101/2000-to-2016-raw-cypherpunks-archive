While money can buy shill humans to stand in, as below, it's
costly, and casual human interactions by multiple signers reviewing
them may expose them to risk.

Govt seems to have no issue doing such illegal / unethical things.
And they certainly can use their own network, tor, to do it.

This is suggested often on tor-talk. And tor devs continually
pass on it.

Not really. Tor already loads GeoIP. So 20 or so lines
of code and you've got a separate country for
each hop. A few more lines to define groups like
FVEY / BRICS, hemispheres, regions, AS, etc.
Users could isolate on whatever they wanted.

And a bunch more lines to include attributes as to
"verified to be a human node operator in person"
pki web of trust into the consensus. At least that
way it raises the cost and risk to adversaries who
today just use their Govt credit card to order up
VPS nodes all over the world.

Does it benefit? Tor devs say trust the random node selection.
Others say at least some subset of users know the / their
environment better and could use such tools to advantage.

Tor still refuses to do it.
So like mixmaster, you have to do it yourself.
That sucks.
It could stand to be talked over a bit more.
