Generally, asking questions like "where does the state spend
lottery money on" is committing an error.  If the sate gets more 
money earmarked for a specific pirpose, it spends less from 
general revenue for that purpose.  Essentially, it's all general 
revenue.

I think states do the same thing. Certainly in those states where the
staes run the liquor stores they must admit that they keep their
monopoly 1) for the money and 2) because they can.

I think the real differences are 1) the mafia gives a much better 
payoff and 2) the state advertises the hell out of the lottery
and sell their tickets everywhere.  Therefore, the state ropes
in a lot of suckers that probably aren't as inclined to
gamble, whereas the mafia pretty much only gets
fools who are dtermined to gamble.

I have a hard time believing the numbers are anywhere near this 
close. I think 40% is probably a more realistic number for state
lotteries that 50%, and as for the mafia, 60% seems incredibly low.

Nobody would go to a bookie that gave less than 90%  payoff,
and casino-style games tend to have like 97% payoff.

Comes with assimilation I guess.
