cypherpunks,

Note toad.com, August 18 1987. :-)

I believe John Gilmore started cypherpunks@toad.com in September-ish  
of 1992 or so, after Tim May and Eric Hughes hosted the first  
physical cypherpunks meeting.

After using a buddy's password to the MIT/Sloan student Nexis account  
to research on-line cash payment and reading about cypherpunks there  
in an article by Kevin Kelly in the Whole Earth Quarterly, I  
subscribed to cypherpunks@toad.com, and my first post was in May of  
1994, or so. But, living in Boston, I never went to a physical  
meeting, though I've met lots of cypherpunks face-to-face in many  
other places since...

Seeing pyramid.com was a blast from the past. I first used Unix  
seriously on a Pyramid machine in the first half of 1986 or so. It  
had Gosling's (boo, hiss! Not Pure!) emacs on it, and, a flurry of  
keystroke-recorded macro building and multiple telnet shell windows  
later, I had practically automated my third-shift (real-live blue- 
smock and glass-wall) Production Expeditor job at the University of  
Chicago's Computation Center to about half an hour a night most  
nights. On my way out the door to Boston, I did the last week more or  
less remotely by dial-up. Lots of usenet news read, baseball-bat- 
sized cigars burned, pizza for "breakfast", and self-taught cross- 
harp harmonica playing (not necessarily in that order...:-)) in Mr.  
Stallman's honor as a result of that discovery...

Obligatory Four Yorkshiremen thread to follow here, I'm sure. :-).

Cheers,
RAH

WORLD'S FIRST .COM

THE LONGEST LIST OF THE LONGEST STUFF AT THE LONGEST DOMAIN NAME AT  
LONG LAST
What was the world's first .com?
Just what would the site with the world's longest domain name be  
without mentioning what the world's first dot com was
Now were sure many of you think you know and some really do know, but  
those that think it was think.com better think again, think.com was  
the third...we think.
The DNS was created in 1984 and in 1985 top level domains were  
defined. The first top level domains were COM, ORG, EDU, GOV, MIL and  
ccTLD.
In April 1985 cmu.edu, purdue.edu, rice.edu and ucla.edu were the  
first registered domain names.
The first .gov was css.gov and was registered in June 1985.
The first .org was mitre.org and was registered in July 1985.
Now for the first .com which was registered on March 15 1985 and it  
was symbolics.com which still happens to be up and running, although  
not much to look at.
