I would recommend to read the post.  I thought it was fairly
comprehensive and this is extremely bad both in network fork risk
(which not everyone may understand details of as its quite intricate).
Hard-forks should only be done with wide-spread consensus, and are
fairly risky even then, but by doing it in a contentious divisive way
- understand everyone in the technical community is very concerned -
just  unnecessarily magnifies the risk of failure.  The other major
issues being the precedent set and loss of decentralised code
governance described in the post.  A "distributed system" which has
one or two developers, one who has a slight history for proposed a
number of objectionable things in the past (red-lists etc) is not
really distributed.  How do we know other than assumption that they
are not taking money to push preferred features, or under
duress/blackmail etc.  This is the point of the existing code change
approval system to review and cross check against things like that.

If people on *cypherpunks* cant get the points in the post, I think
the world has a problem.  The price of security in a distributed
system like bitcoin is eternal vigilance, but if people dont
understand what constitutes a risk and hence what to be vigilant for,
the meta-system can be unreliable and lose its assurances.  I think we
need to explain some more concepts and probably people will over time
learn things and and an influencer pyramid emerge as happened in
privacy technology.
