And most people find farts offensive.  Should everyone be banned from
eating beans?  Or be forced to wear butt plugs to make you happy?

So put on an air filter if the air offends you.  If someone wishes to kill
themselves with either smoke, drink, or Mickey D's, that's their choice.  

No one forces you to walk behind them, nor breathe their exhaled smoke, or
farts, or car exhaust, live over Radon emitting land, stick your head in a
microwave oven and disable the safety switches, etc.  You can chose to be
where those odors that offend you are not.

Just as you can chose to not engage in unprotected sex with VD/HIV
carriers, play Russian Roulette, etc. it's up to you to protect
yourself.  

If others chose to endanger their lives and health it is their choice.  
Either they will wind up killing themselves weeding themselves out of the
gene pool and winning a Darwin Award, or their bodies will build up
tolerance improving the gene pool.

Why should your standards and life choices be used to limit those of
others?  Who decides whose life choice should define the baseline of
everyone's?  And why that person?

Remember Farenheight 451.  Books were burned because not everyone, but
someone found something offensive, and since everyone put together pretty
much found everything offensive, all books were banned and everyone was
forced to be happy by artificial means.

That is the slippery slope you ask all humans to take with your stupidly
selfish demands.

And no, personally, I'm not a smoker.  But I take great exception to NYC
forcing everyone to quit smoking just because a few morons in power - much
like yourself - except that you have no political power (thank the gods
for that!), have decided to be the conscience of the public.

And personally, if someone wishes to clog their arteries or lungs or
destroy their liver with alcohol, or pancreas with sugar, brain cells with
aspertame, no one should have to pay for their condition.  Neither in
welfare, social security, health insurance, nor any other means.  And yes,
if a corporation decides to poison the environment and their actions make
everyone around them sick - without informing them of the dangers, they
should be held liable.


But things like second hand smoke and obesity are well known to be
dangerous, so if someone inhales smoke or fat burgers, that's their life
choice.  Fuck'em.

If someone is spreading SARS, the plague, or running around machine
gunning people, they should be dealt with accordingly.  But if all they're
doing affects only themselves, that's their choice.
