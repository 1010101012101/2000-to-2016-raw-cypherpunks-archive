If you want to run it on that Redmond stuff, then I guess you do,
actually.  (or run a VM, as suggested upthread).

Didn't gloss over it.  The motto 'round here is "Cypherpunks Write
Code", and while it's honored more in the breach, it still stands.

Perhaps you are needy, but you picked precisely the wrong tone for your
little chastisement.  Getting in the collective face of the developers
of the software you "need" isn't neighborly.  You also forget that it's
both free and Free.  You want guaranteed development results?  The usual
process is RFQ->PO->check.

Because \polite{Windows networking is not the best environment one could
use}.  The workarounds are a royal pain.  And since Windows isn't the
only choice anymore, a lot of us have moved on to where things aren't
broken by design.  (got raw sockets?)

Go the VM route. On Windows, it'll hurt the least.
