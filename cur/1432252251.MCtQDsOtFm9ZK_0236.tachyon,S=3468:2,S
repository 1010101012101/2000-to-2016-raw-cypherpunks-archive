I am very interested in your home based business, however I would like to 
have a phone # and mailing address to whom I am sending my money.  My second 
concern is the shipping and handling.  If you could explain that in detail 
that would be greatly appreciated.  I can be reached at 813-805-2038 after 
8pm every night.  I look forward to your prompt response as I am ready to 
earn some great $$$$.   Thanks for your time and consideration.         
Sincerely,  Jennifer Hartsfield
