Yes, the laws can be written, and they will enjoy the same efficiency and 
success that laws against copyright violation, pornography, prostitution, 
illicit drugs, and so forth have experienced. Not only can the law not 
touch an anonymous economy, it cannot prevent one, either.

It's difficult for people in comfortable democratic countries to fully 
comprehend that activities like drug trafficking, pornography distribution, 
and adultery continue in places where punishment for those activities is 
likely to be summary public execution. Further tinkering with the 
Sentencing Guidelines, for example, might change the rate at which those 
things occur, but it will not eliminate them. At a macro policy level, we 
cannot choose a regulatory configuration where those activities never occur 
- humans have already experimented with incredibly scary sticks (like death 
and torture and extended unpleasant imprisonment) and found them inadequate 
to eliminate them. We will have to plan (to the extent that macro planning 
is considered important) on those activities continuing; and we should not 
abandon otherwise productive choices because they fail to achieve the 
impossible.
