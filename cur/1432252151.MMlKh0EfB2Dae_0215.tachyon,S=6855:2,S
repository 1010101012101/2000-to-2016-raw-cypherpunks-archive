You need a cheap online computer to transfer BTC. You will need a bigger
online computer to make BTC.

You don't need to be a central bank to issue BTC. You don't even need
a banking license, and a connection to SWIFT in order to transfer.

All you need in a lousy smartphone. I think that levels the playing
field quite a bit.

I'm pretty sure that if you're trying to find a hair in the soup
hard enough, eventually you will. However, I find this dish
palatable enough as is. Your mileage might vary.

When I'm trying to form an opinion about something, I try to research 
it first. In general I did not care about minting other than a means
to obtain play money to test transactions. I find this curious that
so many are focusing on the most irrelevant aspect of a P2P monetary
system, the distributed mint, and expect a personal, handsome profit 
from seigniorage. There's a reason that difficulty is adaptive.
The system is supposed to homeostate so that the rate of production
is limited. This is by design.

You obviously did something wrong, then.

I understand when inventors and patent holders of cryptocurrencies scoffed 
at the first cryptocurrency to succeed wildly, by solving the issue of double spending 
without resorting to centralism, and hence a single point of failure. A simple
case of sour grapes.

What is your track record, so far?

If you figure out a tamper-proof way of measuring underlying economy
and a tamper-proof way of issuing a matching volume without any
single point of failures, feel free to publish. It will make quite
a splash, I assure you.

Look, I just pointed out the problem with where you focus and your approach.
If you think that issuing P2P currency with the intent to make a personal
profit is stupid, I agree.

Why are you so focused on production?

As compared to which successful digicash system, exactly?

Deflationary in the sense is that the total amount is limited, and will
be approached asymptotically.

If you want the currency to be useful, you need to grow the underlying economy,
so people are more incited to spend than to be unable to spend.

So what kind of business that is accepting BTC are you running, personally?

Nobody prevents you from designing a P2P cryptocurrency with built-in
demurrage.

You're hating on an experiment. As I understand the designer was unhappy
with the rate of adoption, it would be indeed been much better if the minting
craze didn't happen. I don't think that flaw needs to be fatal.
