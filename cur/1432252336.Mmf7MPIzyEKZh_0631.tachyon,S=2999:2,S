There was a question brought up at the last BA cypherpunks
meeting about what the July meeting agenda might be,
depending onwho will be there vs,  say,  at Defcon instead.
Was anything resolved?  I might want to go to Defcon,  whether
I do or not depends largely on whether I feel there's anything to
do around here.  There's a Phish concert that weekend and I
have a dentist appointment,  so I think incentives for staying and
going are about equal.
