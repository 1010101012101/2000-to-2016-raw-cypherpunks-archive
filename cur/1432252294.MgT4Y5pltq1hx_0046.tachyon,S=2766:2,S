   Not I. My attire most of the Summer is just tank top and shorts, with very
open sandals, no socks - and a spend a lot of time wandaring through the woods
hunting mushrooms. My favorite mushroom woods is just thick with poison ivy, I
don't even bother to try to avoid it, just wade thru it. And I used to be very
allergic to it years ago, but I think you must desensitize to it the more you're
around it. And as I said before, the mosquitoes really aren't that bad, just
quit swatting at them. I'll take bugs over smokers anytime.
