I would argue the alcoholic is best assigned a personal police officer and
psychologist, to keep him in check and positive. In fact; everyone needs a
personal police officer and psychologist.

Especially this guy.

We would all be so much better of if we'd be kept in check and positive. If
we had someone watching us all the time, we could do anything we like
without fear. If we had someone tell us what to think, we wouldn't think
anything badly.

But.. unless we can somehow automate the personal police officer and
psychologist we will never have enough people to do it :(
