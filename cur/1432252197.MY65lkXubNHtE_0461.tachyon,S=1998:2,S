Yes, that remains valid.  As does anonymous broadcasting, eg
usenet stego.    The essential problem for us sleeper cells is to
be able to access the alt.port DB without 1. this being anomolous
2. the posted files being detectable.

There's a nordic fellow, Nichols something or other, who has
looked for stego'd files in high-bandwidth places.  He has
not found a babypicture hidden in a diagram of the 1945
plane-into-skyscraper picture I have posted at an alt port
with even the tool & passhprase issued.

Just FYI.  I haven't tried posting a double-message to eBay yet,
not really having anyone to communicate with, but it would be trivial.

Data -> compress -> encrypt -> encode
