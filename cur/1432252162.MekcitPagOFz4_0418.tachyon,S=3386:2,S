Moderately clever.

Is this choice of IR wavelength or coding techniques or big honking
optics?
Or all of the above?

AT&T IIRC had something similar, for building point to point.  I think
the alignment
was a bitch, and the cost was similar to that $10K, and wireless overran
that niche.
(Ergo cheapness via volume isn't going to happen.)

A friend of mine was interested in using IRDA to cross a street to leach
off a link (with permission).
He didn't try it AFAIK.  Same concept though.
