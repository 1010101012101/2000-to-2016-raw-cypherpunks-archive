--finance.html

By Dustin VolzOpponents of mass surveillance cheered the ruling by U.S. Dis=
trict Court Judge Richard Leon, who granted an injunction to bar the NSA fr=
om collecting the phone metadata of California attorney J.J. Little and his=
 small legal practice.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday=
 for the first time ordered the National Security Agency to cease collectin=
g the phone call records of a lawyer and his firm, providing an unprecedent=
ed but narrow and largely symbolic victory to privacy advocates.Unlike prev=
ious rulings against the NSA's program to vacuum up Americans' call data, w=
hich was exposed publicly by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, =
Leon=E2=80=99s opinion does not grant a stay, meaning it will take effect i=
mmediately.The decision is of little practical consequence because it is so=
 narrow in scope in covering only Little and his firm.It also comes just we=
eks before the NSA is scheduled to end its controversial bulk collection pr=
ogram in favor of a more targeted system. That new regime, as mandated by C=
ongress earlier this year, will become active on Nov. 29.But the ruling's l=
anguage is forceful and represents a win for civil liberties groups concern=
ed that NSA surveillance is too intrusive.Leon wrote that the case may be t=
he last court evaluation of the NSA's bulk metadata collection program."It =
will not, however, be the last chapter in the ongoing struggle to balance p=
rivacy rights and national security interests under our Constitution in an =
age of evolving technological wizardry," he wrote.On Twitter, Snowden cheer=
ed the "historic decision" as one that concluded the NSA =E2=80=9Cviolated =
Americans=E2=80=99 privacy rights.=E2=80=9DLeon, a conservative judge appoi=
nted by former President George W. Bush, has long been among the most vocal=
 judges critical of the NSA=E2=80=99s spying practices.Leon said he did not=
 stay his Monday decision =E2=80=9Cbecause it has been almost two years sin=
ce I first found that the NSA=E2=80=99s bulk telephony metadata program lik=
ely violates the Constitution."Other plaintiffs in the case, including cons=
ervative activist Larry Klayman, who began the lawsuit, were not included i=
n the ruling, due to issues concerning standing.A higher court previously r=
ejected Klayman=E2=80=99s challenge, saying he could not prove his phone wa=
s targeted by the NSA as Snowden=E2=80=99s documents only revealed customer=
s of Verizon Business Network Services, which is a subsidiary of Verizon Co=
mmunications, such as Little, were implicated. Klayman added Little to his =
case to address the standing concern.
