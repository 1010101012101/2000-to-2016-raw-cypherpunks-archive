No doubt the UK Police will use it's powers to get RIM to disclose the
phone numbers used in specific areas (cell towers) and then request call
records. The London police cells are overflowing with alleged rioters,
many will have had their 'smart' phones impounded for later forensic
analysis. The disturbances in London/UK are likely to be a test bed for
Police and Forensic Science analysis of digital footprints etc

RIM to turn in BlackBerry-using looters after London riots
"Catching the fire-starters retrospectively is possible as RIM can pass
over decrypted versions of BBM chatter."

As a matter of interest, the NYTimes has it a little wrong: Lammy's not
a minister in the government, he's an opposition MP, representing the
area where the riots started.
