Actually, tapping terrestrial fiber optic cable is easy: a 3db splitter will
do it, though that introduces a break (which isnt a big deal: sonet/sdh rings
will recover within 50 ms, in general).

Its also fairly easy to introduce a tap that doesnt introduce a break, and
this doesnt require spookish equipment at all:its kind of a
hand-grip-looking thing that clamps onto the fiber and pulls some of the
optical signal via cladding-mode coupling.
Either of these methods introduce at least a 3db loss, which in many cases
will just be assumed by the fibers owners to be some of the usual cultprits
that cause loss, or simply a poor splice by the truck guys.

Once you introduce optical amplification, however, its eavesdrop city and you
can tap out some signal without the loss being evident to even OTDRs.

Tapping an underwater cable is far, far harder, but the NSA is known by fiber
guys to have at least two of the very expensive and very specialized subs
necessary.

At Bellcore, I actually consulted on some undersea project by the defense
department, who were seeing intermittent losses on their underwater
something-or-other, which they never told us. But, it was obvious that they
were operating an OC-3 network via their own optical fibers, which I strongly
suspect sat alongside or even inside the underwater cable. They probably had
periodic stations to look for interesting chunks of traffic that they could
tap (or electronically copy) into their own network, which Ill take a wild
guess was probably ATM over OC-3, which would make sense for several reasons,
including reach, which is critical in that environment.

In this case, though, I dont think its us JbTs, just because theres too
much business at stake.

I suspect we have some new mode of fiber optic mujahadeen that are trying to
hurt or seriously fuck up money flows into the middle east, but dont quote me
on that. How did they do it? Dont know, but remember they were resourceful
enough to figure out how to turn a 727 into a very effective smart missile.
