Chemical Plants Said to Pose Risk
More than 100 facilities, including 12 in the L.A. Basin, could expose
millions to toxic gas in an attack or accident,
documents indicate.

By Marla Cone, Times Staff Writer

More than 100 chemical plants throughout the United States -- including
12 in
the Los Angeles Basin -- each could expose millions of people to
dangerous
concentrations of toxic gas in the event of a terrorist attack or major
accident,
according to industry documents filed with the U.S. Environmental
Protection
Agency.

In Southern California, eight plants in Los Angeles County, three in San

Bernardino County and one in Riverside County are each capable of
exposing
a million or more people to the gases, and some people could receive
doses
high enough to cause death or serious injury, the documents show. About
30
other plants in the region handle smaller volumes of chemicals that
could affect
between 100,000 and 1 million people.
