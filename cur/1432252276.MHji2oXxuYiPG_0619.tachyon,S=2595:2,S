John Schwartz writes in the December 31 New York Times:

"A controversial system installed on a criminal suspect's 
computer by the government to capture the encryption 
passwords of a criminal suspect is nearing its second 
phase." 

Anybody have info or leads on the "second phase" of 
what appears to be the keylogging technology used 
by the FBI in the Scarfo case?
