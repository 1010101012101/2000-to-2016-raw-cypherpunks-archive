How much would be gained by using DC-Nets for inter-remailer communication?

Generally, DC-Nets increase the traffic by a factor equal to the number
of nodes in the net.  Suppose there were a core set of always-connected
remailers with about a dozen members, few enough to make a DC-Net
practical given current traffic loads.

Would this eliminate the benefits of remailer-to-remailer cover traffic?
Would it allow for shorter remailer chains while maintaining anonymity?

How much benefit do you get for the cost?
