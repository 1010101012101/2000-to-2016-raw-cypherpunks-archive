ISLAMABAD (Wahdat): The deputy chief of Afghan intelligence,
Abdullah Tauhidi, has claimed that intelligence officials have
acquired a number of new videotapes of Osama bin Laden and
his associates in the al-Qaeda network.

The videotapes show clearer camera work, which could be far
better proof for a court of law to put the most wanted man on trial
in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks, he said in
an interview.

The videotapes pictured bin Laden and other members of his
network planning terrorist activities around the globe. Unlike
previous tapes obtained by the US, the new tapes are very clear
in picture and voice. This will help to clear up continuing doubts
about the authenticity of the videotapes that have earlier been
obtained and made public.

                                         He said that these tapes would
be put on public display after a
                                         thorough investigation by the
authorities concerned. We are
                                         happy with the remarkable
achievement made by the country's
                                         intelligence in a very short
time, which started functioning after
                                         the recent fall of the Taliban
in Afghanistan, he said.
