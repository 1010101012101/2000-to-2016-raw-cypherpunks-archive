"A descendant of the inventor of the "Venetian blind" window covering 
has expressed shock, sorrow, and regret for the evil deeds of his 
great-grandfather. He says he cries every day as he thinks about the 
misdeed that the curtain industry has made possible.

Harvey Wimpelbert, heir to the Venetian Blind Company fortune, has 
apologized to the world for his family's involvement in helping 
terrorists, pornographers, and other criminals  to "hide behind the 
curtains my family helped foist upon the world."

"I support the government's demands that curtains be banned so that the 
legitimate needs of law enforcement may be met. Everyday I cry for 
several hours over the horrors that are being committed out of the view 
of our noble policemen," he sobbed.

"People who place curtains or blinds over their windows obviously have 
something to hide," said Homeless Defense   Minister Ridge.
