Wait, you're taking an academic paper, a good one I might add, and
saying that this counts as admission by the Tor Project that our efforts
are futile?

Perhaps the leaked documents that specifically state this fact might
clue you into their capabilities?

I encourage you to read them:

  http://media.encrypted.cc/files/nsa/

Contained in those files, I see no evidence for your assertions. Aaron's
paper is good but as Al said, feel free to show us some evidence that
you've used it to break Tor!

Wait, they have access to information, that they publish, story by story
and that means that they're not credible? That is hilariously strange
reasoning. The information is coming out as quickly as people are able
to make sense of it.

No, the latest news is that Glenn still has nouns of steel and is still
publishing incredible news on a regular basis.

All the best,
