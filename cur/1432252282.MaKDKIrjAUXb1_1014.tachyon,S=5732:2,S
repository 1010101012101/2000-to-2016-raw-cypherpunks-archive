The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri|led 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oi| and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you wil| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
