Dear Ryan,Should you need a hudsucker proxy on another island,Im so 
cheap,Im free.
On the question of legal proceedings,never plead guilty,(horace 
Rumpole.)Plead defence of necessity and ultra vires.
Also Insanity by reason of excess alcohol,twinkies,prozac,etc 
consumption.Blame Kanada.
Economic realities may be safely handled by issuing more transparent e-cash 
until break even.Collapse of govts is assured by the rapid exponential 
growth of hawala style service.Should you be nuked the end should be quick 
and painless.
The authorities probably wont hassle you as they would be fearful of 
publicizing such a potent threat to their very existence.
Should sandline threaten you just threaten them back with APster.Remember 
nelson mandelas words at his trial.
I should like to live for a world where remailers save the world for 
freedom,this is cause that I should struggle to live for and if necessary 
will die for.The whole wired worlds watching.Yours in solidarity and 
crypto-anarchy,mattd aka proffr1.

Everyone a remailer,everyone a mint,everyone an APster.
