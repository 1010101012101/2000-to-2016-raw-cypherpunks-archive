If I think of the 3 whistleblower cases I'm mildly familiar with, there 
is no commonality between the source protection aspects.  I think this 
might be something where whatever technical system you put in place, a 
wise whistleblower would not be keen to trust it.  Given that the 
typical cost of being a whistleblower is probably minimum loss of income 
for years, and loss of liberty likely, it might be a really high target.

If that view holds, it might be better kicked out of any technical 
design for a publishing system.

OTOH, If you wanted to make source protection strong *and* technical 
(e.g., uploading), then you might want to make it the same system for 
both uploading and downloading.  Hiding the source in a crowd of 
downloaders is one benefit, and making the download protection high 
profile may help to make the overall source/sink protection better.


4.  Gatekeeper role.  It would seem that any pure technical system could 
be flooded by junk.  Typically a team is needed to analyse, filter, edit 
and approve.

Some thoughts!
