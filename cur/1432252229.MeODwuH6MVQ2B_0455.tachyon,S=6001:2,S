Dear Friend, 

Dont miss out on the greatest oppportunity to hit the net!
Everyone wants to win the lotto, and with this 7 year old 
company you can increase your odds of winning to 1 out 8,000
instead of 1 out 35 million! 

Listen Friend I am not a gambling man but this opportunity
is unreal..People are making money from winnings as well as from 
the groups they build.. 

$120 a month buys you 40 shares and your own lotto agency .
Get 5 other peopel and you are playing for free! 

There is so much information about the Amazing opportunity
People are making $10,000 a month in 3 months time..
Look dont take my word for it just listen to this testimony
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The letter from my friend: I had a friend that asked me to join Lotto## a long 
time ago. I didn't do it because I already make a very good living on the Internet 
and didn't want the burden of promoting a new program. I'm already in many, plus 
the web designing, and web mastering I do for several large companies take up 
a lot of my time. I put him off for almost a year. He had no downline and earned 
$125,000.00, he's not an Internet marketer and thought if I was a part of his 
team he would make better money from commissions. Because of the odds of winning, 
I decided to join his program. I told him I was mostly interested in playing 
the lotto and not promoting, because of my busy schedule. But, I told him, if 
I make money from it, I?d promote it. When I received my last months letter from 
the lotto showing my playing numbers they always attach your check along with 
a statement telling you what your following months check will be. I almost threw 
this one away. It wasn't a regular size and it was all in German with just my 
name in English (the previous check were English and regular size) I told my 
wife, this looks like a check and I wrote an email to lotto21 to verify the amount 
and if it was really a check. Here is the email they returned to me: ======================================================= 
Dear Mr. Parker. We refer to apply your e-mail, which we received on date 09/01/01. 
(01/09/01) With this cheque you can go to each bank around him to redeem. 12,34 
Euro are approx. 11,951.29 US $. In order to keep the costs of the redemption 
of the cheques small, we can offer to you, that you collect the gain CHECKS and 
to hand back us these completely if the amount were exceeded by US $ 500,00. 
We will contact then immediately our trustee, so that you will get a cheque over 
the total amount. Best regards. Lotto Team Partnership Service GmbH i.A. Ploumi 
i.A. Ritter ======================================================= As you can 
see the check was almost $12,000 my statement showed my next check to be over 
$25,000 This was all from winnings... NO downline. As you know there may be a 
month that I don't win. However, because of my friend?s success and mine, I decided 
to promote it. The nice thing about owning the agency is the commission structure. 
When you have only 5 sign ups under you, you are playing for FREE. Anyone, over 
5 result in a monthly commission check. The monthly cost is an average of $130 
per month for the 40 shares. It fluctuates with the currency exchange rate. This 
month it was only $118. It's actually the best set up program I've seen. Only 
5 members and you play FREE with the opportunity to win millions and build a 
nice monthly income by promoting the agency. Just from the sign ups last week, 
if I never win again the monthly income would be $1200 per month. That's not 
bad for a few days work! I hope I've answered all of your questions.
