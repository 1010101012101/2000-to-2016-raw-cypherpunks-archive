I'd ask the same thing about anonymity. It must always be taken that
both the surveillance state, and anonymity must exist, for one cannot exist
without the other.

But back to things not adding up.. none of us is a superhuman opsec 
practictioner. We all get tired, sloppy, arrogant, including the spooks and
the surveillance state.

If I would have been in Snowden's position I probably would have promoted
tor just as he was, in the hopes it might weaken the system.

As it is, I find the best treatment for paranoia is to give up the illusion
of anonymity, and my life is more relaxing and enjoyable if I do not feel 
obligated to keep secrets.
