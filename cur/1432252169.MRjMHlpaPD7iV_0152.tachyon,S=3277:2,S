Actually that's http://www.ifccfbi.gov/ , and yes, it's almost slashdotted.
The IFCC comes from Internet Fraud Complaint Center, and it seems it is a
preexisting .gov website. The frontpage says:

    "The Internet Fraud Complaint Center (IFCC) is a partnership between the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National White Collar Crime
Center (NW3C).

IFCC's mission is to address fraud committed over the Internet."

That does not sound good at all -- it's likely the public FBI and/or CIA
servers could handle a higher load, yet they've decided to use an Internet
fraud reporting site for this incident. Do they think online circles have
some special role in all this? They *have* been touting Osama as a "wired"
terrorist for some time...
