It's not that hard to read the US Copyright Law.  Visit
http://www4.law.cornell.edu ; either read the DMCA (you
can search for it), or just look through the relevant
sections of Title 17.

Yes.  Being out of print is irrelevant.  What's relevant
is whether it's copyrighted.

This is most assuredly copyrighted.  It's conceivable that King
(who, I believe, owns his own copyrights) granted the book to the
public domain, but don't bet on it.

You could anticipate being found and prosecuted.  Under 
Title 17, the fines can add up quite quickly: per copy made.  This
is why Napster was fined hundreds of millions of $$$.

Your profit or motive is essentially irrelevant to copyright law.

Huh?

If you bought the book, then various rights are yours.  These
do not include redistributing the book except under certain
circumstances (a.k.a., "fair use").

Producing quotes or whatever from a book for a court is one
thing.  Mass distribution of a book is another.  

Search for "harlan ellison" on http://www.slashdot.org to see
what one author is doing about his book being redistributed.
