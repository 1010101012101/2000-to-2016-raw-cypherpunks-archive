I wonder what's the budget to date for chasing down one apparently not
so dangerous guy? They may be creating, at great expense ( is there
another way for a government to create? ), what it is they want to find.
If they push him over the edge, in 5 years or so they can have a real
manhunt with bullets and everything. What's the saying? 'The race is not
always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but that's the way to
bet.' Good for The Department ultimately.
