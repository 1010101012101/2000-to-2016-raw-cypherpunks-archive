I invite all cypherpunks subscribers to let this censorhappy -- not to
mention humorless -- sysadmin know what they think about spam
complaints over a joke posted here:
"J.A. Terranson" <measl@mfn.org>

I posted recently, in response to a help-me-spam message:
> Cypherpunks are well-known providers of Bulk-email HTML spam campaigns.
> As a "marketing analyst," you've clearly come to the right place.

And Terranson complained to my upstream provider that I was spamming
(see message below).

I will be writing about the censorhappy behavior of Terranson/MFN
in my next column.
