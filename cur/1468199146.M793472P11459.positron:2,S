"A couple of years ago, Forbes reported that 400 billionaires owned 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S."
First, I should point out that to the extent that this may seem to be a pro=
blem,part of the problem is that behind the scenes, governments actuallymay=
 be _promoting_ income inequality, rather than reducing it. =C2=A0I'veseen =
an article that indicates that considered over the entire world economy,inc=
ome inequality may have peaked in the 1980's, and has been loweringsince th=
en. =C2=A0To a great degree, that is because of world trade, and the fact t=
hat=C2=A0we (America) are getting manufactured goods from foreign countries=
, to anextent far different than in the, say, 1960's. =C2=A0 This strongly =
contrasts with thekind of people (leftists) who selectively point to income=
 inequality within a singlenation, saying it is increasing.
"In the face of this, I think AP may have a problem with scale:=C2=A0 How
many small investors does it take to redirect AP profiteers away from
targets chosen by factions among the ruling class, beginning with
anyone suspected of operating the AP infrastructure and/or promoting
it effectively to a wide audience of participants?"
It's hard to target people when you don't know who they are. =C2=A0In today=
's=C2=A0political world, people try to make changes by being loud and compl=
aining.Potentially, this makes them targets while AP is turning on. =C2=A0B=
ut I believe thatin a smoothly-functioning 'post-AP-transition' world, peop=
le simply don't needto complain.Or, they will be able to do so anonymously.=
 =C2=A0Would a very rich person havesort of special advantage in an AP worl=
d? =C2=A0Well, he'd have a lot of money,=C2=A0but that would be just about =
the only advantage he has. =C2=A0AP would effectively shut down governments=
, not merely shutting down the=C2=A0need for government, but also making it=
 virtually impossible to run a large,or oppressive (or both) government. =
=C2=A0This means that governments won't be=C2=A0able to funnel money to tho=
se people who (in today's world) eventually becomebillionaires.
>If an AP lottery is not "fair and honest" by allowing anyone to be
targeted regardless of occupation or etc., how long until ones that do
allow any human to be bet on appear, with inflated bounties on
perceived enemies of the ruling class?"

Long ago, I realized that a fully-functioning, 'complete' AP system would e=
ventually haveto somehow replace both the existing national defense system,=
 as well as theexisting 'criminal justice' system. "Did somebody actually a=
ggress on somebody else?"=C2=A0But initially, to get there, I think it woul=
d be sufficient to have an AP-organization with a much-simpler standard: =
=C2=A0"Does the person named as the aggressor work for government atsome le=
vel?". =C2=A0 =C2=A0He's already aggressed. =C2=A0No more proof is necessar=
y.
If, hypothetically, I was running such an AP system, I knew that I couldn't=
 stop anyone else fromalso running a different AP system, different rules. =
=C2=A0I imagined that this wouldn't (couldn't) be a=C2=A0monopoly, it would=
 amount to a competition. =C2=A0Some organizations (I'll label them "unethi=
cal")=C2=A0would accept bets on anyone. =C2=A0Others, such as my own, would=
 initially just have the initial"does he work for government" standard. =C2=
=A0Over time, I believe that the "ethical" organizationswould have advantag=
es, so they could do the equivalent of offering lower prices:The amount of =
their awards could be lower. =C2=A0The "unethical" organizations would=C2=
=A0"do" anybody, but it would cost much more. =C2=A0They would take higher =
profits, meaning that peoplewho had a genuine beef with someone else would =
tend to employ "ethical" systems. =C2=A0"Business"would tend to shift. =C2=
=A0Over time, the market will shift from "unethical" to "ethical".=C2=A0
=C2=A0Eventually, what amounted to "court systems" would be included, to de=
cide whethera complaint was valid. =C2=A0These "court systems" would, of co=
urse, be "voluntary",in the sense nobody would be required to appear, but t=
he consequence of failure to appearwould be that 'bare AP' would operate: =
=C2=A0If enough donations appeared to motivate somebody,that would happen. =
=C2=A0

>Mind you, AP is a frightfully clever idea.
At the time I started writing the first part of AP in January-February 1995=
, I was=C2=A0entirely unaware =C2=A0of the existence of the CP list, or doc=
uments such as Cyphernomicon:I had no direct access to the Internet, and th=
e WWW.=C2=A0=C2=A0In section 16.4.2 of Cyphernomicon =C2=A0is the paragraph=
:=C2=A0=C2=A0http://www.kreps.org/hackers/overheads/11cyphernervs.pdf
"The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology=
, citingnational security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers a=
nd tax evaders, andfears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns=
 will be valid; crypto anarchywill allow national secrets to be trade freel=
y and will allow illicit and stolen materialsto be traded. An anonymous com=
puterized market will even make possible abhorrentmarkets for assassination=
s and extortion."
Despite my forming the idea essentially independently, even then I was not =
under any=C2=A0impression that I =C2=A0was somehow inventing the concept of=
 an =C2=A0"assassination market",=C2=A0which I assumed at the time to be ob=
vious.=C2=A0
=C2=A0Rather, I believed that =C2=A0what =C2=A0would usually be thought of =
such a market would be a system=C2=A0where "Anonymous Person A could hire A=
nonymous Person B to kill Person C." =C2=A0Certainly=C2=A0that was a suffic=
iently =C2=A0fascinating idea in the early 1990's to be worth discussing, b=
ut it=C2=A0occurred to me that if that was the only use made of it, few peo=
ple want specific other peopledead enough to completely finance it themselv=
es. =C2=A0Far more interesting, the thing I really broughtto the table, wou=
ld be the idea where tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of anonymo=
us=C2=A0persons pool their donations, and offer to any number of potential =
assassins, such that the=C2=A0winning assassin gets his reward also anonymo=
usly. =C2=A0 THAT, I thought and still think, was a new=C2=A0concept. =C2=
=A0That is not merely quantitatively different than 'your father's assassin=
ation market', but=C2=A0in fact qualitatively different: =C2=A0Combine enou=
gh donations, no matter how tiny the individual ones=C2=A0are, and that wil=
l be plenty to buy death. =C2=A0Further, offer those donations to an unlimi=
ted number=C2=A0of people, and the target will have no idea from where the =
killing blow will strike. =C2=A0Each potential=C2=A0assassin knows he compe=
ting with all the rest.
And once I thought of that idea, I've always believed that it was absolutel=
y inevitable. =C2=A0SOMEBODY
was going to think of this, eventually. =C2=A0It just happened to be me.
