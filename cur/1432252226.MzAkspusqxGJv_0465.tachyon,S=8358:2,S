Not only man-babies, but principally man-babies.

Boom.

So, a 'movement' that claims to want "journalistic integrity", which 
absent press censorship means "self regulation", can't be bothered 
policing its own ranks to stop misogynistic slander and death-threats. 
How many "Gamergaters" spend time chasing others for doxxing, 
threatening and slandering women in technology? As many as actually take 
part in these acts? I doubt it, and I see no evidence of such 
self-policing at a meaningful scale.

I'm sure there are honest, decent people using the "Gamergate" flag to 
call for something-something, but the fact that they're using that flag 
after it's been so thoroughly dragged through the muck *by other 
gamergaters* shows that they are content to accept misogyny in exchange 
for trending status on Twitter, rather than forking what's become more 
of a *bowel* movement into something with a measure of the integrity 
they claim to demand of others.

As often, Chris Straub summed it up well (Warning: Allegory):
