Working Conference on Complex and Dynamic Systems Architecture
Date: Dec 12, 2001 - Dec 14, 2001

Location: Brisbane Marriott Hotel, 515 Queen Street, Brisbane, Queensland.

The Distributed Systems Technology Centre (DSTC) and University of 
Queensland host an international conference on complex and dynamic systems 
architecture. It will feature high-level representation from Australian and 
international researchers, including US Defence research organisations, US 
Defence contractors and US Government standards groups. With such key 
representation, the conference will be of interest to companies and 
departments reliant on the successful operation of large complex systems 
and in particular, organisations participating in the national and 
international defence communities. Specifically, the conference bridges 
international research and industrial and defence communities in order to 
share ideas and increase synergy between theoretical and empirical work. 
Program topics include reconfigurable software, architecture definition 
languages, configuration management, embedded system architectures, 
survivability, software architecture documentation, modelling 
re-configurable distributed systems, component compositions, ACME, probes 
and gauges in event-based systems, composition of behavioural 
specifications, system generators, composition analysis, peer-to-peer 
workflow, co-evolving and adaptive systems, adhoc federation, adaptive 
threat environments and semantic interoperability.
