Slur: You're going to hate it.

"Slur is an open source, decentralized and anonymous marketplace for the
selling of secret information in exchange for bitcoin. Slur is written
in C and operates over the Tor network with bitcoin transactions through
libbitcoin. Both buyers and sellers are fully anonymous and there are no
restrictions on the data that is auctioned. There is no charge to buy or
sell on the Slur marketplace except in the case of a dispute, where a
token sum is paid to volunteers. - See more at:
http://slur.io/#sthash.OsHtOC5o.dpuf"

"How does it work ?
 

Sellers encrypt, upload and then list their data on the digital
market with the ease a user might list an item on eBay. They do so
with full anonymity and there are no restrictions on the content of
the data.

Exclusive bidders attempt to purchase the data for their own use
and / or prevent other parties from acquiring a copy. Should an
exclusive bidder win the auction they alone will receive the
decryption keys. The same data cannot be auctioned a second time
on the Slur marketplace.

Crowd bidders pool their funds into a single bid. Should they
win the auction the network will release the decryption keys
to all users on the Slur marketplace and the information will
therefore become public.

Arbitrators are randomly selected users who agree to weigh
in on a dispute should the winner of an auction claim that
the decrypted contents do not match the sellers
description.

Public key cryptography ensures the data being sold can
only be decrypted by the winner of the auction.

"Implications:
If correctly implemented this platform will have a profound and lasting
effect on our society.

An unregulated free market for information would redefine the net worth
of every person as their material assets would in the future be weighed
against the market value of their secrets.

As damaging as Slur can be to individuals it is considerably more so for
groups

It's estimated that 5% of the general population are psychopaths.
Introducing financial incentive in an anonymous framework will produce a
greater yield of leaked information than from say the ideology that
drove patriots like Edward Snowden. For every idealist willing to
selflessly sacrifice their freedom, assets and even risk their lives for
a greater good, there are 1000 psychopaths willing to anonymously sell
out their peers for material gain.

Organizations of every type; governments, corporations and the military
are in the unfortunate predicament of having both a great deal of liquid
assets and a large number of secrets to protect - accessible by numerous
disgruntled or psychopathic personnel. When Slur becomes ubiquitous it
will bleed organizations secrets and funds.

The Slur marketplace will sharply increase demand for bitcoin from those
parties attempting to purchase previously inaccessible secret
information and organizations scrambling to suppress damaging leaks from
inside their own ranks or security breaches.

The Slur market is WikiLeaks 2.0. An incalculable resource for public
knowledge and unfiltered access to the truth. Except that in the future
journalists will need to compensate whistle blowers for the extreme
risks they take.

The types of information we expect to see on the Slur marketplace ;

Trade secrets.

Designs for every type of consumer product.

The source code for proprietary operating systems and high end
CAD software.

Zero day exploits. For the market defined value rather than
a price determined by the corporations under the guise of a
bounty with the veiled threat of legal action should the
researcher choose to sell elsewhere.

The details of backdoors covertly installed inside
industrial and consumer hardware and software.

Stolen databases. Corporations will no longer be able
to get away with an apology when they fail to secure
their customers confidential data. They will have to
pay the market value to suppress it.

Proof of tax evasion from disgruntled or underpaid
employees. Both the IRS and the public have an
interest in that information and the corporations
will have to bid to suppress it - a very
quantifiable and predictable payoff for the seller.

Military intelligence relevant to real-time
conflicts.

Aerospace and defense designs.

Evidence relevant to ongoing trials.

Unflattering celebrity photos and
videos.

The complete databases of social
media sites like facebook.

Proof of government corruption.
Close to an election. - See more

The site appeals for donations and has a crossed out sentence saying
production versions will be available in july 2015.

Thoughts?
