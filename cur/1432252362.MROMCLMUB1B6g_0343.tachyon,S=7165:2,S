Except if the action is taking place on the property of the business,
it is the owner's perogative to ask the people involved to leave.
Property rights are just as important to the ballpark owner as
personally expressive rights are to the lesbians at the baseball game.

Except inasmuch as you are now one someone else's property and must
obey commands from them to leave.

Wrong.  I don't have to justify throwing you off of land that I own.

When I buy a ticket to a ballgame it is subject to the owner letting
me in the ballpark.  I understand that when I buy the ticket, I take a
risk in doing so; the owner can decide he doesn't want me on his
property and throw me out.  The fact that I bought a ticket doesn't
assure me that I'll be allowed to stay in the ballpark, it only
assures me that I won't be turned away at the door.  The owner can
still decide to throw me out at any time.

Because in the owner's eyes this won't be acceptable to the majority
of the fans at the game.  I personally say let them do whatever they
want, but if there's some tightass bible banger sitting next to the
two lesbians who decides that such a display is unacceptable and stops
taking his three kids to the game, the owner has a problem.

It seems to me that you're the one taking rights away, or perhaps you
genuinely don't believe that property rights are valid.  In that case,
we have no common ground from which to even begin to discuss
constructively.
