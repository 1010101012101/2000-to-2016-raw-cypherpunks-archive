You need to get back on your medications.

But thanks for helping with my defense: "Tim Im posting articles under 
your name at Indymedia."

Persecutor: "Mr. May, did you write these words?"

Me: "I don't know. Other people post things under my name. I really 
can't say for sure whether I wrote those words. What did the digital 
signature say?"

(Note in general: Even without the forgeries from Detweiler, and now 
this admission from "mattd," I expect that if asked if I wrote something 
I would say "I don't know." Without checking my own archives, it would 
be hard to know if something attributed to me was actually written by 
me, was a clever forgery, or was a satirical forgery. It's why digital 
signatures, with flaws of their own, exist. And it's why I don't sign. A 
signature is giving away something of value, to a prosecutor in this 
case.)
