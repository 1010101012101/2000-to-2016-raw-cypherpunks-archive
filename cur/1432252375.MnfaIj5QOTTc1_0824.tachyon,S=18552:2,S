re: The FATHERLAND...There will soon be no Swine to Cast Pearls before =
(even when they
write first), since the Host of the Toad List which originally attracted
all of the Swine is shutting down the MotherOfAllDisturbedMaleLISPs
after having realized--all of the Chickens having flown the CoOp
(mysteriously leaving nothing but BullShit in their wake)--that he
had created an Animal Farm in a BraveGnuWorld.

This of course leaves the OriginalMixedMetaphorPlagarist UpATree
WithOutAPaddle, as BothReaders[TM] of the 'The True Story Of
The InterNet' Manuscripts (me and Jeff Gordon, eh?) are both
redundantly awaiting the Release&OR&Escape of 'The Chronicles
of Arnold' aka Part V of 'TTSOTI (aka 'The Prison Writings of a
Free[h] Man,' aka 'Don't Crush That rEvolutionary Dwarf Pile Me=20
The Handlers'), just when the HostOfTheParasite is Wiping the
BottomFeeders from the Toad's Ass.

However, since the Author is UpTheCreek and ShitRunsDownHill,
I am certain that SlalomFishingInAmeri%a will find a new BitStream
in which to practice ReleaseAndCatch Fishing&OR&Trolling with
BarbedHooks ("NoPainNoGain") while FuckTheseMorons![TM] can
continue to practice ClaimToCatchAndDon'tRelease Netting
("WeMayOnlyKeepOneLittleOneButWe'llScareTheBeJesus
OutOfTheBigOnes").

I forsee a 'Pull-It, Sir. Prize' from the Master Baiters&OR&Writers =
Watchers=20
Club of the Ameri%an JustU$.$y$tem.

[Fortunately, it is Alec McCrackin's turn to be Toto during the NEXT =

agree
to it in *writing*, eh?)]
