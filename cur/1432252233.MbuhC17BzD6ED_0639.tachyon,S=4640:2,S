Probably true.  Just take a look at the publically advertised info from
AST and other NSA supplies, and Carnivore really is just a toy.  The claim
that this is just a way to test the legal waters (which NSA is generally
protected from) has a lot of merit.  If this is really the best the FBI can
do, I want my tax dollars back.
