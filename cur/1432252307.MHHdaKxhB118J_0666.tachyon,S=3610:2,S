I can't see a market defined as anything else than "private property and
voluntary exchange".

Irrelevant. Does Linux scale to your intended target any better? How about a
voluntary army in WW2? People do even "grand" things without expecting to be
paid (or even worse, expecting to die from it), because they want to. If you
want them to produce more, feel free to pay them. Arguments "I don't like
that they only produce this much, so YOU should pay them" are at least
inane.
