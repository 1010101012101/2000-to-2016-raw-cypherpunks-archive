What has happened lately in the killing judges world?
There was a spate of cases and a couple of jokers got 
vised, but any recently?

I mean in the US, not elsewhere it's acceptable culling.

Is Jeff still here hoping for another gold star, is Tim still being 
bullseyed for "he's gone too far, make him an example." 

Crypto-assassin CJ's still emitting judicial mock, with  
filthy, disgusting heavals from Three Rivers, TX. Course, 
the flung bung wads could be Jeff's plying your honor.
