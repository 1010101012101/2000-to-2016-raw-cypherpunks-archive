I'm in that category. And as someone who basically grew up in Carnegie Hall 
and the Metropolitan Opera, I trust my ears (I saw the opera Wozzeck twice 
by the time I was 17).

There are engineering reasons for this that I'm willing to discuss, though 
the discussion will be tedious for engineers, and impossible to understand 
for non-engineers. Far easier will be for you to go and listen
to a CD player that can upsample standard CD to 24bits/196kHz. The 
difference is not by any means subtle.

As an audiophile (Krell+Levinson+Thiel gear at home), I definitely don't 
want to grab an analog signal. Doing that the signal is sure to retain 
characteristics of the extracting gear. But the vast majority of P2P kids 
won't care one iota that their file was analog for half a second.
