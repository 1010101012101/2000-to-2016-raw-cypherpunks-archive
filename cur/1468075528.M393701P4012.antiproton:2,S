I find it hard to imagine how anarchist societies could develop in our
currently state-dominated world. Anarchist societies have survived
through isolation, and some still do. But how does that work in places
under active state contention?

Also, anarchy seems to work best when everyone is more-or-less equally
powerful. Everyone has the same weapons, for example. In science
fiction, anarchist societies typically depend on some new technology
that eliminates states' power monopoly. Maybe it'll be the Singularity.

Yes. But Russia has been exporting ethnic Russians to Crimea for
centuries. And for other ethnic groups, voting against joining Russia
would have indeed been voting for civil war, on the minority side. You
can't vote your conscience when there's a gun to your head.

That's just another gang, the one that NATO helped build. And sure, they
also have grievances going back centuries.

Look, Russian governments have always needed an ocean port that's not
frozen for much of the year. The rest of it is just bullshit.
