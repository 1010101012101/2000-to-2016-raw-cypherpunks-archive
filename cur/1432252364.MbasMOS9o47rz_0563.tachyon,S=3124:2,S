"The Internet is a virtual place where copies of everything proliferate. 
There are no Internet authorities as such, with the exception of those 
whose task is to make the net function. It doesn't have an owner, and won't 
unless a super-power emerges to control it," he told the Weekly. 
Cyberspace, he argued, belongs to all those who participate in it. "We 
cannot let it be a playground where only cats are allowed in and mice are 
banished."'('Naguib.egypt poet/rebel )
