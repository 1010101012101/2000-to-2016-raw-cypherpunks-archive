Not related to THIS CDR. THAT list died a horrible and lingering death.

Who gives a fuck what's written at that site. When Igor and I set this
list up when the old list was announced dead we decided we'd do what we
wanted and not what 'they' wanted. We also wanted a way so that no other
list operator ever had to worry about what one or more (or n-1 for that
matter) other list operators THOUGHT the right way to run the list was.
As a result we leave it up to individual operators to decide what goes
into and out of their node, but they may not filter traffic they relay
from other nodes in any way. It's worked pretty damn well I'd say.

I don't believe in the concept of 'control', I see it as an extension of
ego and self-absorption. As a result I don't filter the SSZ node ever for
anything, not my job. I intend, and make public my intentions, to focus on
cryptography, civil liberties, and economics (and related topics). I intend 
to promote a critical and questioning culture as a consequence.

Money talks, bullshit walks.

"Sacred Cows"? Let's have a bar-b-que boys!...
