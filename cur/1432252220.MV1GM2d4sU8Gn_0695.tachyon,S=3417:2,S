Unfortunately U.S. postal regulations require identification when you
rent a mail box, public or private.  See
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/audio/private_mail_box.htm:

   Recent amendments to postal regulations will make it harder for
   criminals to victimize innocent consumers by using mail drops.

   Anyone renting a box from a commercial mail-receiving agency such
   as Mail Boxers, Etc., Parcel Post, and Postnet will be required to
   provide two forms of ID, one being a photo ID.

It won't do much good to chain them if each one in the chain has your
ID on file.  Granted you can use fake ID but that would be breaking the
law, raising the costs considerably.
