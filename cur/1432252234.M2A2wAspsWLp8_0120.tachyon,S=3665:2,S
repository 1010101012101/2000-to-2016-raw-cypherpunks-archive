Whatever promise AP has for its avowed purpose, so far it
has helped to jail a couple of guys and smear a few more
while boosting the careers of several alleged targets.

Talking about AP in public is still going on, here and elsewhere.
Disagreeing about it too. Take it seriously or as a joke, take
your pick. Nothing in the essay proves it's serious or a joke.
Its quality appears to be determined by the credulity of the
reader. 

I like its jokey aspects more than the other. But that's my feeling
about this forum too. The thrill continues, trying to figure out
who is serious and how is joking and who is laying the traps. 

The more serious posts here are the best, but mattd is coming
on swell for a standoff comic. 

True that not everyone likes the humor of political agitation,
and prefer a somber aping of the pols and mils and edus
flogging non-fictional aspirations to right what's wrong,
delusional ravings presented as insight.

Jim Bell would have made AP an underground comedy if he
had hung out with the time-wasterists at MIT rather than with
the techno-commercialists. But I think his techno-political
potboiler succeeds by making a comical wrong turn into the
pokey, not once but twice, and inspiring CJ to follow,
and mattd, and surely more to come as the AP PR machine
gains momentum. 

A lesson to be learned by the politico-religio-righteous.
