This is true, if you do like DeCSS and try to publish software with the
key in it.  The content consortium will put the cert for that key onto
a CRL, and the key will stop working.

The other possibility is to simply keep the key secret and use it to strip
DRM protection from content, then release the now-free data publicly.
This will work especially well if the companies offer free downloads of
content with some kind of restrictions that you can strip off.  If you
have to pay for each download before you can release it for free, then
you better be a pretty generous guy.

Or maybe you can get paid for your efforts.  This could be the true
killer app for anonymous e-cash.
