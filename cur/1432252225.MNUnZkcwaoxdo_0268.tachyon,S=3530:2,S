digs to make September Forever once again on the cypherpunks list:

>Muhammad Ahmad the so-called Mahdi

Sayyed Qtub is who every model of a modern major islamofascist likes to
point to as his ideological source, so Qtub's good enough for, heh,
government work. Qtub is the person whose various manifestoes were used to
found Egypt's Islamic Brotherhood, for instance, and Al Qaeda is,
ideologically, just a branch of that.

<Yawn...>

Yes, yes, "War is God's way of teaching Americans about geography", to
quote Ambrose Bierce. Meanwhile, "consensus" is the final rhetorical refuge
for socialists who can't even get the mob to agree with him anymore...


Apparently, understanding the recursive minutiae of the Levant, et al., the
old-fashioned "received", regurgitated, OxBridge way didn't help y'all too
much when it came to Fabianizing yourselves back to the stone-age, either,
since we're on the subject of neo-feudalist totalitarianism. It took a
whole *bunch* of American "right-wing journalese", plus the odd rescued
City academic or two, filtered through a mere bourgeois shopkeeper's
daughter to drag you lot, kicking and screaming, back to the 20th century.

;-)


Cheers,
RAH
