Francisco Sabate Llopart (known as El Quico) -- Guerilla Extraordinaire -- 
(1915-1960).Born 30 March 1915 in Barcelona; died 5 January 1960.
Francisco Sabate joined the CNT in 1931. In 1932, following the events of 
Fijols, he started the action group "Los Novatos" which aligned with the 
FAI. In 1935, they carried out their first expropriation to provide funds 
for a prison relief group.
On July 18 & 19, 1936, the fascist uprising in Barcelona was defeated, 
signalling the beginning of a libertarian revolution.
On August 27, 1936, Sabati & his brother Josi joined a CNT-FAI column which 
fought on the Aragon front.
With the defeat of the Republican forces, Sabate was interned in France at 
the camps in Vernet. Once free, Sabate continued fighting in Spain 
clandestinely, & on August 20, 1945, succeeded in freeing two comrades. His 
group then began striking against the Franco regime & its supporters, as 
well as robbing companies & banks to finance the underground movement. On 
March 2, 1949, they killed two heads of the phalange.
While many of his comrades were arrested or killed over the years Sabati 
succeeded in slipping through the various police dragnets. But on January 
5, 1960, after having slipped across the border with four companions, they 
were encircled by army & the civil garde, & were shot down. Still, Sabati 
managed to escape, before succumbing a few hours later to bullet wounds.
Sabate figures in at least two movies:
Behold The Pale Horse, with Gregory Peck as a character very closely based 
on Sabate, the Spanish anarchist guerilla.
