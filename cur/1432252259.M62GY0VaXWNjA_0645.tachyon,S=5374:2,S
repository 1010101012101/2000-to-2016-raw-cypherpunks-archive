i have spoken exstensively to lawyers about using this tactic

they say it is very problematic > the people that sit on juries are
not informed that they can in fact nullify AND if a lawyer sees a
possibility in an instance of a case they can get at best reprimanded
by the judge if there is any 'jury tampering' perceived

the courts have nullified the jury nullification law

if the citizenry were in fact knowledgable and educated that would
help the issue and change a lot of things actually - the education
system sucks of course so... and its such an odd thing because people
put such incredible "faith" in the legal system and they know so
little about how it "functions"

i have done some work in the jail/court support area and there are a
ton of things happening in the courts that need changing there is
barely an analysis of how screwed up the system really is - some
volunteers are doing great work in statistics especially regarding
sexual assault cases BUT it is only a beginning on what needs to
happen for anything to get better
