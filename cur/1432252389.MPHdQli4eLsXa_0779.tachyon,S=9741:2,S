Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC 2011),
Bay Gardens Beach Resort, St. Lucia
February 28 - March 4, 2011 - http://ifca.ai/fc11/

[CFP in PDF: http://ifca.ai/fc11/fc11cfp.pdf]

Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major international forum for
research, advanced development, education, exploration, and debate regarding
information assurance, with a specific focus on commercial contexts. The
conference covers all aspects of securing transactions and systems. Original
works focusing on both fundamental and applied real-world deployments
on all aspects surrounding commerce security are solicited. Submissions need
not be exclusively concerned with cryptography. Systems security and
inter-disciplinary efforts are particularly encouraged.

Topics include:

Anonymity and Privacy, Auctions and Audits, Authentication and
Identification, Backup Authentication, Biometrics, Certification and
Authorization, Cloud Computing Security, Commercial Cryptographic
Applications, Transactions and Contracts, Data Outsourcing Security, Digital
Cash and Payment Systems, Digital Incentive and Loyalty Systems, Digital
Rights Management, Fraud Detection, Game Theoretic Approaches to Security,
Identity Theft, Spam, Phishing and Social Engineering, Infrastructure Design,
Legal and Regulatory Issues, Management and Operations, Microfinance and
Micropayments, Mobile Internet Device Security, Monitoring, Reputation
Systems,
RFID-Based and Contactless Payment Systems, Risk Assessment and Management,
Secure Banking and Financial Web Services, Securing Emerging Computational
Paradigms, Security and Risk Perceptions and Judgments, Security Economics,
Smartcards, Secure Tokens and Hardware, Trust Management, Underground-Market
Economics, Usability, Virtual Economies, Voting Systems

SUBMISSION

Submission categories: (i) regular papers (15 pg LNCS format), (ii) short
papers (8 pg), (iii) panels and workshops (2 pg), and (iv) posters (1 pg).
Anonymized submissions will be double-blind reviewed.

Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF files.
Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted
electronically according to the instructions and forms found on this web
site and at the submission site.

Authors may only submit work that does not substantially overlap with
work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication
to a conference with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission
serious research fraud and will treat it as such. In case of doubt contact
the program chair for any clarifications at fc11chair@ifca.ai.

Regular Research Papers.

Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific
contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer
review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings
to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages.

Short Papers.

Short papers are also subject to peer review, however, the intention is to
encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications and
corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a
focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and
future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages
in standard LNCS format. The paper title for short papers should necessarily
include the text '(a short paper)'.

Panel Proposals.

We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals. These
should include a very brief description of the panel topics, as well as of
the prospective panelists. Accepted panel sessions will be presented at the
conference. Moreover, each participant will contribute a one-page abstract to
be published in the conference proceedings. Please feel free to contact us
directly if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain
topic. Panel submissions should be up to 2 pages, sent to fc11chair@ifca.ai.

Posters.

The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative opinion,
interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea that will spark
discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a multi-hour session to
discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback from attendees.
Poster submissions should be 1 page (in the same LNCS format). Please keep
in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main paper submission
deadline. The posters will be published in the proceedings.
Poster proposals should be sent to the posters chair at fc11chair@ifca.ai.

Workshop Proposals.

Proposals for workshops to be held at FC 2011 are also solicited. A
workshop can be full day or half day in length. Workshop proposals should
include: (i) a title, (ii) a call for papers, (iii) a brief summary and
justification -- including how it would fit into the greater FC scope, (iv)
a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair, (v) one-paragraph bios for
key organizers, and (vi) the expected (or previous - if workshop has been
held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance
rates. Workshop proposals should be sent fc11workshops@ifca.ai.

The Rump Session.

FC'11 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of
short (5-7 minute), informal presentations on works in progress,
off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any
conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session
Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of
a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief
abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person in the
morning on the day of the session.
