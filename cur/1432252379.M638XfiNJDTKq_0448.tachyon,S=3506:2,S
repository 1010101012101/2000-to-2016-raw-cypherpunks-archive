There are two ways of modeling the Universe.  One can build it from lots
of copies of the null set, or one can take the undifferentiated whole, and
subdivide it into countless fragments in equilibrium with each other in
various complex ways.

Religions are essentially collections of stories about the latter method
of modeling, created for people who can't do the math, and who have never
bothered to wonder why all the choirs of angels form such neat little
arrays.

God is the thing you have before you start chopping it up.  God is the
abstraction that has everything in the universe as a possible instance.  
Archangels are chunks of a coarse partition of God.  We are chunks of a
fine partition of God.

Mormons make perfect employees.  They are always bathed, well-dressed,
hard-working, self-reliant, well-educated, respectful of your authority,
and they hardly ever mention that after they die, they hope to rule over
other planets in physical bodies, and have a wonderful sex life.

Then again, they'll put their teenage children in a mental institution in
a heartbeat for defying them, or acting gay.

Mormons are the true Stepford citizen units.  Perfect on the outside,
dangerous on the inside.

The Nephilim are a fun bunch.

The whole universe is inside you, Grasshopper.
