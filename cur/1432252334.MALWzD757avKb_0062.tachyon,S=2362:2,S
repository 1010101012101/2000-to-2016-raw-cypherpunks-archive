Excellent rejoinder to Mr. Monahan. The same could be
said of the Internet, hell, make a leap, same applies to 
the government. Stop using the Net and digital security 
and privacy problems will vanish. Stop paying taxes and 
the gov will disappear. Nothing about 9/11 changed that.

Well, the Net got more invasive and the gov more
intrusive. Still, just give them both up, retreat to the
hilltop or Okefenokee or no census nabe, eat spiders 
and snakes and varmints or even better get eaten by 
them, your cold dead middle finger marking the scene 
of dawinism off the grid.

Meanwhile a small fat-bellied band in the heartland of
birght-lit luxury will crow at the rigged suicide of another 
useless eater, the group log on to Rummie's inbox to type, 
thanks old man, those invites to defiance work wonders 
to red dot the hot blood bitchers.

Burp, hiccup, lick lobe, suck snot, poot, pat glock, order
more fodder, clap for market uptick, bray for another
Walter Reed amputee refit Dell-modeled efficient.
