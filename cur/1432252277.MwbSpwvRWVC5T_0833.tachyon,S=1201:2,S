Dear cypherpunks@jfet.org

If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, you are not alone. 
In fact, more than half of all men over forty have difficulties getting or maintaining an erection. 
This condition, called erectile dysfunction (ED), occurs with younger and older men as well, 
but there's a safe, effective and easy method of treatment: Viagra.
