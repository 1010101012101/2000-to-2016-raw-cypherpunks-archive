Run your own server, preferably at home. Provide a web frontend. Have
those people who you need secure communication with sign up for a fancy
new email account, on your server.

Only send email to their email account on your server.

If it's really really important, block their email account from sending
email outside your server - they can still download attachments, but
they can't "make an easy mistake" since they have to be intentional.

If you provide POP or IMAP access, only allow encrypted access.

If your contacts use the web interface, and you -really- want "security"
(to the level you are confident in your own server at least), then issue
your own Certificate Authority and server Certificate, and meet your
contacts in person, manually installing your server certificate into
their browser certificate directory!

NEVER trust ANY external Certificate Authority for any server or
communications that is highly sensitive!

Feel el1te!!!

If it's on a phone or fax, or in front of a Samsung TV, or near any land
line phone that's been certified by your national telecommunications
authority, or in a public WIFI cafe which is likely bugged, or near any
mobile phones that are switched on, or .... etc ... then assume your
conversation is property of your national government and most likely the
"five eyes" (USA, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany).

Use a chat application which provides PFS/ perfect forward secrecy, and
allows transfer of files - that's another approach. There are plenty
more.
