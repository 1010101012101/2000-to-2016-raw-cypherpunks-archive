John,

Funny the paper doesn't mention Cryptome's eyeballing project. :))

Abstract:
U.S. decisionmakers require an analytical process for assessing whether publicly accessible geospatial information (e.g., maps, overhead images, Web site information) can help potential attackers, including terrorists, in selecting and planning attacks on U.S. critical sites. This book provides a framework to assist U.S. decisionmakers by applying three key criteria  usefulness, uniqueness, and societal benefits and costs  to assessing the homeland security implications of geospatial information.

Keep up the great work.
