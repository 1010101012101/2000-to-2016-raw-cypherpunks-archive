LATimes ran something too!  And even included a  link to the
mental-jihadist,
terrorist-du-coeur, amateur pan-geo-opticon-astronomer who freely admits
having studied what hold buildings (and the thugs that tax them) up, as
well as once being an operative of the largest, most WMD'd military
ever.  Zeus bless his Promethian soul.

                      IN BRIEF / CANADA
                      Many Barred From U.S. Because of Security Lists
                      From Times Wire Reports

                      Dozens of people from Canada have been turned back
at the U.S. border or prevented
                      from boarding U.S.-bound planes because their
names are on the American "no-fly" list
                      or a State Department list of possible terrorists,
documents show.

                      The incidents are detailed in daily briefs from
the Homeland Security Department. They
                      contain no classified information.

                                                                    A
department spokesman

confirmed that the memos,

posted at

http://cryptome.org , were

legitimate.
