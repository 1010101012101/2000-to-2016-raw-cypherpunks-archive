In practice, trades on Bitcoin exchanges don't create transactions in the
Bitcoin crypto log; you can even give Bitcoins to one another within an
exchange for the cost of an API call. It's only when money is transferred
into our out of the exchange that a "real" transaction needs to be created,
whether though Bitcoin or through a bank. Private markets can help aggregate
small transactions.

Of course, this presumes you trust the exchange, which is a different
matter.
