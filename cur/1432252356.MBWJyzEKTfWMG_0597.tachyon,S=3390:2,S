Israel imposes tough rules on amateurs
<http://www.arrl.org/?artid=6658>

The Israeli authorities have imposed draconian new rules on radio
amateurs. From January 2007, many of the countrybs radio amateurs
will not be able operate their radio equipment unless it has been
checked and authorised by government inspectors. This follows the
ratification of a new law that aims to prevent harmful radiation from
radio equipment. The only amateurs who are exempt from the new law
are those who use only VHF and UHF equipment with an output of below
20W.

Amateurs will also have to obtain a permit for the erection of
antenna towers. Permits will only be granted if the installation can
be proven not to cause harmful radiation. Operation of amateur radio
equipment without the proper permits will be considered a criminal
offence.

According to a spokesman for Israeli amateurs, the harsh new rules
were pushed through by government following public concern over the
safety of mobile phone masts. He said: bIt seems that all this has
come about from the public near-hysteria over the presence of
cellular telephone installations in residential areas.b

There have been similar fears in the UK about mobile phone masts.
However, no study has shown any evidence of harmful ionising
radiation from these or amateur installations.
