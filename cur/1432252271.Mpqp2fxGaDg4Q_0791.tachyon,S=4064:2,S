Ya know, last night, I was thinking, I'm a suspicious bastard for 
thinking this but... let's count 'em off on imaginary fingers here. 

One, it's Florida, where there's known precedent for scamming votes 
and the traditional infrastructure doesn't do much to prevent it.

Two, it's the governor's brother running for president. (and the 
governor, conveniently, is in charge of investigations into vote 
fraud). 

Three, the bloke running for president's dad is a former head of a 
major intelligence agency who's had a lot of experience setting up 
covert operations and has the personal wealth needed to fund his own 
team of agents. 

Four, Daddy probably knows where a lot of bodies are buried -- 
George Sr. prolly has no end of ammo for playing hardball with US 
intel services and others who might investigate vote fraud -  
particularly  Ms. Janet Reno. 

Five, Daddy also happens to be an ex-president of the US, with lots 
and lots of connections and favors owed.  Which also means, in 
particular, that he is a former head of all of the US armed forces.  

Six (hmm, I must be polydactyl), the ballots can continue to 
come in by mail from overseas for ten days - mostly from places 
controlled by US armed forces - provided they have postmarks with 
an appropriate date - and there's no protocol to make sure that 
postmarks aren't getting backdated. 

Now, I don't *know* that anything large and organized in the way 
of vote-stealing is going on -- but goodness, if you wanna talk 
about a full complement of opportunities and fodder for conspiracy 
theorists, there's just no end of angles, is there?

Um, ditto if you were a Democrat, I'm thinkin'.
