I guess we're stuck with Eye Of Sauron and Balrog.  Too bad, this
is a much more Lovecraftian issue IMO:  We are being pulled into a
place where all the angles are "wrong," and watching the most
merciful thing in the world - the inability of hostile actors to
correlate all the contents of the Internet - starting to crumble
away for reals.

Couple of things I can see to work on:

* Publicize this as a quantum leap in network security threats,
requiring new trust models and comms protocols across the board,
to every audience that is likely to understand the problem and
respond proactively.

* Review RFC 6973, Privacy Considerations For Internet Protocols,
and work to amplify/expand sections relevant to what we are
learning about large scale threat actors and their behavior as
observed in the wild.  This RFC is only two years old, so changes
now may have a large impact on results later.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973

* Think about building an ecosystem of repositories for hashes and
signatures, and protocols for monitoring consensus and assigning
relative trust values to reduce reliance on repo signing keys as
guarantors of software integrity.  Developing comms protocols for
this network would also contribute to general solutions for
hardening networks against the capabilities of our new overlords.

* Think hard about open projects to reverse engineer IC chips with
attention to manufacturer sabotage.  It seems to me that the
likely venue for this would be non-aligned nations (so-called)
with a vested interest in pooling their resources to push back
against universal surveillance & sabotage capabilities of the
Superpowers and their special pets.

*  Keep pressure on all fronts already being worked, i.e.
replacing the HTTPS protocol with something that actually works in
the sense of costing a lot more to defeat.  Make the opposition
spend more money when and wherever possible.

Considering the choice of an apparently competent security
oriented venue to "pen test to destruction" as reported, I wonder
WTF that was about.  Does somebody with control of the resources
used WANT their capabilities publicly disclosed?  If so, was this
a strategic decision from the top, or an act of systemic sabotage
by a lower level actor within the organization in question?  So
many questions, so few clues... so far.
