Sorry about the extra delay.  Very interesting results for year 2000.  Looks
like the Muellers got a new Chevy, from SAL903 to the current VCV976

"VCV976","1","CHEV","SV2","VA","1GBEG25K3SF156657","9830708131",1995,1,2000,

Here's an interesting addition. I ran a year 2000 license plate search for
all Oregon plates registered to 20830 Dione Way, Bend OR, and this popped up
as well.

"WSN592","1","TOYT","RUN","UT","JT3HN86R3X0197687","9829222474",1999,1,2000,

Interestingly enough, GO.COM lists a John Ashe at 8 Todd Ln, Bend, OR,
97707, phone number 541-593-2784

More later
