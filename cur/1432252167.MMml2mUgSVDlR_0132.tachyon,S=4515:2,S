Um, I do know how to spell "restaurants", just not how to tpye.

I presume Reese knows a joke (mine) when he sees one, and is just
looking for info about deer & elk.  This is a story I've
heard about in several forums, including a radio show (maybe
Pacifica News, I'm not sure).

Go to www.google.com and query "bse elk deer" and you'll get
several hits covering this topic.  Whether it constitutes a
"positive link" is for you to decide.

I think Project Censored (www.projectcensored.org) did a story about
this, too.  The bottom line in several of these stories is that BSE
*is* in the wild in the U.S., contrary to what Big Money (in this
case, beef producers, McDonalds, etc.) would have us believe.

Whether BSE is in US cows or elsewhere in the non-hunter human food
chain is something I haven't heard about, but it's fair to guess that
this is the type of information that would be supressed by the powers
that be.

All the more good reason to go vegan...
