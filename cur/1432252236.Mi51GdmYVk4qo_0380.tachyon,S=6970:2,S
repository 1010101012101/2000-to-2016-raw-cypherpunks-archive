This is one of the problems with the whole "Economics" prize. There's 
not even a prize in _mathematics_, fer chrissake, so why one in 
_economics_? Alfred Nobel certainly did not endow an economics prize. 
(The econ prize gets its money from some other source.)

The Econ prize was only established in the 70s, and now the prize 
committee is reaching down deeper into the ranks.

Maybe it's time for them to admit that creating the prize was a 
political move in the first place and it should now be retired, or cut 
back to a prize only when it is really warranted.

Most chip and computer engineers are not unionized (the union meaning, 
not the plasma meaning). This works well.

Some engineers have formed professional societies. These are _nominally_ 
to "ensure professional standards." But critics point to their role as a 
rate-limiting, rent-seeking group. Doctors and lawyers, most notably, 
use professional societies as unions.

The blue-collar worker also has a fair amount of "bargaining power." He 
is paid less, usually, but his relative value to the employer is what he 
is paid. A machine tool worker may not have much power to "demand more 
money," but neither does an engineer, or even a security expert!

The traditional labor union threatens mass action, typically a strike or 
walkout or slowdown. The usual theory is that this protects them from 
retaliation because a plant would have to fire _all_ striking workers, 
with dire consequences for them.

This is false, as factories can and do move to other states, other 
nations.

(The U.S. was a low-wage haven compared to England, in textiles. It also 
"stole" the intellectual property of the mills in England. Ironically, 
the same southern states (Georgia, South Carolina, etc.) that complain 
so viciously about the Asian and Mexican factories were _themselves_ 
beneficiaries of the move of factories from New England mill towns to 
their states. Largely to escape unions and reduce labor costs. Irony 
squared and cubed.)

I put it even more strongly, of course.
