procmail/mutt removed your junk, Jim. I thought you'd stopped
sending web pages to the list. You probably re-add the stupid
"CDR" to the subject every time you reply too...

1. "|urlview" is hard to mistype.
2. I didn't copy the URL
3. If you use google, you'll notice it keeps cached copies of result pages.
4. I only mentioned it because, I really don't care Jim. I am willing
to concede the absurd. 1000 metre waterfalls. Whatever. You win.
