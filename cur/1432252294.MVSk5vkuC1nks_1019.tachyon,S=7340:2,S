Well, having done some optical signal processing (and getting a patent in 
that area, come to think of it), I imagined that most photos will naturally 
have some image noise in certain frequency bands...this noise would not have 
to have anything to do with your camera or whatever, but is probably a 
function of what's in the image. For instance, a picture of a naked girl 
standing in front of drywall probably has very little useful image energy in 
spatial frequencies represented down at the length of a pixel. In a spatial 
fft there's probably a lot of low frequency white noise for a while, until 
you get to the level of the shorter body hairs and whatnot. And then there 
may be spatial freuency bands between that and her height that are nearly 
unoccupied with image energy.

>From a spatial/fft perspective I imagined that this is where stego'd 
information goes. I also imagined that if it were done in a very simple way, 
the stegoed info will be fairly obvious to someone knowledgeable and looking 
at the spatial fft of the image. I imagine that it will look obvious 
because, to an expert, it won't look like the authentic kind of noise 
expected there. If the information is encrypted, I consider it possible that 
the noise may even look too "perfect" perhaps.

If that's true, then I suspect it's often possible to determine that a 
photo's stego has been removed. Or at least, there will be cases where stego 
removal will be "obvious".

Come to think of it, I bet TLA operatives are given precise instructions 
about what kinds of photos make for undiscernable stego (I'd bet where the 
spatial image information is not well-concentrated into "bands"). In other 
words, a photo with all different-sized objects in it. Perhaps they even 
travel with some photos for just this purpose.

Hum. I wonder if photos of "clouds" work well for this purpose. That would 
actually explain something I encountered recently....
