The great firewall of China is somewhat effective, but by no means as effective as the chinese government would wish.  The Russian equivalent is dead in the water.   We do not have magic armor, but, governments do not have magic bullets either.

To effectively repress, a government must be lawless.  But a lawless government risks either disintegrating, as in post 1990 Russia, or succumbing to a cult of personality, as in the 1930s russia.  A bunch of very old men currently keep china wobbling between these two extremes.  When they drop 
dead, it will wobble one way or the other.  Since the cult of personality has proved so deadly to government officials everywhere, they will probably choose the safer course of wobbling in the direction of disintegration.
