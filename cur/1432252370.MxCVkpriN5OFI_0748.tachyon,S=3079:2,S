Interesting.

So what does this mean for remailers that do screen content? At the very
least, the mixmaster software comes with the ability for individuals to
block themselves (or other people -- it's not authenticated) from
receiving mail from the remailer.

So, in effect, the remailer is screening mail for that recipient, and
discarding it.

(And there are, or have been, remailers that screen messages for "bad
words." The messages are then dumped into a file for review.)

How does this affect "common carrier" status?
