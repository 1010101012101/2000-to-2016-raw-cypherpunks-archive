Greetings:

I have a bit of a problem here.  The mixmaster I have set up
is having problems retrieving the mlist2.txt file

The address I have for it is:

wget -O - http://xenophon.homeip.net/echolot/mlist2.txt > mlist2 && \

But this node does not respond.  Any idea for another source of the list?

Thanks!

Regards,
Gregory Hicks
