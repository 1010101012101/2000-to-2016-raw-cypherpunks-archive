Leaving aside the qualitative discussion, let's remember that the freedom to
express onesself does not imply the obligation for any other party to listen.

The problem at hand does not require "authenticated" Tor users.  It requires
authenticated Wikipedia users.

Tor is transport layer.  Authentication for a specific service (such as
Wikipedia) is the responsibility of that service and belongs in the session
layer.

An authenticated network and an anonymizing network are mutually exclusive.

No, Wikipedia needs to realize that the IP address correlation they enjoy
outside of Tor is a happy accident, and that they should stop treating IP
addressess as user credentials.  If they want credentials, they need to
implement them.
