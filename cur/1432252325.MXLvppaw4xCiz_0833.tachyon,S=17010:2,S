<br>
Dear IRTF Chair, IAB, and CFRG:<br>
<br>
I&#39;d like to request the removal of Kevin Igoe from CFRG co-chair.<br>
<br>
The Crypto Forum Research Group is chartered to provide crypto advice<br>
to IETF Working Groups. =A0As CFRG co-chair for the last 2 years, Kevin<br>
has shaped CFRG discussion and provided CFRG opinion to WGs.<br>
<br>
Kevin&#39;s handling of the &quot;Dragonfly&quot; protocol raises doubts th=
at he is<br>
performing these duties competently. =A0Additionally, Kevin&#39;s employmen=
t<br>
with the National Security Agency raises conflict-of-interest<br>
concerns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dragonfly Background<br>
----<br>
Dragonfly is a &quot;Password-Authenticated Key Exchange&quot; protocol (or=
<br>
&quot;PAKE&quot;). =A0Dragonfly was proposed to CFRG 2 years ago [PROPOSAL]=
.<br>
Compared to better-known PAKEs, Dragonfly has no security proof, a<br>
lack of extensive security analysis, nonfunctional complications added<br>
for IPR reasons, and some security issues [REVIEW].<br>
<br>
Dragonfly became a hot topic recently when the TLS WG disputed CFRG&#39;s<b=
r>
alleged report that Dragonfly was &quot;satisfactory&quot;, as well as disp=
uting<br>
that this report reflected CFRG consensus [TLS_1]. =A0After extensive<br>
criticism of Dragonfly, the TLS WG ceased work on a Dragonfly<br>
extension [TLS_2].<br>
<br>
<br>
NSA Background<br>
----<br>
The National Security Agency (&quot;NSA&quot;) is a U.S. Intelligence Agenc=
y<br>
which is believed to devote considerable resources to:<br>
=A0- &quot;Influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial<=
br>
public key technologies&quot;<br>
=A0- &quot;Shape the worldwide cryptography marketplace to make it more<br>
tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities&quot; [BULLRUN]<br>
<br>
While much is unknown about these activities, the NSA is known to have<br>
placed a &quot;back door&quot; in a NIST standard for random number generat=
ion<br>
[ECDRBG]. =A0A recent report from the President&#39;s Review Group<br>
recommends that the NSA:<br>
=A0- &quot;fully support and not undermine efforts to create encryption sta=
ndards&quot;<br>
=A0- &quot;not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable<br=

generally available commercial software&quot; [PRESIDENTS]<br>
<br>
This suggests the NSA is currently behaving contrary to the recommendations=

Reasons for requesting Kevin&#39;s removal<br>

1) =A0Kevin has provided the *ONLY* positive feedback for Dragonfly that<br=

<br>
3) =A0Kevin&#39;s approval of Dragonfly to the TLS WG misrepresented CFRG<b=

consensus, which was skeptical of Dragonfly [CFRG_SUMMARY].<br>
<br>
4) =A0Kevin&#39;s NSA affiliation raises unpleasant but unavoidable<br>

br>
