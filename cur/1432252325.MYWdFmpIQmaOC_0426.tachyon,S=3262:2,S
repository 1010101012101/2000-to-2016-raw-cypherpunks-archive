I gather that the denizens of alt.video.dvd have yet to read the Betamax
case.  Perhaps they should expand their reading before they opine on the
state of IP law.

This is one of several times that the readers of Tim's posts have reported
him to the authorities.  I recall the Santa Cruz sherrif's office call of
the early '90s occaisioned by a simple admission that Tim legally posessed
weapons at home.

I'm constantly amazed by the things that people think are illegal that
aren't.

Reporting people to the authorities is such an impolite thing to do.  In a
less enlightened era it would have led to an unfortunate breach of the
peace.  If you have a problem with someone's behavior speak to him nicely,
first.  And make damned sure that he's doing something wrong before you
complain.
