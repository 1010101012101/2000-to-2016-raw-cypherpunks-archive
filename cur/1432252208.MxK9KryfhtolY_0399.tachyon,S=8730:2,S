I am a producer for NBC Nightly News in New York.  In 1986, I spent =
several days in Rosman and nearby Asheville researching Rosman and =
shooting it from the ground and the air.  The ground level shooting was =
mostly fruitless, but I still have video I shot from a helicopter.

At the time, Rosman had 14 dishes in a bowl like area in Pisgah.  It was =
quite secret as the Sun notes.  However, the FAA never instituted any =
restrictions over the site, as it did with other sites.

We included it in a two part series we did in 1986 called "The =
Eavesdropping War"--NBC having refused to kill the story, as requested =
by then-NSA director William Odom.   Odom threatened legal action if we =
ran the piece.  They are particularly concerned about Rosman.

We determined that Rosman had several missions.=20

 One was intercepting communications from Soviet geosynchronous =
satellites, the Gorizont and Raduga.  We were told interception had two =
values: 1. the satellites were used to communicate with Russian forces =
in Cuba and 2. they were also used to communicate with Soviet SS-20 =
sites in Europe...several of which were in East Germany. The farthest =
Raduga, as I recall, was at 14 degrees west, putting it in range of both =
Rosman and East Germany.  It should be noted that Rosman is almost due =
north of the old Soviet headquarters in Lourdes, Cuba, southwest of =
Havana. Lourdes, of course, is also the largest satellite sigint base in =
the Russian equivalent of Echeon, which I just wrote about for =
msnbc.com.  I was told that Rosman was used in part to capture signals =
being sent between Lourdes and the Soviet sigint downlink at Vatutinki =
outside Moscow.

The other mission was intercepting signals from the agent satellite =
network the Soviet Union maintained to communicate with its agents =
worldwide.  A crude version of Iridium, it contained eight satellites in =
low earth orbit.

The property was ceded to the DoD from the General Services =
Administration in December 1980, at the close of the Carter =
administration, on the same day another smaller NASA site outside of =
London was turned over to DoD. =20

At the end of the Cold War, with the signing of the INF Treaty and =
lessened tensions, it was shut down and some of its equipment sent to =
the NSA base in Sebana Seca, P.R.

I hope this was helpful to you.  If you need to call, give me a ring at =
1-800-NBC-NEWS, ext. 7390.
