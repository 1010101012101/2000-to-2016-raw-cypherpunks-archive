Correct.

A client/friend recently spent 9 hours in jail for failure to carry a
wallet. He was doing something mildly suspicious, but not illegal. NYC
has a very entrenched industry dealing with "processing" people the cops
pick up. This has only gotten worse since Bloomberg and his "quality of
life" racket. Breathing Without ID is essentially a crime that costs a
day of your life, not less than ~$200, and a lot of humiliation. I
thought the San Francisco cops were bad, before I moved here. (My
friend was even told by the cops what to expect, and how best to optimize 
for getting out quickly. Kafka would have trouble doing better.)

There was a mildly publicized incident in another part of Brooklyn
recently where someone was ticketed after their child's balloon popped
in public. A noise infraction. Quality of live, indeed.  "There are no 
quotas, but if you don't meet them, you're on report."

I'd prefer a good old fashioned Mafia protection scheme. At least that 
would be straightforward.
