M1 PROTESTER GIVEN BAIL-BUT OTHER POLICE INTERESTED
A Kyneton man involved in the recent M1 protest in melb.has been accused of 
promoting what is
reffered to as 'assasination politics',and is said to have come to the 
notice of the United States
Secret Service and the Australian Federal Police.
Assasination politics,according to the police,is the practice of nominating 
a person for
assasination,inviting the general public to contribute money to a bank 
account and funding
the assasination with the proceeds.
Police charged Matthew Stephen Taylor last Friday over the vandelism of a 
McDonalds fast food outlet
during the anti-globalisation protest on may 1.
Charges are also pending against Taylor in relation to his alleged Internet 
activities.
On Monday Taylor,46 of Baynton st,Kyneton applied for bail at Kyneton 
Magistrates Court.Taylor faced
two counts of criminal damage and three counts of acting in a manner 
prejudicial to the good
order of a police jail.
As Taylor was led into court,he protested his innocence and described 
Bendigo remand where he
had spent the weekend as a 'hell hole'Inside the court he adressed 
Magistrate William Gibb as
"Your Highness"
He told Mr Gibb he disagreed with his position on drugs and compared it 
with the 1930s prohibition
on alcohol.He was reffering to the previous defendant who appeared on drug 
related charges.
Taylor was supported in court by his father,Ken Taylor,a Mount Macedon poet 
who was recently
awarded the Kenneth Slessor Prize for poetry at the New South Wales 
Premiers Awards.
Prosecutor,Senior Constable Martin Holland said Taylors application for 
bail was not opposed
but he asked Mr Gibb to impose six conditions.
The first condition was "not to post threatening text on the internet 
toward any person whether
located in Australia or elsewhere in the world"
Sen.Const Holland said Taylor had made threats on the internet and a 
computor from Taylors
Kyneton adress had been seized and conveyed to Melbourne for examination.
Sen.Cons.Holland defended the wording of the first condition by saying it 
was not a blanket
ban on all internet useage.
The second condition prohibited Taylor from participating in assasination 
politics.
...The third condition was not to engage any other person in the first two 
things.
The remaining conditions included a prohibition on Taylor participating in 
Melbourne
demonstrations.
Sen.Const.Holland said police had been watching Taylors activities on the 
website
www.indymedia.org with some interest.He said anyone could download 
information onto the
site.He said Taylor was known on the site as the 'nutty proffessor'and had 
posted a
message on the site to chief commissioner of victoria Police,Christine 
Nixon.Sen.Const.
Holland said the message stated that "...should you persist with this folly 
one of your
number will be selected for retirement,i.e.execution."
The prosecution called Senior Constable Nicholas Conte who said he had 
investigated video
and photographic footage from the May 1 protest,including video footage of 
Taylor in an
interview with Herald Sun journalist Peter Mickleburough.In it 
Sen.Conts.Conte said Taylor
reffered to himself as "Robin Banks."He said the name was on the indymedia 
website and was
traced back to Taylors adress by the computor Crime Unit.
He explained the concept of assasination politics to the court and said he 
believed it
originated in the United States where a man named Bell is currently under 
sentence in
relation to it.He said based on comments Taylor had made on the internet he 
believed the
defendant was advertising and trying to gain support for assasination 
politics.
"He doesnt make any qualms about that."Sen.Const.Conte said.
Asked by Mr Gibb what the reality of all this was,Sen.Const.Conte replied 
that he could not
gauge the reality,he could only look at the probability.
Under cross-examination from defense solicitor,Mr Cameron 
Ford,Sen.Const.Conte conceded
he did not know if assasination politics had ever resulted in an 
assasination or attempted
assasination.He said the investigation was continuing,with the Computor 
Crime Squad yet to
look at the content of Taylor's computor files.
Sen.Const.Holland said Taylors activities had attracted the attention of 
the US Secret Service
and Australian Federal police.
Mr Gibb said he did not doubt it,but expressed reservations about the 
conditions proposed for
Taylor's bail.
"It just seems to be a nonsense.Im being asked to impose all these 
conditions that bare no
relevance to the charges,"he said.
Mr Ford said the internet was something Taylor lives on and spends a great 
deal of time on.
"He would agree to not post threatening text on the internet,but that was 
as far as he was
prepared to go,"he said.
Mr Gibb released Taylor on bail with the condition that he not post 
threatening text on the
internet and continue to reside at his adress in Baynton 
street,Kyneton.Taylor was bailed to
appear before the Melbourne Magistrates Court on August 16.
END
A letter to this paper resulted in their publishing the further information 
that the police had
alleged me to be an anarchist where I stated that I was a may day 
celebrant(not m1 protestor)
to commemorate the judicial murder of the Chicago martyrs.several 
anarchists framed and hung in
Chicago's haymarket affair.I indicated that I was proud to be an anarchist 
and it was not illegal
to be one.This was cut from the main story for some reason.(copy of letter 
available on request
was published 1 week after story above.)Another local paper issued a 
clarification about me afterI rang them as they had described me as an M1 
protester.Spelling in the above article is 'as is'.
