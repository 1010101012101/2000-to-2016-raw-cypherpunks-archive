Let's get one thing out of the way immediately - I am not a business.  I'm just an individual 
offering you some information which I have found beneficial to me.  This isn't some hocus 
pocus hair-
brained scheme that's not exactly legal.  Nor is this information NOT of use to you!  What I 
am offering is something that is right for our time - something that our parents couldn't take 
advantage of, and something that our children may not be able to either.

Right now in human history, there's a "sweet spot" that the Internet has reached.  The 
Internet is still in it's relative infancy in that many people do not yet know how to use it for 
much more 
than reading the news and sending e-mail.  But it touches so many people's lives that there 
is untapped potential just WAITING to be used!!!  And it's times like this that allows those of 
us who 
KNOW how to use this tool to sell our "expertise" to those who want to know how.

"BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE INTERNET MYSELF" you may say.  Well, 
don't sweat it.  As you read on, you will find below 5 information packets which can get 
anyone, 
INCLUDING YOU, started using the Internet to further any business venture that you, or 
anyone else, may dream up.  And here's the best part!!!  After you have read this 
information yourself, 
you can start putting it to use RIGHT AWAY, helping other people to learn about the 
Internet and doing business using this new powerful tool.  And yes, you are bound to make 
money while 
doing so.

I absolutely CANNOT promise that you will NOT make any money, because it's just not true 
- this is not charity work!  KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, and the times we are living in have 
been 
dubbed the "Information Age".  So read on, and don't make up your mind either way until 
you've read this entire e-mail through.  I don't like the thought of people making decisions 
based on 
partial information.

Have you ever read the stories about inventors who came up with this BRILLIANT idea 
and made millions patenting and producing this product?  Must be nice, eh?  Well, not too 
many of us 
can think up a life-altering gadget or what-cha-ma-callit to make our income, myself 
included.  But I found that I didn't need my own idea to start with.  Remember those 5 
informatin packets I 
mentioned earlier?  Well, those packets, or "reports", cover such topics as performing legal 
bulk e-mailing over the Internet (still the best-proven method to reach clients), advertising for 
free on 
the Internet, and running an MLM company on the Internet.  People that DO have an idea 
for a product or business but don't know about the Internet will be ITCHING to get ahold of 
this 
information.  AND YOU CAN BE THE ONE TO GIVE IT TO THEM.  But you can't provide 
people something you don't have already, so here's what you've gotta do:

I don't know myself who exactly set this program up, but it's quite well done.  There are 5 
people on the list below, real people.  I should know - one of them is ME!  We each have 
all 5 reports 
already, we were once in your shoes: sitting, reading an e-mail similar to the one you're 
reading now, full of disbelief.  But we took the necessary action to get the ball rolling, and 
not one of us 
regret it, I'm sure.  The first step to take is ordering all 5 of these reports yourself.  You will 
then, in turn, be able to offer this information, or reports, to others, as I am offering them to 
you now.

So order all 5 reports shown on the list below.  For each report, send:
     - $5 CASH
     - the name and number of the report you are ordering
     - your e-mail address

Send these to the person whose name and address appears on the list below next to the 
report.  Be sure to order all five reports before adding your own name, and MAKE SURE 
YOUR 
RETURN ADDRESS IS ON THE ENVELOPE'S TOP LEFT CORNER in case there are 
any problems with it in the mail.

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 
reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.  Your total cost that 
you will 
EVER have to pay to get started in this program is $25.  $5 for each of the 5 reports.  
Shortly after you send your request for the reports you will receive, via e-mail, each  of the 5 
reports from 
these 5 different individuals.  Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you 
to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a backup copy of 
these 
reports on floppy, CD-R, backup tape, ANYTHING and keep it in a safe place.  With as 
valuable as you will find these reports to be, you won't want to let them out of your sight!

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or 
their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step 1 through 
6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you understand the way this works, you 
will also see how it does not work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if 
you alter it, it will NOT work!  People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all 
five spots thinking they could get all the money.  However, it does not work this way.  Some 
have tried 
to be greedy and have found out that it didn't work.  So do not try to change anything other 
than what is instructed.

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take list below and REMOVE the name & address 
of the person in REPORT # 5 position.  This person has made it through the cycle and is 
no doubt 
counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
=============================================================
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer.  DO 
NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this in your backup along with the reports just 
in case 
something happens to your computer.  Trust me - IT CAN HAPPEN.

As I mentioned, the 5 reports that you order actually contain useful information, not only for 
those who buy them from you, but also for you yourself!  They will provide you with 
invaluable 
marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more.

There are 2 main ways to get this program going for yourself:


METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
=============================================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.  Let's assume you and those 
involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive only 
a 0.2% 
response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%)  The more e-
mail sent out will also increase these figures.

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is 
only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10 people responded by moving you down to position 
#2, 
putting themselves in position #1 and sending out 5,000 e-mail each.  That's a total of 
50,000 e-mails sent.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails if only 0.2% responded with orders, that's 
100 people 
responding and ordering Report # 2.  Those 100 people move you down to position #3 and 
put themselves in position #1, then mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-
mails sent.  
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.  Those 1000 people move you 
down to position #4 and send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. 
The 0.2% 
response to that is 10,000 ORDERS for Report #4.  Finally, those 10,000 people move you 
to position #5 and send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails 
sent.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5.  That's 100,000 ORDERS for 
report #5.  At $5.00 each that's $500,000.00, or a half-million dollars.  See how this adds up 
quick?

Your total income in this example would be:
1..... $50
2..... $500
3..... $5,000
4..... $50,000
5..... $500,000
Grand Total=$555,550.00

Although 0.2% is a relatively small amount of responses, you can still see the kind of earning 
potential is out there for this program.  Even if only got a 0.1% response, that's still more 
than most 
of us make in several YEARS at our secular jobs!!!  Can you even imagine for a moment 
what would happen if everyone or half or even a quarter of the people sent out 100,000 e-
mails
each or more?  With over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, 
there's lots to be contacted!

METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==============================================
Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise.  Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We 
strongly suggest 
you start with Method #1 and move on to method #2 as you progress.  For every $5 you 
receive, all you have to do is e-mail the buyer the Report that they ordered. That's it!  
Always provide 
same day service on all orders to keep people happy with the program.  Remember, the 
longer you make them wait for the reports to get THEIR program going, the less enthusiasm 
they will 
have by the time you DO get it to them.  And remember - they can not advertise until they 
receive the report.

THE REPORTS
==============================================
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks are NOT 
accepted. Postal money orders purchased from the US Post Office are the only acceptable 
alternative. 
Make sure that any cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.  On one 
of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, 
YOUR E-
MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES!
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

- If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-
mails until you do
- After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders 
or more for REPORT #2
- If you did not,continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do
- Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2 YOU CAN RELAX, because 
the system is already working for you
- Now just sit back and watch the cash continue to roll in!!!
 
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.  
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering 
from 
you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the 
whole process again!!!  The possibilities are ENDLESS!!!

There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!

You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your 
life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.  You can make more money in 
the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined.

exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you 
have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 through #5 as instructed 
above.  One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your 
name

customers you will reach. So, my friend, I have given you the idea, information, materials
