Also, there had been some discussion of whether the crazy General 
was Chinese, and whether Neal had something against Chinese.
There were actually three crazy generals.  One was Macarthur (:-)
One was the Japanese general, who I think was only referred to as
"The General", who was responsible for the prison camp that 
buried all the gold and had the workers killer.
The other was General Wing (in the Randy Waterhouse thread),
who had been Goto Denko's coworker who escaped after they
flooded the gold storage mine.


				Thanks!
