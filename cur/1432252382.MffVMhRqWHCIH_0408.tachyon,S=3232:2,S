You may want to look into the Publius Censorship Resistant Publishing 
System. http://publius.cdt.org. This is a beta system currently, so 
is only a short term solution. But you could post a file to Publius, 
send the resulting URL out to cypherpunks and other lists, and then 
anyone could get a copy of the file anonymously. Michael
