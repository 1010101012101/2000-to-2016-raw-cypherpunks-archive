Linux Foundation announces project to "advance blockchain technology"
[Announcements] Posted Dec 17, 2015 17:35 UTC (Thu) by jake

The Linux Foundation has announced[1] a new collaborative project[2] to
"develop an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger framework"
to allow developers to build "robust, industry-specific applications,
platforms and hardware systems to support business transactions". Twenty
companies have joined the effort: Accenture, ANZ Bank, Cisco, CLS,
Credits, Deutsche BÃ¶rse, Digital Asset Holdings, DTCC, Fujitsu Limited,
IC3, IBM, Intel, J.P. Morgan, London Stock Exchange Group, Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), R3, State Street, SWIFT, VMware, and Wells
Fargo. "Many of the founding members are already investing considerable
research and development efforts exploring blockchain applications for
industry. IBM intends to contribute tens of thousands of lines of its
existing codebase and its corresponding intellectual property to this
open source community. Digital Asset is contributing the Hyperledger
mark, which will be used as the project name, as well as enterprise
grade code and developer resources. R3 is contributing a new financial
transaction architectural framework designed to specifically meet the
requirements of its global bank members and other financial
institutions. These technical contributions, among others from a variety
of companies, will be reviewed in detail in the weeks ahead by the
formation and Technical Steering Committees."
