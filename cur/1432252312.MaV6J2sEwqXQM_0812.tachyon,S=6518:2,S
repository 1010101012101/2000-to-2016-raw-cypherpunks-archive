Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?

10.12.2013 14:57

Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.

Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.

According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.

Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."

In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.

The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.

The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
said.

A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.

It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.
