[Please forward to relevant lists and forums]

The American Booksellers Foundation has asked me for examples of 
individuals being detained or escorted off planes, airports or other 
facilities based on their reading material.  They have expressed an 
interest in protecting our choice of reading material and want to 
take the appropriate action.

Please send any and all examples of people being harassed, 
banned,asked to leave,confiscation of the reading material- 
Anything- to me and I'll send it to them and share the information 
with all of you.  Thanks-


Regards,  Matt Gaylor-

ps I already have the Philadelphia example of "Hayduke Lives! by 
Edward Abbey"
