Of course. I'm not disagreeing with you here at all-- and in fact, I made a
similar point in a discussion here a week or so ago.  The rule of law is 
worthless without a mechanism to back it up; what could be more obvious? But
without it the weak, stupid, moral and isolated are entirely at the mercy of
the strong, clever, ruthless and organized. 

Without the Constitution, the government would be nothing more (and no better
than) an incredibly powerful gang. You think there's abuse of power now, what
do you suppose would happen with no law to stand in their way of stamping out
whoever they damn well pleased? If there were no law and you opposed such a 
monstrous supergang, do you really expect you would come out ahead? Or even stay
alive? How? Serious questions.

I never said they did: through the mechanism of the judicial system (backed up
by the aptly named "law enforcement") they serve as a check on people acting to
destroy society. The Founders had it right all along, you can't blame them for
the complete hash subsequent administrations made of the American system. 


>You should rely more on your guns and less on your papers.

Isn't that precisely what all corrupt, evil and tyrranical police and statist
government officials everywhere say? 

I'm sure Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and every two-bit petty dictator since the
beginning of time would agree with you.
