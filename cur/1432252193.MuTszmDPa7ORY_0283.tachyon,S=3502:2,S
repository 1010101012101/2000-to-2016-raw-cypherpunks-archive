as a matter of fact, he DOES have a point. consumers have become the
weaker part of the market food chain because they are not organized and
because they ARE sheep. they'll cry murder every time you steal
something from them, but never actually do something, and the few who do
are too isolated to be even noticed.
corporations, on the other hand, have been far more intelligent. from
MPAA/RIAA straight to WTO they understood that lobby groups can increase
their influence greatly and turn the playing field to their advantage.
it's only fair to reply in kind and organize the consumers. or rather:
the 0.1% of them who give a damn.
