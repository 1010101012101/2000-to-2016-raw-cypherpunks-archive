	More interesting by far would be to write software that sanitized the text. 

	Learning to write with a *different* fingerprint should be easy. Remebering which "style" goes with which nym would be tougher, but not undoable. Having a software filter would be optimal.

	Sort of an advanced version of the Swedish Chef or Jive filters. 

	Proably already done and discussed during a period when I was taking a break from this list.
