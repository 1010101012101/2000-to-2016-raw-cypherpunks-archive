Fortunately, my goals do not include either of those. :) And I think my
comment was somewhat unfair: The original OpenPGP standard was well thought
out (but ultimately insecure). It just became a horrifying with three more
major versions.

As this is cypherpunks: I wish more folks were working on making
steganography for encrypted mail more practical. It seems, for example,
entirely feasible, to encode encrypted mail as (nonsense but
grammatical) sentences in the user's language. I would be happy to deploy
a proposal that accomplished something like this with < ~25% overhead,
which seems doable, but hard.

(This is something that will be essential for users in countries like
China...)
