I understand their original reasons for the bump-in-the-wire model,
but I'm glad to hear they are making a cryptophone, because I don't
really want to have some other device there.  I want it integrated.
I'll wait to see what they come out with.  Another thing that would be
even more cool would be a cordless phone.  I will certainly buy these
things when they are shipping them, if they are somewhere in the $1000
range.
