Center for Disease Control Investigating Second Anthrax Case
By Chris Dolmetsch


Fort Lee, New Jersey, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The Center for Disease 
Control is investigating a second case of anthrax poisoning in Florida, 
financial network CNBC reported, citing NBC News.

One man is already hospitalized in critical condition in a Florida 
hospital with the deadly disease, CNBC said. The disease is not 
contagious between people. No further details were given.
"

Two cases of anthrax in Florida, if this is true, when there have been 
very few cases in the past 100 years. (And even fewer pulmonary cases...)

And right where the WTC pilots were living and training.

(BTW, the incubation period for anthrax is up to 60 days...)

"Gun Control: The theory that a woman found dead in an alley, raped and
strangled with her panty hose,  is somehow morally superior to a woman 
explaining to police how her attacker got that fatal bullet wound"
