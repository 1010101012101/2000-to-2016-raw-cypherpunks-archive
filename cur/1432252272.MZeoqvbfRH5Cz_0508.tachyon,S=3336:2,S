 From John Stossel, pretty funny:

>This week's "Give Me A Break!" is about Montgomery County's new ban on
>smoking in your own home if it bothers a neighbor.  It's not surprising that
>Montgomery County is the first to do this; it is right next to Washington
>D.C., where politicians are famous for running other people's lives.
>
>Montgomery County is also home to the mayor I interviewed recently, after he
>banned smoking outdoors in his town.  He said it was necessary to "protect
>the children."  After the interview, he went to the National Cathedral,
>where he worked as an usher, and in the men's room, touched the genitals of
>a 14 year old boy.  After pleading guilty to sexual abuse, he lost on the
>smoking front too--judges tossed out his town's ban on outdoor smoking.
>
>But the county's move on "at home" smoking hasn't been overturned.  What's
>next?  Loud children?  Perfume?  Cooking with onions?
>
>Smoke frightens me lots less than sanctimonious politicians.
