An "International Day of Action..."

Gee, why are so many EFF and similar events sounding so much like Lefty 
events from the 60s?

"National Mobilization Against Online Imperialism"

"Teach-in to protest corporatism"

"Join our circle today"

"Jane Fonda and Abbe Hoffman need our help."

"Perform for a video camera today!"

"Fight the fascist insects who prey upon the life of the people."
