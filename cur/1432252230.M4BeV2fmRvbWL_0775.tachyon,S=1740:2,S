we don't know - or it wouldn't be random :)
for a sufficiently large sample you *should* see roughly equal numbers of
heads and tails in the average case - but :
for 32 coins in 2^32 tests you should see:
one occurance of all heads (and one of all tails)
32 occurances of one tail, 31 heads (and 32 of one head, 31 tails)
496 occurances of two
and so forth up the chain
none of these are guaranteed - it *is* random after all - but given a
sufficiently large number of tests, statistically you should see the
above.
