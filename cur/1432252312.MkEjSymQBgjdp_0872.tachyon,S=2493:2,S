Of relevance to SSL and trust in DNS...

Even without stealing keys, there are unconventional ways of
circumventing SSL server authentication.  That is, pretending to be an
SSL server that you are not.

For instance, a client might forget to verify in a resumed SSL session
that the server hostname matches the CN involved with the original
connection.  If the client starts a resumable session with a server,
that server can pretend to be other hosts.  Examples:
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-05.html
http://snafu.fooworld.org/~fubob/netscape-ssl.html

There is not a well-defined trust model for proxied SSL content.  SSL
authenticates servers, not content.  Example:
http://www.mit.edu:8008/menelaus/bt/17272

Even if SSL were perfect, implementing certificate management will
remain tricky.
