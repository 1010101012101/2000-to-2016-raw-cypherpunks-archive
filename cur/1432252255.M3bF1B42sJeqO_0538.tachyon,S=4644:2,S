EMBRYONIC stem cells injected into the brain corrected the symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease in rats by transforming into neurons that made 
dopamine, a key brain chemical.
In a study appearing today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences, researchers at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital in 
Belmont, Massachusetts, showed in tests that in rats whose brains had been 
chemically damaged, embryonic stem would spontaneously convert to correct 
the Parkinson's symptoms.
Some experts said the study was significant because it showed embryonic 
stem cells may be used to treat brain disorders, but they cautioned that 
the cells also possibly could cause tumours.
Dr Ole Isacson, senior author of the study, said that if further 
experiments were successful, there could be human trials of the technique 
in about five years.
Federally funded research on human embryonic stem cells is limited because 
producing such cells requires the death of human embryos.
President George W Bush last northern summer approved some such research, 
but limited it to cell colonies that already exist - about 60 cell lines.
Many researchers believe that embryonic stem cells hold the promise of 
creating new organs or cells to replace or renew ailing hearts, 
livers...There you go mr president!
