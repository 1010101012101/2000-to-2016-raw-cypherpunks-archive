Since we're in hair-splitting mode, I should point out that "prevents
the denial of an act" is not equivalent to a "negation that something is
false". Of course, logically, it comes to the same thing, but then, so
does "assertion that something is true". Assuming you believe in
excluded middles, that is (which, of course, you don't, as you have
said).

But the important point is that the mechanism could be (and usually is)
entirely different.

Blimey. I appear to be agreeing with Ed.

Cheers,

Ben.
