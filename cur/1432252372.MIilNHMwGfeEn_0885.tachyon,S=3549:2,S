Back in 1999, Steve Lihn posted to cypherpunks and some other mailing
lists about his new online payment system, ecoin.net.  He intended to
work towards a blind coin system based on David Wagner's alternative to
Chaum blinding, as implemented by Ben Laurie in the lucre library.

Surprisingly, he is still in business.  Some recent press releases:

   8/15/01 eCoin OutExchange service is released. You can transfer fund
           to/from PayPal and e-Gold. Login and check it out.
   
   7/25/01 Anonymous Cash Certificate is released. MMDH is finally in
           commercial use. Login and check it out.
   
   6/30/01 PayPal Payment Interface is supported. Now you can transfer
           fund from your credit card by PayPal.
   
   6/25/01 Managed Access Solution is released. Use eCoin to pay your
           subscription!
   
   1/16/01 eCoin.net announces that e-Gold payment interface is formally
           supported. You will be able to purchase eCoins through your
           e-Gold account!

Sounds like it might be worth it just for the transfer to/from PayPal.
Also could be an alternative way to fund your e-Gold account anonymously.
With the blinding it could be a real anonymous payment system.  Credit
card to PayPal, PayPal to eCoin, transfer eCoin anonymously, then from
eCoin back to PayPal.  Anyone want to try a transfer experimentally?
