Yes, this is where I first saw it.

I don't know if "Nomen Nescio" added any twists, so to speak, to the 
cave example, but he should not have paraphrased the cave example 
without some credit. (When I give my explanation of ZKIPS in terms of 
Hamiltonian cycles, which I certainly did not invent, I give enough 
informal comments to make it clear that this was not some invention on 
my part.)
