Yes of course - the point of signing something is a promise.  The act of
signing by pen is just being transformed into a different kind of act.
I think typing a pass phrase is better than a click, but we'll see what

Graham, there are many university profs interested in security on the net,

not sure they are following consumers, but a web search on "medical

Patience, persistence, truth,
