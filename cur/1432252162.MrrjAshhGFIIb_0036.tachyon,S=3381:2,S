"Money in the US was largely privately issued until 1915.
Capitalism long predates government monopolies of money.
The word dollar comes from thaler, which a government stamped
ounce of silver -- but stamped by a minor government very far
away, one of many such stamping authorities."

Very interesting,relevant, not much,but fascinating.Can we talk of e-money 
replacing the present shared hallucination now?

"The state is the enemy of property, not the source. Property
rights in the means of production not only continued to exist
without state support, where the state was absent, they
invariably continued to exist in the face of massive bloody
state violence aimed at crushing those rights. Always, those
seeking to crush those rights had to escalate far beyond what
they expected, then escalate the violence even further."

Whatever the state is,its the enemy,right james?The biggest state at 
present is the US.There seems to some bad socialism creeping into the way 
airlines and others are being handled.The point I keep trying to make is 
the state is the guarantor  of  exploitive,authoritarian capitalism and 
anarchy esp crypto anarchy is the best way to fight that.Anarchy not 
libertarian party Kool-aid.Can we talk about this more at the airport bar? 
Aussi beer is the best.mattd.
