Just a tiny interesting operation found out via routine misspelling that can
breed paranoia in idle minds:

sprint has smtp to SMS gateway for its customers running at
messaging.sprintpcs.com, so if you e-mail to 
tendigitnumber@messaging.sprintpcs.com the user gets message on the phone.


Interestingly enough, there is also valid domain messaging.sprintpsc.com (note
the swapped last two letters) that resolves to no less than 8 IP addresses.
Someone wants it really reliable:

Addresses:  69.25.27.171, 66.150.161.141, 69.25.27.170, 69.25.27.172
          66.150.161.133, 66.150.161.140, 66.150.161.134, 66.150.161.136

sprintpsc.com is operated by po-box identified entity:

Registrant:
 Acme Mail
 Box 455
 Miami, FL 33265
 US
 305-201-4774 
 

and of course messages sent to tendigitnumber@messaging.sprintpcs.com do not
end up on sprint's subscriber handset.

Could be completely coincidental, of course.
