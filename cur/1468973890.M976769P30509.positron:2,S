Feel free to demonstrate how the USA champions democratic principles,
respect for sovereignty (national and individual - corporation
sovereignty is the problem, not the solution) and the rule of law, as it
(the USA BIMSIC - banking, industrial, military, suveillance, injustice
complex) drones humans to death, every day, in at least 12 countries.

Feel free to initiate a thread on how we might engender, induce or
otherwise educate our fellow humans to find authority within themselves,
to stand for a principle greater than meat pies and footy, and to act in
pursuance of such a principle. Many of us a flat out of ideas - really.

And also, feel free to point out how "my" "democratically elected"
"leaders" here in Australia are really doing a fine and upstanding job
at the helm of this great land, how we should all, individually and
collectively be striving to emulate them and how this will lead us into
a better place, a better world, a better future.

Please, and seriously, any such bit of positive news would be good for
my ears as much as for yours, 'cause mostly all I see going on all
around the world today is ludicrous unethical evil actions, idiots
strutting around as "leaders" spouting abominations against all human
decency, common sense and righteousness!

Please, do enlighten me - I'll wait...
