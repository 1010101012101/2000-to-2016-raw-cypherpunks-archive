I think that many managers in this situation would feel reassured that both
Intel and Microsoft would be handling these sensitve documents.  Else why
do lawyers use Microsoft systems to send unencrypted documents between
offices?

ad technicalities: Just one more level of indirection^Wencryption would
answer the objections of those few managers of exquisite sensibilities, who
worry about Intel/Microsoft reading their documents.

oo--JS.
