That's what we all believed.  From Wikipedia (I haven't checked the  
primary references):

======================
In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:

In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard 
(DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its 
own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and 
engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a 
modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and 
brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer 
modification."[8]

and

NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except 
brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. 
Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 
64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.[9]

Conclusion?  We wuz tricked!  In their own words, they managed the entire 
process, and succeeded in convincing everyone that they did not.  And they 
made it weaker where they held the advantage:  budget to crunch.  Last two 
sentences, above.


> If history is a guide, weakness that TLAs insist on are transparent. They are about (effective) key size.

Indeed.  Notice the subtlety of their attack:  it is brutally simple. We 
others focus on elegance, and dismiss the simplistic.

Cognitive dissonance?

They focussed on mission, and used asymmetry of crunch strength.  Recall  
that, in the old days, no other country could muster the budget and  
technology that they could.


> We have no way to know whether this will continue to be the case, but I'd imagine that the gap in knowledge between the NSA and the academic community diminishes over time; so that makes me think that they'd be even more reluctant to try to slip in a hidden weakness today than in 1975.


Possibly.  In terms of algorithms, I don't think there has been a case  
where they've deliberately weakened the algorithm.  OTOH, in terms of key 
strength, they have been very very finessed.  Remember Skipjack? The 
comments at the time was that the key strength was beautifully aligned - 
right at the edge.  80 bit keys where the open community had already 
concluded 128 was the target.  Which meant that if there was to be an 
advantage, all that was left was:  budget in crunching.
