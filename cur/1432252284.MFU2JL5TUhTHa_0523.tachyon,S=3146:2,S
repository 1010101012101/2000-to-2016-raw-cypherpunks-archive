I just got back to DC today (was out of state for the weekend), and I'm
sad to admit that out of all the 400K+ population cities I can imagine,
Washington is particularly ill-suited to deal with anthrax, let alone
prepare a reasonable response.

The mail arrived today, but I fear that packages (I'm expecting a 1 GB
IBM microdrive to be shipped via the post) will be delayed for a
while.
