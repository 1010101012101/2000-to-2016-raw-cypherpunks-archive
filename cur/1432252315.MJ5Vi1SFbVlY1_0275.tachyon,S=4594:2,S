And that's what gets to me. For fucks' sake, people like Weev or Swartz=

discover holes left by somebody else, why are they the ones getting pun=

for it? If somebody made a faulty tool, they would pay, not the user ex=

the problem.

Maybe it's time to try to get some vendor liability/warranty going? I s=

when thinking about that, as that would pose a huge problem for Free So=
ftware,=20
I guess, but I think it is worth exploring anyway.
