It was a deliberate decision on Bram Cohen's part. BT is a very useful medium
to deliver software updates, movies und most for what there are currently
broadcast media for.

If you want to be invisible to lawyers, you have to use something else.

(Or at least run BT on a large zombie cloud, so you have plausible
deniability).

If a network has been declared illegal, and you're a part of that network,
and somebody receives packets from you which are part of IP-protected binary
blob, and your ISP rats on you, your ass is grass with the right kind of IP
nazi legislation.

Obvously, the only way to prevent that from happening is not be part of that
network, not make your ISP rat on you -- or, much better, do not let that
legislation happen at all.

If it does happen, freedom becomes illegal.

Web pages have static addresses in DNS. Search on P2P in dynamic IP is much
more ephemeral, and requires ISPs to keep track of (customer IPv4
time_period)
tuples long enough so that their logs can be subpoenaed.
