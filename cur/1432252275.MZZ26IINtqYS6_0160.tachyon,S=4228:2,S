Research Programmer

RAND is seeking a Research Programmer to work on various information

is preferred that the individual have familiarity with various applied

systems. Under general supervision, the research programmer will be
expected to search, monitor and track information and software tools that
relate and leverage off these measures in the context of information

More generally, the position requires skills in searching for highly

a project's use.

Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, or other quantitative or computer

methods, policy analysis, and critical infrastructure protection.

Specific technical skills required:
Thorough technical knowledge of current computer operating systems (e.g.,
Linux, Solaris, Open BSD, Windows), and programming languages (e.g.,
Lisp, Prolog, C, Perl). Must be extremely proficient in such Internet and
Web technologies as anonymizing sites, IRC and "chat rooms," and
downloading and investigating properties of hacker "toolkits" and related
software. Ability to organize and structure information within a database
for project use is mandatory.

Related experience required: 3 - 5 years

Type of experience required/preferred:
Applicant should have excellent interpersonal skills, be able to conduct
independent investigations of online sites, and participate in online
dialogs
(IRC, chats) by gaining the trust of relevant persons. Experience with the
