Hello. My name is Sandy and I had seen an article that you had or have
disney dollars. The reason I am asking is that my father is a currency
collector and is looking for the disney dollars. As you know that the
old versions are of course very hard to find. Him being with out web
access, it is my job to help is seek and find the newest craze to
currency collecting. If you could be of any help, I would deeply
appreciate it. Thanks for your time and have a wonderful week.
Sandy
Manhattan,KS
