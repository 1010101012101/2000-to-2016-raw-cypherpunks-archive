Subject: New stuff with Envelope Mail

I've done a bunch more work on Envelope Mail, as always, the latest info
is at -

http://gawth.com/bram/envelope_mail/

New is actual code, complete with test code. Plans are next to write a
patch for BoboMail implementing the dummy version of the crypto API.

I could use immediate help on the following things -

A logo - I'm incapable of graphic design

A non-dummy version of the crypto API - the dummy one makes it
excruciatingly clear how the real one should work and gives a strong
indication of how it might be implemented. I'd make the 'real' one myself,
but, you know, you're not supposed to do that, and I'm trying to play
nice, despite the crypto community being remarkably unhelpful in this
regard.
