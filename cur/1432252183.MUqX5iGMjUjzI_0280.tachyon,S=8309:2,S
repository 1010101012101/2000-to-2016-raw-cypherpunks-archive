German is but one of _many_ descendants of Proto-Indo-European.

My favorite dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary, has extensive
etymologies tracing to PIE. Note that often the words have Greek and
Latin cognates, meaning in most cases an etymology distinct from German.

Lots of English, Norse, Dutch, and German words have the "gl" sound:
glitter, glisten, glimmer,  gleaming, gloaming, gloss, glow, glower,
gold, guild, guilder, gall, cholera, even Sanskrit words.

Left as an exercise: the PIE origins of "mark" (another common word for
a unit of money), "dollar" (ditto), and "crown." For extra credit,
"peso," "peseta," and variants. For extra extra credit, "florin."

Here's the entry:

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
