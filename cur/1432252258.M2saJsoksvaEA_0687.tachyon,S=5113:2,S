I didn't mean the imply the Ipaq CPU (200MHz StrongARM) would be
insufficient, merely that from usability standpoint.

The "holy grail" would be working on 16-33MHz *dragonball* (== 68000)
processors.  *That* would be impressive.  Doing this on a strongarm is easy.

I'm not sure what the audio output from the ericsson bluetooth headset
is, when it connects to a PDA.

I've asked Monty (the ogg guy) and some others, and they think a 50MHz
ARM7 is more than sufficient for the compression; getting it down a
33MHz 68000 (like in the recent high-end palm devices) would be cool.
