Why pity Martha Stewart, so far she's escaped the pokey,
despite first wide-mouthed reports was sentenced to 20
years, then that was shaved to half, then further trimmed
to a few years, to settle somewhere between probation
and walking free, maybe even suing the feds for defamation,
loss of wealth, and, if truly not a super bitch of riches, 
overthrowing the government.

Martha may yet reap the benefit of adoration of the
fabulously wealthy, who always get a cut in slack, to be sure
paying for it with small handouts and tips, and having to
hide the trappings of disproportionate moola once the
lesson is learned to not new-rich flaunt it -- build a church
for every yacht.

The old rich know to lay low, let the new mints take the
hit, maybe even report the most vulgar to the authorities
to camouflage deeply embedded thievery with shallow.
One is known to get up in fund-raising fetes to say "My
family foundation gives a million," to prime the yokels' 50K.
Then gets a cut of the take, like Paulie.

Sure, it's hell being a criminal capitalist in the US, where 
profligate display of stupidly expensive over-priced doohickies 
is all the numbnuts can think to do with more money than
they ever dreamed of having, or ever dreamed of having
taken from them by venal racket protectors of their horde.

Prosecutors and FBI can never do as much harm to the rich
as their immediate family, associates, lawyers, doctors,
lovers, underlings, servants, bodyguards, alarm installers,
not to say treacherous architects of their panic palaces.

Just pay your inflated bill, you PoS, sweetheart tips on the 

market aint bankable. The Stewart story is a cover-up,
didn't you know it? All these commiserators don't work
for nothing.
