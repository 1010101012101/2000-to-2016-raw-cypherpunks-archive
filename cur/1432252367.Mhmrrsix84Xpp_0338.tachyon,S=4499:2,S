No, just a reasonable man asking you not to piss where we drink.

Jim, you're being a jerk. When I post long texts, I post only the 
text, even if I have to pull the page source into emacs to do so.
If appropriate, I post the URL instead. This is common courtesy.

As you say, it's an open list. No one can actually stop you from
being a jerk except yourself. However, as your jerk index increases,
people gradually pay less and less attention to you. It hurts your
reputation, which is the closest thing to gold you possess in an
online form such as this.

There's a difference between (1) being a sheep, and (2) acting with
consideration; a difference which appears to be too subtle for you.
