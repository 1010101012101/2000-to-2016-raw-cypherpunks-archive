It just makes formal (and official) what has existed for a long time.  The
guy with the most money can do whatever the fuck s/he wants to, with no
regard to any rule of law or social responsibility, and there isn't anyone
who wants to change that.

After all, if we really wanted to change it, it wouldn't be just four or
five cpunks bitching on a now obsolete mailing list - it would be citizens
with guns storming the halls of congresscritters.
