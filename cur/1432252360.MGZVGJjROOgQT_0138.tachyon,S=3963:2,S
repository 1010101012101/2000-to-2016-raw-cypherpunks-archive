Tim is both right and wrong. 

It's almost unthinkable that he or anyone else will be asked to turn in
their 
old hardware. But 'They' don't have to. All that needs to be done is to 
mandate that all *new* hardware have the TCPA/DRM hobbles. 

Moore's law will do the rest. 

Sure, people can swap old Babylon 5 episodes on DIVX for as long as they 
want, but Moore's law will have stopped for uncrippled machines - Want to 
interact with full immersion VR 1Mpixel x 1Mpixel games and dramas with 
serious AI? How about full-sensorium telepresence? Those ain't gonna run 
on your  2 GHz Pentium, any more than you can run Descent 3 or 
Netscape on your VIC-20. You'll want, and need the newest 30 GHz
machines, and guess what? They *all* have TCPA/DRM.
