For those who care, take a look at http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/opinion/10KRUG.html 
which is an op-ed piece by an MIT Economics prof. describing the California 
situation in the same terms I have.   He cites a paper which in turn cites 
evidence that artificial shortages were previously created in the UK (1996) 
and California (1998 & 1999).   Unfortunately no detail, but it is more 
than just random conspiracy theory.

While no doubt a good number of the readers of this list will consider him 
to be a Communist from the People's Republic of Cambridge, perhaps most 
will at least admit he knows more than basic economics 101.  

Even if you don't care about natural gas or California's deregulation brownout,
 it is a good example of why "free" markets, economies, societies, etc. 
 don't really work.
