                                Amendment IV

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,
and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.

The above places NO burden of proof or action on the acused. It also
places no exemptions on what may be searched once probable cause is
demonstrated. It further places no limits on searches based on the
intended targets desires or state of mind. The issue of 'private' or
'public' is specious with respect to legaly executed searches.

The 1st doesn't say that 'speech' or 'press' can't be searched.

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
