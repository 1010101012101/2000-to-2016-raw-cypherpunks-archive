No, that's not it: the only "trust" you give them comes with getting you on 
the first page in the first place, not what you come to think of it 
afterward. Surely you dont mean to say you never make choices of what to 
read based on something's potential value to you. Haven't you ever picked 
up a book because you anticipated enjoying it, started reading it, and put 
it down when you realized the methodology was flawed or the scholarship was 
poor after all? If not, maybe you need to be more discriminate... I bet you 
have though, and aren't quite the non-judgemental tabula rasa your comments 
indicate.

Agh, not personality, it comes back to the matter of not wasting time: Some 
people seldom have anything to say that I find remotely interesting, so 
I've learned it's in my best interest to skip them. On the other hand, some 
people put really put some effort into their contributions and write in a 
relevant and thoughtful way--so when I'm pressed for time, (as I usually 
am) I read them first. If the subject is important enough I'll read all the 
comments, but otherwise it gets prioritized, like everything else. And none 
of this has the slightest thing to do with whether or not I agree with or 
like someone. Jeez, who haven't I argued with here...

Absolutely.  I just happen to think you can have the highest degree of 
respect for someone's work you don't agree with, and that people you do 
agree with shouldn't get a free pass. Check the archives, that's basically 
what I've said all along.

Look for? There's reading and then there's recommending. ;)

Oy vey, that's what I've already said... I don't think anyone would exactly 
characterize my views as representative of the list as a whole either. Or 
maybe you don't see it, being focused on your own "me versus the list" 
dynamic, eh?

No, not at all actually. Believe it or not, I'm not so arrogant and self-
assured that I have to agree with someone to be able to admit when they've 
got their opposition thoroughly outclassed in terms of sheer knowledge of 
the subject. Unlike other people in the room, the topic wasn't something I 
was heavily invested in in terms of reputation, career etc: anyone who 
tries to deny that makes a difference in how open-minded they are is 
fooling themselves. But everthing about the way he conducted himself 
presenting his arguments merited respect.  If you can't change your mind in 
the face of new evidence, you're too dogmatic, not intellectually flexible 
enough. Sure, he influenced me, where's the shame in admitting that. 
Learning from someone doesnt mean you gave up your own independent 
judgement. And I'd rather change my mind than be an ignorant blockhead 
stuck in an ideological rut. Like far too many I'm sure we both could name.


>and now you pursue that. Me, I'd hunt for the holes in his theory/argument 
>(and I guarantee they are there).

Of course. And if it were my main area of interest, you can bet he'd be the 
first person I'd go to to argue with and sound my own theories out on.


I'll save the second half for tomorrow...
