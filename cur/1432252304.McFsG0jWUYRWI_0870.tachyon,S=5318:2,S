Probably coincidental that so many of these surveillance conferences
are taking place as official-commercial-advocacy-institutional 
(gov-com-org-edu) surveillance funding has become more widely
distributed in clear and in dark.

"Honey trap" is unfair to these good-hearted initiatives which would
likely deny, quasi-truthfully, that they are unwitting tools to siphon ideas,
means and methods, names and biometrics -- and recruit talented
rodents to feed security vultures.

Talented rats could siphon in return and a share the entrailed muck
despite NDAs and secrecy agreements. But will not happen
once the ingested perqs are channeled into feed to shit to sewer to 
befouled landscape. Paranoia is big biz gov-com-org-edu contamination.

ISS lays it on the table, spying and anti-spying are wonderfully 
enriching, spread suspicion.

Others might ignore the polite invitations to herd into paranoia feeding 
pens. Starve the befoulers underwriting them.
