Damn, I spent ages looking up that word.
M-W doesn't list it, true, so here it is from
http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=pedanty

pedanty \Ped"ant*y\, n. An assembly or clique of pedants. [Obs.]

Just because it's obsolete doesn't mean I can't use it. Froom, froom and 
more froom...

The mistaken claimed lack of analogy was a slip on my part. Sorry.

Instead of just miserably pointing out "oh, you're wrong", it'd be 
infinitely more helpful if you could at least attempt to correct 
somebody on their errors. I don't know everything. Everyone makes 
mistakes. Thanks to georgemw for lending a hand though.
