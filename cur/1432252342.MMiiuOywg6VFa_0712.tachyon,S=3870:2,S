Sounds great. Let us know if you have any questions or run into any
problems.

Depending on how you're installing, you might like the development
version (currently 0.2.1.16-rc). The 0.2.1.x series is going to become
the new "stable" soon (it's already probably more stable in practice
than 0.2.0.35), and it's way better in a number of other ways.

But either 0.2.0.x or 0.2.1.x is fine, really.

That's a really good point.

Especially since a lot of the people who really hate/fear Tor are IT
folks who don't understand it.

Yep. The next step is to come up with some really good clean simple
example sentences for our new category. Those examples will dictate the
title we give it -- "Security experts use Tor", "Sysadmins use Tor",
"Computer experts use Tor", or something else.

If anybody knows good places, please let us know. :) There's a small
list being built here:
https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/GoodBadISPs

Another concern is that if we centralize all the exit relays in a few
places, we reduce the anonymity that the Tor network can provide. But I
don't think we're anywhere near doing that yet, so it's just something
to keep in the back of our minds.

Me too. Don't worry, we won't do it. But see also
