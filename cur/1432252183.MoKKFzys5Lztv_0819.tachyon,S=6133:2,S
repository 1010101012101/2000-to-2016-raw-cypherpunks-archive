According to the US Government though they are not soldiers. They are 
"unlawful enemy combattants".

The war in Afghanistan is over. This is were they were caught. Thus they 
should be released, no? If they are terrorists and they have proof of 
this they should put them in front of a court (and I guess that should 
be a civil court, not a military tribunal as I don't quite see since 
when the US Army is performing law enforcement duties).

But they are not POWs by their own account. If they could be charged 
with any of these crimes above, then what takes two years to actually 
convict them?

Some of them ARE US Citizens. Others are citizens of other states. 
International Law means that if I (holding a German passport) have to be 
allowed to contact MY government in order to receive any aid that I 
might require. This right has not been given.

Granted, I would not be protected under the rights of the US 
constitution, but I do have other rights and those are clearly violated 
as well.

Treason would need to be proofen. Considering that no charges have been 
brought forward after almost two years it is pretty clear (or at least 
appears to be) that there is no proof that any of these people did 
anything wrong.

It doesn't. But if that would be the case than the captured Afghans 
should be returned to the Afghan authorities, why is this not happening?

May as it be, but that still doesn't make the actions of the US 
Government right. Or are you telling me right now that Guantanamo Bay 
and Diego Garcia are part of a humanitarian mission?

Bad conditions, so help the Afghani government to improve the conditions.
