            Man Accused of Spiking Trees
            for Radical Environmental
            Group
            The Associated Press

            BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - An alleged member of a
            radical environmental group connected to a series of
            arsons and other crimes has been arrested for
            putting spikes in trees to destroy logging equipment.

            Frank B. Ambrose, 26, is accused of driving 10-inch
            spikes into trees last June in an area of the
            Morgan-Monroe State Forest slated for logging.

            Authorities believe Ambrose is affiliated with the
            Earth Liberation Front, a loosely knit group that
            claimed responsibility for spiking the trees.

            The ELF has claimed responsibility for 22 major
            crimes, including arson attacks and other acts of
            sabotage across the country. The FBI has attributed
            $37 million in damage since 1996 to the group.

            In a statement released Thursday, Ambrose denied
            spiking the trees. After his arrest, he refused to
            answer questions, including whether he's affiliated
            with the ELF.

            Ambrose told The Herald-Times of Bloomington he
            was targeted by authorities for publicly refusing to
            condemn destroying property to prevent harm to the
            environment.

            "Is it illegal to say that? It may not be popular with
            some people, but it doesn't mean I was involved in it,"
            he said.

            A six-month investigation by state conservation
            officers and the FBI traced the spiking nails to
            Ambrose through store surveillance tapes. According
            to an affidavit, Abrose's car was spotted outside the
            forest at the time of the incident, and police found
            hammering and metal-cutting tools and cotton gloves
            with a residue similar to that from the spikes in
            Ambrose's apartment.

            Ambrose is the Midwest coordinator for the
            American Lands Alliance, a mainstream
            environmental group headed by former Indiana
            congressman Jim Jontz.

            "American Lands doesn't support tree spiking," Jontz
            said from his Portland, Ore., office. "Of course, I
            hope that these allegations aren't true."

            Ambrose was released on $2,000 bond and is
            scheduled to appear in court Feb. 2. Tree spiking is
            a felony in Indiana punishable with up to three years
            in prison and a $10,000 fine.

            Leslie Pickering, a spokesman for the North
            American Earth Liberation Front, said he is not sure
            if Ambrose is a member of the ELF.

            Conservation officer Marlin Dodge said it is hard to
            prove involvement in the group.

            "There's no way you'll ever prove who an ELF is," he
            said. "However, we're prepared to show that he did a
            criminal act that ELF took responsibility for."
