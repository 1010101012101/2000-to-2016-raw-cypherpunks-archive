Cypherpunks are not the first to take advantage of 
jurisdictional arbitrage.

The Australian spys have the American spys perform their 
illegal-in-Australia acts for them, and the American spys
have the Australian spys perform their illegal-in-America
acts for them.

I predict you will have some difficulty extraditing an 
Australian spy for spying on people in California.
