Are you tired of trying the same old things, <BR>that produce the same old results, <BR>and cost more and more each time?<BR><BR>

We have something that can make your marketing come alive.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="helvetica, arial, sans-serif" color="green"><B>It's called the eDirect and it can:</B></font><BR>

<B><li>Increase sales
<li>Generate new leads
<li>Direct traffic to your web site
<li>Promote a sale
<li>Announce a trade show</B><BR>
And much, much more.
<BR><BR>

Traditionally, direct marketing has always generated measurable results. You know that when you deliver a message directly to your target's home or office you will continually receive a 2% to 15% return. It's all about numbers. <BR><BR>

Well, here's a new way to reach your market at 1/3 the cost and has already proven to generate double the average response rate of traditional direct marketing.<BR>
<B><li>No printing
<li>No postage
<li>And no hassles</B><BR>
Just measurable results that are affordable!<BR><BR>
We figured out a way to generate qualified leads inexpensively.<BR> 
We can crank it up when you need leads and turn it down when <BR>you've had enough.<BR><BR>

We could explain it all here or just link you to a demonstration of this new tool. <BR>
It's a cool, interactive, red viewer. Try it, click below.

ARE YOU AWARE THAT... each year, over 400 million trees are cut down to provide paper<BR> for "postal" bulk mail in the United States alone?
