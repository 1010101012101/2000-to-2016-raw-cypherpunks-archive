That's nonsense.  Please explain the informational content of the word
"cunt" as you used it.  By the way, there is no validity in trying to hand
the "PC" sign on me for two reasons:  a) I'm about as far as you can get
from being PC, and b) your use PC accusation makes sense ONLY if your use of
the word "cunt" was meant as a general reference to women.  You cannot have
it both ways.
