     Which brings this to mind again. This and the Where to go
thread. So where and what are the disenfranchised to go and do? 
I'm a middle aged IT professional, recently downsized from a 
very good job. I also have a felony conviction for selling pot
back in the 60's -- big deal, eh? Well it is now -- I've been 
turned down for three jobs because they did a background check.
I no longer even bother to apply if they mention background
or drug checks -- which rules out one hell of a lot of places
these days and it's on the increase. I never had a background
check before this for any job. What does that have to do
with my ability to write code? 
    I'm seriously considering taking up robbing banks -- what the
hell, my health isn't too good, I have no insurance, can't get
a job -- and fuck no, I won't work at Hardees. Why should I?
What does my record have to do with my productivity -- my work
record is excellent. I've also thought a lot about suicide, but
figure if I'm going that far, I might as well give bank robbery
a try -- I can always blow my brains out if I get caught. 
   I had a lot of time to think about this, and I'm not finding
many answers -- and like Bear and others have said, the future
looks pretty bleak.
   Another thing that set me off on this rant was May's comments
about "black hoes" etc. I guess I've come to understand quite well
what it means to be black. Fuck it -- why not welfare if you can, 
why not sell drugs or rob? If the other option is working at a fast
food place? Fuck that and fuck anybody who thinks you should.
