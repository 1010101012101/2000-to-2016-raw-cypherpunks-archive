I hear there are non-profits that work to advance the "legitimacy" of
bitcoin. There are plenty of companies that are trying to do the same,
so they can make money.

But we're neither bitcoin-related nonprofits, or bitcoin-related
startups. This is the cypherpunks list. Legitimacy shouldn't be our
concern.

I think it's sad that so many people had no better option (indeed, the
Silk Road was usually the best option for finding substances that
weren't dangerously adulterated) than to send their money to a man who
did violent things, and supported other people that did violent and
utterly reprehensible things.=20

I also think it's sad that this particular man is almost certainly going
to have a shit life from now on.

I also think this adds nothing to any argument over Bitcoin, because
again, he got caught by being dumb. Bitcoin+Tor still seems pretty
ironclad as a hosting platform for illegal activities.
