Yes, but see my previous post.

Same problem as traffic analysis if you are talking about compromising the
remailer. Doesn't work after the fact. (Plus, the risk of detection is
certainly non-zero.)

If you're talking about exploiting flaws in the remailer message
encryption or in the mix-net protocol, that would work, but also would
rely upon having remailer traffic be intercepted and collected for later
analysis.

Stats manipulation has been discussed before. (LEAs run remailers, and
then ensure that their remailers are at the top of the stats pages, either
by falsifying stats or causing legitimate remailers to sink lower on the
stats then LEA remailers.)

Another half-decent attack if planned in advance.

I'm not skeptical as to how effective that would be. Look at all the times
that Phil Zimmermann has been accused of being in bed with the Government.
I'm not sure there are any "trusted pillars of the crypto community".

Except for the pesky fact that the NSA can't spy on US citizens, even if
they're in Canada. (Exceptions can be made, but the hoops become higher
and more numerous than a simple FBI investigation.)

Yes, well. My thoughts on CryptoHeaven are already on the record on this
list.

Smells like entrapment, though.
