Maybe London would prefer China, where thought crime is punished
by life in slave labor camps.  During your communist "rebirth" process
you are made to renounce your opinions on a daily basis.

Why don't they charge him with conspiracy to murder in the first
degree then?  Presumably because they don't have a case.  Wait,
conspiracy needs others involved, right?  How about attempted
murder?

Now stalking has been expanded to passive activities like finding
information about people.  Many private detectives would be out of
business if that were the case.  Maybe Bell was simply going to
complain to his congressman about them.  Must be sure you have
the exact Jeff Gordon.

And this was allowd into evidence?  The court system is apparently 
nosediving quicker than I had previously thought.

They are afraid of guns they had already probably confiscated?  Were
they agaid Bell was going to break into BATF's evidence locker?

Woops.  Thought crimes and ownership crimes.  Maybe we are slowly
being prepared for integration into a system like communist china.
(maybe were half-way there)

Evil, evil, bad, nasty Jim Bell.  I say he should be drawn and
quartered.  Wait, thats not good enough for him.

His outburst probably had something to do with said "evidence" that 
had no bearing on the case.  And bayonets?  Holy shit, next thing
you know Bell might have a hankering to put a sling on his rifle.
Maybe a cleaning kit or two.  Lord knows with all that equipment
he wasn't just hunting rabbits.

Normal response to kangaroo trial proceedings.  But it does piss
of Judges.  Mr Bell, you must learn how to handle those rigged
trials with aplomb.

Oh my f'ing god.  On the Internet?  Next we'll be asked to believe in

Just the next horseman of the infocalypse I say.  Internet users, immanentizing

Hmmm.  More like star chambers.
 
Were it not for a jury, Tanner could simply pronounce him summarily
guilty and be done with it.  Not to worry though, its unlikely 
the jury has any concept of their rights.
