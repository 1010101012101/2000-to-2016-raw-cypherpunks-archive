A "vulnerability" that requires the opponent to have write access 
to your private key in order to exploit?  

Okay.  What was PGP's threat model again?  I'd have sworn that this 
was squarely outside it.  

As far as I can tell, *NOBODY* offers security tools that offer real 
protection in the event your opponent has physical access to the 
machine.
