The original Official Taxpatriates Page just keeps getting better.  I've 
cleaned up some of the text and added a JFile database of Taxpatriates for 
those who use JFile on Palm devices.  Here it is:

As always, the Official Taxpatriates Page can be found at:

For those who track such things, 3008 names have appeared on the "List of 
Shame" since its debut in the 4th quarter of 1996.
