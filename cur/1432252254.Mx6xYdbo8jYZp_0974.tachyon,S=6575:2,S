Close.  I am arguing that insurance companies shouldn't be allowed to
deny coverage based upon factors that the insuree does not have
control over.  For example, I smoke, so I really can't blame an
insurance company for charging me extra, because that's a factor I
have control over.

Fine.  I'll try to find some numbers.  I don't have any off the top of
my head, though.  It just seems that because A) the insurance
companies make good profits and B) the number of people denied
coverage based upon genetic abnormalities is fairly small, it wouldn't
affect them too much.

I don't really see it as an argument for either side.  Breaking into
the medical industry is so difficult because there is an entire
infrastructure that is developed around the established corporations,
and this infrastructure isn't very flexible.

Coverage is most often less expensive than care.  Therefore, one may
be able to afford the coverage, but not afford the care, if it ends up
being required.

Isn't this the whole idea of insurance?  You pay them x dollars, and
if you end up getting sick, they most likely have to pay more than x
dollars to treat you.  The insurers are banking on the fact that the
majority of the people who have insurance don't get sick.

So, yes, the whole idea of insurance is to get out more than you put in.
