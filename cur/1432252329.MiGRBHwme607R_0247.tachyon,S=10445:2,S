I've never quite understood how the amendment-not-ratified-properly-in-1913
argument is supposed to play out.

If this were 1915 and we suddenly realized that there was some funny
business going on, that would be one thing. 

But much has changed in the last 90 or so years. Courts have allowed
the federal government to seize power not granted by the Constitution
(and, in some cases, strictly prohibited by it). Booze prohibition
required a constitutional amendment; drug prohibition wouldn't.

So even if someone were to prove that the 16th Am. wasn't quite kosher,
what would stop the courts from saying -- it wasn't necessary?
