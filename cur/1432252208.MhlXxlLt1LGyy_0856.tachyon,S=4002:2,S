Um, what court of law?  Afghanistan isn't the 51's state of the union.  
Al qaeda didn't sign any treaties with any organization, it's not part of
Nato or the UN... Why even bother with a "court?"  

If bin Ladin is caught, he should be shot on sight, or at least
"interrogated" none of this bullshit kangaroo court crap.

I'm begining to think that bin Ladin is becoming the modern version of
Emmanuel Goldstein, afghanistan is "oceania", and iraq is "eursaia"... and
CNN provides the mandatory two minutes of hate...
