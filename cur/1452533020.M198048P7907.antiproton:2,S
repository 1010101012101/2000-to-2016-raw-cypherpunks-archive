have you played with USB Armory yet?  it's my new favorite ARM platform.

the joy of ARM is avoiding all the usual platform UEFI, CHIPSEC, etc!

the parts of ARM which i enjoy more are the secure boot with signed
boot images. of course, if you're not a developer this is less
compelling.

this all uses TrustZone and fuse memory, under the hood:

if you find any, let me know!  i don't believe they exist.
also, BIOS security on AMD may be even worse than Intel.
use an external SPI flash programmer, not a built in one, in that case.

those blob concerned are going to be increasingly disappointed into
the future. on the other hand, for those with heirloom device funds,
check out Librem:

you're aware of Novena, too? :)

indeed!

i'm playing with stateless lenovo via USB Armory as OS fill via USB.
not quite what you're asking, but might be a nice stop-gap for those
seeking better boot authenticity...
