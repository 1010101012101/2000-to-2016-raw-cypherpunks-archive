It boggles one's mind - the idea that data will _not_ be collected just because
someone says so. Using any concentration point to "anonymize" http access is
like frequenting the facility marked "SAFE PLACE FOR DRUG DEALING" in huge red
letters to cater for one's need for untaxed molecules.

At best it can shield from naive end users - unless they get pissed like JYA.

The only way to anonymize is, of course, visiting the cameraless internet cafe
in the neighbouring city or 802.11-ing into some idiot's AP with the default
settings.
