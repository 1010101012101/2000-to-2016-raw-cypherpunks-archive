One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large gr0up of pheno|ic secondary 
metabolites of p|ants that inc|ude more than 2,00O different known 
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the

With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.
