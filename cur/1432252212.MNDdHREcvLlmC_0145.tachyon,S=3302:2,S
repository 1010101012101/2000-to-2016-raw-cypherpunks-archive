There is a photograph of the fire extinguisher flying through the air at slightly above the level of the window of the police car.  Looks to me as if it was intended to go through the rear window, but is in fact about to bounce off the upper edge of the rear window. I interpret this as a 
photograph of a previous throw from longer range, though one poster has claimed it reflects the fire extinguisher flying OUT of the police car.
