I hope you don't do this. There have been several of these kinds of 
collections--a guy at MIT has done at least a couple of them (I 
forget his name, though three of my short pieces are in one of his 
books: the books cost $40-60 or so, for a damned paperback, which is 
why I don't have my own copy. Even at this high price, they don't pay 
for submissions and they don't even give out copies to contributors!).

What you'd end up with is a printed collection of a bunch of 
mini-rants or survey articles, whose total verbiage is just a tiny 
snapshot of the field.

There's probably a role for a good book on, say, "digital money," 
with a mix of overview articles and detailed articles. This would be 
a _lot_ of work, and the editor would need to be well-versed in the 
field.

But not a book on "Cypherpunk" themes. Too many seemingly-unrelated 
areas, too much background to cover (ironically, compared to digital 
money, but I think this is so).

And Yog help you if you end up just putting together whatever junky 
stuff people are willing to submit.

I didn't see it, but I assume it was like most of the past t.v. shows 
on the NSA and codes and such: Discovery Channel, History Channel, 
BBC "Horizon," CNN, etc. These shows are easy for producers to put 
together: lots of shots of radomes and antennas and NSA buildings, a 
tour of the Cryptologic Museum, some obligatory juicy stuff about 
Enigma and Turing, interviews with talking heads about the need for 
blah blah, and so on.

Feh.
