I didn't quite assert that it is the case, although it should be if
one reads the applicable provisions of the copyright act and the
sales article of the Uniform Commercial Code.  As to a case, there
is one out of California involving Adobe where a federal district
court went a long way toward holding that recently.

But it has everything to do with what people believe is moral.

: 
: Correct, for the case brought on the East Coast (NY? NJ?) by the
: MPAA. However, the first case, brought in California by DVD CCA,
: did not use the DMCA. It alleged theft of trade secrets, and
: violation of the license agreement.

The East Coast case which was decided against the publisher arose
in the federal district court for New York and was finally decided
the wrong way by the 2d Circuit court of appeals.

The California case arose in the California courts and was
based almost entirely on trade secret claims.  (The only way
that licenses got into the case was the claim that the
original parties who had done the reverse engineering were
bound by license agreements to keep the information secret.)
In that case the good guys have won so far.
