Incidentally, and this is something that needs to be said out of due
dilligence, this is what helped kill e-cash in the 90's when some of
the cypherpunks came in from the cold and started their own e-cash
ventures.  We can't forget that chargebacks are how banks make a lot
of money, and they still don't know how to act when that's not
possible.

Paypal also started locking the accounts of people who were accepting
currency in exchange for Bitcoins.  So far as I know, those accounts
are still locked out and the funds in them are still frozen.

That is a huge, huge problem.  On the desktop/laptop side that's
mitigated by cut-and-paste.  It's also a good argument for escrow of
funds - to catch that problem.  On the mobile side, I know a few
people are working on QRcodes for exchange of Bitcoin account codes.

Also remember that MTgox got pwned but good a couple of weeks ago.
Confidence in them tanked as a result.

On the less legitimate side, there are a number of people out there
with fairly high reputation scores on darknet fora who convert
one-time-use Greendot codes into Bitcoins in an anonymous manner.
They're pretty highly ranked on the Silk Road.  On the Third Black
Market, not so much, but time will show who's good at it and who's
not.

What I'm curious about (though I probably shouldn't be) is how the
exchangers in question are cashing out their Greendot and Moneypak
cards because (in the US at least) they have to be tied to a
government acknowledged identity, which torpedos anonymity.

Yee-haw.
