   kitplane01 writes "Airplanes engines need to always work, and are
   monitored by engine monitors. JP Instruments' engine-monitor units
   have [1]begun to encrypt the data output of its monitors so it can't
   be read by third-party software. Whether this is to protect itself
   liability-wise or to discourage competitors is unclear. It seems the
   company is working on a fix, which may require a fee from users to
   translate the file format."
