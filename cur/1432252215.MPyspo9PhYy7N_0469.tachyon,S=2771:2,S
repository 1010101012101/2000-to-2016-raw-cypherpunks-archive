I'm sure everyone has seen this. http://cryptome.org/jones-v-cat.htm

And I know how I dislike raw links so I won't do it.

The Honorable Edith Jones has a VERY healthy attitude towards electronic
snooping. IMHO she's outraged.

Is the Washington-mandated snooping part of a power play where the
behavior of the judiciary needs to be monitored and controlled in
real-time or is it incidental to the stated goals of cleaning up office
computer usage?

Now I wonder how Judge Jones feels about snooping on the population in
general? Is she a standout among judges or do those in power feel
outrage only when the abuse is close to home? Do those in power want to
create the virtual version of gated communities and limit the membership
or all entitled to the same rights?

Mike
