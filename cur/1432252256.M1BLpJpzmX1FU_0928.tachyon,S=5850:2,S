Ah. A fellow knowledgeable China-hand.

As far as I'm concerned, what Kung Tze does ca 5 BCE is really consdolidate 
and codify a large and diverse body of practices and beliefs under a fairly 
unified set of ethical ideas. In that sense, the Legalists were merely a 
refocusing of the same general body of mores, etc...into a somewhat 
different direction. One might call it a competing school to Kung Tze de 
Jiao Xun, but I would argue only because, at that time, Kung Tze "authority" 
as it's known today was by no means completely established. But in a sense, 
the early legalists weren't a HECK of a lot different from Confucious.

As for Mr Donald's ramblings, the are in which they most closely approach 
reality is where filial obedience to the emperor is developed as an 
extension to his ethical system, but even here there are significant 
differences. For one, that filial loyalty is not portrayed as being 
ultimately political, but almost an extension of family (which is why the 
emperor was known as the "Son of Heaven").

Also, and this is fairly Cypherpunkish, unlike in the west the notin of 
Emperor was not ultimately a genetic one. That is, there's a "Mandate of 
Heaven", and when the mandate of heaven is removed from an Emperor and his 
line, it's time to bum-rush his show, which was done on a regular basis in 
China.

As for the Taoists this comment by Mr Donald is almost completely 
nonsensical.
