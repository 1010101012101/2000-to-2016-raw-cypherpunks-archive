I know for a fact the building has to meet fire code and that the fire
dept. as a matter of course has access to these records 24 hours a day.

Police can get access at any time as well since these records are public.

Sounds to me like they want the end user to pay for extra copies the fire
dept. and police can have in their own databanks.
