I've done the searches and come up with nothing. What URL should I
be looking at?

I'm quite interested in exposing any wrongdoing here, both personally
and professionally. Check out my back articles
(http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,21810,00.html) for stuff I've
written that's relevant here.

My PGP key is on the servers; Wired's phone number is in the Washington DC
phone book.
