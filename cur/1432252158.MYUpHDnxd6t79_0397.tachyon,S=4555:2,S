"Others"?  Like Clinton?  Like Gulliani?  Like 3 or four recent Israeli
PM's? Do we get to pick and choose, or are we stuck with only the
"criminals" that this new PD wants?

If they would mind their own goddamn business, I bet the environments
would get a whole lot less hostile...

Aren't you old enough to know this is BS?  Help whoever you want, any way
you like, but *don't* delude yourself into thinking this will et you a
GOOJF card.  Sheeesh!

Well, there's a damn good reason for *never* contacting Dave...

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
