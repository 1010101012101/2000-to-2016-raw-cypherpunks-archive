----
Windows 7 users were left scratching their heads on Wednesday when a
mysterious garbled patch appeared in Windows Update, origins unknown.
...
Its description mostly contained garbled text. Links for more
information, help, and support were filled in with gibberish URLs with
".gov," ".mil," and ".edu" domains.
...
The Register poked Microsoft about the issue, and a spokesman told us:
"We incorrectly published a test update and are in the process of
removing it."
----


"test update" containing .gov,.mil and .edu URLs, lol...
