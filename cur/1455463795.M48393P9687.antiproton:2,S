At one time I did follow it very closely, so I am sure you will
find plenty to disagree with here:

Neither do I.  Beliefs prejudice perception and judgement.

Because his example has already been followed by others, and more
will follow.  In politics one calls revenge "deterrence," but by
any name the U.S. government wants revenge in this matter.

Greenwald currently resides in Brazil.  Apparently he likes the
climate there better than in the U.S.

Not empty handed, he brought propaganda value with him:  A
no-risk, no-cost chance for Russia to both deprive the U.S. of a
military objective (Snowden's capture) and to play the champion of
justice and fair play on the world stage.  They also obtained an
extended opportunity to determine whether Snowden did have
anything of intelligence value to offer.

> Appears to me Snowden still personally leaks enough from Russia
> to give merica troubles, no?

Snowden personally leaks nothing; never did, most likely never
will.  By the accounts of all involved parties, Snowden handed off
all copies of all them documents to Greenwald.  Greenwald then
sold the rights to them to Omidyar.  The staff at The Intercept
occasionally take out their eyedropper and deliver one or two of
these documents, along with articles explaining what say and what
they mean to the great unwashed publick.

A bit more background in case anyone wants more info...
