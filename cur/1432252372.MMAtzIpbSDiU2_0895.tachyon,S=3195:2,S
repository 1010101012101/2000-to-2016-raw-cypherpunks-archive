Many on this list should consider themselves candidates for free speech persecution.  I plan to treat my situation as would a person facing a "three-strikes" incarceration for a petty crime and suggest you all do the same.  If LEs should up for questioning I will treat them as the "security operatives" from Tim's quote of Alexander Solzhenitzyn's, "Gulag Archipelago."

Rape used as control in U.S. prisons

<<http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/091401/091401l.htm>

National Catholic Reporter, September 14, 2001

Many prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the minute they enter a
penal facility; their age, looks, sexual preference and other
characteristics mark them as candidates for maltreatment. In a new
groundbreaking report, Human Rights Watch documents the widespread
prisoner-on-prisoner rape in U.S. men's prisons. The rights group accuses
state authorities of not taking measures to prevent and punish rape and, in
many cases, for allowing this cruel form of abuse to persist.
