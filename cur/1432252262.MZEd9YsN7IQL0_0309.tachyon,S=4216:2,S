It seems some spammer has decided to use my email address as his return
address, and I am now getting his bounce messages.

etc

Am I uniquely blessed with this problem, or is this some new way for
spammers to ensure they are hated even more than serial child molesters
and terrorists.

I think this really crosses the line into blatant illegality, and is a
racheting up of spammer scumminess way beyond simply trying to evade
filters with P'E'N'I'S and gratuitous HTML in the middle of suspicious
words.
