Easier and more productive, but it doesn't make for big flashy
headlines. "Two Dozen Crypto Munitions Exporters Arrested in Midnight
Raids; Ties to Money Laundering, Terrorists, Child Pornographers" would
get the AG's name in the papers and distract Congress's attention from
looking into just what BXA is doing. (Neal Knox noticed that criminal
shooting sprees seem to take place before Congressional votes on gun
restrictions. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. I'm extrapolating to a
different department.)
