There are plenty of unused bytes in the SONET overhead, particularly at 
OC-48 and OC-192 (in fact, most of the line and section overhead is empty 
because the overhead bytes are only defined for the first STS-1! Not a lot 
of people know that).

The problem, however, is that Line and Section layer overhead will be 
terminated pretty much every time they pass through a SONET box. There's the 
possibility of using the POH for control and management traffic, because 
that -should- stay with the payload. In terms of visibility they could of 
course encrypt those packets, possibly even using off-the-shelf VPN of they 
run a short stack management channel (though 7-layer/OSI is not impossible, 
given the old fondness for it in standards groups for so long).

On the other hand they could possibly just go in-band and send the 
management info with their backhauled traffic, but I'm still a little 
doubtful about that.
