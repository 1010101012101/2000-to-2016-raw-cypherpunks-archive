</color>Right.  I feel it is bizzare that one can be charged with "spoliation" merely 
for purging old records that one has no conceivable use for on the grounds 
that you somehow "should have known" that

it was "likely" that the records would be subpoenaed <color><param>FF00,0000,0000</param><bigger>{HYPERLINK "/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=subpoenaed&spell=1"}<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><FontFamily><param>Times New Roman</param>

</color><FontFamily><param>Arial</param><smaller> years later,  but if that's the way it happens,  that's the way

it happens.  I consider it,  as I said,  monstrous that a judge

can legally deprive me of all copies of my own work in order

to enforce a gag order,  but again,  if that's the way it is,

that's the way it is.  But it goes well beyond the bizzare to

suggest that I should anticipate the possibility of a gag

order and preemptively gag myslef in case one might be issued

at a later date.

</color>Yeah,  well,  the reason I suggested posting encrypted to freenet is,

I was thinking I might not want the stuff distributed for the whole world

to see,  but I want to make sure I have access to the stuff,  either during

the trial,  or later once the trial is over (if the judge makes me hand

over all copies,  am I sure I'll get anything back?)


In the particular case of a reporter's notes, one can easily imagine

how this would be the case: my notes contain information which

could be used to identify confidential sources of mine,  that sort

of thing.  I don't want to lose this information,  but I can't just

openly blab it to the world.  



<color><param>7F00,0000,0000</param>> I think a lot of the tension around "cypherpunks should think about law" or

</color>and so groups one and two end up more or less agreeing on the

defacto state of affairs,  just describing it differently.
