The point is that each message doesn't have decryptable cyphertext.
It only has a secret-share that no recipient can decode 
until they have enough shares of the same message,
even if the KGB rubber-hoses them, and the KGB cryptanalysts
won't be able to find anything more than random noise in the message
because with <K shares, that's all you can get.
Now random noise may also be suspicious, but it's less suspicious
than something that's got more structure to it.
Even if they do suspect the recipient and seize his computer,
they'll only get old messages, not the new partially-received ones.
