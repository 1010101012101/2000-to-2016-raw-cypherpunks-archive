The National Security Agency at the Crossroads (Austin: Apr 3-4)
https://strausscenter.org/details/279-privacy-surveillance-and-the-nsa.html

If you review the agenda and speaker list, you'll see this event is a
pretty big deal.


> The Intelligence Studies Project is a joint venture of the Strauss
> Center and Clements Center at the University of Texas at Austin,
> aiming to encourage policy-relevant academic inquiry into the past,
> present, and future of intelligence agencies and the legal, policy,
> and technological environments in which they operate. Nothing
> better illustrates the need for such inquiry than the events of the
> past year surrounding the National Security Agency. As part of a
> larger effort to improve public understanding of those events, the
> Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law and the
> William P. Clements Jr. Center for History, Strategy & Statecraft
> are hosting a major interdisciplinary conference focused on the NSA
> from April 3rd through 4th. It will cover topics including the
> history of the NSA, the role of the media in revealing classified
> information about its activities, the legal architecture in which
> it operates, the compliance and oversight mechanisms associated
> with the NSA, the diplomatic fallout from the recent revelations,
> and the prospects for reform.

Although open to the public, the event is already waitlisted.  I'm
aware of at least a few concerned citizens who signed up to attend and
plan to document the event through various channels.
