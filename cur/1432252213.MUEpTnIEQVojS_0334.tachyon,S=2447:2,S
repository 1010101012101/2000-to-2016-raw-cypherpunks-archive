Well, how out of band? Do you mean the management VPN (or whatever) doesn't 
travel with the actual grabbed traffic? (Frankly, this would be my first 
candidate.) Of course, they could do it via SONET overhead bytes, thus 
avoiding the flakiness and vunerability that routers and switches still seem 
to have.

One wonders too if they do anything with SS7.

Of course, they could have a dedicated fiber for their management LAN, but 
due to latency issues &c I would suspect that can't be a LAN all the way 
across the country...they've got to Long-Haul the management traffic 
somehow, which implies packing it into a 100BaseT or whatever and then 
shipping that out either packed in SONET or with other circuit-switched 
traffic. Or of course, they might just have their management on something 
like STS-3C POS, and the rest of their OC-48/192 carries real traffic.

Anyone know what telecom vendor NSA uses?
