              By David Hudson

              The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
              has become the third federal appeals
              court to uphold a federal law expanding
              the definition of child pornography to
              include computer-generated images of
              minors engaged in sexually explicit
              conduct  even if the images only
              appear to be of a minor.
