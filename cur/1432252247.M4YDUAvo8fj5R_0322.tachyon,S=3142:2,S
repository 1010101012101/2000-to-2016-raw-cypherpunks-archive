Well, perhaps. Then again, consider though primordial blacknet systems 
currently labeled P2P. They don't currently present a big problem to 
Group-of-Bandits X, but it does cause some of their bigger enablers (ie, the 
record industry) to bitch a bit. As a result, they are turning up the 
pressure slowly, but only just fast enough for such systems to proliferate 
while evolving a nice protective coating (despite all the recent lawsuits). 
By the time these systems represent a destabilising influence (ie, you can 
pay someone for a file over anonymous swarmed P2P) it'll be too late.

In short, Group-of-Bandits X is a group of bandits precisely because they 
couldn't survive otherwise...ie, they're not smart enough. They'll 
eventually go the way of the dodo, though they can prolong their exodus 
somewhat through drastic means.

The OBL route, however, does seem to have its merits and is historically 
quite effective (Algeria, Iraq...). A little too messy for my tastes, 
however, and blowing up the building I work in won't be worth the number of 
virgins I'd have coming to me.
