More likely the "fare" was 1.10, but whatever :-)

There's a nice changemaking application for the Palm Pilot
that lets you input the amount of money you want to pay somebody
and the size of payment you can make, e.g. $1.10 and $5.
It splits a circle into appropriately sized pie slices,
you spin the dial, and either pay or don't pay.

Of course, getting a bus company to trust your Palm Pilot
not to be running a rigged version may be tougher
than getting your mathematically inclined friends to accept it :-)
