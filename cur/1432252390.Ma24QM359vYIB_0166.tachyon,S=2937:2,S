Well, if you're saying what I think you're saying, I'm still not so sure. 
"Lies of the Times" indeed...the Times "Liberal" compared to NYPost, 
etc...is like Kodos compared to Kang.

BUT, -local- authorities just might declare it "Liberal Propaganda". Or 
worse, ANY litereature (left, right) will be suspect.

Is this paranoid? A year or two I would have thought so. But things have 
gotten so out of wack that anything goes. Cellphones, of course, are the 
latest scary devices, and here in NYC the towers for them are down in key 
infrastructural places. I could easily see that being expanded into the Wall 
Street/downtown area, where we already have multiple barricades and machine 
gun armed cops.

Saw a local security expert on the news, and he stated the obvious: Random 
searches and whatnot are going to do zero for someone determined, but 
"might" deter someone who was "thinking about" blowing up the A train. In 
other words, everyone here in NYC knows that we've given up a lot for the 
sake of the appearence of security, but no one seems to give a damn.
