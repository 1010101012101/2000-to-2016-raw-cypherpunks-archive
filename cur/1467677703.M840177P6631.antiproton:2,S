> ===== BEGIN SIGNED MESSAGE =====
> To the DAO and the Ethereum community,
> 
> I have carefully examined the code of The DAO and decided to
> participate after finding the feature where splitting is rewarded with
> additional ether. I have made use of this feature and have rightfully
> claimed 3,641,694 ether, and would like to thank the DAO for this
> reward. It is my understanding that the DAO code contains this feature
> to promote decentralization and encourage the creation of "child
> DAOs".
> 
> I am disappointed by those who are characterizing the use of this
> intentional feature as "theft". I am making use of this explicitly
> coded feature as per the smart contract terms and my law firm has
> advised me that my action is fully compliant with United States
> criminal and tort law. For reference please review the terms of the
> DAO:
> 
> "The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart
> contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at
> 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this
> explanation of terms or in any other document or communication
> may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond
> those set forth in The DAO’s code. Any and all explanatory
> terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes
> and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO’s
> code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe
> there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions
> offered here and the functionality of The DAO’s code at
> 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, The DAO’s code controls
> and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation."
> 
> A soft or hard fork would amount to seizure of my legitimate and
> rightful ether, claimed legally through the terms of a smart contract.
> Such fork would permanently and irrevocably ruin all confidence in
> not only Ethereum but also the in the field of smart contracts and
> blockchain technology. Many large Ethereum holders will dump their
> ether, and developers, researchers, and companies will leave Ethereum.
> Make no mistake: any fork, soft or hard, will further damage Ethereum
> and destroy its reputation and appeal.
> 
> I reserve all rights to take any and all legal action against any
> accomplices of illegitimate theft, freezing, or seizure of my
> legitimate ether, and am actively working with my law firm. Those
> accomplices will be receiving Cease and Desist notices in the mail
> shortly.
> 
> I hope this event becomes an valuable learning experience for the
> Ethereum community and wish you all the best of luck.

> Yours truly,
> "The Attacker"
