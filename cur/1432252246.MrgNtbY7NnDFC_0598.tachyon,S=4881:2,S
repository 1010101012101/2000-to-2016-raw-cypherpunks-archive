I don't think you can *ever* prove a claim like that, since you're dealing 
with humans, who can be only very imperfectly modeled.  There's no system 
that couldn't possibly fall into some horrible state, whether that's 
tyranny or chaos or lemming-like rush to an unwinnable war or ostrich-like 
refusal to prepare for clearly oncoming war.  Systems of human decision 
makers are driven by the decisions made by those humans, and sometimes, 
they're a bunch of idiots.  More centralized decision-making has the ugly 
property that a smaller set of decision-makers have to be idiots to run the 
whole society into a ditch.  On the other hand, more centralized 
decision-making makes larger projects possible sometimes, especially ones 
involving big, long wars.
