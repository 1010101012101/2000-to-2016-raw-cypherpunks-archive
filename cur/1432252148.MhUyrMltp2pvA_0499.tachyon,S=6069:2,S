My understanding is that she only went to jail because of a federal law
passed in the early 80's designed to protect undercover federal agents.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I was under the impression that were it
not for that law, there would be no need for a "shield law"...just
stronger clarification of that law.  Did this issue go before the
supreme court...have they ruled that the law is constitutional?

Freedom of the press should protect a reporter from prosecution fromt he
reporting of ANYTHING.  Reporting about a felon is fine(i don't think
current laws dispute this).  If in addition to that, the reporter is
breaking ANOTHER law by shielding a felon, thats another issue altogether.

We're talking freedom to report things, not freedom for a reporter to do
anything they wish.
