Perhaps the subject should just say "Money (its corrupting power)".
Impossible to believe that HP "rerouted" it's servers without any
financial gain for the company.

Besides highlighting (thanks grarpamp) such abominations of anything
resembling human decency/ human rights/ empathy/ fellowship etc
("torture is ok in this situation because..." - oh really), I don't
know what else we can do to incentivise "doing the right thing" or
disincentivise "doing the wrong thing". The nature of corporations is
profit at any cost - and the sacrifice of anything other than profit
is the cost.

Perhaps more humans will aspire to something beyond the animalistic
part of their nature...
