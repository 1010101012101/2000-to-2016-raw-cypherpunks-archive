Hey...

Over West Street by the former World Trade Center site there are two 
pedestrian footbridges.

Something's been pissing me off a bit: Each of those bridges (which run over 
West Street--public property) are staffed by non-Cops with gray jackets that 
say "SECURITY". periodically, if someone goes the wrong way up an escalator 
or a tourist crosses a line to get a better photo, these rentaCops will 
whistle or shout them out of wherever they are.

Is this legal? Are we really allowing private rentacops to take police 
functions on public property?
