Is the report below both technologically and legally credible or just
typical cybersecrurity farting for news coverage? What are the P2P 
Hackers saying about it? 

Recall Assange claimed to have a million files on hand at the start of 
Wikileaks and says WL continued to received millions more until recently. 

To be sure, WL always maximizes counts of whatever it claims to have, 
the cables amounting to some 261M _words_ of which a 1% have been 
made public although the statistically insignificant percentage is never 
farted.

Snippet:

WikiLeaks, condemned by the U.S. government for posting secret data leaked 
by insiders, may have used music- and photo-sharing networks to obtain and 
publish classified documents, according to a computer security firm.

Tiversa Inc., a company based in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, has 
evidence that WikiLeaks, which has said it doesnt know who provides it with 
information, may seek out secret data itself, using so-called
"peer-to-peer" networks, 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Boback claimed. He said the government is 
examining evidence that Tiversa has turned over.

The company, which has done investigative searches on behalf of U.S. agencies 
including the FBI, said it discovered that computers in Sweden were
trolling through 
hard drives accessed from popular peer-to-peer networks such as LimeWire and 
Kazaa. The same information obtained in those searches later appeared on 
WikiLeaks, Boback said. WikiLeaks bases its most important servers in Sweden.
