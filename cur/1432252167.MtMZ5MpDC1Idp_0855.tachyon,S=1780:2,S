I'm shocked that they didn't do so years ago -
I thought they'd at least done the authentication parts.

That's ok - 2-key 3DES still has 112 bits of key strength,
which is 2**56 times harder than cracking single-DES.
3-Key 3DES looks like it should be harder, but it's still only 112 bits
because of meet-in-the-middle attacks using 2**56 words of memory.
