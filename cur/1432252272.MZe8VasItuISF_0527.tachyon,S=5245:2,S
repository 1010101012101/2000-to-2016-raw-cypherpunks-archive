"All symbols that are related to Nazism. One of the reasons (if not the
reason) why they banned "Wolfenstein 3D"."

Interesting. So even if the swatsika is protrayed as a bad thing (to the 
point of practically being a bullseye) it's banned.

So...can you have swastikas in Textbooks? Perhaps 100 years from now the 
Holocaust will be forgotten. Of course, that'll make Tim May happy because 
then it could happen all over again.

So a question for you: If I want to write a book on the history of the 
swastika, or teach about the holocuast in Germany, do I need a license or 
something? (And let's just assume I have a "politically correct" view.)
