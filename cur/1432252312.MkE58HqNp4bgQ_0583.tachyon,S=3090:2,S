Some do, some don't. The U.S., for all its oft-cited faults, doesn't. 
It's not a violation of any national or state (California) law to argue 
that negroes are monkeys, that Germany's main failure was to miss 
getting the last 100K Jews (the main cause of their problems today, as 
the dreidl-spinners yammer about Nazism while arguing for socialism), 
and so on.

One or two states in the U.S. tried to implement "hate speech" laws, 
but the Supremes, in a rare moment when the negroes and Jews were 
outnumbered, said "Go back and read the First Amendment, you fucking 
dweebs and Hebes."

You've been brainwashed by your Yid masters. The swastika goes back to 
very, very old Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist symbology. Hitler read about 
it in some magazine and adopted it as his own.

You make me sick. I hope the ovens are fired up again and you are sent 
to one for a nice, long, _very_ hot shower.
