"> CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - A newly elected Republican state lawmaker has enr=
aged his constituents, party leaders and police by saying he favors killi=
ng police officers when they cross the line. One police chief calls him "=
a hate-mongering lunatic."
<P>
Tom Alciere, 41, won a seat in the New Hampshire House on his fourth try =
after a low-key campaign last fall. It wasn't until Sunday that his const=
ituents in Nashua learned of his anti-police views.
<P>
Alciere told the Valley News of Lebanon that he loves it when someone kil=
ls a police officer: "It's unfortunate that cops do make it necessary (to=
 kill them) when they're waging a war on drugs, and I view cops as enemy =
officers." He said he is "too chicken" to do it himself.
<P>
He acknowledges posting his views at Internet chat sites for months, incl=
uding this 1999 comment: "Nobody will ever be safe until the last cop is =
dead."
<P>
Alciere also posted an Internet message accusing the FBI of being involve=
d in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, which kil=
led 168 people, according to a 1998 article in the Durango (Colo.) Herald=
=2E The Associated Press could not find the message in an Internet search=
 on Wednesday, but such messages typically expire after a while.
<P>
State GOP Chairman Steve Duprey said Alciere should renounce his views or=
 resign. But Alciere stood his ground.
<P>
"There's no way I'm going to resign," he said Tuesday.
<P>
He has also espoused violence against women in letters to the editor of a=
 Nashua newspaper, according to Nashua police.
<P>
"He took a domestic violence position several years ago where he said a w=
oman needs to be dragged by the hair and either threatened with a bat or =
hit with a bat once in a while," Deputy Chief Tim Hefferan told The Union=
 Leader.
<P>
Alciere, a married father of one who inspects circuit boards at a factory=
, said he was arrested for "petty stuff" years ago but never went to jail=
 and has no criminal record. He said his anti-police comments are the "ha=
rmless rantings of a private citizen" that won't influence his legislativ=
e work.
<P>
New Hampshire has no procedure for recalling state representatives, and l=
egislators said they expect Alciere to serve.
<P>
"As despicable as the ideas are, the complaints against him are for his i=
deas," said Peter Burling, the House Democratic leader.
<P>
With 400 members, the New Hampshire House is the largest state legislativ=
e body in the country and many campaigns don't get much media attention. =
Alciere admits he didn't advertise his views during his campaign, but den=
ies misleading anyone.
<P>
"Nobody asked," he said. "For state representative, you don't have to tel=
l where you stand on the issues."
<P>
He said when police cross the line, citizens have the right to use force =
to defend themselves: "Whatever is necessary is necessary. It sounds kind=
 of harsh."
<P>
He is taking plenty of heat. Newmarket police Chief Rodney Collins called=
 Alciere "a hate-mongering lunatic," and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen is among sta=
te leaders to denounce him.
<P>
Nashua Deputy Police Chief Timothy Hefferan said supervisors warn officer=
s to be careful if they get a call to Alciere's apartment building. He sa=
id police usually stay out of politics, but "I think we'll have to revisi=
t that policy just to enlighten people."
<P>
Alciere's views got some publicity when he wrote letters to newspapers.
<P>
In 1997, three days after Carl Drega killed two state troopers, a part-ti=
me judge and a newspaper editor in Colebrook, Alciere sent a letter sayin=
g that except for the editor, Drega was "an otherwise innocent cop-killer=
 taking out enemy officers in battle."
<P>
The letter was never published, but became part of the investigation.
<P>
A short time later, Epsom police officer Jeremy Charron was murdered. Alc=
iere defended Charron's killer, Gordon Perry, because he said Charron had=
 no right to ask Perry and a companion for identification while they slep=
t in their car.
<P>
Alciere said his anger stems from reading and watching television about p=
olice misconduct, and his belief that many of the laws the police enforce=
 are unjust.
<P>
But during his campaign, he promised simply to oppose any bills that infr=
inge on freedom, and defeated a Democratic incumbent by 55 votes. In his =
previous runs for the seat, Alciere ran twice as a Libertarian and once a=
s a Democrat.
<P>
After the election, Alciere went online and said he was elected by a "bun=
ch of fat, stupid, ugly old ladies that watch soap operas, play bingo, re=
ad tabloids and don't know the metric system."
<P>
"The same lamebrains who vote for politicians who are WRONG finally voted=
 for one who is RIGHT," he wrote.
