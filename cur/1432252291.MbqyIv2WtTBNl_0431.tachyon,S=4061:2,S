After years of delays and intimidation, three high-ranking officers who 
once commanded a presidential security and intelligence unit are being 
tried on charges that they masterminded the killing of a vocal critic of 
the military in 1990.....( New York Times, 9 Sep 02)
Trial alleges Guatemalan guard's deadly role
Myrna Mack knew the death squads were after her. The 39-year-old 
anthropologist asked neighbors to watch for intruders outside her home, 
began varying her travel habits and told a priest she feared for her life. 
They got her anyway.....( AP, 8 Sep 02)
