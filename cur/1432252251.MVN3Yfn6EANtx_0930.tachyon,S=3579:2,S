For extra credit, try to find even one mainstream newspaper in AmeriKKKa's
Rah Rah "free" press in which this international wireservice story is
printed.

See the Neocons argue that because the story only appears in the Arab
press, it can't be true.  Hey, it worked with Accused Jewish War Criminal
Ariel Sharon's "The Jewish people control AmeriKKKa" remarks.

Somehow, I don't think beating people and bulldozing their houses and
businesses every time some writing or image the US chooses to characterize 
as "anti-Coalition" is spotted, does much to further the US message that 
we are bringing "democracy" to Iraq, and that those opposed to our 
behavior "hate our freedoms."

It's too bad an alien power can't just lift all 157,000 US troops and 
associated military hardware from Iraq, compact it into a cube, and drop 
it on the White House lawn for Shrub to explain to the AmeriKKKan people.

I once said "there are no civilians in Israel, not even the babies" after
the Jewish people re-elected Accused War Criminal and Egregious Human
Rights Violator Ariel Sharon in an overwhelming landslide,
enthusiastically supporting his defiance of International Law, and
deliberate oppression of the Palestinian people.

If the AmeriKKKan people re-elect George W. Bush, who has made a mockery
of the UNited Nations, started a war of conquest based on deliberate lies,
in violation of International Law, with complete contempt for the wishes
of the world community, I don't suppose there'll be any civilians in
AmeriKKKa either, and therefore, it will be impossible to label any
destructive act committed against the US, either at home or abroad, as
"terrorist."

KUT, Iraq (AFP) - An Iraqi has died of his wounds after US troops beat
him with truncheons because he refused to remove a picture of wanted
Shiite Muslim leader Moqtada al-Sadr from his car, police said
Wednesday.

The motorist was stopped late Tuesday by US troops conducting search
operations on a street in the central city of Kut, Lieutenant Mohamad
Abdel Abbas told AFP.

After the man refused to remove al-Sadr's picture from his car, the
soldiers forced him out of the vehicle and started beating him with
truncheons, he said.

US troops also detained from the same area five men wearing black
pants and shirts, the usual attire of al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militiamen
and followers.

Qassem Hassan, the director of Kut general hospital, identified the
man as Salem Hassan, a resident of a Kut suburb.

He said the man had died of wounds sustained in the beating.
