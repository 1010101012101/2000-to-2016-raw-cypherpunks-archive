I keep pointing out that, given how easy it would be to blow up the midtown 
tunnel, for instance (never mind just taking a backhoe out into the middle 
of nowhere and digging up a fiber sheath), the very fact that we don't see 
stuff blowing up all the time is proof that there really aren't that many 
terrorists out there. In other words, on 9/11 we lost a solid % of them.

As a corollary, if a person is smart enough to get into the US and then be 
able to sustain themselves economically (never mind go to college or 
graduate school), the desirability of blowing oneself up goes way down.

This means then that it probably gets pretty easy to run out of legitimate 
TERROR! to investigate and protect us poor, terrified Americans from. Look 
for some staged terrorist incidents by guys  looking to protect their jobs 
("LOOK! Someone threw a garbage with the Afghan flag on it through the 
window of the 7-11 last night!!!")
