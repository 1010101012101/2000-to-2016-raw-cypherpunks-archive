My point of course - which through either duplicity or rank ignorance
seems to have gone right over your head - is that your mere presence
on this list as a reader and especially poster of messages is sufficient
to associate you with Tim and his Crypto Anarchist Manifesto brush, and
with Jim Bell and his Assassination Politics, and with CJ and his "plot"
to plant bombs and terrorize federal judges and Bill Gates, and with
Eric Michael Cordian and his defense of BoyNet and NAMBLA, [and lions,
tigers and bears, oh my!]


"So let me get this straight, Ms. Farr, you hang out and "cyber-chat"
with these hackers and copyright thieves, and with known anti-government
extremists, anarchists, and convicted chemical-weapon terrorists, and
with pedophiles and child pornographers about how to hide their illegal
acts with this 'encryption technology'.  What did you say your purpose
in that was again?"


Everyone on this list who isn't already working for the govt can
easily be tarred with the same brush that painted Jim Bell and CJ.

If you are really too dense to see this, it's time someone spelled it
out for you.  And if not, then you clearly are not the disingenue you
profess to be.
