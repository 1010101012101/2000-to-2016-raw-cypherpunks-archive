Ditto.

Domain: freedom.press
IP Address: 108.162.200.15
ISP: CloudFlare
Region: San Francisco (US)

http://en.utrace.de/?query=3Dfreedom.press

I wouldn't trust cloudflare to wipe my balls and they seem to be the ISP
for freedomDOTpress

I wouldn't trust IT either. If you try logging into Hushmail using Tor
the security question overlay is hosted by... Cloudflare (but not the
rest of Hushmail). Would you suppose CF HAS a vested interest in
stalking Tor for the surveillance state apparatus?

My guess would be that's probably one of their pet surveillance projects.=



I understand that a site like fpress undoubtedly needs dDos prevention
services but there has to be some other company providing that sort of
service that isn't connected like a Siamese twin at the wrists and
ankles to the surveillance state.

As a tweet from my account that I don't consider a troll:

I believe NoScript does this as an add-on. It can blacklist cloudflare
but some useful web services such as WeatherUnderground Weather are
badly affected, so fully blocking them limits the utility of the web. Id
say if one only allowed CF for services like that and never showed their
IP to cloudflare otherwise, it wouldn't give them much useful info about
someone.r.

My posts tagged cloudflare
<http://auntieimperial.tumblr.com/search/cloudflare>. There's a certain
repetitiveness to the info but this one's a good place to start, with
links to the other related posts >>
<http://auntieimperial.tumblr.com/post/119691050059>

BTW, Yasha Levine hooked me up with the CEO of cloudflare on Twitter one
day for a short hostile 'interview' when I questioned Cloudflare's
hosting of BB's Project PM. If you can't stomach weasel words I'd avoid
reading it.
