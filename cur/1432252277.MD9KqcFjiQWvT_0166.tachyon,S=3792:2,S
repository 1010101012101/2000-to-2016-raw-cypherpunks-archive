I don't buy this at all. Maybe there is some subtlety I am missing completely.

As a Mac user, PPP and similar protocols were bundled early on. In 
1993-4 the first talk of Mosaic was appearing. In 1994-5, Mosaic and 
its successor were readily available.

Which caused which, a default TCP/IP stack in Windows 95 or Netscape 1.0?

(By the way, friends of mine are happily surfing with Windows 3.1 and 
whatever MS- or aftermarket-based TCP/IP tools are needed. Most of 
them don't even know what a "TCP/IP stack" is...they simply download 
what the ISP tells them is needed, or they insert the CD-ROM and 
click to start.)

As a Mac user, it was the availability of Mosaic and Netscape which 
altered the landscape. The TCP/IP stack junk was just behind the 
scenes machinery which various vendors were then racing to provide.

Saying the modern Net age started when Microsoft provided a TCP/IP 
stack seems overly wonkish.
