[The Harvard Club is now "business casual". No more jackets and ties,
but see below for details. While it lasts, anyway. Since last year's
dot-bomb, the suit-ratio in the main dining room has been
asymptotically approaching unity. :-). --RAH]



                 The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                              Presents

                          Arnold Reinhold

                            "Product 'Q':
          The Market Failure of Most Cryptographic Products"


                     Tuesday, September 4th, 2001
                             12 - 2 PM
                 The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                    One Federal Street, Boston, MA


The term "Q" is used in physics as a parameter that describes the
quality of a resonant circuit. In product development Q is a metaphor
for how difficult it is to meet potential market needs. This analysis
will be applied to several past product successes and failures and
then to present and proposed products of interest to electronic
commerce.

Arnold Reinhold is an independent computer consultant and author. He
previously managed software development groups at Computervision
Corp. and at Automatix Inc, which he co-founded. Mr. Reinhold is
co-author of The Internet for Dummies Quick Reference and E-mail for
Dummies. He holds a Masters degree in Business Administration from
the Harvard Business School. He has created several web site dealing
with cryptography including diceware.com and ciphersaber.


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held
on Tuesday, September 4th, 2001, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown
Branch of the Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The
price for lunch is $37.50. This price includes lunch, room rental,
A/V hardware if necessary, and the speakers' lunch. The Harvard Club
has relaxed its dress code, which is now "business casual", meaning
no sneakers or jeans. Fair warning: since we purchase these luncheons
in advance, we will be unable to refund the price of your meal if the
Club finds you in violation of what's left of its dress code.


We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or, if we
*really* know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of
Boston", by Saturday, September 1st, or you won't be on the list for
lunch. Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston
will have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The
Harvard Club of Boston", in the amount of $37.50. Please include your
e-mail address so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements
(we've had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for
instance), please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can
work something out.


Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

October   Jean Camp        Trust and Risk in Digital Commerce


As you can see, :-), we are actively searching for future speakers.
If you are in Boston on the first Tuesday of the month, are a
principal in digital commerce, and would like to make a presentation
to the Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Committee,
care of Robert Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com>.
