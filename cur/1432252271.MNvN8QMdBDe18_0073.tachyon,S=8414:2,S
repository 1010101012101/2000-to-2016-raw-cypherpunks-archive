If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...

FYI

The list members might be interested in the following incomplete historical
list of US armed interventions around the world. Conspiciously absent from
the list are the major conflicts that every US citizen should know (Civil
war, WWI, WWII etc) Also conspiciously absent are the clandestine and covert
operations sponsored by the US that would add substantially to the length of
the list (and its significance, I )

I've drawn a number of conclusions from this list - I would be interested to
know what you conclusions you draw from the list.

him in the last Samoan Civil War (1893-1894). Fighting ensued, which was
complicated by the long-standing rivalry between the U.S., Britain and
Germany for de facto control over the Samoan Islands. On March 15, 1899,
warships of the American and British Navies bombarded the Samoan city of
Apia to intimidate the reigning Samoan king, who was allied with the
Germans. An Anglo-American landing force took control of Apia, but were not
