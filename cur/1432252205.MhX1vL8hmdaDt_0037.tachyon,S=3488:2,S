Speaking about over the counter, has anyone one the list tried Zicam cold 
remedy?  I've used it twice and all my symptoms disappeared with a few 
hours.  No cold!  Available at druggists for <$10/spray bottle (2 bottles 
for <$13 at Costco).  No need for universities and major drug companies to 
spend millions searching for what will turn out to be an expensive 
prescriptive.  Its here and now and over the counter.
