	I have been having an interesting problem with my cypherpunks
feed from sirius.infonex.net - twice in the last 3 weeks or so it
has suddenly and without warning started sending me empty email messages
(zero length body) with essentially null headers (none of the normal
email envelope headers and no indication of where the message came
from other than owner_cypherpunks@cyberpass.net).   And all flow of
actual cypherpunks list messages stopped when these anomalous messages
started.   I presume that each null message I got was really meant
to be a cypherpunks list mailing that somehow got trashed - superficially
this looks like an out of space condition in one of the spool queues.

	This condition persisted in one case for 4 or 5 days and in the
most recent case for about 3.  And then things suddently started working
again.

	So indeed their system administration may leave a bit to
be desired - perhaps they are barely afloat financially and can't
pay someone to watch things like space on their server queue file
systems and backups.
