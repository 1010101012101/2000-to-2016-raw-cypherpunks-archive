Discrimination in the good sense, like discriminating dangerous vs.
safe. What do you think insurance companies *should* do, if not make various
discriminations about risk?  Are you against car insurers asking
about your other genetic characteristics (e.g., sex)?

What a government can legitimately do should be reigned in
by a constitution.  And no more.

What are you smoking?

Corps have to please their customers or go extinct.  Real simple.
Only govt can print money.

You *should* be concerned about various individuals (legislators, their
wives, cultists, etc.) trying to get the government to use its violence to
accomplish their way.  You *shouldn't* be concerned about the _mutually
consensual interactions_ of the individuals (and voluntary associations
thereof, like corps.) within your borders.  Government should *only* be
concerned with nonconsensual interactions.
