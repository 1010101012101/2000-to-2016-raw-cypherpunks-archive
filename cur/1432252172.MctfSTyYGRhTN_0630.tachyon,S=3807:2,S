One of the advantages of using pdfparanoia is that you can directly
remove watermarks based on what we know about what publishers are
doing, instead of blindly guessing. If there is metadata about ip
addresses, write a plugin for pdfparanoia to detect it and remove it.
(Also write a unit test, so that future contributors can make sure
your code doesn't break). So far, I haven't seen evidence of metadata
being used like this. Really, they are all extremely pdf servers like
itext that are serving up http requests for unsuspecting scholars. My
guess is that the most "advanced" watermarking infrastructure is just
some LaTeX template that is being applied for each incoming http
request.
