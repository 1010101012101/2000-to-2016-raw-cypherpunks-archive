As in my previous message, it depends on how you're defining fear in this
application. Can a dog not fear disappointing its owner?

With that, I agree.

I was always told that the only form of physical admonishment one should
ever employ with a dog is a swift jerk at the scruff of the neck
(apparently imitating mother/puppy behavior). I don't particularly see
this being useful, however. The urge to react physically to undesirable
behavior is a failing in the human trainer. (Likewise, when your child
accidently steps on your dog's tail, you want the dog to yelp rather than
bite.)

[snip accurate description of the ordeal of housebreaking dogs]

One method that has worked for me, in addition to everything you've said,
is the repetition of a phrase while waiting for the dog to do his
business. I've spent many a night standing in my back yard saying
"hurry-up" in the sweetest voice imaginable to my puppies, and then
telling them how much of a good dog they are when they pee. Makes the
neighbors think I am batty, but they eventually equate "hurry-up" with
"take a leak", and I can get them to urinate on command.

Jim, most people on here won't know what an alpha roll is.

By extension, if you're ever in a situation where you fear you may be
attacked by a dog, avert your eyes. A staring contest with a strange
dog may end up with bloodshed.

The Monks of New Skete.

Absolutely.
