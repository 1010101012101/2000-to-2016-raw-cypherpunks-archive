C'mon Bill, that's not fair.  Even Osama commented on how
Bush was making good progress on that book about the goats
in the school on 9/11.  How W didn't even want to put it down,
he enjoyed it so much.

His fine reading skills even got shown in Fahrenheight 911,
along with some amusing footage of his handlers,
and that's a documentary, so it must be true.
