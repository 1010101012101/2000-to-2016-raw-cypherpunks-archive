Actually it is rather common practice for various jails/prisons to take
blood samples from everyone who stays long enough to be "processed" (by
processed I mean someone who is staying more than a couple of hours
waiting for bail). This is done for health reasons (aids, hepatitis, name
your disease here, testing), because of this the samples are taken from
everyone regardless of the crime accused of or convicted.  

I do not know what the policy is with the storing and recording of DNA
data but the specimens are being collected.
