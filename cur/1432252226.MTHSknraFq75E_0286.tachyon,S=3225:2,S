As I understand it, they're simply having similar agencies from other
countries doing the appropriate PW, followed by an extradition from those
countries willing to do so.

There has been a lot of change in this area over the last two years.

The feebs are in a position right now where it's not a matter of "swallowing
their pride", but rather a "corporate mandate" if you will: they have been
*ordered* to make these types of extraditions happen.  

Of course, the next [obvious] question is where did I get this
information?  From work: we had an incident that resulted in an FBI call and
international players from third world countries.

If it's just Mattd they're looking for, then I too doubt that he's worth
putting the wheels in motion for, but if it's something they consider "real",
I have absolutely no doubt that they are now in a position to successfully
complete an international extradition
