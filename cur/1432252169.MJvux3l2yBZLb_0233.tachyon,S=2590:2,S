The problem is to find a reasonable way for a relay to refuse to forward
unencrypted messages.  So that participants don't accidentally reveal the
discussion.

*Not* to identify the language or cipher algorithm.  *Where* do you get
that idea?
(Rhetorical, I realize who I'm replying to..)

A general and reliable heuristic is to measure entropy.  This will of course
pass unencrypted compressed files (including possibly jpeg, mpeg, etc.).  A
more
reliable 'cheat' is to look for headers.  This can also enforce an
additional (and perhaps
unwanted) requirement that a certain tool is used.  But again, malicious
posters
will be able to spoof this.
