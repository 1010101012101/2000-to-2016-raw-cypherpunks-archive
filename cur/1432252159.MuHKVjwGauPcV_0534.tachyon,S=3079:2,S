This is a valid and probably commendable political position.  I do not
believe, however, that it reflects current practice in the USA or
elsewhere.

I say "probably" because it seems likely that adopting this as a practice
would have very high costs.  How far would you have this go?  Is the US
government to be obligated to ensure these rights to everyone everywhere?
Does this mean liberating slaves in China and Saudi Arabia, for example?
Opening up Russian jails?  Forcing countries everywhere to grant the vote
to women, to educate children?

Hmmm.  Does the application of this principle mean that the US government
is going to require the British government to recognize the right to keep
and bear arms?  ;-)
