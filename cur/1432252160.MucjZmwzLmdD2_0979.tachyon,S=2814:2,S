 Investigators had a list of 20 possible suspects, but Fischer was moved
to the top. Detectives said
they attached a tracking device to her car, hoping to catch her in the
act.

On Sunday, more than 30 razor blades were found hidden in Alicia Park in
Mission Viejo. Had
Fischer been there, the tracking device should have recorded her visit
to the park. But the device
malfunctioned.
