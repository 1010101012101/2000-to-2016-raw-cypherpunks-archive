Yes, I am indeed a little suspicious. Clearly, this "quantum repeater" can't 
be doing an O/E, or no amount of hype will budge this product an inch.

Quantum Crypto utilizes pairs of correlated photons, so we can't be talking 
about an optical amplifer.

So since I've been away from the literature for a while, is there a device 
that can repair a deteriorating, about-to-be-collapsed superposition state? 
I can't see how this could occur without the requirement of acting on the 
other (correlated) photon either, and if that photon is physically removed 
from the first, then forget about it. (Though theoretically I think I can 
conceive of the possibility of two "correlated quantum repeaters" exchanging 
'information' (including gating) about the photon pair they are collectively 
handling*, but no way that can be useful commerically.)

*: This isn't quite as farfetched as it seems: Even 5 to 10 years ago it was 
shown that there can be quantum Forward Error Correction, and simple devices 
were demonstrated in the laboratory.
