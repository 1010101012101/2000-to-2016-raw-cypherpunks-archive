I'm sure you've thought of this, but there's also a reason (d):
because the most convenient component for a particular application is
vastly more secure than you need.  When using a cipher as a component,
you might as well use a ludicrously strong one like Rijndael or
Blowfish, because there's nothing to be gained from using a weaker
one.  Good locks are more expensive than bad ones, but strong crypto
is free.
