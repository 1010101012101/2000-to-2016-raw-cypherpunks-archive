There's nothing magical about it: I never said any amount of formal 
education is "guaranteed" to do a thing for you--it is very much where you 
are, who you know, and what you can get them to tell you. But even in the 
richest of environments, if you're not making the effort to acquire 
fundamental analytic skills, you might as well concede that you 
don't "speak the language" and would be better off taking the "capitol hill 
ho" route instead. Which is odious--and overrated, I might add.

Absolutely. But they all shared a certain mindset which made them far more 
than that, the whole point of bringing them up in the first place. Is that 
something anyone can teach you? Probably not. Does it depend on having an 
extremely high IQ and a lot of innate raw potential? You bet. But once you 
make the decision that there's something to be gained by demanding a lot 
from yourself, you need to find the right kind of program to facilitate 
getting you where you need to be to best further your ideas. And as far as 
I can tell, for me, the "super analyst" approach is the way to go. If you 
have any other suggestions I'd be glad to hear them.

There's no lack of smart cypherpunk-friendly lawyers, but brilliant pro-
freedom policy analysts are in short supply. If more people here at least 
considered this an option, I think it would be a good thing.
