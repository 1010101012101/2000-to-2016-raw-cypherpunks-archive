In case you haven't read it, here's a partial synopsis of Heinrich von
Kleist's "Michael Kohlhaas", written in 1810....

***

In Michael Kohlhaas, Heinrich von Kleist tells the grim story of how a
relatively small injustice escalates almost into civic insurrection. It is the
story of the wealthy horse trader Michael Kohlhaas.

The strange and unhappy story of this man takes it beginning one day when he is
travelling to Saxony with a couple of well-fed young horses. Crossing the
border he is asked to show his travel permit. Michael Kohlhaas has never heard
that such permit is necessary, and does not have money available to pay for
one. Instead he leaves behind as security two black horses together with a boy
who is told to care well for them. They are all placed in the care of the
castle bailiff, Junker Wenzel von Tronka.

When Michael Kohlhaas later arrives in Dresden he finds out that a travel
permit was not necessary. He succeeds in selling the rest of his horses and
returns to collect his two black horses and the boy. He finds the horses in
miserable condition in a stable, while the boy has been chased away for
disobedience. 

Kohlhaas is incensed and refuses to accept the horses as they are. Instead he
carries his case to the court, but his complaint is turned down, apparently
because the bailiff, Junker Tronka, is related to the officials of the court.
His wife goes to Berlin to deliver a petition in person. Guards hinder her in
delivering the petition and by accident one of them wounds her fatally. 

Kohlhaas swears revenge. He rides to the castle of Junker Wenzel von Tronka,
and burns down everything.The Junker has already fled to Wittenberg. Kohlhaas
follows him, torches part of the town, and threatens to continue until the
Junker is delivered to him. The Junker flees to Leipzig with Kohlhaas at his
heels. A growing number of people is following Kohlhaas. What began as a
personal vendetta has grown into a small but dangerous insurrection.


***

I won't spoil the ending...a great story!

~Faustine.

 oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will
reach to himself.
