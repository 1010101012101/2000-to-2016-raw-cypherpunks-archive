Early this morning, US Marshals and MPD officers descended upon the Olive 
Branch Community's house at 1006 M Street, NW, to evict the residents of 
the building. The Marshals searched the building and removed some of the 
personal property belonging to Olive Branch residents. One resident 
described the eviction process as "political oppression."

The City Council voted Monday to put homeless people in jail if they are 
caught sitting or lying on downtown sidewalks. Violators of the new 
ordinance could face a $500 fine and 60 days in jail.
