Your assessment of Debian corresponds to my understanding.

For those who just can't get enough of The Man "demoncraticly" imposing
his collective will on you, you might be sad to read the following and
find some empathy with one of the world's all time greatest democracy
promoters, George Soros:

Soros Complains Russia Now 'Global Power' While EU 'Falling Apart'
Has the billionaire regime-change architect finally admitted defeat?
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/aww-thats-shame-soros-complains-russia-now-global-power-eu-falling-apart/ri15098

A dejected George Soros confessed yesterday that not all is proceeding
according to his grand design.

 Club in London, Britain June 20, 2016

Attending a London pow-wow with fellow Russia-haters, the world's most
infamous private "democracy" promoter had this to say, according to
Reuters ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-soros-idUSKCN0Z629H ):

   Billionaire investor George Soros said on Monday he saw Russia emerging
   as a global power as the European Union collapses, in much the same way
   as the EU flourished when the Soviet Union started falling.

   Soros added that he felt "more than ever" that the EU's destiny hinged
   on Ukraine's future, speaking in London at an event hosted by the Open
   Russia, a Russian opposition movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail
   Khodorkovsky.

So the future of the European Union hinges on a bankrupt, failed state run
by oligarchs, Nazi militia, mafia and general psychopaths (
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/shocking-confession-ukranian-dr-evil-bragging-about-killing-militiamen-donbas/ri15095
). I'm sure the French, Germans, and Italians are gratified to hear that.
Somehow I think they probably disagree.

European nations have lost billions in trade with Russia since the
introduction of sanctions - which they are apparently renewing (
http://sputniknews.com/politics/20160621/1041666675/eu-russia-sanctions.html
) once again at Washington's demand. 

If this is the future they will be tied to, all the more reason for the
British to vote to leave the EU on June 23.

But Soros hasn't given up on the EU dream completely - he wrote (
http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36582026 ) in The Guardian today
attempting to scare British voters that going through with Brexit will
collapse the pound. 

Soros is probably growing frustrated at the increasingly hard time he is
having at building the new world order he wants. Russia's not cooperating,
and populations in Europe are supporting EU-skeptic parties while American
voters are supporting Trump.

Here's hoping he meets continued disappointment. His misfortune is the
world's gain.
