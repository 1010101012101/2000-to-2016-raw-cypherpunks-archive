Actually, most of the features of Nogsuccob are features that I
want, like integrity protected, authenticated boot.  The problem,
bundled with those features, is the ability of the system to attest to
its secure boot.  This can be fixed by not letting the host know if
you've exported its host key or not, which makes it possible to run a
virtualized, trusted copy in your emulation environment.
