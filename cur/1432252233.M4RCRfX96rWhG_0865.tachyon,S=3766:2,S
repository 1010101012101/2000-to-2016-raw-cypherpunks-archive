    That's a common arguement used against biofuels which doesn't hold water. In
the first place, whether it's biodiesel or ethanol, you still have the vast
majority of the food left after you extract the oil or ethanol -- meal cake or
"brewer's grains" (a very high quality protein).

Right at the moment we have  farmers (US) being paid *not* to grow, and/or
growing at a loss. Corn is now by far the cheapest fuel for home heating.

    Right, but there's a tremendous amount available right now, and an awful lot
getting dumped in landfills and  illegally down drains.

   And if you start looking at gasification of waste biomass, there are amazing
amounts available at least in western countries.
