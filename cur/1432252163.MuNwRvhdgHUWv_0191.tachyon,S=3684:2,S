I need to sign up for health insurance tomorrow.  I'm going to buy
individual coverage from Kaiser.  On their form, it asks for an SSN,
of course.

Well, Kaiser is not a government agency, and is certainly not
associated with the Social Security Adminisrtation in any way, so they
have no legitimate need for my SSN, and I don't want to give it to
them.  I'm wondering how best to go about doing this:

1. I could make up an SSN and give it to them.  I basically just have
   to make sure it's one that hasn't been taken, and corresponds to my
   real birth county, right?
================================

Try this instead....

1. Get copies of the forms they wish you to sign.

2. Re-image and delete any wording which "certifies under perjury" that 
the information is correct.  Add or change the revision numbering sequence 
info, so later you can counter claims it was a fraudulent submission ("Hey,
 check the revision number, its not your form you accepted but mine.)
