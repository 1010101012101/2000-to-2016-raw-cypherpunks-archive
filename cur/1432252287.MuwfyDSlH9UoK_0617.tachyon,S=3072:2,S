Think of it as DIVX for PCs, with a similar chance of success (see my earlier
post about TCPA being a dumping ground for failed crypto hardware initiatives
from various vendors).  Its only real contribution is that the WAVEoid board on
Ragingbull (alongside the Rambus one) is occasionally amusing to read, mostly
because it shows that the dot-com sharemarket situation would be better
investigated by the DEA than the FTC.
