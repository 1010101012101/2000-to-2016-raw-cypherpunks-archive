I'm now 49, and "car" has been much more common in these United 
States than "automobile"  has been, in my lifetime.

Further, I often hear Britishisms which are far longer and more 
labored than the American equivalents. For example:

"articulated lorry" vs. "semi"

"redundant" vs. "laid-off"

"Mackintosh" vs. "raincoat"

"Pantechnicon" = "moving van"

(I only learned this last one on a site devoted to Britishisms vs. 
Americanisms.)

Fact is, both dialects of English have longer versions of the same 
basic word than other dialects have.

Which is preferable is a matter of taste and familiarity.
