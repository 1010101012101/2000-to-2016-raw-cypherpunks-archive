I would like to read worthwhile books in the cypherpunk genre! I have a few 
questions:

Can you distinguish a "cypherpunk" genre from a "cyberpunk" genre, and is it 
a worthwhile distinction, and what are the features ?
What are the worthwhile books to read to learn about cryptography in the 
future, and the culture of people "into" cryptography ("cryptoheads"!) ?
