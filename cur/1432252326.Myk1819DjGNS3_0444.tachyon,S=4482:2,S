It's about Spain so there may be some spittle spray from long time trot 
lunatic jamesd.Switch and bait?
By Giles Tremlett
Madrid
August 24 2002
More than 60 years after one of Europe's bloodiest civil wars, campaigners 
believe Spain will set up a truth commission to find out what happened to 
the tens of thousands of people who disappeared after being arrested by 
Franco's rebel forces.
The commission was one of the demands made at the United Nations this week 
by a group of relatives of the disappeared. They also want the government 
to dig up and identify the corpses of 30,000 people believed to have been 
summarily executed by Franco's followers and buried in mass graves.
The campaigners took their case to the UN's working group on forced 
disappearances after Spanish judges and the People's Party government 
refused to start the search for the bodies.
Santiago Macias, of the Association for the Recovery of Historic Memory, 
said: "This is like the victims of Pinochet in Chile or those of Videla in 
Argentina.
"We know who the assassins were but in this case we are not after them. 
What we want is the historic truth."
Something jamesd is shit scared of.
