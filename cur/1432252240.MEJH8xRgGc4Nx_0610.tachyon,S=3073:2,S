Seems like you could do this with a slightly tweaked mixmaster-style
remailer chain that allows a message to specify branching.

in -> (mix steps) -> out1 + out2 + out3

Or even better, have out1, out2, and out3 diverge and run through their
own mix chains with randomly-selected lengths to make it harder to
correlate pieces of a message.

Then you just need some up-front processing and the reverse on the
client end to combine out{1,2,3} into an intelligible message.  Perhaps
something where each (n-1) messages can be used to produce a decryption
key for the nth?

Don't see why you'd do it, but it does seem nifty.
