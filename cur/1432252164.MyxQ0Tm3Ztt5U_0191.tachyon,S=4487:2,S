 >>Something that's sad is that the National Security Agency has abdicated
its role in helping to secure communications critical to these United
States.<<

Not to me,any division and mistrust in the enemies ranks is an opportunity 
to divide and rule them.It is sad how low a pseudo anarchist can stoop in 
his fog of senility.

  >>To wit, its COMSEC role. Part of the charter of the NSA is to
provide COMSEC for critical communications, including ensuring strong
ciphers. <<

That for critical communications.The recent Anthrax/9-11 scare showed 
congress is expendable

 >>Because it has spent much of the past decade trying to slow
down strong encryption<snip> Blueberries and similar devices are now being 
given to Congressmen and
other government employees and officials <<

Thats great,they are expendable,even Faustine knows that.

as a means of communicating
with them in times of national emergency. Laptops <snip> Thank the NSA and 
folks
like Dorothy Denning for stunting the implementation of good crypto in
consumer products. <<

Probably why I haven't issued a fatwa against her yet.She's as dumb as 
paint so should be an *asset*

Good to know that Al Quaida knows the ARDIS hacks <<

Those fuckwits dont even know APster! Is there an arabic translation of 
Assassination politics? Hasan al fuck invented the word Assassination.

and will have them
ready to go when they strike next: Blueberry Emergency Alert to Rep.
Barney Frank: "Rep. Frank, report soonest to this [isolated] location in
the woods [where our agents can kill you]. signed, Agent Farr [Abdullah
Al Ragheda]."<<

Forest grunts are already out there.They pay tax and live off others 
taxes.They can expect no mercy from me.Im not JB.

  --Tim May, Occupied America

Caves of Corralitos,Cali actually,where I bitch and moan constantly about 
big Goobermint and high taxes and do fuck all about it.Look on my works ye 
mighty and despair.(kill the president.)

"They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety
deserve neither liberty nor safety." -- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.Yeah what 
happened to cyberliberty Tim? That was safe.
