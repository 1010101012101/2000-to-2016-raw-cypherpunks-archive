I think what Lucky means is that the remailer operators have no way of 
knowing if the messages passing between remailers are actual messages, 
dummy traffic, stats pings, etc.

All that a remailer can tell is the number of real messages entering or 
leaving his server (and even this would require modification to the 
remailer software). Unless all the remailer operators collected and shared 
this information, we can't know accurate stats for the remailer network as 
a whole.

How much are dummy messages that come from one remailer and die at the
last remailer? How much are pings that return to the originating
remailer/stats collector? These aren't helpful if you are a remailer user
wishing to hide in the crowd -- you need lots of other remailer users
generating traffic.
