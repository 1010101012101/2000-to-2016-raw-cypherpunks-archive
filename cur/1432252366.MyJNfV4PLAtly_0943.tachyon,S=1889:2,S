Sonoma Police Chief John Gurney, who described the attacks as a
"sophisticated campaign of domestic terrorism," said: "They're trying to

Manrique said the vandals had left behind a videotape of his family
inside the house that had been shot through a window.

The radical group Earth Liberation Front issued an unsigned e-mail
Friday calling the incidents ELF actions,'' and the FBI was
investigating the dealership fire as domestic terrorism, Police Chief
Frank Wills said.
