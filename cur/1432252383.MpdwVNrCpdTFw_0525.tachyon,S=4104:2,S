The US makes these claims on their own. If they are the "good guys" 
than they should act like it. Not only when it is convenient but also 
when it is not. Morale is not about the "best bang for the buck" but 
about integrity. The US Government clearly does not possess a lot of 
integrity when it comes to morale.

Televising this for propaganda purposes.

No, what I am saying is that no matter what he did, the US still has to 
play by international rules (or should at least). Using those images 
from Saddam as Propaganda clearly is wrong.
