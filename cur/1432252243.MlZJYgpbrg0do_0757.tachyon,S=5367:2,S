No Hype Needed...Just Do The Math
====================================

TAKE A LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS: 
NO HYPE NEEDED!

1 full bronze=$322.50/mo.  - 1 full silver = $1,612.50/mo.
1 full gold=$14,512.50/mo. - 1 full Platinum=$80,512.50/mo.

Each Round is a 3X3 forced matrix, ie. 3-9-27.
The entire progression from Bronze to Platinum is
completely self-funding. And the chart above is only
one part of the commission structure. If you'll dig in
and read the website, you may lose some sleep tonight.
