Douglas Diesels Limited

of=20

Nova Scotia, Canada

Has been working on a project with cooperation with several other =
companies. This project includes construction and turn on of =
commuication cables at sea. The amount of time spent on this is 11 =
months to the day. Once the whole operation is up and running the shares =
will be taken to the Toronto Stock Exchange, We are in the process of =
creating a company called "Canber Communications", here in Canada. This =
company exsists of 100 million shares. So far up to date we have buyers =
for 14.5 million shares at $10.00 a share. However, we are trying to =
sell off 49 million preferred shares in total. We are looking for =
investors and people to help us find investors. If we can agree upon a =
reasonable commision we would be willing to give each broker a =
percentage of shares to sell. Anyone interested in doing business with =
us and would like more information on this must sign a non disscloure =
agreement. If interested let us know and we will forward the non =
disclosure agreement.=20

Sincerely,
