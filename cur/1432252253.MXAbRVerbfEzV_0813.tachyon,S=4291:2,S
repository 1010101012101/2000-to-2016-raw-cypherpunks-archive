For forty years the grisly activities of Japan's Unit 731 and sister units, 
remained
the best kept secret of World War two. The victorious Allies were desperate 
to secretly
acquire the expertise and know how of the Japanese Biological Warfare 
research. Fulsome
records of the human experimentation undertaken, were especially sought. 
Hindered at home
by social repulsion to such activities, human experimentation data was 
viewed as the jewel
in the crown.
Scientists and medical experts from Fort Detrick, Maryland - the American 
top secret BW
facility - raced to interview Japanese technicians. Barely one of them 
stopped to consider
the ethical implications. Having assessed the facts, an intelligence cable 
coldly informed
the War Department, Washington DC, that the "foregoing information warrants
conclusion that Japanese BW Group, headed by Ishii did violate rules of land
warfare." The message added pragmatically: "this expression of opinion is not a
recommendation that group be charged and tried as such." None of those 
implicated in
Japanese BW research were brought to trial by the Allies.
