Are you claiming that DNA collected by the police is then given to 
insurance companies?

An audacious claim. Do you evidence to support this extraordinary claim?

I will be very interested to hear which communities, which states, 
are doing this. So will many journalists, I hope.

On the other hand, having heard that even getting a simple blood or 
saliva sample requires court action, I expect you are once again 
merely hand-waving.

As for insurance companies "discriminating," this is what I hope for. 
Those of us who don't engage in certain practices--smoking, sky 
diving, anal sex, whatever--should not be subsidizing those who do. 
This is the beauty of "opt out" plans.


But the first order of business is for you to support your claim that 
DNA is collected by the police and then shared with insurance 
companies.
