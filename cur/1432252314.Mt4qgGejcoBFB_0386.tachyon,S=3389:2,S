Um, governments and organized crime achieve this goal on a
regular basis.

Governments by having an effective monopoly on violence in a 
given area (George the Second bears the blood of over 300 
people who presented no threat to society (they were already 
incarcerated)). 

Organized criminals by having the resources and manpower to
effectively separate the person ordering a hit from the person
doing the hit, and to cover up the evidence.

Beyond that, even non-distributed murders are often unsolved,
especially when there is no pre-existing link between murderer
and victim (eg, many serial killers).
