Really?  You got this mail through an old modem and linux box..

Google for 'winmodem' and linux finds:
http://www.linmodems.org/
plus lots of other links you may find useful.

Microsoft's lock on the winmodem appears to have been pretty short.

Commonly used interfaces do eventually become well known.
While they do have owners, the amount of market interia they
develop makes then essentially unchangeable.

But demanding that they be "communal property" sounds like
the sort of socialism that can only be imposed by authority
and fails when it is imposed.

That's been done before-- Diamond refused for years to supply info
to Xfree86, so there was a boycott of Diamond graphic cards in
the Linux community.  They eventually saw the light (or market).

1. figuring out the winmodem interface.  It's software, so its possible.
But it appears that others have already done the work for at least
some winmodem chips.

2. boycotting winmodem makers.  Not likely to work in this case since
most modem makers sell the things.  Besides, the market drive for
reduced chip count and the PC makers' hunger for anything that chews up CPU
cycles and drives consumers to buy faster machines is a lot stronger
than that for linux.

3. beg for some higher power to "do something".  You can probably
guess from my tone that I don't think much of this option.
