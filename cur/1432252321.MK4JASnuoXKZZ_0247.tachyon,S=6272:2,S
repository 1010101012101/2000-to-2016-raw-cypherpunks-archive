I guess it depends on the country.  In the U.S., I'm not sure what
would happen.

You are correct.  Just so it's clear, I did say "IF raising taxes to
95%..."  I'm not sure that it would.

Again, it depends on the economic framework under which we are operating.

I don't know, what black markets would arise?  If people were housed,
clothed, fed, etc, then most would still have plenty of disposable
income to buy what they wanted.

I'm not sure.  However, if all housing and food was provided by the
government, and not paying your appropriate level of taxes removed
your entitlement to said housing and food, then I'd think most people
would pay their taxes.

Not that I'm advocating government being the sole distributor of food
or anything.  I'm just illustrating that it depends on the exact situation.

Who would revolt?  The rich?  Too few in numbers.  The middle class?
They're apathetic, and they'd still get access to everything they had
under our system in the new system.  The poor?  They'd be better off,
so they wouldn't revolt.  Cypherpunks?  Sorry, guys, but there aren't
that many of you. ;-)

> What about public choice theory?

I'm not familiar with this.  Want to explain it to me?  Probably not,
seeing as both you and T.C. seem to think that I'm not worth speaking
to.  Ah, well.
