Syria and Libya expressed condemnation of the WTC event, so I expect 
they looked at the likely upcoming firestorm and decided they'd better 
sign on with Uncle Sam. Cuba did as well.

I think this worsen things for us, because the New World Order is 
gathering a huge head of steam. Expect to see a worldwide ban on 
privacy, with Fidel Castro invited to the White House.

This is exactly how it is looking.

Feinstein, Schumer, Feingold, Lieberman, and all of the other usual 
suspects are scrambling to repeal what they can of the Constitution.

I'm betting, as I said in my last post, that strong unescrowed crypto 
will be illegal by December 15th.

(Not that this would have stopped the WTC cells from planning their 
attacks in apartments, motel rooms, etc., nor from using the signals 
they sent over pagers and cell phones. Good old-fashoned codes are 
impossible to defeat.)

Or noting who is flying them upside down, the symbol of distress.
