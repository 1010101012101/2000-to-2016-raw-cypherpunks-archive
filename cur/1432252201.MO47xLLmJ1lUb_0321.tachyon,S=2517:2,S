You are correct.  

They are needed to perform DES as spec'd in the FIPS, so just
for interoperability you've gotta keep them.

When you do 3DES you can combine them.

These permutations cost only wires in hardware, but take cycles on a CPU.
This is one of the reasons that DES is inefficient in software.
