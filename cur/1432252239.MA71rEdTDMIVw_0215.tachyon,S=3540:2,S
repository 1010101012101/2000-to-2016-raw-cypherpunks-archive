EMI samples new digital security

     By Gwendolyn Mariano CNET News.com

     In an effort to prevent unauthorized copying of music files, EMI
Recorded Music said
     Tuesday it will begin using security from BayView Systems that
offers a new twist on the
     burgeoning technology known as digital rights management.

                      Unlike competitors that use encryption or
watermarking techniques to
                      prevent copying, San Francisco-based BayView
Systems has designed
                      its Duolizer technology to essentially split music
files in two. A large,
                      main file, called the Flexible File, is stored on
the listener's hard drive,
                      while a smaller file, called the Secure Stream, is
stored on a
                      password-protected server, controlled by the
content owner. Listeners
                      enter the password to have the smaller file
streamed and listen to the
                      song.

                      The two files are combined while the song is
played, but otherwise
                      remain separate. The company said that the owner's
rights are
     preserved because end-users never have a complete [Ed note: fnord]
copy of the music, regardless of the
     number of times the file is shared.
