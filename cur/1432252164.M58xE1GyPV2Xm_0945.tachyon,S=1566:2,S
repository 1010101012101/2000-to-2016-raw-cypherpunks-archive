Back in the old days, Tim May would occasionally talk about the 
Kolmogorov-Chaitin theories about randomness - Kolmogorov complexity gives 
you a lot of deep explanations about this sort of problem.  Alas, I never 
actually *read* those papers, but there's been a lot of mathematical 
thought about what randomness means.
