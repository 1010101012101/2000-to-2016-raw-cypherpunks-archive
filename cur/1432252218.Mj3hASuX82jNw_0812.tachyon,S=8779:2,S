Yes, it was our own government propaganda, just like the "baby milk"
factory being a top secret biological weapons manufacturing facility, and
numerous other such examples from the war.

The famous "baby incubator" story was fiction performed in front of the US
Congress to mobilize support for the war, and the supposed eyewitness was
later revealed to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador.  The entire
episode was scripted by an American PR firm hired by the Kuwaiti
government.

Goodness, I thought everyone with more than five brain cells was aware of
these undisputed facts, which were widely publicized at the time.

As the old Russian saying goes, "He lied like an eyewitness."

I am aware there there is no credible evidence supporting the first
allegation, and I am not familiar with the second one.  If you have such
evidence, feel free to set up a web site, and let people judge for
themselves.

> Apparently you have never been in the military... 

This is kind of like someone criticizing the parent beating their child
with a 2x4, and the first words out of the parent's mouth are a smug -
"You're obviously not a parent, are you?"

The first sign of a nutcase is the attempt to disqualify everyone who
isn't a member of their clique from commenting on their behavior.

Particularly odd when the pathology of the behavior is apparently to
almost everyone, without the need for special training.

So, you post to Cypherpunks a lot, do you?

I assure you I have a knowlege of not only how soldiers are trained, but
the behavioral engineering behind it.

We should mourn all individuals unjustly slaughtered.  We should also
recognize that public outrage over such killings is directly proportional
to the media airtime used to promote their victimhood.  So clearly, the OK
victims get a better opportunity to do this than the Waco victims.

American lives, are, despite what you may believe, not worth more than the
lives of any other humans on the planet.

The first excuse of every bully is that the victim "made him do it" by not
acquiesing to his demands.

> Do I believe that the government got together and decided to kill

The government got together and decided upon a course of action which
showed reckless disregard for the people in the building, and had as its
primary purpose a demonstration that no one may defy the government and
get away with it.  The safety of the people in the building was only a
minor consideration.

Was anyone held accountable for their deaths?  NO...  We had a commission
whose purpose was to whitewash the whole thing, and write a report blaming
the victims.

Did the government make a "mistake" at Ruby Ridge too, where FBI Sniper
Lon Horiuchi shot and killed Vicki Weaver as she held her baby in her
arms?

Yes, he tried to kill lots of people at the federal building.  Your point?

Tim McVeigh has no monopoly on killing large numbers of civilians while
"sending a message" to some government.  It wasn't Tim McVeigh who was
quickly bulldozing the dead Panamanian citizens into mass graves just in
time to get them out of the way for the arriving reporters. 

I could cite numerous other cases.

"Terror is a very effective form of communication."
                               --Delenn, Babylon 5

Now, if Tim McVeigh had tried to get 2/3 thirds of the states to ratify a
Constitutional Amendment prohibiting the government from barbequing and
shooting children, do you think he would have gotten his message sent as
quickly or as effectively?  Sometimes dirty deeds demand dirty
retaliation. 

The United States is the world's foremost International Bully, and a
premiere committer of violent acts to further its foreign policy goals.

The United States has zero moral authority to criticize Tim McVeigh's
methods.

The US Government made some decisions, and now it has paid for them too.

Sauce for the gander, and all that.

The last two federal trials I've followed, McVeigh's, and Jim Bell's,
there was no doubt in any ones mind that the defense attorney was working
for the government.
