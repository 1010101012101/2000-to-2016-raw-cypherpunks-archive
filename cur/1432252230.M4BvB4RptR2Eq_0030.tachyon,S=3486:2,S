Fair enough.  But this is not Chaum's scheme, it is Wagners and it is
DH based (or ECDH based in your writeup).

You said earlier:

> Simple Chaumian blinding works fine on EC.  

and the above scheme is not Chaumian blinding.  Chaum never invented
DH blinding, if you read Brands thesis even you'll see that Chaum (who
was Brands PhD supervisor for some of the time) told Brands to forget
about trying to do DH based blinding because it's not possible.
Brands credits Chaum for setting the challenge :-) which led him to
find ways to do DH based blinding.  (And the private key certificate
which is a generalisation of DH blinding to multiple attributes and
selective disclosure of those attributes).
