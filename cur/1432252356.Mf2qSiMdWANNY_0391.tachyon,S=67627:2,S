The ocean's hidden waves show their power / stratification...
http://phys.org/news/2014-01-ocean-hidden-power.html

[q]  Their effect on the surface of the ocean is negligible, producing a
rise of just inches that is virtually imperceptible on a turbulent sea. But
internal waves, which are hidden entirely within the ocean, can tower
hundreds of feet, with profound effects on the Earth's climate and on ocean
ecosystems. (...) These waves are potentially "the key mechanism for
transferring heat from the upper ocean to the depths," Peacock says, so the
focus of the research was to determine exactly how the largest of these
waves, as revealed through satellite imagery of the Luzon Strait region,
are generated.[/q]

the sandwich is so minimal and boring, works best with lettuce (arugula!)

comments: i think the viewpoint in the above article demonstrates a certain
narrowed conceptualization or myopia even, of technological systems as
being more than the end-use tools that are interfaced with, say on the
screen of a 'smart tv' or its hardware configurations and options. these
are indicators of functionality, though they map into larger, extended
systems - infrastructures, and various industries and buildings that have
been effectively rationalized under an earlier broadcast, then cable model,
now importing 'internet' content such as youtube videos and streaming
movies (redbox, amazon video, etc) as additional layers or services. [note-
still at CRT here, not sure how it functions exactly in these terms.]

what is happening is one way to analyze the situation. what could be
happening- the *potential* for network-based television, is a larger
question and consideration. such a large enigma that Steve Jobs of Apple,
Inc. claimed to have cracked the idea of television open, and realized or
discovered resolution for a future model of television, likely involving
the issue of its content ecosystem in addition to interface.

a missing parameter in referencing [tv] without distinguishing past and
future conceptual differences is that the cathode-ray-tubes of the past and
liquid crystal displays (LCD) of the present HDTVs are of different
parameters of functionality. it is not about connecting a CRT display to
the global network as if 'Internet TV', another channel to tune into via
airwaves. instead it is a television display (LCD) screen that has become a
computer, and thus is more like having a personal computer becoming a
television, though it can also tune into airwaves and network protocols as
its channel spectrum.

so while it is true perhaps that there is a limit to innovation in the
hardware interfaces due to a limit reached in the given model, within
certain constraints -- including content ownership via media conglomerates
based on DRM and copyright restrictions, redistribution rights, and
royalties -- which is basically the entire media industry, from radio to
television to movies to music (and publishing even), this viewpoint is
based on the idea that this situation is fixed in its given functioning and
cannot be surpassed or radically changed, within those parameters.

so part of the larger consideration would be to consider HDTV beyond the
local tool or artifact - the television set - and consider the ecosystem it
functions within and potentially could function within, interface with.
first off: the TV set is recontextualized in the realm of the global
computer network, and thus it is at least in part an issue of an 'internet
television' set as HDTV device, interface, functionality, hardware,
software, programming, content, display.

likely curved screens, touch interfaces, wireless, menus/UI, refresh speed,
resolution, these kinds of parameters have tangible effects on
functionality, ease of use, enjoyment, if the design is effective. though
-what- is accessible is a fundamental issue; and for many, this likely
involves a cultural wasteland of commercial content chock full of
advertisements , where the experience of seamless channel surfing has
become bureaucratized, as IP and broadcast frequencies are different
systems, and content exists in multiple formats in several locations (say
media server, internet services, movie streaming, over-the-air) and thus
begins to be unmanageable at the level of interface, requiring much effort
to access and view content that is not preprogrammed and formatted (a
guess, reading feedback of others)

in that there are multiple systems, formats, menus, issues of having to
type or input data, difficulty in doing so, etc. time, energy, frustration,
when pre-computer TV was simple. basic. and always worked except for
transmission glitches or interruptions. prior to being made obsolete by a
new 'digital standard', making old sets no longer functional in the 'new
system' which turns out to be CHAOS, a difficult to mediate or resolve
cultural question, unless it is not in question- which then only involves
extending the existing model, parameters further. and then it is only about
dollars, selling units of HDTV, per capita consumption of mass media
dressed-up as internet content, via extension of the same systems, one-way
media delivery. except- youtube, memes, perhaps TED Conferences, etc. then
also, videoteleconferencing.

the larger question of infrastructure involves parallel video content that
could be made accessible or available to these networked HDTVs. imagine
community television, anywhere in the world. or special access to a school
video archive of a children's play, requiring private login to view years
later. though also, ideas and debates recorded on video, theater and plays
as performance videos, music concerts and recitals, educational
programming, lectures, etc. this was the earlier model or potential that
was passed over, never allowed to develop by the existing rationalization,
within its controlling interest and technical parameters. instead such
'civic content' is locked out, or made into a proprietary channel or
service, oftentimes content requiring additional payment for access,
instead of offering it as a public service, say for sustaining and
improving cultural awareness, cultural literacy. instead, the bane of
pledge drives for 'public TV' interrupts such content with commercials,
advertisements that demand tithing in order to keep the awful
content-system moving in the same backwards direction, a charade of
educational programming, a heist of 'public airwaves' and spectrum, for
what thus amounts to a private ideological approach to mass media,
everywhere colonized the same.

just consider - and certainly fortunate you are if not familiar with this
television content - how destructive a show like "Friends" is to
programming behavior of populations who then mimic and extend adult
adolescence as 'shared consciousness' via brainwashed young people who
congregate and behave similarly, as if adulthood involves preschool for
shared groups. as if this dumbing-down is an education in ignorance,
condoning and developing it (said show is show cynical perhaps it is
covert-based military propaganda even, to promote such decline)

so instead of communicating about meaningful ideas via television or video,
having debates about ideas, the content is trivial and stupid. demeaning,
debasing, idiotic, and formulaic for the very antihuman principles ruling
over and oppressing populations in daily environments. what kind of
relation does Hollywood have with human citizens exactly? why is mass media
programming hostile to ideas of freedom, intelligence, beyond their narrow
self-interest? what kind of public trust is that which seeks to eliminate
other perspectives, public goals, ideals, principles, and instead actively
dismantles, destroys, prevents, censors such views? and everyone who
*purchases* their television content, pays or buys into this services.
VOTES for it via participating in the onesided delivery model of ungrounded
perspective, warped beliefs, antihuman agendas, normalized and standardized
as if 'shared culture' and not unshared cult exploiting humans via oneway,
entropic expropriation of human power, decision-making, relations,
intelligence, via- most likely- endless signed ~legal documents

now that is dark humor. so dark that the laugh track  and non-funny
comediennes provide a diorama-like span of artifice in which to place the
malaise of being lost in such false POVs.

this one-way formatting of culture in hostile terms and dynamics... then
leading to adult preschoolers as the constituency, filling up the void in
mass media as its representatives and participants. the state as mass media
production, then waging war against terrorists, turning against its own
citizenry and constitution. the script turned into a government
prescription that then formats and 'owns' the development (and decline) of
culture via its representation. political engineering, social engineering,
behavioral engineering - marcom & advertising.

public issues and interests then are a pay-per-access approach. parallel to
this, timepiece, the SPOT watch by Microsoft, which could have indicated an
innovative approach to content, except for a monthly or yearly fee to
access radio-broadcast content for the 'smart watch', such that to get the
weather report required tithing. any blip of news, more dimes and quarters.
and thus content-limited, dies out. maximal payment via cellular data
services-- requiring payment of full cellphone plan prior to access data or
services are extra fees, such that actual *information* and data is rare,
unless people live to SMS and that is their lifework

the model of content distribution, ownership, approaches to 'profit'-
removed of a vital and fundamental civic dimension and component that is
absent from these devices and tools. essentially boxed-in by a limited
privatized approach that relies on _censoring outside views and content
from a given platform or industry or media, because that constraint becomes
the basis for moneymaking instead of- i don't know- doing something
worthwhile for humanity, in an innovative and ingenious way that still
makes money, and does not falsely constrain or limit or confine the device
or its future media development out of selfish private interest at the
expense of larger human goals and needs. again- i don't know... like
knowing when the bus is going to arrive at a bus stop via a watch or PDA or
phone- as a public service. and having such data available and accessible
for populations - and then developing more based on such public services
and infrastructures, including media libraries accessible via HDTVs,
schools or university resources and classes as part of public outreach,
etc. in a coherent approach and model based on shared goals, principles,
incentives, reflecting a value in truth and honoring content as more than
private moneymaking ventures that turn culture into a fool's paradise
the civic versus commercial footprint, not just for profit or even
non-profit, also no-profit, a model of the commons and public human sphere
that could be developed outside the given approaches, in parallel to it,
and then made accessible via these tools, as another channel or interface,
though likely a million times larger and full of all the best resources of
culture. and being a citizen provides access, instead of having to pay for
it through a third-party always

so the issue of this existing development of idiocy as the basis for social
relations (antisocial) if not promoting xenophobia via such group dynamics
that become standard, 'the measure' by which others are judged, in these
devolved terms and conditions. including in thinking, such that the
ignorant become the masses who then single out unique individuals are the
problem, the very opposite of democratic potentials, that ideas matter, not
just shared views and beliefs in a larger louder physically more strong
group who are superficial, shallow, and by most indications, incredibly
stupid and extremely proud of it- because this ignorance is the very basis
for social power, engineering consensus and compliance with such lowered
viewpoints as if ideal, enlightened by conformity, by fitting in,
submission, cultic bliss.

it is difficult to write beyond this condition because it is the culture,
it is the televised content, it has taken over 'online programming' and
forms the basis for substitute discourse via idiotic memes and 'dialogue'
about meaningless events as structure for shared relations and reality,
making trivial the everyday, into issues of consumption,
co-media/commodities that participation then validates as a process,
sustaining and building false perspectives, structures, frameworks that can
further be exploited, oppress, via these same means/memes

high-brow, high art, intellectualism and theory-speak and social affairs to
low brow to the realm of the debased and disgusting, all on the same
cultural level, ungrounded, headed in an antihuman direction with an
actively hostile agenda, and yet nonsensical or immune from 'reason' beyond
opinion, due to loss of logic beyond binary ideology & its quick
judgements. in this way mass media - networked or not - becoming channel
surfing, there is always yet another choice to tune into, ignore the
others, even while it persists, keeps on developing, though these 'other
choices' are still the same thing, annihilating all hope of any change in
principles and goals and ideals- because they are against human culture,
implicitly, by design

a question of platforms and tools and devices to access a parallel content
system would need to investigate how to establish a framework for what
exists as a latent yet unused resource, of video or recordings, and then
model a way to integrate this public content into a common model that could
scale from local to state to global interconnectivity, then to standardize
this and establish a common interface that is of highest use and function
and usability versus the oft encountered lowest functionality for such
resources, set at odds with basic searches or categorization, for lack of
coherent modeling of concepts and ideas, beyond unique strings

reading about CES recently, the recent yearly Consumer Electronics Show, a
quote from the Sony CEO reminded me of some of the unique potentials built
into existing tools for access that could co-exist in traditional models
and offer potentially an interface into this world beyond the private-only
model, where cultural media resources could someday be accessed.

reference: Sony CEO says cloud TV won't compete with cable
http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285310/sony-ceo-kaz-hirai-says-cloud-tv-w=
ont-compete-with-cable-4k-adoption

[q] Unlike Microsoft's push, Hirai focused on the installed user base of
the PS3, suggesting that when the service does come to customers it will be
modular and will allow TV viewing across several of the company's products.
"I know Intel was in this space as well, but from my perspective, when you
look at the installed base of the PS3 =E2=80=94 25 million in the US =E2=80=
=94 when we're
talking to a lot of the broadcasters, it's a compelling number." [/q]

the Sony Playstation (PS3/PS4) has its own gaming network and streaming
services, though i am not familiar with how these function- it would seem
that streaming video games as well as movie content is part of its
ecosystem approach, perhaps also external services in some way. though what
has intrigued me for years is that the device includes a Blu-Ray disk
player as part of its videogame console, and can be used as a dvd player to
watch HD movies, which the Blu-Ray disk format exists for- to match higher
screen resolution of HDTVs, while earlier DVDs are more the
cathode-ray-tube resolutions and screen ratios (4:3 versus 16:9). so there
is an interesting overlap or crossover in content and media delivery,
interface, interaction with the videogame consoles (presumably Microsoft
X-Box One likewise), in that they not only can play videogames with an HDTV
device, though can also play movies on disk, matched to that high
definition resolution, and also access streaming content from the internet
within some framework or given parameters.

the potential then, in this particular videogame console as media access
platform, is that it could open a portal to the 'public commons' of another
world of content, say media archives of hundreds of thousands of films,
lectures, videos of events, educational resources, and that if it were
coherently organized and presented as public service, could likely be
integrated into such a content delivery infrastructure - though connected
with a different system of values than those that otherwise dominate what
is on offer, as an 'online commons' or 'public space' beyond a realm of
juvenilia or existing commercialism that is so highly saturated in the
given model that it is like toxic content, as if ideological residue
imparts itself from mere proximity to the detritus of the mainstream in its
devolved, ungrounded warped worldview

so what if the question of television extended into its infrastructure -
what services are on offer, in the private model, and what content exists
that could potentially be accessed, if it were coherently and effectively
organized and accessed via these same tools and devices
what if the problem involves information, modeling of a view that is not
trapped within a too small consideration of what this involves, and
requires a librarian-like cataloging of resources and an information
architecture that unifies and scales distributed resources into a common
model and intelligible framework, while not existing in the 'same place' or
location, or within a central repository except insofar as it can be
interfaced and accurately account for content

perhaps issues of streaming are too involved and that a large effort and
resources would be required to gain access to high definition content or
quality media resources, yet the content itself already exists in archives
around the world and locally, and would provide an immense value to those
newly able to connect with what is otherwise absent and out of bounds
within media and culture, if as memory, knowledge, communication, relation,
awareness, value

what if ideas were debated on the internet, like they were in past eras as
part of the process of reasoning, and really got into the issues of
information and intelligence in a shared model and multiple views. the
incapacitation by one-way media prevents this, and a lack of quality in
existing online resources, else media archives that remain unshared or
still undeveloped, such as video of a dance performance or one act play,
bound or limit what is possible now and also what could potentially occur,
by neutralizing the possibility by going along with the standard model and
approach that does not question or function outside its own parameters in
terms of content development in profit-based scenarios

what if knowledge was of value. shared awareness. education. insight. clear
communication of ideas. debates that shape improved understanding and
promotes civic involvement and engagement with the present day and its
issues and situations. beyond the one-way panel and the presentations, and
into other forms and dynamics of relation, sharing of ideas. this too could
populate the content offerings within media devices. it would be
interesting to know what the difficulties are, what attempts have been
made, by those most engaged in these dynamics and dimensions- and what
actually may be possible as human content within networked media devices
beyond the WWW model for websites and apps, and TV channels. in this way,
what about the media archive and networked library, access to the cultural
assemblage of resources, stratigraphic layering, interconnections across
frameworks

--note also, this summarizing quote from the essay...

[q] In light of the extraordinary influence of Augustine=E2=80=99s idea, we=
 might
think about the problem this way: Even if the ultimate foundations of
reality remain hidden from us, we nonetheless possess a creative faculty
that gives us insight into the infinite. We employ the same faculty at play
in music as we do in probing reality through mathematics. And this faculty
whose workings we observe in the laboratory of music offers an intimation
of our role as junior partners in creation.[/q]

(i think this is dead wrong. there is infinitesimal truth, not maximal
in music today, 'junior partners' only if neuro/audio/signal engineering
programming audiences via entrainment,hypnosis, brain-wave mods;
otherwise this kind of connection is an illusion and a cultural conceit)

<br>comments: i think the viewpoint in the above article demonstrates a cer=
tain narrowed conceptualization or myopia even, of technological systems as=
 being more than the end-use tools that are interfaced with, say on the scr=
een of a &#39;smart tv&#39; or its hardware configurations and options. the=
se are indicators of functionality, though they map into larger, extended s=
ystems - infrastructures, and various industries and buildings that have be=
en effectively rationalized under an earlier broadcast, then cable model, n=
ow importing &#39;internet&#39; content such as youtube videos and streamin=
g movies (redbox, amazon video, etc) as additional layers or services. [not=
e- still at CRT here, not sure how it functions exactly in these terms.]<br=
>


<br>what is happening is one way to analyze the situation. what could be ha=
ppening- the *potential* for network-based television, is a larger question=
 and consideration. such a large enigma that Steve Jobs of Apple, Inc. clai=
med to have cracked the idea of television open, and realized or discovered=
 resolution for a future model of television, likely involving the issue of=
 its content ecosystem in addition to interface.<br>


<br>a missing parameter in referencing [tv] without distinguishing past and=
 future conceptual differences is that the cathode-ray-tubes of the past an=
d liquid crystal displays (LCD) of the present HDTVs are of different=C2=A0=
 parameters of functionality. it is not about connecting a CRT display to t=
he global network as if &#39;Internet TV&#39;, another channel to tune into=
 via airwaves. instead it is a television display (LCD) screen that has bec=
ome a computer, and thus is more like having a personal computer becoming a=
 television, though it can also tune into airwaves and network protocols as=
 its channel spectrum.<br>


<br>so while it is true perhaps that there is a limit to innovation in the =
hardware interfaces due to a limit reached in the given model, within certa=
in constraints -- including content ownership via media conglomerates based=
 on DRM and copyright restrictions, redistribution rights, and royalties --=
 which is basically the entire media industry, from radio to television to =
movies to music (and publishing even), this viewpoint is based on the idea =
that this situation is fixed in its given functioning and cannot be surpass=
ed or radically changed, within those parameters.<br>


<br>so part of the larger consideration would be to consider HDTV beyond th=
e local tool or artifact - the television set - and consider the ecosystem =
it functions within and potentially could function within, interface with.=
=C2=A0 first off: the TV set is recontextualized in the realm of the global=
 computer network, and thus it is at least in part an issue of an &#39;inte=
rnet television&#39; set as HDTV device, interface, functionality, hardware=
, software, programming, content, display.<br>


<br>likely curved screens, touch interfaces, wireless, menus/UI, refresh sp=
eed, resolution, these kinds of parameters have tangible effects on functio=
nality, ease of use, enjoyment, if the design is effective. though -what- i=
s accessible is a fundamental issue; and for many, this likely involves a c=
ultural wasteland of commercial content chock full of advertisements , wher=
e the experience of seamless channel surfing has become bureaucratized, as =
IP and broadcast frequencies are different systems, and content exists in m=
ultiple formats in several locations (say media server, internet services, =
movie streaming, over-the-air) and thus begins to be unmanageable at the le=
vel of interface, requiring much effort to access and view content that is =
not preprogrammed and formatted (a guess, reading feedback of others)<br>


<br>in that there are multiple systems, formats, menus, issues of having to=
 type or input data, difficulty in doing so, etc. time, energy, frustration=
, when pre-computer TV was simple. basic. and always worked except for tran=
smission glitches or interruptions. prior to being made obsolete by a new &=
#39;digital standard&#39;, making old sets no longer functional in the &#39=
;new system&#39; which turns out to be CHAOS, a difficult to mediate or res=
olve cultural question, unless it is not in question- which then only invol=
ves extending the existing model, parameters further. and then it is only a=
bout dollars, selling units of HDTV, per capita consumption of mass media d=
ressed-up as internet content, via extension of the same systems, one-way m=
edia delivery. except- youtube, memes, perhaps TED Conferences, etc. then a=
lso, videoteleconferencing.<br>


<br>the larger question of infrastructure involves parallel video content t=
hat could be made accessible or available to these networked HDTVs. imagine=
 community television, anywhere in the world. or special access to a school=
 video archive of a children&#39;s play, requiring private login to view ye=
ars later. though also, ideas and debates recorded on video, theater and pl=
ays as performance videos, music concerts and recitals, educational program=
ming, lectures, etc. this was the earlier model or potential that was passe=
d over, never allowed to develop by the existing rationalization, within it=
s controlling interest and technical parameters. instead such &#39;civic co=
ntent&#39; is locked out, or made into a proprietary channel or service, of=
tentimes content requiring additional payment for access, instead of offeri=
ng it as a public service, say for sustaining and improving cultural awaren=
ess, cultural literacy. instead, the bane of pledge drives for &#39;public =
TV&#39; interrupts such content with commercials, advertisements that deman=
d tithing in order to keep the awful content-system moving in the same back=
wards direction, a charade of educational programming, a heist of &#39;publ=
ic airwaves&#39; and spectrum, for what thus amounts to a private ideologic=
al approach to mass media, everywhere colonized the same.<br>


<br>just consider - and certainly fortunate you are if not familiar with th=
is television content - how destructive a show like &quot;Friends&quot; is =
to programming behavior of populations who then mimic and extend adult adol=
escence as &#39;shared consciousness&#39; via brainwashed young people who =
congregate and behave similarly, as if adulthood involves preschool for sha=
red groups. as if this dumbing-down is an education in ignorance, condoning=
 and developing it (said show is show cynical perhaps it is covert-based mi=
litary propaganda even, to promote such decline)<br>


<br>so instead of communicating about meaningful ideas via television or vi=
deo, having debates about ideas, the content is trivial and stupid. demeani=
ng, debasing, idiotic, and formulaic for the very antihuman principles ruli=
ng over and oppressing populations in daily environments. what kind of rela=
tion does Hollywood have with human citizens exactly? why is mass media pro=
gramming hostile to ideas of freedom, intelligence, beyond their narrow sel=
f-interest? what kind of public trust is that which seeks to eliminate othe=
r perspectives, public goals, ideals, principles, and instead actively dism=
antles, destroys, prevents, censors such views? and everyone who *purchases=
* their television content, pays or buys into this services. VOTES for it v=
ia participating in the onesided delivery model of ungrounded perspective, =
warped beliefs, antihuman agendas, normalized and standardized as if &#39;s=
hared culture&#39; and not unshared cult exploiting humans via oneway, entr=
opic expropriation of human power, decision-making, relations, intelligence=
, via- most likely- endless signed ~legal documents<br>


<br>now that is dark humor. so dark that the laugh track=C2=A0 and non-funn=
y comediennes provide a diorama-like span of artifice in which to place the=
 malaise of being lost in such false POVs.<br><br>this one-way formatting o=
f culture in hostile terms and dynamics... then leading to adult preschoole=
rs as the constituency, filling up the void in mass media as its representa=
tives and participants. the state as mass media production, then waging war=
 against terrorists, turning against its own citizenry and constitution. th=
e script turned into a government prescription that then formats and &#39;o=
wns&#39; the development (and decline) of culture via its representation. p=
olitical engineering, social engineering, behavioral engineering - marcom &=
amp; advertising.<br>


<br>public issues and interests then are a pay-per-access approach. paralle=
l to this, timepiece, the SPOT watch by Microsoft, which could have indicat=
ed an innovative approach to content, except for a monthly or yearly fee to=
 access radio-broadcast content for the &#39;smart watch&#39;, such that to=
 get the weather report required tithing. any blip of news, more dimes and =
quarters. and thus content-limited, dies out. maximal payment via cellular =
data services-- requiring payment of full cellphone plan prior to access da=
ta or services are extra fees, such that actual *information* and data is r=
are, unless people live to SMS and that is their lifework<br>


<br>the model of content distribution, ownership, approaches to &#39;profit=
&#39;- removed of a vital and fundamental civic dimension and component tha=
t is absent from these devices and tools. essentially boxed-in by a limited=
 privatized approach that relies on _censoring outside views and content fr=
om a given platform or industry or media, because that constraint becomes t=
he basis for moneymaking instead of- i don&#39;t know- doing something wort=
hwhile for humanity, in an innovative and ingenious way that still makes mo=
ney, and does not falsely constrain or limit or confine the device or its f=
uture media development out of selfish private interest at the expense of l=
arger human goals and needs. again- i don&#39;t know... like knowing when t=
he bus is going to arrive at a bus stop via a watch or PDA or phone- as a p=
ublic service. and having such data available and accessible for population=
s - and then developing more based on such public services and infrastructu=
res, including media libraries accessible via HDTVs, schools or university =
resources and classes as part of public outreach, etc. in a coherent approa=
ch and model based on shared goals, principles, incentives, reflecting a va=
lue in truth and honoring content as more than private moneymaking ventures=
 that turn culture into a fool&#39;s paradise<br>


the civic versus commercial footprint, not just for profit or even non-prof=
it, also no-profit, a model of the commons and public human sphere that cou=
ld be developed outside the given approaches, in parallel to it, and then m=
ade accessible via these tools, as another channel or interface, though lik=
ely a million times larger and full of all the best resources of culture. a=
nd being a citizen provides access, instead of having to pay for it through=
 a third-party always<br>


<br>so the issue of this existing development of idiocy as the basis for so=
cial relations (antisocial) if not promoting xenophobia via such group dyna=
mics that become standard, &#39;the measure&#39; by which others are judged=
, in these devolved terms and conditions. including in thinking, such that =
the ignorant become the masses who then single out unique individuals are t=
he problem, the very opposite of democratic potentials, that ideas matter, =
not just shared views and beliefs in a larger louder physically more strong=
 group who are superficial, shallow, and by most indications, incredibly st=
upid and extremely proud of it- because this ignorance is the very basis fo=
r social power, engineering consensus and compliance with such lowered view=
points as if ideal, enlightened by conformity, by fitting in, submission, c=
ultic bliss.<br>


<br>it is difficult to write beyond this condition because it is the cultur=
e, it is the televised content, it has taken over &#39;online programming&#=
39; and forms the basis for substitute discourse via idiotic memes and &#39=
;dialogue&#39; about meaningless events as structure for shared relations a=
nd reality, making trivial the everyday, into issues of consumption, co-med=
ia/commodities that participation then validates as a process, sustaining a=
nd building false perspectives, structures, frameworks that can further be =
exploited, oppress, via these same means/memes<br>


<br>high-brow, high art, intellectualism and theory-speak and social affair=
s to low brow to the realm of the debased and disgusting, all on the same c=
ultural level, ungrounded, headed in an antihuman direction with an activel=
y hostile agenda, and yet nonsensical or immune from &#39;reason&#39; beyon=
d opinion, due to loss of logic beyond binary ideology &amp; its quick judg=
ements. in this way mass media - networked or not - becoming channel surfin=
g, there is always yet another choice to tune into, ignore the others, even=
 while it persists, keeps on developing, though these &#39;other choices&#3=
9; are still the same thing, annihilating all hope of any change in princip=
les and goals and ideals- because they are against human culture, implicitl=
y, by design<br>


<br>a question of platforms and tools and devices to access a parallel cont=
ent system would need to investigate how to establish a framework for what =
exists as a latent yet unused resource, of video or recordings, and then mo=
del a way to integrate this public content into a common model that could s=
cale from local to state to global interconnectivity, then to standardize t=
his and establish a common interface that is of highest use and function an=
d usability versus the oft encountered lowest functionality for such resour=
ces, set at odds with basic searches or categorization, for lack of coheren=
t modeling of concepts and ideas, beyond unique strings<br>


<br>reading about CES recently, the recent yearly Consumer Electronics Show=
, a quote from the Sony CEO reminded me of some of the unique potentials bu=
ilt into existing tools for access that could co-exist in traditional model=
s and offer potentially an interface into this world beyond the private-onl=
y model, where cultural media resources could someday be accessed.<br>


<br>reference: Sony CEO says cloud TV won&#39;t compete with cable<br><a hr=
ef=3D"http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285310/sony-ceo-kaz-hirai-says-clou=

h-cable-4k-adoption</a><br>


<br>[q] Unlike Microsoft&#39;s push, Hirai focused on the installed user ba=
se of the PS3, suggesting that when the service does come to customers it w=
ill be modular and will allow TV viewing across several of the company&#39;=
s products. &quot;I know Intel was in this space as well, but from my persp=
ective, when you look at the installed base of the PS3 =E2=80=94 25 million=
 in the US =E2=80=94 when we&#39;re talking to a lot of the broadcasters, i=
t&#39;s a compelling number.&quot; [/q]<br>


<br>the Sony Playstation (PS3/PS4) has its own gaming network and streaming=
 services, though i am not familiar with how these function- it would seem =
that streaming video games as well as movie content is part of its ecosyste=
m approach, perhaps also external services in some way. though what has int=
rigued me for years is that the device includes a Blu-Ray disk player as pa=
rt of its videogame console, and can be used as a dvd player to watch HD mo=
vies, which the Blu-Ray disk format exists for- to match higher screen reso=
lution of HDTVs, while earlier DVDs are more the cathode-ray-tube resolutio=
ns and screen ratios (4:3 versus 16:9). so there is an interesting overlap =
or crossover in content and media delivery, interface, interaction with the=
 videogame consoles (presumably Microsoft X-Box One likewise), in that they=
 not only can play videogames with an HDTV device, though can also play mov=
ies on disk, matched to that high definition resolution, and also access st=
reaming content from the internet within some framework or given parameters=
.<br>


<br>the potential then, in this particular videogame console as media acces=
s platform, is that it could open a portal to the &#39;public commons&#39; =
of another world of content, say media archives of hundreds of thousands of=
 films, lectures, videos of events, educational resources, and that if it w=
ere coherently organized and presented as public service, could likely be i=
ntegrated into such a content delivery infrastructure - though connected wi=
th a different system of values than those that otherwise dominate what is =
on offer, as an &#39;online commons&#39; or &#39;public space&#39; beyond a=
 realm of juvenilia or existing commercialism that is so highly saturated i=
n the given model that it is like toxic content, as if ideological residue =
imparts itself from mere proximity to the detritus of the mainstream in its=
 devolved, ungrounded warped worldview<br>


<br>so what if the question of television extended into its infrastructure =
- what services are on offer, in the private model, and what content exists=
 that could potentially be accessed, if it were coherently and effectively =
organized and accessed via these same tools and devices<br>


what if the problem involves information, modeling of a view that is not tr=
apped within a too small consideration of what this involves, and requires =
a librarian-like cataloging of resources and an information architecture th=
at unifies and scales distributed resources into a common model and intelli=
gible framework, while not existing in the &#39;same place&#39; or location=
, or within a central repository except insofar as it can be interfaced and=
 accurately account for content<br>


<br>perhaps issues of streaming are too involved and that a large effort an=
d resources would be required to gain access to high definition content or =
quality media resources, yet the content itself already exists in archives =
around the world and locally, and would provide an immense value to those n=
ewly able to connect with what is otherwise absent and out of bounds within=
 media and culture, if as memory, knowledge, communication, relation, aware=
ness, value<br>


<br>what if ideas were debated on the internet, like they were in past eras=
 as part of the process of reasoning, and really got into the issues of inf=
ormation and intelligence in a shared model and multiple views. the incapac=
itation by one-way media prevents this, and a lack of quality in existing o=
nline resources, else media archives that remain unshared or still undevelo=
ped, such as video of a dance performance or one act play, bound or limit w=
hat is possible now and also what could potentially occur, by neutralizing =

 other forms and dynamics of relation, sharing of ideas. this too could pop=
