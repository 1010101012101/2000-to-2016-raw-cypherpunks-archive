Medical insurance, car insurance, life insurance, home insurance, boat 
insurance, etc., are all just variations on a theme.

When AAA Insurance meets with Joe Sixpack to discuss his health or life 
or earthquake insurance, they seek to collect enough information to 
have a reasonable chance of turning a profit on the deal. Else why 
would they exist as a business?

They likely never have complete information, about fault lines, or fire 
hazards, or unhealthy behavior, but they can manage their risks 
reasonably well by standard statistical sampling and actuarial data 
methods.

I won't waste my time further arguing your "medial insurance is 
different" point until you show you have some basic grounding in how 
the real economy works and can explain why you think medical insurance 
is somehow exempt from the normal profit/loss considerations.

Saying that health care is important is not enough. It's just another 
purchased service, after all.

First, I pay for my own such needs out of my own pocket. Many firms and 
well-off individuals are "self-insured." Insurance is not something 
magical, it's just a set of tradeoffs of risk and ability to pay. For 
those who cannot possibly raise the $100K for a seldom-needed 
operation, paying $5000 a year in premiums _may_ make sense. Because 
they perceive the consequences of not having the money to buy the 
operation, despite its unlikelihood, to be worth the payment each year. 
And so on, for a range of scenarios.

Second, if I wished to have insurance I would buy it.

That's how I would get x-rays or chemotherapy.

Saying that because I do not share your views about socialized 
insurance I must plan on making my own x-ray machine or brewing my own 
cancer chemicals is not only silly, it is disingenuous.

You're further gone than I thought.
