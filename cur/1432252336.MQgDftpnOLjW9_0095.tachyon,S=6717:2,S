Following are responses to an FCW.com poll question that asked, "Given an 
opportunity, would you work for the Homeland Security Department?"
I think Homeland Security is overdue. I would be willing to work there, but 
the location would be paramount in my decision. In my opinion, the one 
place it doesn't need to be is Washington, D.C.
C. L. Jennings

***
I would consider working for Homeland Security for two reasons. One, I 
believe it is an important and necessary effort. Two, as an insider, I 
would be able to know just exactly how much information will be collected 
on citizens, and to what use it would be put.
