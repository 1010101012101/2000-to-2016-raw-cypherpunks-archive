Interesting. BTW the state appears to be claiming that they took care of 
the _McIntyre_ problems by rewriting the statute post-decision to only 
apply to pseudonymous/anonymous messages written by someone affiliated with 
a campaign.

So in other words, you could write stuff under a nym, but someone on the 
campaign staff could not.

(Note I'm not saying this makes the statute constitutional, but that it's 
not as broad as it could be.)
