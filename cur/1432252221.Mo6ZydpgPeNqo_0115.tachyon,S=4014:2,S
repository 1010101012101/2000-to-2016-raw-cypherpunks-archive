Because when you send to the node I subscribe to and another node, I
receive two copies of what you write.  One from the node I subscribe
to, another as that same piece of your spew makes the X-loop rounds.

 >Fuck off Reese.

Certainly, after you justify your idiotic redundancy.  Or is some valid
need satisfied by sending to two different lists?  What is it?  Or should
I simply filter your redundancy in the manner it deserves?
