Currently the amount of my mail protected by traditional means is essentially
nonexistant.  I get one piece of PGP-encrypted mail every month or two (and I
was one of the peope who helped write the thing!) and I don't recall ever
having received or sent any S/MIME-encrypted mail.  OTOH something like 10-15%
of all my mail is protected by STARTTLS, and the figure is rising continuously
and will continue to do so (particularly if MS make some minor changes in
Exchange which I've asked some people there about).

It doesn't matter how many types of mail encryption software I have sitting
unused on my hard drive, 10% (and growing) coverage with reasonable protection
is better than 0% coverage with good protection.

Peter.
