Well that's a new one.  First, I think referring to the "science" of
marketing is a bit of an overstatement.  Sort of what marketeers might like
you to think they do.  (Hmm, maybe it's working.)

Second, this soi-disant "science" doesn't seem to work of me or thee.  Of
course you could take the elitist position, that we are better than the
"average"...

Third, it doesn't explain why so many businesses fail (1 in 12 in the US).
If they are so good at selling us crap we don't need, why can't they stay in
business?

Because their kid wants it?

To some people.  That's why there are horse races, differences of opinion.

So are porterhouse steaks and orgasms.  I still like them both.

Then I guess we shouldn't let them have ANY toys?

See "horse race" comment above.

So why don't you have a furby?  I guess it didn't work, huh?  Assuming,
arguendo, that this pressure is all that great, think of it as evolution in
action.  We are breeding a more advertising-resistant human.  Or as you put
it:

Are you sure you aren't just projecting?  ;-D
