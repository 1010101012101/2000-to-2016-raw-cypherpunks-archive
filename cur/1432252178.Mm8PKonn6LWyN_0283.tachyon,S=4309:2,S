I support this recommendation. A readable book for the layman (most 
of us), on a par with past classics like "Lying with Statistics" and 
"Lady Luck." Available in a trade paperback for about $15 or so.

The book I recommended a week or two ago, Judea Pearl's "Causality," 
is much more advanced in its mathematics. (But the math is important 
if one is actually trying to construct the causality diagrams Pearl 
is talking about.)
