You cite Chomsky as evidence for the truthfullness of 
Chomsky.

Now if you yourself had looked up some of his citations, and 
cited them as evidence for the truthfullness of Chomsky, then 
that would be an argument.

> No anarchist supports a powerful,or indeed,any state

Yet you cite (as evidence that I am a liar) Ian McKay's 
article on the Catalonian anarchists, in which he concedes 
that the anarchists wound up creating what most people would 
call a state, indeed a terrorist dictatorship, but argues 
that I am lying in that such a state was a good thing, and 
run by nice people, deeply concerned for the welfare of the 
masses

>.Jim Bell seems to be the closest thing to a trad anarchist
> I've seen on this site

What you are calling traditional anarchists were not 
"traditional" until 1938.  When anarcho socialists found 
themselves implementing socialism in only possible form, in 
the form of a terrorist state, some recoiled, and some 
redefined anarchy to mean rule by a terror state, rule 
unrestricted by law and based on force, reinterpreting their 
pre 1936 positions in the light of the new post 1938 
position.

Ted Turner calls himself socialist.  His network used to emit
commie propaganda with great regularity, though since Fox
news started in competition, they have laid off the commie 
propaganda.
