Leonard peltier,just down the hall from chris boyce,would tell you an

Getting back to jim.WTF is the reward money doing unencrypted? I know 
THEY[tm] worry over their own scurvy hides
but this is an emergency.(reward for usama BL reputed to be aprox 60 
mill.)AP is required NOW,where are the
dashing cypherpunks of yore?usama bin laden? Id buy that for a dollar!
