Yes, I recognise that you were naming only the giants in a particular, though higly importnat field, who also had interest in "policy".  My point was simply that certain ideas are so pwerful that their authors have influence on events whether or not they seek it.  And that Washington policy makers must come to terms with those idea, whether or not they like.
