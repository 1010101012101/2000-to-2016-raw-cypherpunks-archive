Sometimes you're in school. 

I am currently in Massachusetts, but I'm registered in Nevada. My absentee
ballot contains numerous NV state questions which I'd like to vote on; a
registration here in MA would not be the same. In my case, I'm a
transplant to Nevada - I don't actually have strong opinions on most of
the state questions (with some specific exceptions). For someone who lived
in one state for most of his or her life, then left for school in another,
however, absentee balloting seems to have a stronger case.
