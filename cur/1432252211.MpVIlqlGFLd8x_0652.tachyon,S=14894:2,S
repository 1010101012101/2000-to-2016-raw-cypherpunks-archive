  Code for 'Unbreakable' Quantum Encryption Generated at Record Speed over
Fiber

  Raw code for "unbreakable" encryption, based on the principles of quantum
  physics, has been generated at record speed over optical fiber at the
  Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology. The
  work, reported today at the SPIE Defense & Security Symposium in Orlando,
  Fla.,* is a step toward using conventional high-speed networks such as
  broadband Internet and local-area networks to transmit ultra-secure video
  for applications such as surveillance.

  The NIST quantum key distribution (QKD) system uses single photons, the
  smallest particles of light, in different orientations to produce a
  continuous binary code, or "key," for encrypting information. The rules of
  quantum mechanics ensure that anyone intercepting the key is detected, thus
  providing highly secure key exchange. The laboratory system produced this
  "raw" key at a rate of more than 4 million bits per second (4 million bps)
  over 1 kilometer (km) of optical fiber, twice the speed of NIST's previous
  record, reported just last month.** The system also worked successfully,
  although more slowly, over 4 km of fiber.

  The record speed was achieved with an error rate of only 3.6 percent,
  considered very low. The next step will be to process the raw key, using
  NIST-developed methods for correcting errors and increasing privacy, to
  generate "secret" key at about half the original speed, or about 2 million
  bps.


  NIST has previously encrypted, transmitted and decrypted Web quality
  streaming video using secret keys generated at 1 million bps in a 1-km
  fiber QKD system using a slightly different quantum encoding method.***
  Using the same methods for correcting errors and improving privacy with the
  key generated twice as fast or faster should allow real-time encryption and
  decryption of video signals at a resolution higher than Web quality,
  according to NIST physicist Xiao Tang, lead author of the paper.

  "This is all part of our effort to build a prototype high-speed quantum
  network in our lab," says Tang. "When it is completed, we will be able to
  view QKD-secured video signals sent by two cameras at different locations.
  Such a system becomes a QKD-secured surveillance network."

  Applications for high-speed QKD might include distribution of sensitive
  remote video, such as satellite imagery, or commercially valuable material
  such as intellectual property, or confidential healthcare and financial
  data. In addition, high-volume secure communications are needed for
  military operations to service large numbers of users simultaneously and
  provide multimedia capabilities as well as database access.

  NIST is among a number of laboratories and companies around the world
  developing QKD systems, which are expected to provide the next generation
  of data security. Conventional encryption is typically based on
  mathematical complexity and may be broken given sufficiently powerful
  computers and enough time. In contrast, QKD produces encryption codes based
  on the quantum states of individual photons and is considered "verifiably
  secure." Under the principles of quantum physics, measuring a photon's
  quantum state destroys that state. QKD systems are specifically designed so
  that eavesdropping causes detectable changes in the system.

  NIST systems are much faster, although operating over shorter distances,
  than previously reported QKD systems developed by other organizations.
  High-speed transmission is necessary for widespread practical use of
  quantum encryption over broadband networks. The NIST fiber QKD system was
  designed by physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians and is part
  of a testbed for demonstrating and measuring the performance of quantum
  communication technologies. NIST has used the testbed to demonstrate QKD in
  both a fiber-based system and an optical wireless system operating between
  two NIST buildings.

  The NIST fiber QKD system has two channels operating over optical fibers
  that are wrapped around a spool between two personal computers in a
  laboratory. The photons are sent in different quantum states, or
  orientations of their electric field, representing 0 and 1. The system
  compensates for temperature changes and vibration, which could affect
  performance, with a NIST-designed module that automatically adjusts photon
  orientation on a time schedule. More extreme environmental changes are
  likely to occur in fibers buried or suspended outdoors as in telephone
  networks; the researchers plan to test a fiber QKD system in the field in
  the future.

  After raw key is generated and processed, the secret key is used to encrypt
  and decrypt video signals transmitted over the Internet between two
  computers in the same laboratory. The high speed of the system enables use
  of the most secure cipher known for ensuring the privacy of a
  communications channel, in which one secret key bit, known only to the
  communicating parties, is used only once to encrypt one video bit (or
  pixel). Compressed video has been encrypted, transmitted and decrypted at a
  rate of 30 frames per second, sufficient for smooth streaming images, in
  Web-quality resolution, 320 by 240 pixels per frame.

  The work is supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.

  As a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Technology
  Administration, NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial
  competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology
  in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

  Background: How the Fiber QKD Works

  In the NIST fiber QKD system, a one-way quantum channel uses lasers to
  generate a stream of single photons, which are transmitted through an
  optical fiber. These photons are the carriers of the raw material for the
  quantum key. A two-way conventional fiber channel is used for data
  processing to improve the key's reliability and security. The data are
  processed in real time by circuit boards designed at NIST.

  In the 4 million bps demonstration, the NIST system sends and receives
  photons in four different orientations. Each photon is sent in one of two
  modes, either vertical/horizontal, or plus 45 degrees/minus 45 degrees.
  Within each mode, one orientation represents the bit value 0, and the other
  represents bit value 1.

  To visualize how this works, imagine that each photon is an envelope moving
  perpendicular to the ground (vertical=1), parallel to the ground
  (horizontal=0), tilted at 45 degrees to the right (plus 45 degrees =1) or
  tilted 45 degrees to the left (minus 45 degrees=0). Each photon fits best
  through one of two types of detectors, or "mailboxes."

  The sender, generally called Alice, randomly chooses both a mode and an
  orientation for each photon. The receiver, generally called Bob, randomly
  chooses between the two modes when he tries to detect a photon. This can be
  visualized as choosing a mailbox slot that accepts only envelopes flying in
  certain orientations. If he chooses the same mode that Alice used for a
  particular photon, then Bob always measures the correct orientation and,
  hence, its bit value. But if he chooses a different mailbox, then he may
  get the wrong bit value for that photon.

  The use of optical fiber poses a special technical challenge, because
  Alice's photons lose their orientation as they pass through the curved
  fiber. NIST researchers developed an innovative recovery method, including
  automatic calibration of the mailboxes, to restore the original quantum
  states before the photons reach Bob.

  To make a shared "key" from a stream of photons, Alice tells Bob which mode
  she used for each photon (without revealing its bit value). Bob tells Alice
  which photons he actually received and measured using the correct mailbox
  (but again, not sharing their values). Then they both discard the other
  bits, the ones Bob measured with the wrong mailbox. The correct
  measurements constitute the initial "sifted" key (or raw key) that Alice
  and Bob now share. (See table below.)

  If someone, generally referred to as Eve, tries to tap into the fiber and
  eavesdrop on the transmission, she will not be able to "read" it without
  leaving clues to her presence. Because of the rules of quantum physics, she
  cannot make perfect copies of the photons, and she would change their
  orientation if she tried. If she measures a photon, with the idea of
  sending a replacement as a cover, she may use the wrong mailbox and
  sometimes get the wrong bit value. She can, therefore, introduce errors in
  the key constructed by Alice and Bob. When Alice and Bob detect an unusual
  number of errors they will be alerted to Eve's presence.

  Before the sifted key is actually used, it needs to be processed further,
  because Alice and Bob need identical keys for reliable encryption and
  decryption. In a perfect world, there would be no errors or inconsistencies
  in their keys, unless an eavesdropper is present. But other errors, caused
  by environmental effects, for instance, do occur. QKD systems need to
  correct virtually all errors while disclosing as little information about
  the key as possible, because it is always assumed that Eve is listening.
  Conventional error-correction processes require extensive communications
  between Alice and Bob and are very slow. The NIST-developed method requires
  less interaction and is much faster.

  In the NIST method, the sender and receiver's keys are divided into
  segments and compared to determine whether they have even or odd numbers of
  1s. These results are used to estimate the error rates in large blocks of
  data in the keys. These blocks are segmented based on error rates.

  Then the system runs a "forward error correction" code, adapted from the
  telecommunication industry, on each segment with an odd number of errors.
  This process corrects single bit errors based on the positions of the 1s in
  the data. All the key bits are then shuffled, blocks are re-segmented based
  on the new error rates, and the correction process is repeated. This goes
  on until the error rate is reduced to about 1 bit per billion.

  The error-corrected key is then "hashed," or mixed up and condensed in a
  particular way, in the privacy amplification process. This produces a much
  shorter key about which Eve, statistically speaking, can know only a very
  small fraction. This is the secret key shared by Alice and Bob that is used
  for encryption and decryption.
