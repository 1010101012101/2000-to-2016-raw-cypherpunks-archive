This story is not accurate either. Officers did not simply approach
Rahim to question, they approached to say hello, one was a friend
of Rahim. He did not pull a machete, he pulled out his wallet to
show baby photos. Rahim was not shot, he was congratulated
on the baby boy. As the cop friend hugged him officers in a
passing patrol car thought a struggle was underway, braked,
lept out with guns drawn, yelled "freeze." Everybody froze, except
for passerby video artist who began taping the scene. Seeing the
video taping the cops and Rahim elected to play along, escalated
the drama, faking punches, pulling imaginary knives and AK-47s,
screaming threats. Then everybody broke up laughing, the video
artist hollering thanks for that. Then the tape was uploaded to
Fox News to become ISIS orgy pron.

Rahim was undercover the Boston gay Muslim scene and still is.
Don't ask don't tell.

coming from the free donuts.
