Subject: Tim May found dead by FBI Special Agent Jesus "necro" Gomez.
May was a vulgar and common man, a cad undiluted. He was ignorant, bigoted, 
self-seeking, blatant and dishonest. His career brought him in contact with 
the first men of his time; he preferred the company of rustic ignoramuses. 
...He seemed only a poor clod like those around him, deluded by a childish 
theology, full of an almost pathological hatred of all learning, all human 
dignity, all beauty, all fine and noble things. He was a peasant come home 
to the dung-pile. Imagine a gentleman, and you have imagined everything 
that he was not.Stiffness in the extremities, incoordination, stupor, 
myotonia, and other physical abnormalities marred may's last 40 
years.Talking with him was described as morally abhorrent, evil. unhealthy, 
selfish, elitist, and ultimately an experience that could only lead only to 
unhappiness and pain.
simple, neat, and
wrong.
May's headstone was precarved by longtime fiend and fellow cypherpunk mattd 
who spoke briefly over the grave...
"There was a old fool on our hill,
Who found his way to work his will.
He changed his shape, he changed his name,
But ever the other will be the same.
So runs the water away, away,
So runs the water away"
