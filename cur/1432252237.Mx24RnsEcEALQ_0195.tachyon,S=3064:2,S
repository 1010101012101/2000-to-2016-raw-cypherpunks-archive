There is in fact a _very_ important difference, one you should think 
carefully about: the issue of force.

In Germany, men with guns arrest those who sing songs which are not PC. 
I have no such power to use force to arrest those who use words I don't 
like.

This is the essence of liberty. It's all about the initiation of force, 
versus free choice.

In a free system, those who don't want to see swastikas or here 
"prejudiced" speech will take steps to avoid concerts where such 
symbols or words are used, will use the "OFF" switch on their radios 
and televisions when such symbols or speech appears, and will avoid 
visiting Web sites which offend them. Choice. And responsibility.

They may even hire others to act as watchdogs or censors to screen 
material which may offend them. This is what ratings systems are all 
about. And closed communities. And voluntary associations.

However, in a free society they may not use guns or force to stop what 
other people are reading or viewing or singing.

Think about it. Carefully. Read up on some of the basics.

You are on the wrong mailing list if you are as statist as you appear 
to be.
