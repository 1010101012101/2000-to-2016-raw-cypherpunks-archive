Here you go using a Good Name(tm) in vain...again.
 
| What is 'perfect competition'?

"Perfect Competition" is not an Austrian idea,
in fact, it is an idea that has been refuted by many Austrians in
the past as it is not characteristic of the real world.

"Complete Knowledge" is precisely what Hayek was refuting when he
proclaimed the idea of local knowledge, since no one can know at all
times what happens all around him, much less the next person.

| Chapter V
| The Meaning of 'Competition'

Did you actually read it? Or did you gather this information off of
an Amazon book review blurb?

| econoimics is just plain crap.

Tim's refusal to service whoever he wishes is directly related to
the free market. By the same token that Tim is free to not service
anyone he wishes, so too is anyone who opposes this attitude free to
not shop at Tim's shop.

| Hayek's views on fascism and socialism are well known, and not positive.
| What Tim proposes is nothing more than fascism at the individual level.

Where do you get this stuff? Do you make it up as you go along?

Churchill, Winston Leonard Spencer --On the eve of Britain's entry
into World War II:
	"If you will not fight for right when you can easily win 
without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be 
sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will 
have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious 
chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate. You may have 
to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to 
perish than to live as slaves.
