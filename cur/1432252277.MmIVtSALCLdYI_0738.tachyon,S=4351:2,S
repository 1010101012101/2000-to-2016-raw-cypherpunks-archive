Also, since when is crashing a proper response to *any* email message?
I don't think you have the PGP/MIME-using people to blame, nor should we
be expected to fix your lousy email program.  I can understand people's
desire to be able to read messages, but even if your MUA does not support
MIME, if you look at this message in plain text you can read it without
any sort of formatting problems.  Only mailers that have incorrect
MIME support will have problems with it, and that's simply not any of
our problem.

ASCII plain text *is* The Way.  But guess what, PGP/MIME *is* plain text.
You can even parse it with your eyeballs.
