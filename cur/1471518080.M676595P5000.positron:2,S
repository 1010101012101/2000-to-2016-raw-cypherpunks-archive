At work I've seen a Bitcoin miner trojan (it's a Windows nullsoft exe masked as a .scr file wrapped up in a file called info.zip) trying to propagate itself through the couple of ftp servers we have open to the world, one of which has a few places that the anonymous guest user can dump (but not list or download) files....

All the attacks have come within the past two weeks from IP addresses all over India....

I don't have the sha256 at hand to send the virustotal link but it's this fucker:

Luckily no users have been infected :). (AFAICT && I fucking hope & pray)
