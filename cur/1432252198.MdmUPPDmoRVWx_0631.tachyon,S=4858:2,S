Good! Perhaps you will have something to say about a matter I've been
turning over in my head lately!

I'm interested in Bitcoin. Why? Because I think there's a lot of
inefficiency and injustice in the way traditional financial systems
(banks, currencies, and markets) are built: they're heavily centralised
and monopolised and entangled with politics and other vested interests.

But I'm far from certain that Bitcoin will be a panacea here. Precisely
because it is decentralised and purely under the control of
dispassionate algorithms, it is open to different kinds of abuse. The
initial distribution is hardly "fair" (no matter how you define fair),
although I don't think a better distribution mechanism could have been
defined; but will it even out with time? Or will we find new
centralisation, in the form of important market functions (eg, the kinds
of roles that banks fill) being monopolised by the few who have the
capital to run them?

There's a centralisation risk in the mining power being monopolised;
somebody who controls more than half of the computational power in the
mining network, for instance, could just write their own rules (creating
bitcoins out of nothing or stealing bitcoins from other people, for a
start).

There's also a danger of governments stepping in and regulating Bitcoin
in ways that make it a slave to the incumbent financial system.

But there's also the chance for truly independent economic institutions
to form, fighting each other for trust and market share by actually
competing, with reputation being the most important capital, meaning
that anyone with a good idea can implement it and earn from it; and
reduced transaction fees and censorship making it easier to do business
from developing economies (look at how PayPal blacklists entire
countries); and stuff like that.

So what can nerds like me do to try and make sure the world gets the
benefits of a decentralised currency, and that good outweighing the
costs of it being used for tax evasion, trading in unethical things, or
ending up ensnared by central control in one way or another?
