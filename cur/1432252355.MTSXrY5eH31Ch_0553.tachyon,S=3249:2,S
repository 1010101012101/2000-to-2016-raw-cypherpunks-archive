                            Clinton OK after airport incident

                            (10/14/01) YONKERS - A bizarre accident at
                            Westchester County Airport involved Senator
Hillary
                            Clinton's entourage Sunday.

                            Sources tell News 12 Westchester that a
vehicle in
                            Senator Clinton's security team tried to
bypass a
                            mandatory check point at the airport, which
has been
                            under a heightened state of alert since the
terrorist
                            attacks. A county police officer attempting
to stop the
                            vehicle from getting through injured his
shoulder. That
                            officer was taken to Saint Agnes Hospital in
White
                            Plains, and his condition is not known.

                            Senator Clinton, who turned 54 Sunday, was
en route to
                            board a private jet to an unreleased
destination. The
                            former first lady could not be reached for
comment.
