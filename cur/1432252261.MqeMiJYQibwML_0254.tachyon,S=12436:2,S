ACC-Australian Crime Commission-new gestapo born in secret.
JOHN Howard has brokered a deal for a new national law enforcement body,=20
with two controversial Carr government advisers helping him clinch an=20
agreement with the states.

A secret meeting in the Prime Minister's Sydney office on Wednesday sealed=
=20
the fate of the troubled National Crime Authority, and in its place will=20
rise the Australian Crime Commission.
The NCA will cease to exist in December, when the ACC will take over its=20
coercive hearing and telephone interception powers. Since a falling-out=20
last year, Mr Howard has been keen to sideline the NCA.
The ACC will broadly take the form proposed unanimously by the states but=20
rejected two weeks ago by the federal Government, with a charter to fight=20
organised crime and the emerging threat of terrorism.
The deal was finalised yesterday, following Wednesday's meeting attended by=
=20
three Howard advisers and two proxies for NSW Police Minister Michael Costa=
=20
=96 academic Richard Basham and former detective Tim Priest.
Another Costa adviser, former NSW Police Internal Affairs commander Geoff=20
Schuberg, is expected to become the ACC's director of operations.
The ACC will be chaired by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick=20
Keelty. Its hearings will be conducted by an official chosen from the ranks=
=20
of senior criminal lawyers. Former Queensland crime commissioner Tim=20
Carmody is considered a front-runner for the job.
Crucial to this week's deal was the federal Government's concession that=20
the ACC will have its own in-house investigative capacity. It will not be=20
just an intelligence assessment agency as originally proposed.
In return, the states have agreed to fund the secondment of police from=20
their forces to the national body. For the past eight years, the=20
commonwealth has footed the NCA's bill.
The states will formally approve the new commission at a meeting of police=
=20
ministers in Sydney on Friday.
Neither federal Justice Minister Chris Ellison nor Mr Costa, who acted as=20
negotiator on behalf of the states, would comment yesterday. Spokespeople=20
for both ministers would only say discussions this week had been=
 "productive".
Both levels of government have agreed to include ASIO director-general=20

The commonwealth also has agreed to give up a board spot that was to be=20
taken by one of its agencies, meaning voting numbers are split evenly=20
between the states and Canberra.
Final details about the ACC's budget and personnel were being finalised=20
yesterday, but a plan suggested earlier this week to retain only half the=20
NCA's investigators has been dropped.
Mr Basham's and Mr Priest's involvement in the deal comes eight months=20
