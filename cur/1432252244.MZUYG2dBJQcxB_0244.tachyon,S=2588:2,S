But it is hardly a matter of "holding out".  So far the Pentagon has
shattered the enemy while suffering casualties of about a thousand,
which is roughly the same number of casualties as the British empire
suffered doing regime change on the Zulu empire - an empire of a
quarter of a million semi naked savages mostly armed with spears.

As quagmires go, this one has not yet got shoelaces muddy.  The
enemies are the one's that have heroic fantasies of holding out
against hopeless odds, as for example Fallujah.  The question is not
whether the terrorists keep Falljah, but merely whether Pentagon gets
a city or a pile of rubble.
