i do need to read it but at face value - or what u pulled out - consensus
is not a problem regarding time wasting - as the ideas of efficiency are
capitalistic and massively overblown + often what seems efficient is just
short term problem solving - leaving huge gaps for people to have to deal
with later - the big problem with consensus is mob rule - just like the
problem we have with supposed democracy in the representative manner
prolific now
