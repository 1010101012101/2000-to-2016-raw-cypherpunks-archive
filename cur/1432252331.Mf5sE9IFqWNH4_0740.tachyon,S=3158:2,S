When you talk about "collaborating" and ZKS selling beta software to the 
NSA, are you saying you've got information that ZKS gave the NSA access to 
more information than the general public got, and/or that the NSA got their 
access or information meaningfully earlier than the general public?

If that's the case, that's interesting, but that's too serious a claim to 
let pass by as an unstated implication.

If that's not the case - and they had the same access to the Freedom beta 
code that the rest of us outsiders/Cypherpunks/critics/commentators did - 
then I don't see an issue here.
