First, Bell's actions are not the actions of most members of this 
mailing list. Frankly, this is a logical error: referring to 
"Cypherpunks" as a collective entity and then imputing the views or 
actions of a few to be the views or actions of the collective entity. 
The government does this routinely.

Second, talk to Phil Z. and Kelly G. about their legal issues for 
several years, as the government sought to prosecute one or both of 
them for violations of the ITARs (and maybe more). True, neither was 
ultimately charged. Their legal bills were substantial, however, and 
they could have face prison time and massive fines.

Whatever people do in the way of writing code, doing it as near to 
untraceably as possible would seem to be the way to go.
