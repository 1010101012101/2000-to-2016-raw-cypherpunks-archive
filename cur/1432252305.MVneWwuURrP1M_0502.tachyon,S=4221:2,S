While I agree that spotting a low process gain, large, signal is 
straightforward with simple TSCM, locating a low power, high process gain 
signal (especially one which uses channel estimation techniques prior to 
transmission, for example "Low probability of intercept communication 
system," US Pat. No. 5,029,184) can thwart most TSCM tools.
