Let us not forget all of the methods of "deniable encryption" discussed a 
few years back. If the "wrong" key is entered, the returned "de-encrypted" 
file will look -kinda- bad but not actually be the original plaintext.

This seems all the easier with TOR-stored data.

Fortunately, it would appear that such a law should be bound to force 
development of deniable encryption tools.
