Well, in Google's case, the list is curated by those doing the linking, but
Google is trading richness of metadata for coverage.

No, but they cover far more of the Web than a manually curated index ever
could. They can answer questions like "what was that article I read last
week on this topic?" and "what other pictures exist of this person?"
Nobody's going to be writing written summaries of every single news article
and blog post.

I think this is a good idea. Spam can be handled by just signing all the
pages and having signed white and blacklists to create a web of
trust/distrust. Proof-of-work could be used when creating new signing
identities in order to make the blacklists useful.

I imagine something as simple as StumbleUpon, just "I like/dislike this",
perhaps with tags. One could add a signed inverted index as well to
facilitate searching by phrase.

Been thinking about it for a while ;-)
