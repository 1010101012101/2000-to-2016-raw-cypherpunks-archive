They forgot about "evil drug pushers" as well. British government
started to downgrade criminal punishments for hemp within days of this
business starting. They always wanted to (why waste all those police
wages  picking up kids smoking joints?)  but never dared to because they
think they will lose votes if they look "soft on crime". Every British
govt. since  at least 1950s has talked louder than it has walked, most
ludicrously Thatcher's Tories who introduced scads of laws against
everything from dangerous dogs to playing loud music at parties, most of
which were never enforced at all. Anything for a headline in the
"Something Must Be Done" tabloid press.

Now there is a war on, and they can look hard by bombing Afghanistan. So
no need to pretend about hemp any more. They are even suggesting being
slightly softer on asylum seekers & illegal immigrants, a very
unexpected result.  Weird.
