..so does this mean you're going to be the first to share with the 
readership exactly *which* state and federal laws you break on a regular 
basis? LOL ridiculous.

"all power flows from the barrel of a gun?" Maybe so. But most people who 
sign contracts are more motivated by the threat of lawsuits, jail and fines 
than the direct threat of violence.

Nothing I see there really points to personal disarmament being a wise 
course of action.

Absolutely, no doubt about it. So how does it follow that this somehow 
makes it okay to harm other people and destroy their property without being 
held accountable for it by the people themselves? Legitimate protest is one 
thing, but the problem is, people who are out to "fuck shit up" aren't too 
discriminate about their targets. If your business was in the middle of a 
riot zone, would you just choose the "roll over and die" option? Somehow I 
think not.


>>Their claim is it is being abused and destroyed. 

There are too many disparate groups under the umbrella of "anti-
globalization" to be able to sum it up into a single claim like that. 
Abused and destroyed? What, how, when, by whom? How can you hope to make 
policy around some vague generalization. More analysis, less rhetoric.

  
>>Where is
>>their spokesperson at the G8? Where is there forum?

That's what NGOs are for. There are some interesting books about their 
growing importance and the role of technology in making it happen that are 
really encouraging...have you seen a book by David Ronfeldt and John 
Arquilla called "The Zapatista Social Netwar in Mexico"? I don't know if 
you can get a online copy somewhere but it's worth a look.


> When I'm attacked, why shouldn't I fight back?
>>Hypocrite.
>>Freedom for me, not for thee...

Where did that come from, I believe 100% in the right to be left alone. 
Anyone on this earth can do whatever they want, but attack me and be 
prepared to PAY: what could be more honest and straightforward than that. 
It's just insane to expect people to put themselves at the mercy of anyone 
who comes along: what are you really saying here, feel free to fill me in! 
A great place to start might be defining "anti-globalism", the reasons 
behind the need for violent indiscriminate protest, and how any of that 
bears a relation to the second amendment. Sheesh...
