The point about emergent behavior is excellently made.  A corollary that
occurs to me is that one of the prime motivators in the emergent quality of
human society may well be the pursuit of non-zero sum games.  This
assumption is based on my reading of Robert Wright's _Non Zero_.  I think
Sunder hits this on the head as well when he goes off about how self
interest does not necessarily harm others, that as humans we are not
typically bound by win-lose scenarios.  Rather some behavior may result in
poor or no gains on a societal scale and others may result in increased
benefits for all.

In this light, seemingly altruistic behavior can be re-interpreted as
banking favors against future need.  One of Wright's better examples is the
practice in certain tribal societies of giving away excess food.  Usually
the food wouldn't keep long, anyway, and by helping a neighbor out today
help is usually secured against future need when a neighbor may be the one
with the excess.
