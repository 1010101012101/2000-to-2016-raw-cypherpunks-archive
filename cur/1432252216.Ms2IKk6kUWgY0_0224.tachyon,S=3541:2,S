One of the interesting ideas, though only relevant for the downtown areas fo big cities, is to use the zoning regulations to get 802.11b access included as one of the "public improvements" required in return for an easement allowing a taller (any other violation of the zoning code would work as well) than would otherwise be allowed.  This is to say nothing of access points set up by individuals allowing broadband access to others, there are already 2 of those in my neighborhood.
