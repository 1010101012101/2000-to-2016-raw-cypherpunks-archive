No, no, don't punish him. He is obviously traumatized by the incident 
and, and like so many other kids,  needs counseling, treatment. And 
medication. Don't forget medication,  so he can be trusted not disrupt 
his "Just Say No" D.A.R.E. lectures. Congress should  immediately 
appropriate $100 billion to help America's youth deal with this tragedy.

Now that I've got that out of my system, did it ever occur to any of 
these idiots that, to most normal 11-year old boys, the idea of planes 
crashing into skyscrapers might just be a way-cool, fascinating subject?

What's really disturbing is that it almost certainly did.
