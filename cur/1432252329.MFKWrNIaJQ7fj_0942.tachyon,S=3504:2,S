That is nonsense.  Famines in Africa are caused by communism and socialism, 
notably the famous Ethiopian famines that occurred under Mengistu, or by 
war, notably the famous Biafran famine.

Famines are never caused by people acting in their own interests.  They are 
most commonly caused by pious benevolent socialists imposing the greater 
good with whip and red hot irons, burning, torturing and killing because 
they love people so very much.  Famines are most commonly caused by 
socialists whose care for the suffering of anonymous strangers is so deep 
and heartfelt, whose love and concern for the faceless oppressed masses is 
so vast, that they will hold a child's face in the flames to force her 
mother to reveal where the seed corn is hidden.  After all, we cannot let 
those damned peasants look out for their own selfish interests, can we?  We 
love them too much to permit them such wickedness, and the flesh burning 
off from the bone on the face of a child is proof of how vital our mission 
is to save the peasants from themselves, proof of how much the peasant's 
wicked greedy selfishness puts them in need of our vast benevolent virtue, 
kindness, and generosity.
