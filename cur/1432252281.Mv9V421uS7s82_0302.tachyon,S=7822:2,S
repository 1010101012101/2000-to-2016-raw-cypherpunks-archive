Drone attacks have consequences, altering what groups are allied with what
other groups, for what goals.  This leads to CIA relocating their bases of
operation.  Here is a tale of one Ugly American, from the perspective of
Pakistan. Article adapted from "The Way of the Knife: The C.I.A., a Secret
Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth," published by the Penguin Press.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/raymond-davis-pakistan.html?_r=0


 

Former Blackwater employee Raymond Davis, and a C.I.A. team, had set up
operations from a safe house in the city of Lahore Pakistan, where some of
these groups were apparently based.  As I have shared earlier, both under
international law, as the US interprets TNIAC,[1] and as UN investigations
of targeted killing and state-sponsored assassinations have written,[2] CIA
agents, and their civilian contractors, do not enjoy any kind of diplomatic
immunity for their actions where there is no war going on. They are also
legitimate targets for their enemies, because they are engaged in a war,
where otherwise there is peace.  From the perspective of the nation where
they are operating, they are no different than criminal gangs.

 

While Davis had been navigating dense traffic in Lahore, two young men had
approached his car on a black motorcycle, their guns drawn, at an
intersection congested with cars, bicycles and rickshaws. Davis took his
semiautomatic Glock pistol and shot through the windshield, shattering the
glass and hitting one of the men numerous times. As the other man fled,
Davis got out of his car and shot several rounds into his back.

 

He radioed the American Consulate for help, and within minutes a Toyota Land
Cruiser was in sight, careering in the wrong direction down a one-way
street. But the S.U.V. struck and killed a young Pakistani motorcyclist and
then drove away. 

 

So the Pakistani police picked up Mr. Davis, for questioning.

 

An assortment of bizarre paraphernalia was found, including a black mask,
approximately 100 bullets and a piece of cloth bearing an American flag. The
camera inside Davis's car contained photos of Pakistani military
installations, taken surreptitiously.

 

The evidence at the time indicated that the men Davis killed had carried out
a string of petty thefts that day, but there was an added problem: the third
man killed by the unmarked American S.U.V. fleeing the scene.

 

Davis was taken to Kot Lakhpat prison.  Washington DC demands his release.
Pakistani people demand a death sentence.

What Davis and the CIA had been doing in Lahore was NOT to fight US enemies,
but allegedly to get entangled in the India-Pakistan disputes.  Eventually
leaders on both sides agreed to a deal.  The reckoning for Davis's actions
would come in the form of "blood money," or diyat, a custom under Shariah
law
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sharia_islam
ic_law/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier>  that compensates the families of
victims for their dead relatives. The matter would be handled quietly, and
Davis would be released from jail.  After weeks of discussions, the parties
agreed on a total of 200 million Pakistani rupees, approximately $2.34
million, to offer "forgiveness" to the jailed C.I.A. officer.
