So, how does a non-criminal citizen protect themselves against armed home 
invaders who break down their front door or crash through a window to gain 
entry?  Are citizens liable for injuries and deaths to law enforcement 
personnel who use such unannounced methods (esp. in the early morning hours)?

I know that there have been cases which determined that its illegal to use 
an indiscriminate weapon (e.g., a shotgun tied to a door) to deter such 
entries, but what about a discriminate, automated, weapon system?  By 
coupling night vision optics and a video pickup, image recognition 
software, a robotic gimbal and an semi-automatic firearm, such a system 
could discriminate forced entry situations from more normal entry means, 
target intruders and initiate deterrence. What then?
