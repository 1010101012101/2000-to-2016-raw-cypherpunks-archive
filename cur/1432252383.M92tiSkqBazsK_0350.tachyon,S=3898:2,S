Quite interesting the language they keep using: "Terrorists don't have 
rights."

The 1200 persons detained without due process, without habeas corpus, 
for close to three months, are presumed to be "terrorists" and thus are 
denied the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

(Note that the C. does _not_ say these rights are held by citizens. It 
says these rights existed _prior_ to the writing and ratification of the 
Constitution and apply to everyone. There are a few rights, such as 
voting, which are spelled out as applying to citizens above a certain 
age (varies according to Congress' whims), and so on, but it is clear 
which rights these are. To see this, imagine if it were decreed that 
only legal citizens who are not felons could practice a particular 
religion. Or could publish their ideas. Slam dunk violations of the 
First, regardless of citizenship status.)

The police state measures rushed into law by Congress will be used to 
suppress dissidents long after this war is over.

The one good thing about this action is that we won't have to hear from 
Congressvarmints complaining about some radical chick (not to be 
confused with radical chic) in Columbia given a secret military 
trial...we're now doing the same thing to our Constitution-spouting 
radicals!
