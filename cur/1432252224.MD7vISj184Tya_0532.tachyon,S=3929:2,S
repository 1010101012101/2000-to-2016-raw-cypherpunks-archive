There is all kinds of info no NMR and related technologies on the web. Try
google.com and use 'NMR'.

In general the material under examination has some intrinsic property that
can be measured using EM fields. By measuring the magnitude/transmissivity
of the signal through the material one can map that material. The
precision is enough to rival x-rays and that sort. The distinction between
the phases of the CD material in it's two states (eg density) would
interfere in different ways. So the fact that one CD might be re-writable
more than once isn't important with respect to what is written on it now
(though one could probably do bit archeology just like on magnetic media).
