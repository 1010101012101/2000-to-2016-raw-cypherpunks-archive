--- re: transparent ziplock example ---

In the previous post addendum [1] the following link was provided for
artwork that demonstrates a most immediate aspect for how "cryptography"
can function within everyday language situations in a realm of mutable
signs and symbolism.

transparent ziplock with acid written on it, yellow letters inside, by Ray
Geary (?)
http://vapidforever.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Acid-241x300.jpg

Here is a quick viewpoint for how it might or could be read, whether or not
the intended meaning; (basically it potentially involves superposition as
the letters could be in different positions of rearrangement (ACID) given
their movement in the bag, so chaos or arbitrariness are inherent)... the
off-kilter AC could reference 'alternating current', referencing a back and
forth movement in relation to power, [if not also air conditioner], the
letters I and D could ping the idea of 'the id' which is a dark realm of
the psyche where subterfuge may exist and their backwards reading, Defense
Intelligence. Likewise the letters C and I could relate to
counterintelligence (CI) and intelligence community (IC). The 'C' and 'I'
could be put back together into a second capital letter D which would
change the four letters to three, leaving ADD as another potential. This in
a context of acid as mentioned in the previous post about ushering in
armageddon, forcing splits, etc, as the context for 'variables' and their
meaning, grounded or not. If you think about it though, the assumption of a
secure "brown paper bag" instead being an insecure "transparent ziplock
bag" - including with its contents on the outside as a 'signage' - it has
interesting corollary to issues of both a false encryption regime, which
essentially ramps up the paranoia level, though also the jumbled letters
may also signify more could be occurring than simply a repetition or A:A
relation between what the signage says (ACID) and the contents (A,C,I,D) in
their structurally detached 'linear' state.

For instance, a search of the Internet Anagram Server for the word ACID
only provides two possibilities for rearranging the original meaning using
these same letters, the original word itself (ACID) and (CAD I). And yet
just looking at acronyms or other 'known' cultural examples - shared
libraries of knowledge or understanding as it were - then opens up other
levels of interpretative possibility. In this way, concepts such as
counterintelligence, defense intelligence, intelligence community,
alternating (power) current, the id, who knows- AI and DC even further,
then potentially "decrypt" actual meaning or relevance to what it may mean
if the supposed security of encryption is knowingly subverted and yet the
lies are being sold as a mainstream perspective- and what that may result
in, in terms of a transparency within "security products" and industry.

It probably is a lot more involved than this, such that there could be
levels or layers to encryption that exist beyond 'the letters' in the
transparent envelope, which is assumed what is actually happening in a
double-model where security does exist, yet is invisible and extends beyond
the signs as delivered, carrying placards "this is a secret". So perhaps
counterintelligence is built-into encryption, as a trapdoor and some other
encryption approach functions as a failsafe within that, yet unidentified
or unmediated using the same approaches, algorithms or conceptual
communication channels. Which was the point about language, though likewise
could extend into different mathematics that take 'the message' received
upon decrypt or before decrypting, and decrypt otherwise. In other words,
the artwork provides example that the external 'sign' read by surveillers
and the transparent package contents could be assumed A=A, whereby
ACID=ACID and it is of finite meaning as a decrypted message, whereas if
the label (ACID) and the contents could be interpreted beyond this via A=B
analysis, the message may not be decrypted if the assumption remains the
inside meaning is bounded only at ACID, and not involving AC, CI, IC, DI,
ID, DC, ADD, etc.

Another aspect would be if noise was added such that a number 1 replaced
the capital i, as the label and contents, and then "keyword" software may
never consider ACID as the word or other connections, due to a category
error, such that the set {ACD,1} may not be interpreted that way
machinically, if not programmed for this basic substitution, and thus AC,
DC may result though nothing like CI, IC, DI, ID, which would bound
potential meaning as a result. Whereas these substitutions could be obvious
for a person who is on the lookout or reads this way, such that texts can
function like puzzles and if in a context of secret communications, can be
solved or resolved via such methods.

It seems then an issue of *how do you know* what is a correct
interpretation? And that is again like cloud-code, scrying, crystal ball
skills involving the revealing of patterns as they align with other
structures, and find grounding. The decrypt, whether from another person or
'psychic intelligence' tapped out of noosphere, relies upon the observer
and their state of being, sane to insane, and how well they are grounded in
truth, or reliant upon falsity, and how this interpretation either is
stable and reliable or destabilizes and leads to paranoia and
self-destruction by not having the skills to mediate ideas from within
noisefields, like a Random Event Generator or scrying device. A high-risk
thus could be involved and without a solid foundation in truth it could
lead to significant problems in thinking, with high likelihood of losing
mental grasp with day to day existence, and thus promoting a schizoid
condition via unanswered or assumed perspectives, the hall of mirrors of
wrong assumptions, and all the private chaos that could generate and also
be noticeable to others, as a person goes off the deep end into la la land
or no man's land, a point of no return, which can lead to extreme behavior,
justifications, etc. Thus the issue of limits of interpretation and
personal limits of awareness, could cause one person to immediate violent
action due to unresolved, unlivable mental conditions whereas another may
be able to think or understand beyond that boundary and continue
functioning. So the psychic snap effect is likely related to a threshold of
awareness and understanding, the ability to find and attain grounding in a
world of subversion and locate a path to continued existence. This would be
especially interesting if those who realize they are trapped then are
provided an opening, turned, via these same means, because there is really
no way out of it once captured within the labyrinth. It is final.

Another cultural reference, somewhat analogous is Johnny Carson's repeated
skits of Carnac the Magnificent, where he takes a sealed envelope and holds
it up to his head  while wearing huge turban (perhaps secret tech inside)
and derives an answer for a question via psychic investigation of the
contents, which then is tested against the actual question in the envelope,
opened and recited, completing the joke.

Johnny Carson as "Carnac" from 1974

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_the_Magnificent

This appears in some way equivalent to a false encryption scheme (via
psychic key escrow perhaps) that allows encrypted communications to be
accessed and read remotely yet appear secure and untouched. Perhaps this
root access or god-like access would be assumed in any scenario of
civilization in a context of power struggles, how could it feasibly not be,
and yet perhaps a further consideration would be *malice* and misuse of
this potential, versus a beneficence, watchful eye, protecting aspect. That
could equate to *trust government* at some point, yet what if the
government interfaced is venal, corrupt, contemptuous of human values and
no longer serving the citizenry.. or more specifically- only their private
citizenry. In such a case, the false encryption could bound or trap their
activities within it, while allowing them to monitor enemies using the same
technology, and so the ultimate setup scenario could exist via and within
the corruption. The nightmare of state, by comparison to comedy skit, would
be if a person could query the ur database of secrets at any time, get an
answer, and use it against you for their personal and shared group
advantage, for an antihuman agenda. There are indications this is actually
what is going on, including with blacklists, and it is wide in the open,
businesses and organizations micropoliticized, 'standing armies' even
within workforces, conflicts mediated by control over accounting
spreadsheets and expenditures, who gets access or moves ahead and who is
sidelined, versus overt violence. Soft war, balkanization, though also
Vietnam War fracturing, taking of sides, forcing splits and oppositional
dynamics within daily environments and interactions. And then these kinds
of activities, supported by supposedly 'secure' encryption involved as
infrastructure and the "complexity" of that, all computers, their
obfuscatory aspects that can be both a hinder and a help if the subversion
or false floors are built-into the code regime, and when triggered for
collapse, impaling ideological adherents in response.

Related to this would be psychic activity as a basis for shared relations,
as it relates to shared knowledge or secret communications, versus those
who are not like this. Perhaps the toxic pollutive wi-fi blanketing
environments is a countermeasure, to short-circuit the atmosphere, fill it
with thick signals of electromagnetic fog to disorient the tuning of
interconnection even. Such that not only is it promoting long term EMF
side-effects of cancer, the wireless radio and computer and cellphone
signals are jamming and blocking the mind from functioning, both inside and
between individuals and the larger group, in additional to animal life,
including colony collapse of bees, etc. What is not active covert warfare
about these crimes against nature and humanity? Instead, "bureaucratic
language" can choose to only validate and interpret one side of the issue
(binary bias) that sides with the same technocratic agenda as delivered by
scientists and technologists, made standard, made a basis for profit and
'the economy' that is functioning against humans and the earth itself. And
because both the role of electromagnetism in this situation is actively
censored out of existence and because "logic" itself has been removed from
education entirely, such that relativistic pseudo-truth based on
authoritative control has essentially become the means for dictatorial
power, that *no feedback is possible* to correct these mechanisms because
they are actually part of the masterplan, decades if not centuries old and
underway, to defeat humanity. So what if observers are not even allowed to
think, allowed to freely observe, and a natural state of being even becomes
criminalized (in some way perhaps related to anarchists and libertarian
issues or policy views here). What if that state or corporate agenda
actually diminishes a society's health and vast many peoples ability to
think or relate in a *sane context* versus an insane, unstable, toxic,
sick, unhealthy, oppressive environment. Think kindergarteners who go to
then go to the same gradeschool and junior high for 8 more years, sitting
in classrooms for hours a day, in direct proximity to a massive active
cellphone tower that is without question bathing them in sickness inducing
toxic radiation* via long-term exposure- and that likewise, people in
apartments are likewise criminally exposed to such hazards, by design. What
allows *words* to have so little shared meaning that the truth involved can
be removed from the signs, via legal -protection clauses- (security), and
cannot be related back to truth, to defeat the scam? People are literally
dying and being made deathly ill, for profit, by the obfuscatory approach--
like that transparent ziplock, the evil planning agenda, and yet nothing is
or can be done to stop it apparently because LOGIC is absent from
reasoning, people are illiterate and unable to communicate about what is
actually going on as the situation has been made ever-more 'variable' via
relativism, you can choose what to believe and have a friction-free
lifestyle versus consider other humans, the results of decisions. And thus
Babel fully realized, complete incoherence of worldview and local
observation, everything is skew, warping and distortion- all of it as
simple as the Binary Code Regime allows. It does not exist, just keep
believing in the false perspective, stay within the herd that is benefiting
and surviving- you can be one of them if only you let go of your delusions.

(*not to mention interaction between EMFs and cellular signals and
industrial chemicals in the body, breakdown of cells, and relation with
psychiatric and other pills which can trigger other effects; obesity,
diabetes, cancers, skin problems, and other issues potentially connected to
electromagnetically saturated and compromised environs.)

It reeks of Fahrenheit 451 dynamics, say the wrong thing, think the wrong
thought, share or relate in the wrong dynamics and an alarm goes off
somewhere to justify a potential security response that likely involves
breaking into your computer, remotely monitoring everything you do, going
through all health, education, banking records in a context of "terrorism"
or potential enemy of the state, future citizen criminal evaluation, that
can also be used as a map for take-down and behavioral and social
engineering, suddenly you lose your mate, lose your job, cannot get
rehired, etc. Blacklisting would be expected if there is unchecked power,
carte blanche to take down enemies of a hidden dictatorial agenda. That is,
a private takeover advantaged by a onesided viewpoint that is governing the
security state via its corrupt ideology. A public takedown of humans, so
there is no longer any illusion of having control, it is a charade and
masquarade and at some point the liars will need to be counted in the same
way they are counting everyone else. A double encryption scheme could
account for this, say a next level standard that is 'not exploited' yet
similarly backdoored and trapdoored.

Further, basic dwelling as embassy. Whether in-built systems or dual-use
off the shelf consumer electronics made to TSCM tap, say wireless speaker
systems-- what surveiller could ask for more, unless of course including
trance-inducing or hypnotizing technology as part of the arrangement. There
are probably 50 ways within every domicile if not more to fully keep track
of people, from relaying of printer and scanner data to viewing through TVs
or listening through radios, to siphoning data through mice, keyboards, USB
drives especially, routers, as if there is no limit even, and this likely
possible remotely without resources on-site or locally. Plus the technology
itself is toxic and in its design specifications, EMF-wise, the emissions
can cause illness and disease, yet they are not identified as such- so
completely onesided the 'reality' involved. And who benefits? Those making
and making a living off of this death-machine and those who serve its
agenda without considering the sell out and consequences. It seems for some
it is a known pogrom with genocidal intent, which they live to support,
through normalized doublespeak and cloaked similarity while polarized,
pressing onward. Reason does not work when people do not observe truth, the
antireason crowd has the debate, they own this crooked language, law,
state, its policies of mediocrity. And it is as if no one is the wiser
because of the silence, and thus the *alarm* when someone actually says
something 1:1 about this situation-- SECURITY ALERT! SECURITY ALERT! -- as
if even constitutional rights are a threat to the state now, because it
ruins the party going on for the group benefiting from and building out the
false perspective. Hollywood must be involved, it is just too perfect, too
fictional, too much like a stage set, yet for the ignorant they may not
realize the difference, as it confirms 'true beliefs'.

Thus likely it is part of a long-ago strategy, this then the big reveal,
curtains opened on the security theater, its players on stage, before the
proscenium, taking on their critical roles in the performance- voicing
their rehearsed lines, going through the scripted motions as required of
the social engineering, whether at grocery store or in government
positions, making decisions one by one that influence things for their
betterment, undermining culture and civilization in the process, all the
while smiling or smug, a self righteousness afforded most to the
ideological carried as a scent, fingerprint on the bounded limited psyche,
these, the self-same lot those grabbing cellphones and pointing directly at
others- diagnostic scans of the borg, counting, monitoring, 'watching' as
all-seeing private eyes, tallying elsewhere their observation into warped
skew of shared view, corrupt yet to them - divine, highest, a view of
privilege and entitlement, everyone else stealing from them, selfish,
undeserving, while they dismantle civilization itself, their end game is
ending humanity, a rationalists conceit, believing themselves smartest on
the block- oh how that had to be fun to set this whole cosmic takedown
up... The pain of living through it, centuries upon centuries, something
different, though ultimately it will be worthwhile to rid the world of the
plague of such a deceit-filled organization.

(It is like the model where the Devil is the greatest servant of God,
leading the unbelievers to their demise, the ultimate double cross and
sacrifice unimaginable to most all yet ultimately of shared love and
commitment to truth. Versus, say, the 'real devil' who sees themselves as
the real leader of unbelievers, himself the false God, their king, etc. It
fits the terrorism/security model quite well, actually. "Bomb plans on the
internet- here's the link... hell, here are 5,012,202 links to sundry and
unsound activities... go for it!")


--- literacy in relation to truth ---

It is proposed that there is mass illiteracy in the culture, as part of
this overall design for its takeover, that has subverting the reasoning
process to that of behavioral science and its methods as a form of social
control via pavlovian conditioning. Bad thought! leading to "no think" via
pills, therapies, conditioning. Contra, bad thoughts everywhere via
advertisement, forgetting values and exploiting urges and instincts, making
populations animalistic in relations and self-evaluation. So a question
such as how an individual relates to a situation may be assumed they have a
foundational understanding and awareness that was once cultivated in the
education system though has further and further become detached from the
lived reality (especially its technological escape velocity from any known
documentation explaining what exactly _is going on, in the terms it
actually exists).  And thus expecting that people are operating at truth
(1) and accurate observation for relations could be largely mistaken for
most of the population, and thus 'groups' and individuals could be building
their consensus around more what amounts to shared lies or shared warped
views that include and rely upon errors to support their limited thinking
and frameworks, which could be spoon fed to them via news and talkshows and
popular communications. In this way, relation could occur in a vast context
of falsity (0) to start with, and some very minor truth may occur what is
effectively a false world view that only locally finds grounding in some
accurate, temporal way. For instance, "I am married" instead of "My spouse
is a robot" or imposter in the nightmare scenario, whereas for others this
may be for them utopia.

And movies and books have made critical contributions to recontextualizing
the present, such as the Matrix and Truman Show as related to living within
a simulation, or cyberpunk literature or other bridge-building between
views, as these go back into old and ancient ideas, and issues of whether
they are surface interpretations or find grounding in relation to the
foundation of knowledge, via logical reasoning, and referencing and
accounting for shared beliefs in terms of ones and zeros, hypotheses
necessarily removed of errors. Yet holier than thou dogmas occur and
lifestyles emerge, the cult of culture, where entire scenes are based on
the shallow superficial *image* and the actuality can become yet another
alphabet for letters, words, and sentences, more diary-based activities,
more like a theme park of state, carnival rides than deep investigations-
as if getting tattoos is the signifier for a meaningful life, versus doing
things that correspond to those tattoos beyond mere consumption and trend
following. Thus the image of the thing, and the thing itself, and issues of
copies, copies of copies, and dilution of truth into something ultimately
opposite, ideological, dissimilar. What once may have had truth or
"literacy" as it were, instead becomes in some sense "illiterate" and
removed of its original truth and conditions for existence, if not
devolved.\

Personal Computers and networking for public citizens from homebrew to Dumb
Terminals in service to the Corporate Terror State and the global junk
drawer, hand over your passport, drivers license, health and banking
records, all private documents, secrets, and we will let you continue to
login in and use the network for hedonistic pleasures.

Thus questions related to a security model based on shared/unshared
communications, and various combinations...

   a.     illiterate <-----> illiterate

   b.     literate <-----> illiterate

   c.     literate <-----> literate

In 'shared illiteracy' there could be a shared false POV that functions as
truth (T) yet is only pseudo (pT) that tends towards falsity (0). This
could be exploited in crypto whereby the sign=sign yet it is a deception,
thus the decrypt is what is expected though a false perspective, thus
relaying and serving up B=B though believed to be A.

In the asymmetrical, doubling aspects of true and false could co-exist,
various siphoning, whereby literate could coexist within A & B views, rely
on A while sharing a false view of B as the relation with the illiterate
via bounded, threshold interaction, so from the illiterate side B=B would
be the only reality shared in the exchange. In this way distortion, warp,
skew function as camouflage by reinforcing ideological bias, perhaps itself
a form of conditioning via confirming bias, no questions, no new answers.
Also, feedback from B could occur, thus pulling information out of
exchange, like animal training perhaps, this probably normal for most
exchanges in terms of manipulations within some dimensions, whether
business or personal.

And then assumption of A=A relations in relations and communication
exchange within shared grounded truth (1) that may have some errors (A=B)
yet be identifiable, recognized, within the involved dimensions. This is to
clarify, in contrast to the first example of shared illiteracy that while
shared literacy 'shares truth' it still would be of the domain of
pseudo-truth (pT), the difference being that it tends towards 1 (absolute
truth) and not 0 (falsity), unlike shared views of illiteracy that are
ungrounded and continue to detach from whatever may correct the viewpoint,
increase the understanding, etc, because it may not be ideologically
necessary, even.

Then to consider "encryption" and crypto in a such a context of actual
intelligence and ignorance of varying degrees and dimensions, that again
may shift given context. A very smart person could be highly literate in
binary code and programming (c) yet in terms of intelligence in a larger
realm be incompetent (a) and both of these occupy an issue such as secret
communication and secure exchange, such that they may "believe" crypto is
secure on ideological grounds due to belief in technology yet without
considering the ideas and thinking beyond that context, due to illiteracy
of ideas, thinking, conceptualization, that could then be exploited in an
unshared situation (b) whereby the asymmetrical pseudo-truth shared
exchange can be exploited...

   pT(1) <-----> pT(0)        whereby:

   pT(A/B) <-----> pT (B)

In essence leading to a falsed shared state of the second observer in
shared falsity (B), tending to zero, and allowing the first observer to
double in a contained accurate view (A) while feeding and interacting in a
false view of B.

The pseudo-truth of the first tending toward truth, and the second toward
falsity, yet perceived as if a shared state by the latter in an
asymmetrical relation due to 'not knowing' what they do not know or remain
unaware of, via bias, threshold, limitations. And thus errors, skew,
warping, distortion relied upon as structures can be security exploits.

   1<=A|B=>0  <===crypto===>  B=>0

Note: a shared viewpoint of pseudo-truth thus could be shared by observers
one and two, where for the latter it appears both share the same reality
(0) even though it tends towards falsity, where from their perspective it
defaults to absolute truth, if uncritical ideology is confirmed, though for
the former this could be known, a deception, and thus knowingly
misinforming while functioning in a realm of truth (1) beyond this
interaction.

In this way, the first observer could even send a message to the second
which is decrypted, verified as 'secret' and send this further down the
line, which could still be encoded or encrypted, should it encounter
another who is of the shared 'shared awareness' or literacy, whether human
or machine, and therefore if the view was hidden it could bypass or go
beyond the observer (say surveiller) via the bounded interpretation or
knowledge, and yet still be deciphered by some other observer down the
line. Perhaps this most possibly in a context of ignorance or more advanced
approaches, beyond the capacity of the second observer to gain any clues
about via observation.

It would thus seem that 'zoning' and 'tiered access' whether hidden or
unhidden could relate to this issue of "perspective", a holographic quality
even given access, angle, or dimensional perch. Maybe this is sliding scale
and is about more/less knowledge, thus literacy and more literacy, that
paradoxical back and forth, so that in certain views if deception it would
actually be true that B is the higher state, say the Binary Crypto Regime,
where those adhering to standard A are viewed illiterate by their
dissimilarity or incapacity even, and thus strong crypto (knowingly false)
is knowingly presented and sold this way (B=A) as a deception, yet via an
ideology founded on pseudo-truth, lies, such that their ungrounded A=A
equations and assessments tend toward zero by default, when outside their
limits of control, and ability to govern over its action and
interpretation. Thus the importance of maintaining and exploiting illusions.


--- more on pseudo-truth --

Without spelling it out entirely, beyond 1<A|B>0 as an approximation, it is
to suggest that in ordinary, normal reasoning processing reliant upon truth
and logical evaluation via empirical structures, shared grounding in some
sense of observation removed of errors as the standard, that the ability to
ignore this leads to illiteracy and ungrounded belief, *faith* in what can
amount to falsehood or inaccurate views due to lack of rigor,
accountability, and built-in ignorance in terms of not knowing as a part of
being, and the role of learning in moving from less truth to more truth
over time, via cybernetic feedback and improved decision-making and
observational capacity slash awareness. If education is short-circuited,
this improvement process via critical evaluation may be broken within
individuals and then their group relations in society, also with family
deterioration. If debate is short-circuited due to ungrounded relativism
and their being 'no need to see things similarly', as is the subjective
default, then faith can take over and people can choose what to believe
based on its profit to their immediate sensibility.

Thus a potential for relation could exist in that each person has a
capacity for some ignorance and some intelligence, or relies on some
falsity and some truth within their observational frameworks...

   A|B  <=====>  A|B

In this model A is assumed to be pseudo-truth tending towards truth (1) and
B is towards falsity (B).

       A <=====> A

In a grounded ~empirical resolution of shared observation, contingent truth
via tested hypotheses would enable 'shared truth' to exist in A=A relations
between two observers, and this could be the result of logical evaluation
and debate.

The plague that is relativistic ideology breaks this process, and allows
ungrounded observation to exist as if A, without removal of errors, and
thus 'unshared A' which may only be hypothetical and untested and
uncorrected outside its controlled private boundaries, based upon
"theoretical" beliefs, heavily invested in a binary worldview as its
intellectual justification, cherry-picking data that confirms the viewpoint
and ignoring the role of falsification and error-correction as part of the
process of grounding ideas...

    A (1)  <===/  /===> A (0)

Everything is equal, unless the false-viewpoint is in control, say of
education, then 'truth' (1) can be censored out and presented as 'illegal
thinking', while the false view actually is reliant upon and moving towards
falsity (pt=>0) and is actually an A=B situation, though disallows debate
that has facts and argument indicating B=B is the actual substance of the
corrupted observation. And thereby discourse must stop, and the default
machine progression of institutional ideas thus favors this
closed-ideological approach or 'theoretical observation' that is inherently
ungrounded, untested, and essentially reliant upon and promoting a fiction
for the shared reality to which others must conform to proceed within
institutions of learning and education, which function against ideas,
against learning, and against society in their day to day agendas, except
insofar as it benefits those who serve the goals of this subversive agenda,
who then likely are doubles and very smart yet duplicitous or extremely
ignorant and selfish.

  A -----> A|B

The function of debate in terms of feedback has been to provide empirical
and observational oversight to ideas, such that panoptic qualities of
additional views of a situation can often held refine the limited
perspective, and therefore any observation of error (A=B) could be
recognized and corrected.

  A <-----> A

In this way, empirical resolution and refinement can 'improve' ideas via
shared observation and this can be a back and forth encounter between one
observer and another or one observer and many, or many with many- the
belief in bugs and eyeballs, which seems opposite of where the code is at
these days in terms of sensible understanding. That is the bugs are
normalized, errors prolific and rife and relied upon, the beast of
antisecurity making its fortune on the pT=T exploit now a structure of the
technology, this protected even by subverted law, ah how language has
become detached from its reliance and verification in truth by the
relativistic mindset and its beliefs. unbelievable, the extent of the
corruption, making its way into nervous systems and reprogramming people to
believe and serve lies via brain washing and other methods of
indoctrination.

  A|B <====> A|B

The potential for debate then is that each side has some truth and falsity,
and if ungrounded these 'shared observations' in pseudo-truth via
relativistic frameworks can lead to 'shared falsity' that tends towards
zero, in terms of the sliding scale, where "ideas" communicated are reliant
upon scaffoldings of wrong assumptions, errors, flawed thinking and
beliefs, skew and bias, such that whatever contingent truth may exist and
be shared, it would be reliant on massive falsity to communicate and share
and thus exist only as a minor aspect, homeopathic amounts, a tincture
within a much larger frame of flawed observation, and this normalized as
the basis for exchange.

  B <=====> B

In this way 'shared truth' could instead, if ungrounded and reliant on the
errors for its structure and sustenance, be *believed* true (1) yet
actually be so minor and reliant on false belief and wrong assumptions that
the pseudo-truth tends towards falsity overall, if taking into account the
context needed to sustain the truth, its container of other ideas and
thinking, most likely flawed ~ideology that no longer asks question and
relies on previous answers or a particular observation becomes solidified
as 'the POV', thus limiting the questions to a finite, skewed model that
requires its errors to be continued as a viewpoint, keeping opposite views
outside, allowing false utopia to exist inside.

Whereas if partial truth is accessed in an accurate framework, this same
contingent aspect of discerning what is real and actual and existent via
observation can be removed of errors via debate, and what is true can be
separated from what is false.

   A <====> A

Thus observers could validate the same truth (A=A) while simultaneously
recognizing the errors in this condition (B=B) and thus instead of relying
on the errors, discard them or learn from them, yielding what is accurate
from the forces of skew, warping, and distortion as force fields aligning
with disconnected truth yet not relying on these as if they are themselves
unfettered truth, which relativists allow and require and celebrate-- THE
BULLSHIT basically.

In the above example, as a situation moves from A|B --> A, via logical
reasoning of grounded empirical observation, pT=>T, and falsity is removed
from the process of shared communication as a structural framework.

Subvert logical reasoning, disallow it, including freedom of speech and
thinking and censoring and controlling what facts are allowed - controlling
POV - then the opposite occurs:  B ---> A, such that  pT => T

This is the crypto exploit of the Binary Code Regime, where B=A(0) and
pT(0)=>T(1)

And it is the same ideological 'code' used as an authoritarian means of
control over debate, to stop error-correction and install a false POV as
the shared false 'empiricism' whereby truth is ignored, logical reasoning
disallowed, facts censored, views onesided, and right answers based on
'authority' - power over ideas, versus ideas themselves.

In this way, ~Enronomics goes beyond accounting for Sokal Hoax of
financialization and into classrooms and minds everywhere, engineering
'shared pseudo-truth' => 0.

It must be said also that 'bullying' and the ego of the oppressor
oftentimes is part of this relation, pT>T, and likewise B>A, and goes hand
in hand with the bullshit regime, and in this way intimidation or the need
of the powerful to let the oppressed know they are superior is a security
lapse, revealing what hides behind the facade of security theater.

Thus false POVs, vanity, egotism, sadism, and flawed assumptions of
observers should not be discounted as security threats, weaknesses or
strengths for hack/crack attacks. And this is certainly accounted for
already, though it seemingly is not being accounted for in ideas
themselves, their truth (1) in a shared empirical framework. Thus what if
crypto is protecting or reliant upon bad ideas and yet this is not being
accounted for due to social issues or non-mathematical variables of a
civilization in ruin?

<div><br>transparent ziplock with acid written on it, yellow letters inside=
, by Ray Geary (?)<br><a href=3D"http://vapidforever.com/wp-content/uploads=

tent/uploads/2013/03/Acid-241x300.jpg</a><br>
<br></div><div>Here is a quick viewpoint for how it might or could be read,=
 whether or not the intended meaning; (basically it potentially involves su=
perposition as the letters could be in different positions of rearrangement=
 (ACID) given their movement in the bag, so chaos or arbitrariness are inhe=
rent)... the off-kilter AC could reference &#39;alternating current&#39;, r=
eferencing a back and forth movement in relation to power, [if not also air=
 conditioner], the letters I and D could ping the idea of &#39;the id&#39; =
which is a dark realm of the psyche where subterfuge may exist and their ba=
ckwards reading, Defense Intelligence. Likewise the letters C and I could r=
elate to counterintelligence (CI) and intelligence community (IC). The &#39=
;C&#39; and &#39;I&#39; could be put back together into a second capital le=
tter D which would change the four letters to three, leaving ADD as another=
 potential. This in a context of acid as mentioned in the previous post abo=
ut ushering in armageddon, forcing splits, etc, as the context for &#39;var=
iables&#39; and their meaning, grounded or not. If you think about it thoug=
h, the assumption of a secure &quot;brown paper bag&quot; instead being an =
insecure &quot;transparent ziplock bag&quot; - including with its contents =
on the outside as a &#39;signage&#39; - it has interesting corollary to iss=
ues of both a false encryption regime, which essentially ramps up the paran=
oia level, though also the jumbled letters may also signify more could be o=
ccurring than simply a repetition or A:A relation between what the signage =
says (ACID) and the contents (A,C,I,D) in their structurally detached &#39;=
linear&#39; state.<br>
<br></div><div>For instance, a search of the Internet Anagram Server for th=
e word ACID only provides two possibilities for rearranging the original me=
aning using these same letters, the original word itself (ACID) and (CAD I)=
. And yet just looking at acronyms or other &#39;known&#39; cultural exampl=
es - shared libraries of knowledge or understanding as it were - then opens=
 up other levels of interpretative possibility. In this way, concepts such =
as counterintelligence, defense intelligence, intelligence community, alter=
nating (power) current, the id, who knows- AI and DC even further, then pot=
entially &quot;decrypt&quot; actual meaning or relevance to what it may mea=
n if the supposed security of encryption is knowingly subverted and yet the=
 lies are being sold as a mainstream perspective- and what that may result =
in, in terms of a transparency within &quot;security products&quot; and ind=
ustry. <br>
<br>It probably is a lot more involved than this, such that there could be =
levels or layers to encryption that exist beyond &#39;the letters&#39; in t=
he transparent envelope, which is assumed what is actually happening in a d=
ouble-model where security does exist, yet is invisible and extends beyond =
the signs as delivered, carrying placards &quot;this is a secret&quot;. So =
perhaps counterintelligence is built-into encryption, as a trapdoor and som=
e other encryption approach functions as a failsafe within that, yet uniden=
tified or unmediated using the same approaches, algorithms or conceptual co=
mmunication channels. Which was the point about language, though likewise c=
ould extend into different mathematics that take &#39;the message&#39; rece=
ived upon decrypt or before decrypting, and decrypt otherwise. In other wor=
ds, the artwork provides example that the external &#39;sign&#39; read by s=
urveillers and the transparent package contents could be assumed A=3DA, whe=
reby ACID=3DACID and it is of finite meaning as a decrypted message, wherea=
s if the label (ACID) and the contents could be interpreted beyond this via=
 A=3DB analysis, the message may not be decrypted if the assumption remains=
 the inside meaning is bounded only at ACID, and not involving AC, CI, IC, =
DI, ID, DC, ADD, etc. <br>
<br>Another aspect would be if noise was added such that a number 1 replace=
d the capital i, as the label and contents, and then &quot;keyword&quot; so=
ftware may never consider ACID as the word or other connections, due to a c=
ategory error, such that the set {ACD,1} may not be interpreted that way ma=
chinically, if not programmed for this basic substitution, and thus AC, DC =
may result though nothing like CI, IC, DI, ID, which would bound potential =
meaning as a result. Whereas these substitutions could be obvious for a per=
son who is on the lookout or reads this way, such that texts can function l=
ike puzzles and if in a context of secret communications, can be solved or =
resolved via such methods.<br>
<br></div><div>It seems then an issue of *how do you know* what is a correc=
t interpretation? And that is again like cloud-code, scrying, crystal ball =
skills involving the revealing of patterns as they align with other structu=
res, and find grounding. The decrypt, whether from another person or &#39;p=
sychic intelligence&#39; tapped out of noosphere, relies upon the observer =
and their state of being, sane to insane, and how well they are grounded in=
 truth, or reliant upon falsity, and how this interpretation either is stab=
le and reliable or destabilizes and leads to paranoia and self-destruction =
by not having the skills to mediate ideas from within noisefields, like a R=
andom Event Generator or scrying device. A high-risk thus could be involved=
 and without a solid foundation in truth it could lead to significant probl=
ems in thinking, with high likelihood of losing mental grasp with day to da=
y existence, and thus promoting a schizoid condition via unanswered or assu=
med perspectives, the hall of mirrors of wrong assumptions, and all the pri=
vate chaos that could generate and also be noticeable to others, as a perso=
n goes off the deep end into la la land or no man&#39;s land, a point of no=
 return, which can lead to extreme behavior, justifications, etc. Thus the =
issue of limits of interpretation and personal limits of awareness, could c=
ause one person to immediate violent action due to unresolved, unlivable me=
ntal conditions whereas another may be able to think or understand beyond t=
hat boundary and continue functioning. So the psychic snap effect is likely=
 related to a threshold of awareness and understanding, the ability to find=
 and attain grounding in a world of subversion and locate a path to continu=
ed existence. This would be especially interesting if those who realize the=
y are trapped then are provided an opening, turned, via these same means, b=
ecause there is really no way out of it once captured within the labyrinth.=
 It is final.<br>
<br>Another cultural reference, somewhat analogous is Johnny Carson&#39;s r=
epeated skits of Carnac the Magnificent, where he takes a sealed envelope a=
nd holds it up to his head=C2=A0 while wearing huge turban (perhaps secret =
tech inside) and derives an answer for a question via psychic investigation=
 of the contents, which then is tested against the actual question in the e=

 in some way equivalent to a false encryption scheme (via psychic key escro=

</div><div><br></div><div>Related to this would be psychic activity as a ba=

wi-fi blanketing environments is a countermeasure, to short-circuit the atm=
