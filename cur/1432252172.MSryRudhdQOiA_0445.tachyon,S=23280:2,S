# Posted to http://masssurveillance.info/
January 24, 2014

Media reports since last June have revealed that the US government 
conducts domestic and international surveillance on a massive scale, 
that it engages in deliberate and covert weakening of Internet security 
standards, and that it pressures US technology companies to deploy 
backdoors and other data-collection features. As leading members of the 
US cryptography and information-security research communities, we 
deplore these practices and urge that they be changed.

Indiscriminate collection, storage, and processing of unprecedented 
amounts of personal information chill free speech and invite many types 
of abuse, ranging from mission creep to identity theft. These are not 
hypothetical problems; they have occurred many times in the past. 
Inserting backdoors, sabotaging standards, and tapping commercial 
data-center links provide bad actors, foreign and domestic, 
opportunities to exploit the resulting vulnerabilities.

The value of society-wide surveillance in preventing terrorism is 
unclear, but the threat that such surveillance poses to privacy, 
democracy, and the US technology sector is readily apparent. Because 
transparency and public consent are at the core of our democracy, we 
call upon the US government to subject all mass-surveillance activities 
to public scrutiny and to resist the deployment of mass-surveillance 
programs in advance of sound technical and social controls. In finding a 
way forward, the five principles promulgated at 
http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/ provide a good starting point.

The choice is not whether to allow the NSA to spy. The choice is between 
a communications infrastructure that is vulnerable to attack at its core 
and one that, by default, is intrinsically secure for its users. Every 
country, including our own, must give intelligence and law-enforcement 
authorities the means to pursue terrorists and criminals, but we can do 
so without fundamentally undermining the security that enables commerce, 
entertainment, personal communication, and other aspects of 21^st 
-century life. We urge the US government to reject society-wide 
surveillance and the subversion of security technology, to adopt 
state-of-the-art, privacy-preserving technology, and to ensure that new 
policies, guided by enunciated principles, support human rights, 
trustworthy commerce, and technical innovation.
