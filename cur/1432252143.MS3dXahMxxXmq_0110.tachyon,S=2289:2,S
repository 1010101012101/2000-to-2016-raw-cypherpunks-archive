That assumes the reader or listener has heard of Digicash, or of Chaum. 
Not an assumption I'd be comfortable making.

I tend to use "electronic money" when discussing coin- or account-based 
systems, anonymous or not, with the unwashed masses. It conveys the 
meaning well enough to serve as an opening wedge to a better 
description, and it's general enough that it shouldn't offend the 
sensibilities of those few people who do understand the subject in 
depth. And it hasn't been gobbled up by any company, so far as I know.
