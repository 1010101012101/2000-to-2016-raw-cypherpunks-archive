The early private Wikileaks email messages, leaked:


http://cryptome.org/wikileaks/wikileaks-leak.htm


http://cryptome.org/wikileaks/wikileaks-leak2.htm

The goal to raise $5M in a half-year is in the first URL,
near the bottom, 7 Jan 2007.

Lately, that goal appears realistic -- Julian claims over
$1m donated in the few months after the gun ship video
and war logs release -- and thanks to inducing the MSM 
to launder WL's rising profits through its approved channels
for selling leaked classified information after checking
with officials about what will keep the mutually beneficial
leaks flowing. 

Nobody comes close to profiting as much by selling 
leaks like governments and other authoritatives. Leaks
were invented for that purpose, insider spin, press
offices obligatory, research grants, conferences,
tete a tetes, hot sheets, lost laptops, Lady Gaga CD
burnings.

There will be stings to entrap extortionists. Bank of 
America hard disks. Swedish honeys. Rats inside
and outside WL.

On Ted's point about Cryptome: it is a library of sorts
not a hot sheet. 90 per cent of its traffic is for archived
material. Totally untrustworthy. Damaging to seekers
of authoritativeness. Not worth a centavo. Don't go
there. Fuck off. Fuck yourself. Fuck me. Fuck WL.
Fuck this.
