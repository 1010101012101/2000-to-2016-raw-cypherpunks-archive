After reading the Salon article you mentioned, I filed FOIA requests regarding "Main Core" with NSA, FBI, DHS, DSS, NORTHCOM, STRATCOM, CYBERCOM, and DODIIS. All I got was responses saying that there were no responsive records. Of course, this is what happens when almost any information about classified programs is requested via FOIA, so I wasn't surprised (FOIA is really just a smokescreen to make people waste their time begging for records they're never going to get, and to promote the illusion that citizens have some sort of oversight over "their" government).

I sent a letter to the editorial staff at Salon and Democracy Now, which both ran stories on this based on "anonymous sources", and pointed out to them that pretty much every intelligence agency is responding to FOIA requests saying the topic of one of their stories doesn't actually exist. Neither of them responded.

    to the Salon article. Hamilton, who (was then, and still is)
    president of Inslaw Inc., a computer services firm that includes
    clients in government, indicated that the Bush administration's
    domestic surveillance operations used Main Core - it is not known if
    it is still used today in 2014. Main Core was first widely reported
    on in May 2008 by Christopher Ketcham and in July 2008 by Tim
    Shorrock, which included in July of 2008 an interview by Amy Goodman
    of Tim Shorrock. However, I am unaware of any release of names,
    e-mails, etc. which might be on this list, and it seemed kind of
    obvious that those who were reporting on it probably had never seen
    the Main Core list. This may involve use of PROMIS software, and
    according to Adm. Dan Murphy (a former military advisor to Elliot
    Richardson who later served under President George H.W. Bush as
    deputy director of the CIA, who 'died' shortly after his meeting in
    2001 with William Hamilton), did not specifically mention Main Core.
    But he informed Hamilton that the NSA's use of PROMIS involved
    something "so seriously wrong that money alone cannot cure the
    problem." ]]/
