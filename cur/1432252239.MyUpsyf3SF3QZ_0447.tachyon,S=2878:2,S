Um.  Not true.  Many of my relatives do without the first three 
owing to religious proscription.  Since they tend to build their 
own homes in big house-raising parties, (ie, would rather pay for 
employing their own community for a day plus have singing, a 
banquet, and horseshoe pitching instead of paying the same money 
to "some outlander", aka a contractor) the standards to which 
contractors are held in building have never become an issue.  

Then again, as far as I know no Amish-built house has ever fallen 
down or had the roof blow off in a storm, and the locals hold them 
in high regard as solid structures (this is Kansas, where the wind 
occasionally dismantles other buildings).  I don't think a 
structural inspection would likely be a problem....
