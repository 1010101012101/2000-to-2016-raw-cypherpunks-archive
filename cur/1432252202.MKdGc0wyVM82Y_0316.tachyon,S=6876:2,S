Nor am I a racist. I don't even believe the concept of "race" is a 
meaningful one. After all, the latest evidence from mitochondrial DNA 
studies is that nearly everyone in the world is descended from a 
group which was in Africa about 50,000 years ago. A mere blink of an 
eye.

However, I believe people and groups of people, through their 
culture, vary in their approach to education. Few can dispute that 
Jews are very strongly represented in medicine, law, science, and 
professions in general...and underrepresented in sports, for example. 
Few can dispute the opposite about blacks, at least in America.

There are well-known _cultural_ reasons for this. Without even giving 
the ethnic group for these statements, it is obvious which ones they 
belong to:

"My son, the _doctor_."

"Books are for whiteys."


The role of culture is readily apparent at public libraries in 
Silicon Valley. Large numbers of Asians, men and women, usually in 
couples, with large numbers of Asian children hauling armloads of 
books. And Asian children dominate the science fairs, the engineering 
programs. (The Vietnamese do especially well. This was noticeable to 
many of us as early as 1980-83, when the Valedictorians and 
Salutatorians--the top students--at area high schools were largely 
"boat people." These BPs had "floated under the Golden Gate Bridge in 
rafts," as I like to say, and yet several years later they had 
mastered enough English to dominate their high schools. It was seeing 
this that finished off any sympathy I had that black and Mexican 
students were failing because they hadn't mastered English, blah blah 
blah. I realized it was culture, pressure from parents, and desire to 
succeed.)

One could look at the success of blacks who are from the West Indies, 
and who tend to be academically-oriented, to see that culture is more 
important than race. Many blacks from the Dominican Republic, even 
dirt-poor Haiti, are doctors and lawyers.

The issue remains culture. Perhaps a remnant of slavery, perhaps a 
remnant of the plantation lifetstyle. Whatever. They must change this 
culture. Whitey and Big Brother can't do it for them.

The black family in America is fragmented, drug use is rampant, 
children are strongly, strongly discouraged by their peers and their 
mothers (the fathers are absent, in most cases) from academically 
excelling. A culture of "deliberate slacking," like a union shop that 
is on a work slowdown. Those who excel, academically, are seen as 
"white inside" with a variety of deprecating names applied to them.

Obviously this is not true in all cases. There are black scientists 
and black doctors, and there are Jewish tramps and winos, Asian drug 
dealers. But the "distributions" basically fit what I have described. 
And many black intellectuals, dismissed by other blacks as Unca Toms 
and "race traitors," are saying the same thing with increasing 
concern about their culture. Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, many 
others.

Biologically, it is just plain crazy to think that groups which only 
recently scattered into Europe, Japan, Australia, and other corners 
of the world have evolved different brain structures. They haven't.

But cultures can change in the blink of an eye, in a few decades.

This is what is at issue.

Call me a culturalist, but not a racist. Correlation is not causation.
