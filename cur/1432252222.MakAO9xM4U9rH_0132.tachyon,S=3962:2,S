A PERTH schoolboy's suggestion that rose petals be scattered on the streets 
of Manhattan to commemorate September 11 has reportedly been taken up.
Joshua Tan, 14, from the northern Perth suburb of Kallaroo, responded to a 
World Trade Centre website invitation to submit ideas on how to commemorate 
the anniversary, the Sunday Times reported today.
In his email the teenager suggested rose petals could be scattered in the 
streets to remember the victims and celebrate the victory of the spirit of 
the people, like in Roman times.
New York mayor Michael Bloomberg on Friday emailed back saying Joshua's 
suggestion would form a key part of the September 11 commemorations.
"I can't believe that I'm on the other side of the world and my idea has 
been taken on board," Joshua told the paper.
"I just had a feeling I wanted to do something and be part of it."
I had that feeling last year.Funny old world innit? Bloomberg probably 
smokes petals.
