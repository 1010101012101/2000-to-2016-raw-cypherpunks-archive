I think that's quite unlikely. The nodes must reside in commercial
data centers and run untrusted software (including necessarily
modified Tor clients), all of which exposes them to hacking risks and
to the resulting possibility of discovering the interception framework
employed (which is probably not unique to Tor, so that's a huge risk).
But one could try correlating Tor relays and Tor clients growth graphs
since, say, 2000 b if at some point there was a sharp growth in
USA-located relays without a corresponding growth in total clients,
and if those relays have similar bandwidth / data center quality
capabilities, then that could be "The Man".
