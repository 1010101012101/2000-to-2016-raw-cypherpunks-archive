Most people will happily trade privacy for some 'free stuff'. Encrypting
things nobody cares about hiding seems like a losing battle not worth
fighting.

'De-bugging' is also de-bugging and removal of surveilance devices.

If everything (including the network path my data takes) is encrypted,
then I have no real ability to know if it's being tapped, redirected,
or misdirected.
