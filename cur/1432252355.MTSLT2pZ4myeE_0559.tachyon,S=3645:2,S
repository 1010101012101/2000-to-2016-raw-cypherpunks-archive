This should be fun to watch. Let's hope the
result is similar to the matchup of the Kilkenny cats.

    "There once were two cats of Kilkenny 
     Each thought there was one cat too many 
     So they fought and they fit, 
     And they scratched and they bit, 
     Till excepting their nails and the tips of their tails 
     Instead of two cats there weren't any."

Peter Trei
