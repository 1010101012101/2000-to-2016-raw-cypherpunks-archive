If you want to get picky, a clever brain could probably figure out
keystrokes from across the street with a laser mic if the target has a
loud keyboard, considering each key will probably make a slightly
different sound.  I'd think an attacker could determine spacebar hits,
at least, and pauses, which alone might lead to a complete keystroke
log.
