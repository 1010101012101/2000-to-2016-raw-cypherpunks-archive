I don't know, but I just got my first two mailings
from some poor sap, and it has the same intro. 

   "I send you this file in order to have your advice" 

I emailed the person to let them know, asked
if they've visited my URL or anything. Gave
them the CERT URL. Again: 

   http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-22.html

No, it's real, and screamingly funny!!! 

I received an executable ".xls.pif" version of
a spreadsheet called "2000 taxes". 

 From viewing *hundreds* of these using "strings" as
part of previous email monitoring duties, I can
tell just by looking at it that it's the real thing.
(If that showed anything interesting, I transferred
it to a PeeCee for further inspection.) 

If anyone actually wants to run the "win32 executable",
email me for it.

Holy Shit, Batman!!! 

Too bad it didn't get out earlier! 

Let me know if you want the whole thing put up on WWW.
