Amen.

The "rush to statism" that some authors at Reason, The Wall Street 
Journal, Wired, and all of the other Usual Suspects have engaged in 
should not be forgotten.

What happened in New York City was horrible for the targets, but so are 
a lot of things. Suspending civil liberties, as tens of millions of 
Americans are clamoring to have done, is despicable.

"I want to show that I am a patriot. I vote that we allow our police to 
enter our homes whenever they want to look through our diaries and 
letters...I have nothing to hide!"

This is turning out to be a useful exercise. When it is over, sort of, 
we will know better who our enemies are.

Quote of the Month: "It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; 
perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks."
