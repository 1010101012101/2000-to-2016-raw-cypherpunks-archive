The thing about government agencies (US government agencies, in particular)
is that they are brutally pragmatic.

If they thought - really, really thought - that having a human-equivalent
AGI running in a data center would let them accomplish their goals, they'd
do it in a heartbeat.  There's no guarantee that it would actually happen,
because the government/contractors system is horribly inefficient, but an
attempt would be made.

It seems, by all accounts, that the NSA is more concerned with being able
to break crypto than they are having a human-equivalent intelligence.  From
what I've heard from more-or-less reliable sources, they need raw number
crunching power and disk space for huge rainbow tables to do what they need
to do and be able to show results.

If anything, I think the DoD would be more interested in having an AGI, but
they have more than enough trouble to deal with on the infosec side of the
house.
