Whats your threat model? If the prospective attacker
has state-level resources, this will always fail.

There are a number of guides online describing how 
attackers should deal with computer data. One
of the most basic is they *never* run the attackees
software on the original disk. Step one is always to
make a bit-level mirror of the entire hard drive, and
work with a copy of that. Step zero is to pull the power,
so any shutdown code does not run.

Any protective scheme which relies on the attacker
inadvertantly activating software is doomed from the
start.

If you're dealing with a state-level attacker, any
scheme involving explosives or incendiaries would get
the attackee in as much or more trouble than the
original data would.

This is a hard problem. I suspect any solution will
involve tamper-resistant hardware, which zeroizes
itself if not used in the expected mode.
