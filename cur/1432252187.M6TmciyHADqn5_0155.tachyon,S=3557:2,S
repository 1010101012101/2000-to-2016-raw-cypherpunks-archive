Hmmm, I hadn't heard of YaCy before, thanks for the mention!

OVF is a dead end AFAICS.

It's not perfect, but the combination of Chef/Puppet (to specify +
install + configure the software stack) plus Vagrant (to specify +
install + configure the base VM) seems like a more fruitful path
forward.  There are some missing pieces; for example, it's regrettably
common in current Cookbooks and Vagrantfiles to download
unsigned-and-unhashed code from the network and trust it.  But that's
fixable with more hashing and content addressed storage.
