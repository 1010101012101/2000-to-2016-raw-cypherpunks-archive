One boggles when some idiot who spams refers to a URL as a "line," and
then can't even give a valid URL. What did they do, convert the IP to
a single value and then translate it to decimal? Why? It's obviously
to dodge complaints. I have to wonder about anybody who
would write a browser which accepts something like that in the first
place.
