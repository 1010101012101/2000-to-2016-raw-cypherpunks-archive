That is complete bollocks i wrote over and over about johns bullshit...
acknowledging it

That you refuse to have self critique proves point of an irresponsible
mindset toward the community

I am not alone here others stated the same i am just following what you
pointed to as big proof you made an ask to the list... which i do not see
at all

If ypu acknowledge the issue maybe your ego will get out of the way and you
can shift behavior if you dont even acknowledge the behavior you will be on
repeat cycle - not acceptable

Shelly brain hurt? Not surprising
