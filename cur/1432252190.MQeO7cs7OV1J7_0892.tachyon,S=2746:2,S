Germany, or any State that  restricts words or thought, needs a regime
change
with extreme prejudice.

Are there exceptions for Buddhists and Amerinds?  Moron.

If so, then Germany should have the balls to discover freedom --adopt
the US Constitution for instance.  The US can't counter such a move.

>There is no "ultimate" free speech as the US promises,

Not in Germany, obviously.  In the US, yes.  Our founders trusted
the Volk; your conquerors (eg the US) let your shepards (eg your govt)
neuter the sheep (ie you).

Fuck censors dead.

Freedom is only tested when its unconfortable, baby.

Maybe you will find this list too uncomfortable, Kalus.
