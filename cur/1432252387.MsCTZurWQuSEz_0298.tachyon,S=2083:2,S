I have to take a look at this. Using racoon was my first idea because it
seems to be the "official" Linux thing these days and is portable to the
*BSDs, too. It's probably only the NIH syndrome at work.

Also, using pluto suffers from the general FreeS/WAN problem of not allowing
contributions from USAians. 

Anyway, thanks for the reminder - while the project is still at the 
"half-assed idea tossing" state, hacking FreeS/WAN should still be an 
option.
