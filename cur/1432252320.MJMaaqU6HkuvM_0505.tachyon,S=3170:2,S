Fair point. I don't recall seeing the original message. Cypherpunks
nodes are flaky enough, and I don't read all messages.

In any case, I throw some ads up on politechbot.com to (partly) cover
server costs. Those are not Doubleclick ads, and I have never done so.
You can subscribe to the mailing list if you like and avoid the ads.
