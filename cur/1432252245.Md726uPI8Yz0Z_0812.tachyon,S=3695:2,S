Sure, thats why I and others at koeln.ccc.de started just telling
journalists to go away, it works fine for us and saves a lot of
time. Andy Mueller Maguhn can play the Media Bizz game with far
better success, but success for whom?

But I still would be very glad if you as a person probably
understanding the media biz can give a hint what is so
fundamentally wrong about the assumptions in above paragraph.

thanks
