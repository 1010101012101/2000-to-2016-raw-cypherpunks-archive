Has it not occurred to you that having Powell make the first statement may be
designed to avoid having Bush make the [obvious and needed] statement?  The
truth is more likely along the lines of Bush demanded certain Intel be
"found", and it was.  Now that it cannot be substantiated, and is becoming a
slow but growing thorn, making it go away as quietly as possible is the rule
of the day.  But it won't die quietly if Shrub makes the announcement: it has
to be an underling.

And lets face it - Powell is the *only* underling with *any* credibility.
