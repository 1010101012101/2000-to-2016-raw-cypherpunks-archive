it seems that core (i.e. the root servers) has deleted the entry for
vote-auction.com - while the whois still works and their primary
nameserver (in austria) still resolves, a regular lookup returns with
"host unknown".

rumour has it that core carved in to demand by most possibly the feds.
here in europe the sentiment today is that by doing so core has stopped
being (if it ever was) an independent and purely technical instance and
has entered the realm of politics. for example, no matter whether or not
vote-auction.com is or is not illegal in the US, what business has a US
court or lea in blocking the site for *me* (in germany) or, for that
matter, the rest of the planet?
