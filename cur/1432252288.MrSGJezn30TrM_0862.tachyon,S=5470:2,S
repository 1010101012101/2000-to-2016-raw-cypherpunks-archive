Which "text boxes"? Any form on Teh Intertubes? THe AwesomeBar or Searc=

It's easy (it just requires a habit of decent tagging), and effective -=

I remember an information I found important from a website I visited, i=
t's=20
usually in my bookmarks, tagged properly. This means 95% of the time as=

information I have already seen is concerned, the AwesomeBar reaching d=
own to=20
my bookmarks is enough to get what I need, no need to go to Google here=

Not that easy, as everybody would need to publish their bookmark RSS/At=
om=20
channels not entirely in accordance with how it is being done usually o=
n the=20
'Net. Usually, only the first 10-30 headlines/items are in the RSS/Atom=
=20
channel, the older ones (it is assumed) are already cached in users' RS=
S/Atom =20
readers.

Firefox does not cache live bookmarks, so each time you only get the cu=
rrent=20
10-30 items, all older are "lost". This makes sense with regard to the=20=

intended use of this functionality in Firefox (and other browsers), but=
=20
unfortunately makes it harder to implement interesting bookmarks sharin=
g the=20
way you described.
