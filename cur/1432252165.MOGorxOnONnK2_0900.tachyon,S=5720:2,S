UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif., Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- In a major first for the 
entertainment and telecommunications industries, Universal Studios Home 
Video (USHV) and Hop-On (OTC: HPON) have partnered to launch the 
first-of-its-kind, disposable cell phone in connection with the DVD/home 
video release of "Jurassic Park III" on December 11. The limited edition 
introductory phone, a specially-designed Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone, 
employs the latest hands-free, voice-activated communications technology, 
and will be available only as an exclusive FREE offer via inserts in 
thousands of "Jurassic Park III" DVDs and videocassettes for a limited time.

Cutting-Edge Telecommunications Technology
The exclusive Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phones will offer 60 minutes of 
prepaid calling time without the requirement of a cellular service contract 
or monthly fee. Compact and lightweight in design as well as fully 
recyclable, the cell phones require only two buttons: CALL and END. Using 
mistake-proof, automated voice-recognition dialing, the cell phones include 
a hands-free earbud/microphone to provide safe and convenient 
communication. Once activated, the phones are supported by 24-hour operator 
assistance and last up to six months.

The limited edition Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone will also feature a 
branded "Jurassic Park" faceplate to enhance collectability. Hop-On plans 
to release a regular disposable cell phone in national retail outlets for 
$30 after the introductory promotion with "Jurassic Park III." The Jurassic 
Park Survival Cell Phone combines the latest cutting edge communications 
product with one of the year's biggest theatrical box-office successes in 
time to capitalize on heightened consumer awareness during the holiday 
shopping season surrounding the home video/DVD release.

The cell phone offer will be communicated via on-pack stickers on all DVD 
and VHS copies of "Jurassic Park III" as well as through in-store 
merchandisers. "Because a cell phone played such a crucial role in 
"Jurassic Park III," we were looking to find a unique telecommunications 
partner to help celebrate the film's release on DVD," said Ken Graffeo, 
senior vice president of marketing, Universal Studios Home Video. "Our 
partnership with Hop-On is ideal and we are thrilled to be bringing the 
next wave of cell phone technology to consumers."

"The Jurassic Park Survival Cell Phone is designed to give consumers easy 
access to help if they need it -- anytime, anywhere," said Peter Michaels, 
chairman and CEO, Hop-On. "As an entrepreneurial communications company we 
are extremely excited to be partnering with one of the most successful and 
dominant global media and communications organizations. Hop-On's phones 
have the potential to revolutionize the communications industry and this 
launch is an important step toward that goal."
