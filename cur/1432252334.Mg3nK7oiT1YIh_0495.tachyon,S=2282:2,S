But it's not trivial to roll your own 24/7 monitoring company with the ability 
to call in the cops.  If the monitoring company is compromised, you're 
\033653337357 anyway, but without them, all you have is one of those car 
alarms that everyone ignores.

The multi-layered approach is the way to go.  Your home-rolled layer probably 
wouldn't be able to call 911 for you, at least not without tipping your hand.  
Most places, the police require a formal agreement before they will respond 
to automated alarms, and some departments simply won't. But it could notify 
you of an invasion and archive the surveillance videos to a remote site.  At 
least you'd know you'd been compromised and could take appropriate steps.
