Unless you and the person with whom you are commmunicating publish
your public keys on a key server before any of the government action
in question takes place.

In that case, you wouldn't have to send your key to that person---they
can access it via the keyserver.  As to getting their key, it wouldn't
be hard to have that person post a signed message to a public list to
which you are subscribed, giving you demonstrable reason to download
his/her public key.
