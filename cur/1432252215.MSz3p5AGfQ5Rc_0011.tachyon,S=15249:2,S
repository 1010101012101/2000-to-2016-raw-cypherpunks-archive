Strikes me 12TH/sec is not actually very much computation?  
http://bitcoinwatch.com/ also gives network hashrate at 12.4 TH/sec.

But a single normally clocked (925Mhz) AMD 7970 based graphics card which
has 2048 cores is claimed to provide 555MH/sec.  

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison#ARM (ignore the
aggresively overclocked 7970s...  the one that counts has 925 in the clock
speed column!)

But that means the entire bitcoin network compute is only equivalent to 23
AMD 7970 GPUs?  That seems wrong by orders of magnitude, there are youtube
videos of private individuals with mining rigs in that range in their
garage.

(Somewhat amusing scale of raw compute being thrown via SHA256 hashcash at
the bitcoin core at this thing- still its arguably not wasted CPU because as
human endeavours go other forms of currencies have their costs too.  So a
p2p currency if it played out might save a lot.  Personally I lost a bundle
on major currency devaluation GBP, EUR, USD look at them against the CHF to
see how much you'all lost due to whatever human / political inefficiencies
you attribute currency devaluation on that scale to.  A stable mechanism for
value storage would be a rather useful instrument.)
