The state of Oregon uses vote-by-mail for their elections,
though I think there's an option for physical delivery if you want.
I'd be surprised if they require witnesses - if anything,
that encourages your spouse to look at how you voted.
I've never been required to have witnesses for voting with
absentee ballots in New Jersey or California.

Besides, in places like Chicago or Tammany-era New York City,
it'd be easy for the Party to obtain notaries to witness ballots.
	"OK, Mr. Jones, the stamp on your ballot, and here's the stamp
	on your bottle of whiskey.  Next, please!"
and optionally to put the correct party ballots in the correct box
and the incorrect party ballots in the round container.



				Thanks!
