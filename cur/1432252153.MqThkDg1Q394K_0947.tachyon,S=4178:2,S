Are you a bookseller taking the book on concession? Are you listing it as
'destroyed' and then taking it to a local bookstore to sell it? No? Didn't
think so. Did the book have a cover when you bought it? Your comparison is
moot, you are ignoring who actually owns the property, and arguing that
because on one non-similar case one can do one thing then by extension
that same freedom of action extends to all others.

That's nitwit Tim.
