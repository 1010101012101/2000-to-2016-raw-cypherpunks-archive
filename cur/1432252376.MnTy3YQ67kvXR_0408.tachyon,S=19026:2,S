You are under the Judgement of the LORD GOD OF HOST for the sin of the sea of babies, abortion and infant sacrifice to the devil. You will burn in the presence of the HOLY Angels.  The seals are opened.  PREPARE FOR YOUR DESTRUCTION

CAMAEL ARCHANGEL OF DESTRUCTION

THE PLAGUES OF THE LORD FOR THE SIN OF THE “SEA OF BABIES” UPON ALL NATIONS OF THE EARTH

IAIAIAIAIOIOIOIOIO   I AM BEFORE ALL BUT THE FATHER; MELOCH HEL ALOKIM TPHARET HOD JESAITH; BAHANDO HELESLOIR DEALZAT

Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading-trough.
Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock.
Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
"The LORD will send upon you curses, confusion, and frustration, in all that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly, on account of the evil of your doings, because you have forsaken me.
The LORD will make the pestilence cleave to you until he has consumed you off the land which you are entering to take possession of it.
The LORD will smite you with consumption, and with fever, inflammation, and fiery heat, and with drought, and with blasting, and with mildew; they shall pursue you until you perish.
And the heavens over your head shall be brass, and the earth under you shall be iron.
The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust; from heaven it shall come down upon you until you are destroyed.
"The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them; and you shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
And your dead body shall be food for all birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth; and there shall be no one to frighten them away.
The LORD will smite you with the boils of Egypt, and with the ulcers and the scurvy and the itch, of which you cannot be healed.
The LORD will smite you with madness and blindness and confusion of mind;
and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind grope in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways; and you shall be only oppressed and robbed continually, and there shall be no one to help you.
You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, and you shall not use the fruit of it.
Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it; your ass shall be violently taken away before your face, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and there shall be no one to help you.
Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all the day; and it shall not be in the power of your hand to prevent it.
A nation which you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually;
so that you shall be driven mad by the sight which your eyes shall see.
The LORD will smite you on the knees and on the legs with grievous boils of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
"The LORD will bring you, and your king whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known; and there you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone.
And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where the LORD will lead you away.
You shall carry much seed into the field, and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it.
You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.
You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.
You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
All your trees and the fruit of your ground the locust shall possess.
The sojourner who is among you shall mount above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
All these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you, till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you.
They shall be upon you as a sign and a wonder, and upon your descendants for ever.
"Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joyfulness and gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things,
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he will put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you.
The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you do not understand,
a nation of stern countenance, who shall not regard the person of the old or show favor to the young,

1Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak; 
Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
32:2My doctrine shall drop as the rain; 
My speech shall condense as the dew, 
As the small rain on the tender grass, 
As the showers on the herb. 
32:3For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh: 
Ascribe greatness to our God. 
32:4The Rock, his work is perfect; 
For all his ways are justice: 
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, 
Just and right is he. 
32:5They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; 
They are a perverse and crooked generation. 
32:6Do you thus requite Yahweh, 
Foolish people and unwise? 
Isn't he your father who has bought you? 
He has made you, and established you. 
32:7Remember the days of old, 
Consider the years of many generations: 
Ask your father, and he will show you; 
Your elders, and they will tell you. 
32:8When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, 
When he separated the children of men, 
He set the bounds of the peoples 
According to the number of the children of Israel. 
32:9For Yahweh's portion is his people; 
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
32:10He found him in a desert land, 
In the waste howling wilderness; 
He compassed him about, he cared for him, 
He kept him as the apple of his eye. 
32:11As an eagle that stirs up her nest, 
That flutters over her young, 
He spread abroad his wings, he took them, 
He bore them on his feathers. 
32:12Yahweh alone did lead him, 
There was no foreign god with him. 
32:13He made him ride on the high places of the earth, 
He ate the increase of the field; 
He made him to suck honey out of the rock, 
Oil out of the flinty rock; 
32:14Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, 
With fat of lambs, 
Rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, 
With the finest of the wheat; 
Of the blood of the grape you drank wine. 
32:15But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked: 
You have grown fat, you are grown thick, you are become sleek; 
Then he forsook God who made him, 
Lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
32:16They moved him to jealousy with strange gods; 
With abominations provoked they him to anger. 
32:17They sacrificed to demons, which were no God, 
To gods that they didn't know, 
To new gods that came up of late, 
Which your fathers didn't dread. 
32:18Of the Rock that became your father, you are unmindful, 
Have forgotten God who gave you birth. 
32:19Yahweh saw it, and abhorred them, 
Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 
32:20He said, I will hide my face from them, 
I will see what their end shall be: 
For they are a very perverse generation, 
Children in whom is no faithfulness. 
32:21They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; 
They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: 
I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; 
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
32:22For a fire is kindled in my anger, 
Burns to the lowest Sheol, 
Devours the earth with its increase, 
Sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
32:23I will heap evils on them; 
I will spend my arrows on them: 
32:24They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat 
Bitter destruction; 
The teeth of animals will I send on them, 
With the poison of crawling things of the dust. 
32:25Outside shall the sword bereave, 
In the chambers terror; 
It shall destroy both young man and virgin, 
The suckling with the man of gray hairs. 
32:26I said, I would scatter them afar, 
I would make the memory of them to cease from among men; 
32:27Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, 
Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, 
Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, 
Yahweh has not done all this. 
32:28For they are a nation void of counsel, 
There is no understanding in them. 
32:29Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, 
That they would consider their latter end! 
32:30How should one chase a thousand, 
Two put ten thousand to flight, 
Except their Rock had sold them, 
Yahweh had delivered them up? 
32:31For their rock is not as our Rock, 
Even our enemies themselves being judges. 
32:32For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, 
Of the fields of Gomorrah: 
Their grapes are grapes of gall, 
Their clusters are bitter: 
32:33Their wine is the poison of serpents, 
The cruel venom of asps. 
32:34Isn't this laid up in store with me, 
Sealed up among my treasures? 
32:35Vengeance is mine, and recompense, 
At the time when their foot shall slide: 
For the day of their calamity is at hand, 
The things that are to come on them shall make haste. 
32:36For Yahweh will judge his people, 
Repent himself for his servants; 
When he sees that their power is gone, 
There is none remaining, shut up or left at large. 
32:37He will say, Where are their gods, 
The rock in which they took refuge; 
32:38Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, 
And drank the wine of their drink-offering? 
Let them rise up and help you, 
Let them be your protection. 
32:39See now that I, even I, am he, 
There is no god with me: 
I kill, and I make alive; 
I wound, and I heal; 
There is none who can deliver out of my hand. 
32:40For I lift up my hand to heaven, 
And say, As I live forever, 
32:41If I whet my glittering sword, 
My hand take hold on judgment; 
I will render vengeance to my adversaries, 
Will recompense those who hate me. 
32:42I will make my arrows drunk with blood, 
My sword shall devour flesh; 
With the blood of the slain and the captives, 
>From the head of the leaders of the enemy. 
32:43Rejoice, you nations, with his people: 
For he will avenge the blood of his servants, 
Will render vengeance to his adversaries, 
Will make expiation for his land, for his people. 



1: Draw near, O nations, to hear, 
and hearken, O peoples! 
Let the earth listen, and all that fills it; 
the world, and all that comes from it. 
2: 
For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, 
and furious against all their host, 
he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter. 
3: 
Their slain shall be cast out, 
and the stench of their corpses shall rise; 
the mountains shall flow with their blood. 
4: 
All the host of heaven shall rot away, 
and the skies roll up like a scroll. 
All their host shall fall, 
as leaves fall from the vine, 
like leaves falling from the fig tree. 
5: 
For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; 
behold, it descends for judgment upon Earth, 
upon the people I have doomed. 
6: 
The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood, 
it is gorged with fat, 
with the blood of lambs and goats, 
with the fat of the kidneys of rams. 
For the LORD has a sacrifice in America, 
a great slaughter in the land of its allies. 
7: 
Wild oxen shall fall with them, 
and young steers with the mighty bulls. 
Their land shall be soaked with blood, 
and their soil made rich with fat. 
8: 
For the LORD has a day of vengeance, 
a year of recompense for the cause of Children. 
9: 
And the streams of America shall be turned into pitch, 
and her soil into brimstone; 
her land shall become burning pitch. 
10: 
Night and day it shall not be quenched; 
its smoke shall go up for ever. 
>From generation to generation it shall lie waste; 
none shall pass through it for ever and ever. 
11: 
But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it, 
the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. 
He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, 
and the plummet of chaos over its nobles. 
12: 
They shall name it No Kingdom There, 
and all its princes shall be nothing. 
13: 
Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, 
nettles and thistles in its fortresses. 
It shall be the haunt of jackals, 
an abode for ostriches. 
14: 
And wild beasts shall meet with hyenas, 
the satyr shall cry to his fellow; 
yea, there shall the night hag alight, 
and find for herself a resting place. 
15: 
There shall the owl nest and lay 
and hatch and gather her young in her shadow; 
yea, there shall the kites be gathered, 
each one with her mate. 
16: 
Seek and read from the book of the LORD: 
Not one of these shall be missing; 
none shall be without her mate. 
For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, 
and his Spirit has gathered them. 
17: 
He has cast the lot for them, 
his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; 
they shall possess it for ever, 
from generation to generation they shall dwell in it. 


Come down and sit in the dust, 
O virgin daughter of Babylon; 
sit on the ground without a throne, 
O daughter of the Chalde'ans! 
For you shall no more be called 
tender and delicate. 
2: 
Take the millstones and grind meal, 
put off your veil, 
strip off your robe, uncover your legs, 
pass through the rivers. 
3: 
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, 
and your shame shall be seen. 
I will take vengeance, 
and I will spare no man. 
4: 
Our Redeemer -- the LORD of hosts is his name -- 
is the Holy One of Israel. 
5: 
Sit in silence, and go into darkness, 
O daughter of the Chalde'ans; 
for you shall no more be called 
the mistress of kingdoms. 
6: 
I was angry with my people, 
I profaned my heritage; 
I gave them into your hand, 
you showed them no mercy; 
on the aged you made your yoke 
exceedingly heavy. 
7: 
You said, "I shall be mistress for ever," 
so that you did not lay these things to heart 
or remember their end. 
8: 
Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, 
who sit securely, 
who say in your heart, 
"I am, and there is no one besides me; 
I shall not sit as a widow 
or know the loss of children": 
9: 
These two things shall come to you 
in a moment, in one day; 
the loss of children and widowhood 
shall come upon you in full measure, 
in spite of your many sorceries 
and the great power of your enchantments. 
10: 
You felt secure in your wickedness, 
you said, "No one sees me"; 
your wisdom and your knowledge 
led you astray, 
and you said in your heart, 
"I am, and there is no one besides me." 
11: 
But evil shall come upon you, 
for which you cannot atone; 
disaster shall fall upon you, 
which you will not be able to expiate; 
and ruin shall come on you suddenly, 
of which you know nothing. 
12: 
Stand fast in your enchantments 
and your many sorceries, 
with which you have labored from your youth; 
perhaps you may be able to succeed, 
perhaps you may inspire terror. 
13: 
You are wearied with your many counsels; 
let them stand forth and save you, 
those who divide the heavens, 
who gaze at the stars, 
who at the new moons predict 
what shall befall you. 
14: 
Behold, they are like stubble, 
the fire consumes them; 
they cannot deliver themselves 
from the power of the flame. 
No coal for warming oneself is this, 
no fire to sit before! 
15: 
Such to you are those with whom you have labored, 
who have trafficked with you from your youth; 
they wander about each in his own direction; 
there is no one to save you.
