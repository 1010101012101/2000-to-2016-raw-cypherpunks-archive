Why such a suspicious attitide?  :o)

This loops back to my own initial interpretation of the Snowden
affair as a likely deception operation.  Since then my opinion of
that interpretation has been all over the map in response to new
information, but I have never had reason to doubt that the Snowden
leaks are controlled for the benefit of the U.S. National
Interest.  (Material from the second and/or third NSA leakers,
believed to be stationed in Germany, maybe not quite so much.)

Some of my speculations here are obsolete, but the general concept
that the Snowden Saga is not what it appears to be and is strongly
influenced and/or controlled by elements of the NatSec community
appears to stand up well.  I believe it's very possible that
Snowden never obtained access to the useful and relevant technical
documents that seem to be missing from his dump:
