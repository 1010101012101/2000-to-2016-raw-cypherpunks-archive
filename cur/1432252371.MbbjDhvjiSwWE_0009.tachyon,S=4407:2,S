No, that's just not true of DNSsec.  DNSsec doesn't depend on the 
integrity of the connection to your DNS server; rather, the RRsets are 
digitally signed.  In other words, it works a lot like certificates, 
with a trust chain going back to a magic root key.  I'm not saying that 
there can't be problems with that model, but compromised DNS servers 
(and poisoned DNS caches) are among the major threat models it was 
designed to deal with.  If nothing else, the existence of caching DNS 
servers, which are not authoritative for the information they hand out, 
makes a transmission-based solution pretty useless.
