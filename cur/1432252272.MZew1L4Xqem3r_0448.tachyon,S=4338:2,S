No quibbling, just explaining what the common law is.  Anyone who wants to
believe that the Constitution is precedent court ruling recognized under the
common law, is welcome to do so.  Trouble is, it just ain't so.  You can
woulda-coulda-shoulda all day long, but that won't change the facts.  You
can spend three years in law school and learn something, read a book or two
about the origins Anglo-American jurisprudence or live in darkness.  The
choice is yours.
