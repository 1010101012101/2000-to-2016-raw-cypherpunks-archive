There was a cypherpunks discussion on "chaffing and winnowing without
overhead" archived at 
http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.98.05.11-98.05.17/msg00087.html

You can also find a paper by Bellare and Boldyreva "On The Security of
Chaffing and Winnowing"
http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/cw.ps

and the "Chaffinch" system which extends the idea to deal with
forced disclosure of keys (RIP act):

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/Chaffinch.html

I seem to recall a paper with a title along the lines of "A Comment on
Chaffing and Winnowing" in either Financial Cryptography or maybe
Selected Areas in Cryptography, but I can't find it right now.
