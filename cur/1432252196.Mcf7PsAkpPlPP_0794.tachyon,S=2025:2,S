You're gonna love this one: You can't have "terrorism" without state sponsors.

We take out (by whatever means at hand...) state sponsors of terrorism,
and, hey, presto, no terrorism. Iraq. Syria. Iran. Libya. Doesn't look so

Americans -- actually westerners in general -- may win ugly, Peter, but, so
far, they win.

Cheers,
