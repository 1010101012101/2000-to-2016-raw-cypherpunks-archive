How can it possibly be treason if there was no declaration of war?

Furthermore, since when is mere travel treason?  If you  could show that 
he had actually participated in war against the U.S. -- not just thought 
about it, not just taken leg one of a trip that could eventually get him 
to a location where he would have an opportunity to do so (if he didn't 
change his mind first) -- then there could be a case.
