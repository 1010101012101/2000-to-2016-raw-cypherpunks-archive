Dot gov subscribers have been around since the beginning.
Some wear dual hats, some switch back and forth. Some use
nyms, some use personal mail, some are open, some are
hidden. This is how crypto has always worked, no other way
to do it. Cannot be one-sided, cannot be perfect, snake oil
as common as trustworthy, deception essential, honesty
a sure sign of dishonesty. RTFM, RTF archives, filled with
tips about using mail lists for FUD. Without FUD no need
for crypto. Gov FUD is oxymoronic which is why crypto
is basic to any regime.

70 people is about what the USG needs for comsec. 10 capable
ones, 60 to pad the payroll and please Congressional earmarkers.
75,000 is shale-fracked snakeoil. Ft Meade better used for
a Swedish massage spa.
