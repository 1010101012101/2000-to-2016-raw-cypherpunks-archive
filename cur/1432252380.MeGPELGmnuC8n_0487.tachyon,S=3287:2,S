Sure. Don't go for the hard-headed containment structure,
knock out the soft-shelled control facility which regulates
cooling pumps. The reactor will do the rest just as effectively
as planes weakened the towers so they would self-destruct.

It is truely strange that the Pentagon was hit rather than
the soft-shells downtown. Probably a feint or a blunder
by a pilot nearly insane.

Nuclear power plants are likely a feint as well, with so
many soft-shells ready to eat -- refineries, airports,
seaports, suspension bridges, most domestic military
bases, universities, national labs, mega-malls, on and
on, look around you where all the gov-terrified people 
bunch for safety in numbers.

The experts here predict a mid-West target just to freak
the true interior homeland which everyone believes they
can retreat to. Draw a half dozen vectors connecting
the publicized targets and see where they intersect.
That point won't be far from Cheyenne Mountain, not the
hardened bunker but its vulnerable support system -- 
most of which remains identifiable on the Net because 
it is not military or government, you know, the collaterals.
