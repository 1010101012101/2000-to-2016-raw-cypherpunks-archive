Just as the heavy handed Cold war led to incredible mass 
murder,torture,corruption and repression so goes the latest war on a 
tactic,this time,not even an ideology.
The provision on "classified activities" is especially troubling because it 
permits "projects not otherwise authorized by law," in other words, covert 
actions.
This latest round of military aid has made one thing clear: the U.S. 
military has found a new excuse to extend its reach around the globe, 
arming regimes that had previously been blacklisted for human rights 
abuses, weapons proliferation, or brutal conflict.
