IMHO they will kick the bucket as soon as google
stop pouring money in them.

Back to the roots?

According to quote:
"Roots are the branches down in the earth. Branches are roots in the air
-- Stray Birds".

If you want the roots, consider spamming Brendan Eich,
he has ideas about "expanding JS", which I won't comment.

If you ask me, starting from zero is better.

Likely, this will require nontrivial amounts of money.
