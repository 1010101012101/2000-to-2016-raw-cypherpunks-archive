Frank Sudia's bio says that he is a programmer, a lawyer, a public policy 
analyst, and a co-founder of the CertCo encryption company, formerly part 
of Bankers Trust. He is also the creator of the "Bankers Trust Corporate 
Key Escrow System."

His paper (see the link below)  is a suggestion for a route for Congress to 
take if they "decided to require all encryption systems to be readable by 
authorized legal authorities."

Subject:  Encryption and the Restoration of National Sovereignty

Dear Policy Professional,

In response to the Attack on America, I have drawn upon my extensive work in
secure banking systems, key escrow systems, and patent licensing to bring
you the following white paper (about 10 pages of text).

Frank W. Sudia, JD, "Encryption and the Restoration of National Sovereignty:
Proposal for an Escrow Patent Pool Corporation," September 14, 2001.

     http://www.sudialab.com/sov-eppc.htm.

While at Bankers Trust (1991-98) I designed one of the largest encryption
systems in the world, the Global Trust Organization.  Chartered in 1999 as
Identrus LLC (www.identrus.com) it now includes 50 of the world's largest
banks.

In my view, encryption policy options are poorly understood.  The power of
government to protect the nation should not be in doubt, yet the debate has
been skewed by the claims of opponents that such systems will not or cannot
work.

In reality, it would be straightforward to build a system that is much more
secure than the current banking system.  However, this has not been done,
and cannot be done, because complex patent problems must be resolved.

Before anything serious and believable can ever be built, even on a test
basis, we must aggregate the required patents into product pools, using
government money and eminent domain powers, if necessary.  And we must fund
the development of prototypes.  Only after viability has been established
can the commercial sector move forward with products that are highly secure
and credible.

For further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.  If you are a
contact or friend of mine, I would appreciate comments, which will be
acknowledged in any future version.

Regards,
Frank Sudia
