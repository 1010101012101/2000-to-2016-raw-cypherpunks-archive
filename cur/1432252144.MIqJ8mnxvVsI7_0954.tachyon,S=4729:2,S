I consider Tahoe-LAFS to be the (current) best solution for this. It
provides a distributed data store, which can be used for hosting (with
a Javascript "web server"). I know Tahoe works with Tor via SOCKS but
I don't personally know of any active networks. Tahoe has been used in
I2P as a distributed data store for a long time, and there are several
"deepsites" hosted in it. We are actively working to make Tahoe
integrate better with Tor/I2P.

Zooko recently posted a *much* better summary of this:
