Your story is inconsistent.  You tell us Saddam was a
capitalistic CIA agent -- so therefore we should not let the
Iraqis hang him. Huh?

Saddam also was and is socialist, anti western, anti american,
seized stuff without compensation etc, which is presumably why
you are backing him today -- and which makes the tale that he
was a CIA "creation" unbelievable.

Your "history" comes for the most part from notorious KGB
agents, for example John Pilger.

>From time to time old archives of the CIA are opened, and
usually conspicuously fail to confirm these tales -- these
tales all being variants of one single tale -- that wherever
Soviet aligned tyrants had trouble with each other or with
those they subjugated, it was all the CIA's doing.

> I also don't understand your contempt of the ICC Hague

Consider the trial of Milosevic.  Either the Hague is
deliberately trying to get him off, or they are idiots.  Most
likely idiots.

Plus if the Hague should ever get to exercise real power,
which its present performance makes unlikely, we would have a
world government, which would probably decide the entire
American population to be war criminals and send everyone to
the camps.
