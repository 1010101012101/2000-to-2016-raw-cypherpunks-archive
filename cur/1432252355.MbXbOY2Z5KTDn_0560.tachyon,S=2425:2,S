I can understand the argument that the parts of the shuttle are
government property, so their "conversion" to private property
may be criminal.

But astronauts are not government property. So if, let's say, a 
charred head falls into my backyard, then it would be legal for me
to put it into a jar with denaturate alcohol, as a souvenir, right?
