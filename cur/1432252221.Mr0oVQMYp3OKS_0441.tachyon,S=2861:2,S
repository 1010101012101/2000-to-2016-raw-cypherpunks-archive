I saw this on BBC news.  It took a very sophisticated lab two years work to
produce polio.  They thought they might be able to do smallpox given about 20
years work.  They even managed to slip in an Internet reference in the story. 

I guess "We synthesised polio from RNA" just isn't newsworthy enough on its
own.
