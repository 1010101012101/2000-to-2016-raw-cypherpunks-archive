These problems with binary trust in hierarchical models ("trust this 
cert because the highest node said to trust it") have been dealt with 
many, many times.

Cf. my own articles on probabalistic networks, belief networks, and 
Dempster-Shafer measures of belief.

I don't even see how thoughtful people can continue to believe this 
is still a debatable issue. Those pushing X.509 and similar 
hierarchical systems have their own statist axes to grind...and they 
like the commission they get off of each of the King's certs.
