A guy was busted by using DNA from an envelope he licked
in response to a "sting" letter from the police (but not appearing so).

A guy was caught because his *son's* DNA was on file.

Go dump-diving in places where his trash is dumped.  And at
his relatives houses.  Befriend/employ someone where he/they get
their bloodwork done.  Cleaning people who dust where he sits.
His barber.  His launderer.

Wonder how they got their dentalcharts.

They'll have to show us the beef if they want to be believed.
Of course, Bush and Rummy holding their heads on sticks
will have to be edited from US markets...

The first rule of missile fighting: the one who brings the full-auto
rifle loses.
