Hey, Declan, in your free time, find out about the encryption...

#    
#    DUDLEY, Mass. (AP)  Nancy Surprise left her 7-year-old son alone 
#    in the car one day while she ran into the post office, and 
#    returned to find a 280-pound man sitting on top of the boy.
#    
#    But when the man was hauled into court, Surprise says, prosecutors 
#    insisted the best way to handle the case would be to make him 
#    go far, far away.
#    
#    Prosecutors cut a deal in 1991 with the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah: 
#    no jail time, two years of probation, and he must keep his promise 
#    to move to Montana and live with his mother. Bar-Jonah headed 
#    west.
#
#    And it is there that he stands accused of crimes far more 
#    horrifying: He is suspected of butchering a little boy and
#    serving the remains in dishes cooked up for his Montana
#    neighbors.

#    
#    In 1999, Bar-Jonah was arrested outside a Great Falls, Mont., 
#    elementary school, again dressed as a policeman. He was carrying 
#    a stun gun and pepper spray.
#    
#    A search of his house yielded thousands of photographs of boys. 
#    Investigators also found encrypted writings, which the FBI 
#    decoded, about "little boy stew" and "lunch is served on the 
#    patio with roasted child," prosecutors said. Also found was a 
#    list of boys from Massachusetts and Great Falls.
