Well, back in the day, I thought AP way cool. But some years later, more
conscious of increasing concentration of wealth, I doubt that it would
improve on status quo. Sure, maybe crowd-funding would take down some
assholes. But serious assholes are seriously hard to kill. Also, it
would provide another mechanism for governments to covertly kill their
enemies.

I'm reminded of Kim's Shit Slaughter Squad in Burroughs' _Place of Dead
Roads_ about killing the assholes.

Hard problem.
