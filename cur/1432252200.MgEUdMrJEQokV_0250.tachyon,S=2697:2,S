Actually it's a perfect comparison. Anyone can put stuff on your front
porch. They can't take it away or read it, that is using personal property
without permission. Hence, people have a -right- to send you mail. They
don't have a right to read your mail without permission.

Sorry, your front porch isn't considerd 'trespassable' unless -you- take
explicit and particular steps.

Then you must put up a sign, does your mailbox have such a sign?

In fact your position backs up mine that the current trespass and
harassment laws are sufficient to handle this problem.

In other words, you shot yourself in your own foot with regard to 'new'
law. We don't need it. What we need is the courts to recognize that if we
tell somebody to stay away and they don't then an actionable event has
taken place.

So, we actually agree but you don't see it, yet.
