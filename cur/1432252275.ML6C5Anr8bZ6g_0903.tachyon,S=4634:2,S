Ah Detweiler...  I mention him to Internet newbies (anyone online after 
1994) once in a while to blank stares.  What an implosion. But I missed 
the episode below, so thanks for that!

We really need an FAQ on varieties of madness:

Detweiler
Tea Party Saturate
GOPping mad
Faux News Skewed Reality
Tin Foiler
Crystal Crank
Drug Addled Nonsensical
NSA Paranoid (wait, that's just reality now)
Zion refugee
Microsoftie

(Apologies for the cross-post.)
