  Many of you may remember Stuart Baker from the crypto export policy
  wars. I still remember him telling me in a conversation after a New
  York Bar Association debate on the subject that the Internet would
  never be of any economic importance. Anyway, without further comment:

  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050713-8.html

     The President intends to nominate Stewart A. Baker, of Virginia, to be
     an Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Policy). Mr. Baker is
     currently a Partner with Steptoe & Johnson, LLP in Washington, D.C. He
     previously served as General Counsel for the Commission on the
     Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of
     Mass Destruction. Prior to that, Mr. Baker served as General Counsel
     for the National Security Agency. Earlier in his career, he was a law
     clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens, U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Baker
     received his bachelor's degree from Brown University and his J.D. from
     the University of California, Los Angeles.
