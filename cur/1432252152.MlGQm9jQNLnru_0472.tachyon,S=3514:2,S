Those who want Saddam released, for the most part also 
rationalize 9/11

He may not be related to the terrorists, but his fans are 
related to the terrorists.

The title of this thread is "I am anti war, you stupid evil 
scum are pro saddam."

I do not support the invasion.   I am not making up pretenses 
for the invasion.

This is war.  Rule of law does not apply.  Rules of war do 
apply.  And rules of war say that the US army can not only give 
Saddam a dental examination, it can nail Saddam's head to a 
post in Baghdad with a nine inch nail, because he was captured 
out of uniform, administering the war effort while hiding 
amongst civilians.

Handing him to the ICC is not fine, because the ICC is not 
going to execute him, and because the ICC is farcically 
incompetent, and because the ICC is dominated by the same 
tyrants who dominate the UN human rights commission, who might 
well choose to let him off.

When I see how many people want to get him off, I more and more 
think the the USG needs to kill him quickly.  The longer he 
lives, the greater the likelyhood that his international pals 
will pull him out of trouble, and eventually return him to 
power.

The Nuremberg trials were held in Germany by the victors.  Why 
this big desire to do something different this time around?   I 
don't hear anyone except the usual Nazis whining that Nuremberg 
was illegitimate or unfair.
