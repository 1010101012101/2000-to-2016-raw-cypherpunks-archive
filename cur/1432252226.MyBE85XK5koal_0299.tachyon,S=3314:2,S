Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age
Releases Third Report
"Mobilizing Information to Prevent Terrorism: Accelerating
Development of a Trusted
Information Sharing Environment"
July 13, 2006
The Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the
Information Age today released its third report with recommendations
on how to reconcile national security needs with civil liberties
requirements. The report offers a new "authorized use" standard for
government handling of legally collected information that bases
authorization to view information on how the information is going to
be used, rather than on the nationality of the subject or the
location of collection. The report also proposes a new risk
management approach to sharing classified information that balances
the risk of leaks of classified information with the security risk
that can come from failing to share information with those who need
it to understand the threats to national security. Further, the
report identifies examples of technology that can be used effectively
to provide appropriate oversight and accountability.
