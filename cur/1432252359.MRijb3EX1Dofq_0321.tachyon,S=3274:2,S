It's *NOT* anonymizing anything. DO NOT USE THIS IN PLACE OF AN ANONIMIZER!!!
All it does is log where you're going.  It doesn't actually proxy anything. It simply opens up two frames, one that says "You are
visiting a site outside of Net@ddress. Please close this browser to return to Net@ddress." and instructs your browser to go to
whatever embedded url you have. In this case Amazon.com.

Should you hover your mouse over the links in Amazon you won't see the netaddress.com url pop up. You'll see Amazon urls.

So while, yes, it does spy on what urls you visit, it does *NOT* proxy them, so it offers no protection!!!
