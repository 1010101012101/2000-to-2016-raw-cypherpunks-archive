Reading the article it looks more like the kind of news that's playing a lot these days: the story of 'something is not yet being done', nobody is claiming to be doing it, but it could be done and the majority of people would support it.  A kind of "no news is news" story.

At the same time, if Baker, attorney with Steptoe (god what a perfect name!), were aware of this and leaked it to the press based on work he is doing with the FBI, wouldn't he be subject to imprisonment or at least civil and professional penalties for violation of attorney-client confidentiality?  Unless the FBI wants it leaked.  And why?  To gauge reaction perhaps.  To tell the frogs the heat's going to be turned up a notch?

But it also could be Baker trying to keep warm in the sunshine of publicity by having something to say.  At the same time spouting this information would be a most egregious violation of at least SOMEthing.

"Curiouser and curiouser," said Alice!
