this is an excellent idea.  i've played with the old WRT54G's a little
bit and it is certainly an amenable piece of equipment for this kind
of tweaking.  i've had problems trying to get too much on a single
unit as the flash space restrictions are tight but there is still
enough space to support a decent set of services (like openvpn and tor
as you mention).

this is the only other trouble i've had with them: the crypto bits
tend to get sluggish, esp. when negotiating EDH or generating keys.
(fortunately this isn't needed all too frequently)

i haven't looked at the GS but if they support WPA2 they should also
support AES; it would be nice if this AES engine could be used for
general offload in addition to WPA2 traffic :)

i'm going to have to get one to tinker with...
