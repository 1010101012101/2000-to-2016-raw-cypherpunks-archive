You are confusing todays Germany with the communist pre-1989 Eastern
Germany, two *very* different things (I thought the British had better
knowledge of the "Olde Europe" than the fellow Americans do?)

As to the rest, always look at who published the "facts". It's the same
sources that claimed the Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. It's
unfortunate that most people fall for this kind of manipulative
misinformation.

Cheers,
Dan
