Not surprisingly, the mad cow scare has gone underground and spawned a fan 
club that professes to live on the edge. Club members usually wear black, 
go to all-night clubs in Greenwich Village, and demonstrate courage by 
doing a line of cocaine. The new fad is a line of spine that involves 
inhaling through the nostrils a line of pulverized, powdered spine 
ostensibly from a really mad-cow cow. So pervasive is this practice that 
New York health officials have launched a television campaign called "This 
Is Your Brain On Cow," showing hapless young men and women braying at the moon.

In a less dramatic manner some restaurants are simply adding a note of 
intrigue to expensive, bland menus. For example in Japan blowfish is 
considered a delicacy. However, it must be cooked properly or the consumer 
could die a very painful death.

A similar practice is currently the rage in England where enterprising, 
risk-taking upper-class families actually seek out suspect meat for the 
Sunday roast claiming their pedigree will protect them.
