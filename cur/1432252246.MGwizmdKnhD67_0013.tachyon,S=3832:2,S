What about adding link padding?  Can you say something about why
this doesn't help, or costs too much?

Without it, someone monitoring your system can see which ZKS node you are
talking to.  If they then monitor that node they can see that whenever
you send an incoming message, there comes an outgoing message, so they
can see the next node you are talking to, and so on.

With link padding, they couldn't do this.  They'd have to interrupt
your data stream and then monitor *all* the outgoing traffic from *all*
the ZKS nodes and see which one got interrupted.  This sounds like a
much more expensive attack.  It is an active attack as well, while the
previous one is passive and could be done by a Carnivore system.
