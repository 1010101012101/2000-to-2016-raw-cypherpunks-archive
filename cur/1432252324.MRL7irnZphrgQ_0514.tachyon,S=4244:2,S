First, this is not how I satirize uneducated--or even 
educated--blacks. I didn't use any ebonics code words, nor did I 
mention niggaz, crack hoes, or welfare entitlements.

Rasha sounds like the typical illiterate student who has to take 
remedial English upon her arrival at Beaver College. I had a roommate 
in college who was one of these types, having to take the equivalent 
of "English for Dummies." He couldn't spell, he couldn't construct a 
sentence, and he couldn't read worth a damn.

And that was 29 years ago. At a UC campus. I expect that standards 
have declined even further since then, especially as college has now 
become just an extension of high school. In fact, I expect that a lot 
of places like Beaver College, Lower Ohio River Valley State College, 
and Yankton Practical University are all being swamped by illiterate 
and innumerate students who barely graduated from their 
already-abysmal high schools.

When a university education is an entitlement, gud stuends like Rasha 
are the result.
