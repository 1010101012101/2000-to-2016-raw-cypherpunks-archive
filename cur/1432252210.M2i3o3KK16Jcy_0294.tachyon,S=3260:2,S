Google: intelligence test lights button

http://www.forbes.com/asap/1998/1130/281_print.html is the first result.
This article is pretty much against the concept of intelligence testing.

According to that article, the device is called "Jensen's button box".
That may not be correct, as a google search for "jensen's button box"
(quoted to filter out obvious false hits) yielded only that article.
