This is bad.  But damage control is good.

If I recall, there were only 16 senators who voted against the
CDA, and most of them were in other ways broken (e.g. Ted K.).

Luckily these things keep getting tossed by the courts before the
first assault team can be assembled.

On the other hand, he has been a strong (as it gets) voice for
things such as encryption.


> also supports the removal of separation of church  and state,

Your separation of church and state is imaginary.  The 1st
Amendment states:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

In two of the three anti-Ashcroft points listed on your website,
school vouchers and social service privitization/contracting, the
claim is silly; the ultimate recipients of funds may be
religious, but that occurs either by private choice or by judging
a religious organization by the same criteria as any other and
ignoring its theo-aspects.  Religion neutral.

Courtside, e.g.: Witters v. Washington D.S.B. or Zobrest v.
Catalina F.S.D., etc.

The third point is Ashcroft's support of a measure that would
allow individual students to, of their own choice, volition, and
organizing pray in school (or before a school football game?).

I can't understand how the courts can accept the gov't compelling
students to attend gov't educational installations for most of
the day for the first xx-years of their life by force of law, and
order them by the same to ignore the Great Pumpkin and stop that
free-exercise, without violating #1.

Go Ashcroft.

The chance of getting John Lott nominated is pretty slim; roll
the dice again and we'll probably end up with the senior Senator
from Utah.

I've become resigned to speaking for my own right to bear arms,
symbolizing it would be good too.
