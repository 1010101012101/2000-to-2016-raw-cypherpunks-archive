Fine, I'll take on your arguement.

Humans want private property because of the kind of creatures that we
are.  We want homes, not just for shelter but as an extension of our
identities.  This is why people decorate their homes.  

Decorations don't serve as something to prevent exposure to extreme
weather.  Nor do they provide food, food storage, food preparation, or a
place to sleep.  They provide entertainment - which we own.

We own appliances not for their decorative abilities - though you could if
you wanted to - i.e. chrome retro toasters and such, but for their ability
to help us store/prepare our food, or keep our clothes clean.

We own radio's, TV's VCR's, DVD players, stereos, etc. because they
entertain us when we are bored.

These things are all property.  Few people in modern countries would give
these items up to live in a tent.

But say you do live in a tent, at that point, the tent is your property
and is of immense value as are clothes and tools - they help your
survival.  Would you give them up?  Only if you didn't need them (for
instance you might have had spares.)

Land also serves as a property - there are many other creatures who are
territorial and also view the places of their shelters as their property.
Birds build nests, etc... cats (large and small) as well as dogs and other
canines mark their territory.  This is something that is instinctual and
with it comes the concept of "This is mine, I will protect it to keep
it" and so on.  

If you're going to try and argue against property ownership, try taking a
t-bone from the mouth of a big dog.  Also for example, my dad's dog likes
to play property games too.  If I shake a plastic bag or a piece of paper
around, he'll come over a grab it and hold on to it.  He won't let go of
it until I let go of it.  He let's it drop to the floor - if I try to take
it off the floor, he puts his paw on it, and if I continue, he'll bite to
protect it.  Dogs understand property.  So do cats.  Ever have a cat rub
it's head on you?  It's not showing affection, it's just marking you as
it's property.


All of this predates laws, governments and even modern humans.  Property
becomes an extension or a tool of the individual.  Birds nests for
example, and Bowers which don't serve as a shelter - but more as art
intended to attract female bower birds for mating, etc.


Once you start from there, private property makes sense, and is no longer
in question - except if you're a Marxist/communist which goes against this
ingrained relationship to property and therefore is doomed to fail.

Private ownership of land is no different.  Some peoples don't have this
concept, they are nomads, but like it or not, they too must live off the
land.  Afer all, their either hunt or plant vegetation or both.  For the
time, the land is under their care.  They may move on frequently and not
attach themselves to it, but there is always a camp, or a caravan or
something that is property.


Now, the original arguement was about smoking and being up or downwind
from someone's cigarette.  It was on the street - something which is
considered non-private property or the commons.   

Being exposed forcibly to second hand smoke was the gripe, and banishment
of the act of exposing others to second hand smoke by the law in places
such as Pubs and restaurants was the core of the arguement.

At some point, Harmon chimed in with the idiotic idea that all smoking
should be banned on public streets because he hates walking behind someone
who is smoking.  But this is an issue of the commons.

One is free to simply be elsewhere. Another street, another side of the
street, another city, or even one's property.  One is not forced to
breathe another's exhaust.  While on the street, it's not your property,
and hence you can't declare that the guy infront of you must stop smoking
because he's violating your property rights so long as you can move out of
the way of that smoke.  You're also welcome to wear gas masks or whatever
(let's ignore the fact that the cops will think you a suspect for
something for the sake of the arguement.)

Point is that street, and that air is not your property, it's shared
property - and hence not subject to your whims, likes and distates, but
upto the community to decide its usage.  If a large enough population who
uses said street wishes to smoke there, then the whims of a small minority
of who are offended by second hand smoke should not force the rules to
be changed.


As to why some people get red faced when private property gets mentioned,
it's very simple: the ones mentioning it are usually the ones interested
in taking it away (read theft.)  

For example: communists, socialists, fascists, dictators and totalitarians
in every form, cultists, and mobsters.  Some may believe in thir professed
(and flawed) ideals, but in the end, they are governed by greed or are
making the way for those who are governed by greed to steal said private
property.  

Especially when they claim such gems as private ownership of imovable
items such as land or what's built on them is senseless.  Tell that to
countries, states, cities, neighborhoods and so forth.


It's after all, not just about trying to live a better life.  It's true
that trying to live a better life is a huge goal.  Hence, the grass is
always greener on the other side.  But it's mainly about property, not
everyone gets the concept - until they actually live in a commune (or
under a totalitarian regime) and find out first hand why it doesn't work.
