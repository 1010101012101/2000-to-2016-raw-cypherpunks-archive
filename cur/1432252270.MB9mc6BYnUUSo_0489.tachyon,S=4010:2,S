Oh dear. QM does rule out internal states.

I didn't think I would have to explain why I capitalised "Bell", but perhaps
it was a bit too subtle. Google "Bell" and "inequalities", and go from
there. 

The uncertainty principle was generally considered to rule out internal
states long before Bell, though. Since around 1930, I think. Whether QM/the
uncertainty principle is wrong is a different question.
