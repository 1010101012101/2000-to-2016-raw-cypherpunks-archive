It's normal, almost all Russian procurements are like this. Also, it can
be only companies that have licenses for access to classified
information and for producing wiretapping devices, I'm not sure it can
be citizens. Probably it will be some companies like MFI Soft or Norsi
Trans who already produce devices Russian mass-surveillance program SORM.

There is something more about that companies

Not very likely. I don't think break Tor costs just $111,500. It seems
more like report on existing weaknesses.

Also, Russian journalists found some more interesting procurements
published same day by same agency, including tender for trojan (
