The whole point of an autoclave is that the superheated steam and
condesing superheated water drops transfer heat to the target faster
than simple hot air at 1 atm. 

Putting the material to be sterilized in a waterproof container defeats
this goal. Putting it in a pressure tight container such as a canning
jar is doubley futile - either the superheated steam and water won't
get to the material to be sterilized, or the container will fail 
catastrophically.

Autoclaving ain't for delicate materials. Irradiation would be a 
better bet. Anthrax spores are (so I've heard) pretty sensitive to 
UV, so ionizing radiation may not be neccesary.
