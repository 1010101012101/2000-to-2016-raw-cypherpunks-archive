Actually, it was WfWG 3.11, to be precise. I only had Windows 3.1, and
lusted after the full windows for worgroups edition...

I did not know about Linux back then - I had actually heard about gcc
and tried to download it on an old loaner PC running DOS that I had at
the time, but I was getting only 1200baud! After 12 hours, reading
enough to realise I'd be doing a lot of swapping just to use it, I
figured I would wait until after upgrading to one of the new beaut
24/32kbps spangled modems and a better PC.

A few years later someone I was working with brought in a slackware full
CD set, and I was pleasantly amazed. Memory is not the best so there are
probably other events in between.
