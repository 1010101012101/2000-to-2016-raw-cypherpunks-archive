There is no reason to build a house on sand.

There is no fruitful discussion to be had when the premise is patently false.

Just because the USA invented their tyrannous "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act", for which they perversely coined the euphemistic term "Patriot Act" and there fore can not be trusted anymore for hosting anything there, why should the Americans be replaced?!?!?

You seem upset at this.  Why?

Instead of some kooky conspiracy theory that ESF could be tortured or pressured to weaken pfSense, is this the *real* issue you have?

You seem upset that ESF controls the project.  Why?

You have provided no explanation (other than “rubber hoses”) for what form that “pressure” would take.

“The community” doesn’t own the copyright on the code, nor the trademarks to the names used.  Those belong to ESF.

Further, you’ve hypothesized about a ‘threat’ without providing any factual basis for same.  The term for this form of argument is “conspiracy theory”.

Since pfSense is open source (specifically, the BSD license), “the community” (or rather “a community”) could take the decision to fork the code and create their own solution.  It’s been attempted a couple times, but none of these have flourished.  While I don’t encourage forks (it’s typically not good for either project), occasionally they work out (at least for a while), I don’t go out of my way to inhibit those who wish to fork.

However, in any case, such a community would be prohibited from naming the result “pfSense”.

You greatly inflate my ownership interest here.

Not as strange as someone randomly showing up one day, hiding under a pseudonym, having never posted to a pfSense list before, making accusations.   You started throwing accusations, and yes, I got hostile.

Mostly I got hostile because your accusations are baseless, and despite my challenge, you refuse to drop it.  Since your activities are not furthering the project (find bugs, or at least make proposals), you’re wasting everyone’s time.   (I’d quote Spock here, but…)

Goodness man, you don’t even understand what happened with Lavabit, or why the situation would be different if a three letter agency were to show up on the doorstep one morning and demand that we weaken the project.   

Despite my challenges (“name the law that they would use”), you refuse to respond, instead ducking for cover in your empty, baseless accusations that “it might happen”.

Specifically, Lavabit ran afoul of the Stored Communications Act (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act), "a law that addresses voluntary and compelled disclosure of "stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records" held by third-party internet service providers (ISPs)."

ESF is not an ISP.  The SCA does not apply.

CALEA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act) obliges telecommunications companies to make it possible for law enforcement agencies to tap any phone conversations carried out over its networks, as well as making call detail records available. Common carriers, facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service – all three types of entities are defined to be “telecommunications carriers” and must meet the requirements of CALEA.

Since ESF is not a “telecommunications carrier”, CALEA does not apply to your proposed “FBI/NSA on the doorstep” scenario.

Even the various provisions of the PATRIOT act of 2001 (and it’s follow-ons) do not apply.  The most abusive of these, the so called “NSLs” are really a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals, and an accompanying "gag order".    Since pfSense has no reason to store any records, there is nothing to hand over.   You could *perhaps* make the case that the config backup service could be attacked this way, but it was specifically designed such that ESF (or before January, BSDP) doesn’t have access to the plaintext configuration.   It is encrypted by the remote user, and we store the result.  We don’t know the keys.

Thus, my challenge stands.  You have yet to offer ANY legal authority under which the NSA (or any other agency of the US government) could demand that ESF make changes to pfSense.

Some here in the “community” seem upset that I’ve been so abrasive with you.   If you had an actual argument that made sense, you and they would see a different side (“Oh, you’re right.  We should find a way to close that loophole.”)  Instead, you stood on your accusations, despite any factual basis.  Your "Culture of fear” argument was roughly equivalent to the meme of a couple years ago:

"Did Glenn Beck Rape And Murder A Young Girl In 1990?”

This hoax began as a parody of public perception of Glenn Beck’s over-the-top interview antics on his self-titled television show Glenn Beck, wherein he frequently asks his guests to disprove highly speculative and often outrageous assertions.

(Just like you did.)

About.com published an article titled “Internet Hoax Says Glenn Beck Raped, Murdered Young Girl in 1990”, which called the hoax a textbook example of “…how to construct Internet smear campaigns…”  (http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/2009/09/03/internet-hoax-says-glenn-beck-raped-murdered-young-girl-in-1990.htm)

So yes, I went after you, because the correct response here is to not let the attempt at a smear campaign stand.   People love to take silence as assent.   Placating you would have been a mistake of the first order.

In the past, I’ve stood up to AT&T.  It took a decade, and was both expensive and exhausting.  I won.  Fnord.

You and those in the community who are upset with my behavior (whilst I was defending ESF and pfSense from your smear tactics) can bet their last Euro/Dollar/Yen that I’ll be 10X more abrasive with the US Government if they attempted what you accuse.

Were I to seek a country that was at least outwardly opposed to the behavior of the US security apparatus (and its related apparatus in other countries), I might consider Brazil.   That time is not now.

What you probably don’t appreciate is that the actual “we write code before breakfast” people employed by ESF to work on pfSense are already outside the US(*).  One of them lives in Brazil, another in Albania.  Perhaps of interest.  Perhaps not.  At the very least, they’re not subject to US law, so it would be difficult to get them to “go quiet” about any attempt to weaken the codebase of pfSense.
