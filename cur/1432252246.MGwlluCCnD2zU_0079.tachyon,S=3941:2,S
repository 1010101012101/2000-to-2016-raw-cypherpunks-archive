Maybe yes, maybe no, but the G8 are all nominally democratic.  Anything to
back up your assumption?  Anyway, democracy is just the dictatorship of the
proletariat.  I'm against ALL dictatorships.  As I've been saying, having
either of those sets of monkeys at Genoa having any power over me is not my
ideal.

It was a hypothetical statement.  If the rioters were in charge they WOULD
have the guns, by definition.  Were that the case, I think they would be
infinitely worse.

Yeah, I thought so too.

So your beef is against physics?  Man, and I thought those rioters were
wishful thinkers.  What's at the top of your list, gravity?  Rock on.
