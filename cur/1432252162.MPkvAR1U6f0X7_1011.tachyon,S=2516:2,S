With Swiss/UBS nearly ready to capitulate in the Florida suit by
the IRS of the USA, what are the current choices for hiding money
from the tax authorities? Are any of the digital parks still operating
outside of government stings? And how can one be sure now that
so many well-rewarded coders are in cahoots with the money-tracing
masters?

Now any fool knows that governments work their perfidies as much
by bluffs as by PR shock and awe, by hanging a few malefactors
in public for effect, by shoveling money to those who fuck their
customers, by swearing there are seamless agreements among
thieving authorities to aid each other harvest each other's low-hanging
fruits, by staying far away from those who pay top price for arranging
cooperative regulations and biased regulators, by lying about how
effective tax evading dragnets work, by firing up a war or two to
entertain taxpayers with stories of threatened national security
even as pigs root the public tills, and by what else, creating large
escape holes in tax laws and international agreements for driving
huge trainloads of booty into bunkers supposedly constructed for
continuity of government.

What other purpose do avenging revenuers have except to
invite first use of economic WMDs?

Answers are needed, by most secret communication if you please.
