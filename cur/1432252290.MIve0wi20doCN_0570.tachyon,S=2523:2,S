According to the court docket, Jim Bell was arraigned
on Nov 29 and pled not guilty to two charges of
interstate stalking.

A jury trial is set to begin on Jan 22, 2001. Pretrial 
motions cutoff is Dec 20. Jim remanded.

Entries on Dec 11 show something is up: a motion
was made for a Dec 22 closed hearing on the topic of
defense counsel, and Jim has sent a letter to the judge, 
"re: counsel."
