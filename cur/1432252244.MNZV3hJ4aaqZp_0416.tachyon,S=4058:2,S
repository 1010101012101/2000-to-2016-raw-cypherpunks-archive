	I hate to inject my silly voice into such august debate, but it
is both possible and there is precedent (in respect to other consumer
electronic gear) for legislating restrictions on consumer PCs in the
hands of the general public without controlling or restricting PCs used
for business, commercial, scientific, or technical purposes.

	Thus the pro-DRM argument that says that DRM will never be
legislated because of the magnitude of the impact to the economy
conveniantly ignores the possibility of a bill that restricts new PCs
sold for home use by ordinary consumers but allows all the computers
in the business economy to function without TCPA or DRM if they choose.

	This would, of course, satisfy almost all the content cartels
realistic needs and would only force consumers to upgrade to the closed
boxes if they wanted the new content, not force wholesale replacements
of offices full of PCs.

	And yet it could result in a world in which it was illegal to
offer software or hardware to the general public that was not DRM'd or
allow the general public complete access to their networked machines
even for personal use only.
