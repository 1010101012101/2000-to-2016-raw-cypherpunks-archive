FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CULT OF THE DEAD COW Statement on Jacob Appelbaum / ioerror

Like much of the hacker community, we were troubled to hear the allegations
of sexual abuse, manipulation, and bullying leveled against one of our
members, Jacob Appelbaum, A.K.A. ioerror. We=E2=80=99re also aware that the=
 Tor
Project is conducting an internal investigation, and encourage anyone with
relevant testimony to come forward. For some, it won=E2=80=99t be easy. The=
re can
be shaming or humiliation, or the fear of not being believed.

It is also our responsibility to create an environment where people feel
safe to come forward. We have always stood for freedom of speech and
expression, which sometimes necessitates the right to anonymity. This is
something that victims of abuse often require. We stand by their right to
be anonymous. Others, like our friend Nick Farr, who decided to go public
with his own difficulties, deserve our respect and support. Everyone will
do this in their own way.

We know that it may be scary, but we also encourage victims to contact
their appropriate local authorities. We understand the complicated
relationship we all have with law enforcement, but there is a time and
place for government intervention. If the most extreme of these allegations
are true, they should be addressed in a court of law, and dealt with
appropriately.

CULT OF THE DEAD COW is known for a lot of things, but treating people
horribly is not one of them. If communities are to thrive and remain
relevant we have to do some housecleaning from time to time. As we have
become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the
stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake
from the herd effective immediately.
