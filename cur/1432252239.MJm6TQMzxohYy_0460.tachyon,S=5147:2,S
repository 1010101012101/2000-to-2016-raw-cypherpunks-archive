Well, it should be pointed out that learning to read Chinese is not so 
unlike learning to read phonetic languages as one might think.

Remember first of all that Chinese does not have "2,000 letters". Each of 
the characters is a word, or in some cases two or three characters form a 
word. Each character is also made up after an assembly of "radicals", or 
basic building blocks (actually, only one of the sub-characters is referred 
to as 'the' radical, and that's how they look up a character in a Chinese 
dictionary).

And remember that when learning to read, being able to pronounce the word 
based on its letters does little for you (when you're small) unless you know 
the meaning of that word. So young Enlglish readers have to learn 
word-by-word just like young Chinese readers. The english readers get some 
help by being able to sound out the word, but the Chinese reader can 
possibly pick out the radical and get something of a hint.

That said, it IS harder learning to read and write in Chinese, and this is 
why Beijing has indicated its desire to put away the characters one day. 
(But that will never happen.)

The reading ramp-up curves occur fairly similarly in east and west, from 
what I've been able to tell, but the western curve seems to move towards an 
asymptote in HS while Chinese seems to remain linear up through part of 
college.
