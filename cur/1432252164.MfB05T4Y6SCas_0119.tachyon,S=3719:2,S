RUSSIANS UNEXPECTEDLY ARRIVE IN KABUL

   KABUL - While U.S. Marines were consolidating their bridgehead near
   Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, Russian troops unexpectedly arrived
   in Kabul.
   
   They set up camp on a piece of waste ground, and have so far refused
   to say what they're doing in the capital.
   
   Some sources said they are setting up a temporary embassy, others said
   a field hospital. But it looks like a military camp and many Afghans
   have bitter memories of the 10 years of Soviet occupation.
   
   "A few years ago they came here (to) Afghanistan and they fought with
   people. And they are very crude people. We don't like (them)," said
   one man. "Russians destroyed all of Afghanistan. Maybe they are now
   coming to help," said another.
   
   Given the Soviet occupation of this country in the 1980s, Russian
   soldiers may not be the ideal choice for a humanitarian mission. But
   Russia is a strong supporter of the Northern Alliance, which has been
   in power in Kabul for two weeks.
   
   Russia may be flexing its muscle as one of the regional powers in
   Afghanistan, or it may be keen to show that if Washington can put
   Marines in Kandahar, then Moscow can put troops in downtown Kabul.
