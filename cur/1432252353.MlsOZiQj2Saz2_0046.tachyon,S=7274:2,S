As far as I can tell, nothing was deleted, you're just looking at the
wrong issue:

There's a huge difference between the EFF taking a public position on an
untested legal concept and a lawyer providing council to a client.  Of
course the EFF is going to advocate them, their job is to take that
position.

Whether warrant canaries will work or not is not my area of expertise.
However, I don't want to experiment with them for two reasons:

1) Lawyers who provide us council have told us it's very likely they
won't work.  I don't want to advertise something that could be
interpreted as an assurance which is actually false if for some reason
it ever came down to that.

2) It's not the hill I want to die on.  We're not well positioned to
push the state of the art in legal policy or to be a test case.  It's
not what we're good at, and honestly the point of our work is to make
those kind of questions irrelevant by not having any data to provide.
That's the envelope that we *are* interested in pushing.

You left out the part about the lizard people.

We have never received a subpoena, warrant, or gag order related to any
OWS app or service.  Now can we go back to writing software?
