If that was a lie, then it is odd that until Khruschev
renounced Stalin, the entire left fell for it.  I have
frequently commented on Chomsky's extraordinary servility
towards Soviet foreign policy.

Even to this day the socialists white wash Sihanouk, because 
though he was murdering real and suspected communists 
internally, he served Soviet foreign policy in external 
affairs.
