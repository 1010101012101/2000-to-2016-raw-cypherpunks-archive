No you imbecile, I'm telling no one anything, other than you to get a 
clue.  Where did I tell people who are under attack to suck it up?

All I did was point out that you weren't there and therefore any comment 
you care to make about it is bound to be flawed.

Please find yourself a clue store and open your wallet - wide.
