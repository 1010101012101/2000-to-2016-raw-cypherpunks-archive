Tim, the guy was taking a break from election results to
actually say something about a cypherpunks topic.
We know the election rigging is in progress, and it looks like
Bush is better at it than Gore.

Ooh, that's nasty.  Hope he does it :-)
In practice, the Statute of Limitations probably applies to
most of the things the Clintons did.  Besides, the Republicans have
used far more slack than they had available in trying to prosecute
Clinton for something/anything/whatever.


Meanwhile, the speaker on CSpan Book Passage is talking about 
how he and his friends attempted to not be swayed by the
Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field ("We even had *hand signals*
to warn each other when they were getting sucked in..."  :-)
				Thanks!
