This is the position I maintained, word for word, since Carter.  However,
where as you may have "mandated" the crimes you voted for, you have also
"mandated" the crimes you failed to prevent, since you KNEW those crimes
would be committed.

Bullshit.  That may be *you*, but that does not cover all of us.

Agreed.

This was the reason the vote was (a) so close amongst voters, and (b)
likely decided for Shrub.

> You vote for Kerry because you think he is a liar?

No.  I voted for Kerry because unlike George, he has at least two brain
cells - so there's a *chance* (remote, I grant you), that he can be made
to see reason.  Bush however, (a) has no brain whatsoever, (b) *enjoys*
fucking things up and praying that his good buddy Jesus will fix his
fuckups, and (c) seeing people needlessly suffer.  This is why people are
so upset that he was finally elected: nobody wants a sadist in a position
where he can deliberately and with impunity hurt whoever he turns his sick
little gaze to.
