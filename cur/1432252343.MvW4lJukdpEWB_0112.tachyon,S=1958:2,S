There's some wonderful Sicilian Reasoning in that: We can't reveal the rule because 
the Bad Guys would figure out what we're looking for.  But the Bad Guys already know 
what we're looking for, but we'll keep the rule secret anyway because we know they 
know what we're looking for. The thing is, the Bad Guys know that too...
