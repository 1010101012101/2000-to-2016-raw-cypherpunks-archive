Bill Scannell, who did the Boycott Delta project about CAPPS II,
reports that they're back.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAPPS II testing has been restarted.

The Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration
continues in its attempts to set up defacto internal border controls at our
nation's airports.

In response to the collaboration of Galileo, a subsidiary of Cendant, Inc.
in this test of the CAPPS II system, a disinvestment campaign has been
launched at:

http://www.dontspyon.us

The idea of citizens having to undergo a background investigation simply to
travel in his or her own country is invasive and un-American.  The CAPPS II
system goes far beyond what any thinking citizen of this country should
consider reasonable.  That citizens will be required to provide detailed
personal information to private companies that can be used for tracking and
marketing purposes is repugnant.

If enough people refuse to conduct business with Galileo or any of its
sister companies, then it is likely that other Computerized Reservation
Systems (CRS) will refuse to implement this sadly misguided and
anti-democratic program.

The boycott will remain in full effect until Galileo publicly withdraws from
any involvement with the testing of CAPPS II.
