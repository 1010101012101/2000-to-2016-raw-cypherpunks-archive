I worked in Intel's R&D group for a number of years, and I still know 
many of the researchers. I was there when the mantle of chip research 
was effectively passed from IBM to Intel, where IBM and other computer 
companies came to Intel (and a few other chip companies) to learn more 
so than chip companies looked to IBM.

This doesn't match what I know of Silicon Valley. Even with today's 
depressed stock market, the sheer amount of _money_ the leading chip and 
tech companies has dwarfs anything the rest of the world can put 
together.

That someone could argue that the "industry is no longer rich" and that 
the labs are "dead" is ludicrous.

I hear he runs an interesting list, but as a judge of technology he

Plenty of thriving businesses in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.

Nonsense. The best R&D has come out of industrial labs. The nature of 
R&D has shifted, as the number of basic new discoveries has 
understandably declined.

And I can tell you that almost nothing of importance to IBM or the 
computer industry has come out of the Watson labs in the last two 
decades. A lot more has come out of Cisco, Intel, even Apple.

Yeah, get that government boondoggle revved up in Australia.

What Australia needs is just _one_ major tech company...right now they 
have not a single world-class tech company.

He doesn't know much about actual industry.
