I am fairly familar with utilitarian thought.  My specific form of
utilitarianism is act utilitarianism, which means that each individual
action is evaulated, instead of using utilitarian ideas to form a
complete system of moral thought.

The reason why I use "the least pain for the greatest number" instead of
"the greatest happiness for the greatest number" is because the latter
justifies many not-so-great acts under act utilitarianism.  Consider
this example:

     There is going to be a Sado-Masachism (sp?) convention, which
     will be attended by 10,000 S&M-ers.  They kidnap a poor person,
     bring him to their convention, and electrically shock him.  This
     delights the crowd, but devastates the poor person.  Under the
     common definition of utilitarianism, this act is justified
     because it pleasures 10,000, while hurting only 1.  However,
     under my definition, this act is not justified because it creates
     a lot of pain, whereas not doing it does not create any pain.

And I disagree with him.
