            California Court Declines to Review
            Vehicle Forfeiture Law 
            The Associated Press

            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The state Supreme Court has
            declined to review a ruling allowing police to seize vehicles
            suspected of use in crimes such as drug dealing or soliciting
            a prostitute. 

            Without comment, a majority of justices Wednesday decided
            not to hear the American Civil Liberties Unions challenge to
            Oaklands 1997 vehicle seizure law. 

            Under the law, a car can be confiscated even if the crime
            suspect using the vehicle is acquitted, or the cars owner was
            unaware of the crime. The measure exceeds state and
            federal standards. 

            The ACLU argued that cities looking to profit from seizures
            would enact similar measures. 

            So far, Sacramento has put a comparable law on its books
            but San Francisco lawmakers shelved the idea last month,
            concluding it was unconstitutional. 

            Since passing the "nuisance abatement" act, Oakland has
            collected, sold and kept the profits from 300 cars. 

            The impetus "was really complaints from certain communities
            which were essentially drive-thru sex-and-drug bazaars.
            People were sick of having lines of cars in their streets with
            this activity going on," said Oakland Deputy City Attorney
            Pelayo Llamas.
