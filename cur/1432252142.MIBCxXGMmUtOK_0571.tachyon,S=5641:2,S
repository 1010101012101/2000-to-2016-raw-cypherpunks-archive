Arnold,

Yes. However, we live now in a post-modern society, where the emphasis
is on local discourse and it is accepted that there are many truths and
many ways of knowing.  The cat is out of the bag and we need IMO to learn
to cope with diversity rather than try to iron it out.  Of course, there are
many dictionaries and many languages and computer technology has not
solved this problem -- in the contrary, we have maybe dozens of "computer
languages" being born every year and a handful of them actually being
used.

So, if we look to the real world, what do we see? Do we see a uniform law rule,
a uniform government and a uniform language? No, we see multiple relationships,
multiple actors, heavy overload, intersubjective contexts.

As Tony Bartoletti wrote, apologies for what seems a rant, but the "solid
mathematical foundations" underlying digital signatures, "Qualified Certificates",
unmistakable IDs, biometrics and so forth create in me a degree of "psychic
and social backlash" as well.

We create these instruments in the hope of ascertaining better measures
of the constancy of authentication and identities.  The central question that
comes to mind is "to what degree we are artificially creating the constancy we
intend these instruments to measure."

No. The fact that people like to talk in dumbed down soundbites like
"identity theft", instead of using well-established words like "impersonation",
does not mean that any legally relevant conclusions can be drawn from the
misuse of technical terms like "theft" in the soundbite.

Otherwise, we seem to agree.
