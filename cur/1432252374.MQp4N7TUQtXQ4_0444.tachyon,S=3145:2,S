actually, contrary to almost all other cases of censorship (not that I
say this isn't) the german state of bavaria owns the COPYRIGHT of "mein
kampf", and as such actually has some kind of standing in most of the
cases. yeah, it's still censorship, but at least they were bright enough
to do it in an intelligent way. in essence, only copies printed before
1945 are actually legal, because the copyright owner (bavaria) has not
authorized any later printings.
