I don't think they are targeting you. It looks like, for better or
worse, that phrase and the case number have become part of some
"boilerplate" SEO spam or "Lorem ipsum." Congratulations, I guess...?

There are "sewer rat" SEO consultants/firms use highly questionable
techniques to game Google, Bing, and other search engines. I get spam
for them all the time via a contact form on a personal site I'm about to
shut down. Obviously, they cannot read the notice I've put on the
contact form page.

The best defense against this is may be to better advertise what they
are trying to drown out with the spam, either intentionally or not. As a
practical matter, two of the most relevant pages are the top two
results. Is there something else you want to be sure is out there in
regards to this, besides what's said in Isaak Crofton's book and
Wikipedia?
