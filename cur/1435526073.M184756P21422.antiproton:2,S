I'd be hesitant to suggest that "onion (tor)" is the best choice
of darknet (that in which any clearnet exit feature of same is not
used), nor the best to come. However sure, any of todays legit
darknets are more attractive than clearnet for many purposes.

Darknets are now powerful spaces for generally unobservable
communication and collaboration. In particular they seem unobservable
to corporations and all lesser entities.

[Darknets have not yet proven to be unobservable to the largest
passive / active capable governments, of which a few exist. The
academic vulnerabilities are documented. There's an active arms
race. And a wait for proof.]

Physical and other abuse / crime against individual humans seems
to not be resulting in any legislative bans of darknet / crypto
tech.

Meta level things such as crimethink and active markets don't
seem to be vulnerable either.

Filesharing is an interesting proposition in that, unlike the
physical and meta, it offends another class of opponent, the
corporation. (Be it of traditional copyright consumer multimedia,
or of corporate secrets).

So the next real test may be when the filesharers move onto the
darknets. Will the corporations expend resources to observe or
legislate them, or will they give up?

The tools and stands to be tested, both on clearnet and on darknets,
are interesting, important, and necessary.

Many are moving into the darknets today, yet it will take another
decade or so to know the outcome.
