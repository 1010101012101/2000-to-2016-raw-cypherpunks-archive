Agreed.

However, try have fun all your life and not getting paid for it.
Artists are a good example, but you can't do that all your life
without money either. There aren't a whole lot of landed aristocracy
in the world, for instance, or even those who live on trust funds. Or
who are even retired. :-).

(Apropos of nothing, some of the worst jobs in the world are those
where one is getting paid to have "fun". Prostitution and bartending,
come to mind...)

Yes, people try to do work that's fun. But the point is to get
*paid*, right? 

Like rock and roll, the minute it is possible to get paid to do
something you like, a vast majority of thinking humans would rather
get paid than *continue* to it for free.


Cheers,
RAH
