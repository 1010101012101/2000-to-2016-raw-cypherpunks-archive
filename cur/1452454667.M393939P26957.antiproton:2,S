Juan, let me return your incredulity with clarity,

i know i'm old, but that also means i remember a time we were not
actually at war (except drug war! in hindsight, that counts as war
well enough...)

incarceration rate alone doesn't tell the tale. part of this problem
is a "success" in prosecution and consistent(sorta) sentencing.

speaking of ending endless wars, drug sentences will reduce this a
fair amount, but significant reduction will require significant
reduction in sentences...

which is ok, as anything beyond 5 years is just punative;isolationary
- not rehabilitation.

Narcos a local example of serious threat, vs. annoyance.

is this where you advocate direct action to inhibit the machine?
 with unlicensed molotovs and conspiracy to congregate?
  ;)


in seriousness, a detailed and accurate picture of this experience
would be interesting to read.

there are historical references from this period, of dry edification,
but actual accounts from this perspective hard to come by, presumably
because the minds behind them were extinguished...

key aspects which stuck out:
- economic malaise, squeezed lower class.
- theology in service of power, rather than separate.
- business and government collusion in war making.
- nationalism coupled to racism. then ultra-nationalism to mass murder purges.
- willing populace mistaking blunder for boldness, polemics for
persuasion, and ever more cowed into total subservience...



> 	has become corrupt? How much to you get paid to troll this
> 	list?

the "justice system" is not total farce; completely devoid of all
credibility. extra-judicial summary killings are not common place.
secrets laws don't ^H^H^H ... ok, part of it quite fucked.

but beyond redemption? this is what i intend by "completely corrupt" -
unable to dispense justice; only deceit on the scales.



> 	No it's acutally propagandists like you who are to blame.

propaganda! skillful use of this another key factor for thriving
facism. i meant to add that to the list above...

though perhaps it is your feign of forceful repudiation which is the
facade?  i enjoy your consistent and copious criticism Juan. one day i
hope to enjoy your suggestions, too :)


best regards,
