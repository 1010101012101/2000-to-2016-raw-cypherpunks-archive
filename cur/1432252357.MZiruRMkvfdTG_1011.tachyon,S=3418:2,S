This is naive. Credit bureaus handle only a particular class of 
reputations, certain types of credit-worthiness, and then with 
well-documented deep flaws:

-- regulation by government

-- "Fair Credit Reporting Act" forbids them from "remembering" certain 
classes of defaults and welshings

-- lack of competition (the Three use the same precise standards)


If you are rejoining the discussions after a long absence, you need to 
get up to speed.
