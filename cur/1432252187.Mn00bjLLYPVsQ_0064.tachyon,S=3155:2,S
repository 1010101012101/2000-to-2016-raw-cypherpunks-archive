It's OKAY to question the legitimacy of the Bush presidency! Year's from now, history will reflect what the Supreme Court's decision triggered: The removal of Republican Congressional power in 2002, and the subsequent overhaul of our voting system, so that the true wishes of the people are expressed. 

The following bumper stickers are taken from http://MesaVistaPress.com You can order pro-Bush stickers, too, or make one that says ANYTHING YOU LIKE. Add to the following list there or in this forum...

BANANA REPUBLICANS 

DISNEY GAVE US MICKEY, FLORIDA GAVE US DUMBO 

NICARAGUA WAS ONLY PRACTICE. FLORIDA WAS THE REAL THING
