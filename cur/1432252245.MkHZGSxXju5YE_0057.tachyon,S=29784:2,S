Complaint for      

Relief from DEFAMATION [libel] and HARASSMENT       
      
1	Citizen Richard Gallegos gives documents in Exhibit A to citizen Arthur Morales.    
   
Morales gives documents to Payne on Saturday March 22, 1997.  
   
Exhibit A 4 show that the documents clearly refer to plaintiff  W. H. Payne since    
   
his signature is affixed to that document.   
   
Payne had not seen Exhibit A documents before March 22, 1997.   
   
The documents contain false and defaming information.     
   
Release of  documents like those seen in Exhibit A without written consent is a criminal    
   
violation of the Privacy  Act,   5 USC § 552a,  Records Maintained On Individuals    
   
http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/privstat.htm   
   
5 USC 552a(b) , the Privacy Act, states,   
   
   	CONDITIONS OF DISCLOSURE -  No agency shall disclose any record which is    
	contain in a systems of records by any means of communications to any person, or    
	to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior    
	written consent of, the individual to who the 	record pertains, ...   
   
5 USC 552a(i)1 applies.   
   
   	CRIMINAL PENALTIES. -  Any officer or employee of an agency, who by virtue    
	of his employment or official position, has  possession of, or access to, agency    
	records which contain  individually identifiable information the disclosure of which    
	is prohibited by this section or by rules or regulations  established thereunder, and    
	who knowing that disclosure of  the specific 	material is so prohibited, willfully    
	discloses of the specific material is so prohibited, willfully disclosed the material in    
	any manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a    
	misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000.   
   
Further,    
   
	The Privacy Act provides a civil remedy whenever an agency denies access to a    
	record or refuses to amend a record. An individual may sue an agency if the    
	agency fails to maintain records with accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and    
	completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any agency determination   
  	and the agency makes a determination that is adverse to the 	individual. An    
	individual may also sue an agency if the agency fails to comply with any other    
	Privacy Act provision in a manner that has an adverse effect on the individual.   
   
    	An individual may file a lawsuit against an agency in the Federal District Court in    
	which the individual lives, in which the records are situated, or in the District of    
	Columbia. A lawsuit must be filed within 2 years from the date on which the   
  	basis for the lawsuit arose.

	EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES   
   
  	I. Generally   
   
	In recent years the trend has become for employers not to give detailed or even    
	meaningful employment references when asked to do so. Most employers today    
	either give no employment reference information or merely confirm that the    
	(former) employee worked for the employer during  specified dates and at a certain    
	rank or position. The rationale for the unwillingness to provide more complete or    
	specific information is that employers must minimize their risk of  exposure to     
	workplace defamation liability.   
   
	Generally, an employer is liable to an employee for defamation if the employer    
	publishes a false statement about the employee that harms the employee's    
	reputation and that is not privileged.   
     
	Each element of a defamation action is examined briefly below.   
   
	First, employers cannot make false statements about an employee. Employers can    
	now be held liable for false statements only if they are responsible for the falsity.    
	This means that the employer can be held liable for a false statements only if they    
	were negligent in attempting to ensure the truthfulness of the statement. In other    
	words, employers are not liable for a false statement if  they were not negligent in    
	their attempts to ensure that the statement was true before they published  it.

	JUNE 25, 1997   
   
  	PRESENTED BY:  DEBRA  J. MOULTON, ESQ.  KAREN KENNEDY &    
	ASSOCIATES, P.C. 6400 UPTOWN BLVD., NE, SUITE 630-E     
	ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO 87110 (505) 	884-7887   
	_____   
   
	7-1	Defamation Defined   
   
	The test for defamation is not merely a statement that hurts one's reputation.    
	Defamation is the publication of a defamatory statement of  fact. When defamation    
	occurs in written form it is called libel. When the defamation is an oral    
	communication, it is called slander.  In order to prove that one has been defamed,    
	the New Mexico courts rely on proof of the  following facts:   
   
  	1. that there was a defamatory statement of fact concerning  another (i.e. a    
	statement, as opposed to an opinion, that tends to lower the employee in the    
	esteem of the community or other respectable individuals);   
     
 	 2. the statement must be published; that is it must be spoken or  otherwise    
	communicated to at least one person, usually a "third party," other than the    
	complaining party;   
     
  	3. fault amounting at least to negligence (should have known it  was false) on part    
	of the publisher, or, if the employer is a public official, the statement must have    
	been made with the knowledge  that it was false or with reckless disregard for the    
	truth; and   
   
  	4. that the statement was the proximate cause of actual injury to the employee.   
   
	It is imperative that employers take action to stop all defamatory  actions by their    
	employees, even in the realm of horseplay, since there exists in New Mexico both    
	criminal, and civil liability for such actions.   
   
  	LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT IN  NEW MEXICO:   A Complete Desktop    
	Guide to Employment Law,  ERIC SIROTKIN  Butterworth, 1994.   
   
While it may seem obvious to readers of Exhibit A that both Sandia National Laboratories    
   
and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission got caught in writing    
   
violating both the criminal and civil portion of the Privacy Act and should settle, the    
   
federal government decided to fight in federal court relying on cooperation of  federal    
   
judges to protect it.   
   
However, in this case the federal judge violated New Mexico state law in by mounting a     
   
campaign of harassment instead of administering a fair jury trial his zeal to protect the US    
   
government from liability.   
   
Therefore, legal remedy reverts to state court.

1999 in US District Court for  the District of New Mexico for violation of  the Privacy

entry 12.   
   
5	Garcia denies service in CIV 99-270  May 24, 1999 claiming that Payne can only    
   
use US  marshal service in a in forma pauperis case.  Exhibit C,  Exhibit B page 8 docket    
   
entry 18.   
   
Payne never claimed he filed in forma pauperis and can, in fact, use US marshal service if    
   
he pays about $25 per summons.   
   
Citizen Garcia harasses Payne.   
   
6	On 8/4/99 in CIV 99-270 defendants Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn,  

 Smith and Bannerman file

	[55-1] (cc: all counsel, electronically) (rd) (8k) Re: NOTICE [55]   
   
Garcia was removed from CIV 99-270 on 6/8/99 and, therefore, has no authority to order    
   
sanctions against Payne.   
   
Citizen Garcia harasses Payne in violation of New Mexico state law.   
   
15	On August 12, 1999 Payne files for writ of prohibition by certified mail with judge    
   
Antonin Scalia.   
   
	Payne wrote   
   
	I sued under the Privacy Act as a result of false and defaming documents about   
	my self distributed by Sandia Labs and EEOC.   
   
	These are seen at http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/congress/8327/robles.htm   
   
	Exhibit B shows that magistrate judge Garcia dismisses my air-tight Privacy Act   
   
	Defamation lawsuit.   
   
	Exhibit C shows that judge Garcia has the gall to attempt to assess me with fees.   
	  
2	I ask that you issue a writ of prohibition to judge Garcia to stay his   
	   
	August 5 ORDER ASSESSING COST IN FAVOR OF SANDIA DEFENDANTS    
	   
	AGAINST PLAINTIFF WILLIAM H. PAYNE because written evident seen at   
   
	http: //www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/8327/robles.htm   
   
	controverts Garcia' s claims.   
   
Scalia does not respond.   
   
Garcia, of course, was removed from case on  June 8, 1999 and had no authority to rule.   
   
Citizen Garcia harasses Payne in violation of New Mexico state law.   
   
13 	Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn, Smith and Bannerman file lien again Payne's and 

wife property on January 19, 2000. Exhibit D.   
   
Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn, Smith and Bannerman, knowing that Garcia was removed 

by affidavit harass Payne by  filing illegal  lien.   
   
Rule 11(b)(2) states   
   
	Rule 11.  Signing of Pleading, Motions, and other Papers; Representations to   
	Court; Sanctions   
   
	(b) Representations to Court.   
	By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later    
	advocating) a 	pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or    
	unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge,    
	information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the    
	circumstances,--   
	   
	(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by    
	existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or    
	reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;   
   
Evidence in documents in Exhibit A clearly violate the both the criminal and civil provision    

of the Privacy  Act.  These documents are obviously defaming too.   
   
CIV 99-270 is not frivolous.     
   
Citizens Garcia, Smith and Bannerman law firm Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn  

 harass Payne in violation of New Mexico state law.   
   
14	Payne files DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL in CIV 99-270 on March 24, 1999.     
   
Exhibit B page 9 docket entry 3.   
   
On  03/17/99 paid the filing fee for this jury trial guaranteed him by the Constitution and    
   
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   
   
Garcia, however, judged case without a jury trial.   
   
Citizen Garcia denied Payne's right for jury trial and thereby harasses Payne in violation of    
   
New Mexico state law.   
   
15	New Mexico state law, ARTICLE 3A, defines      
                    
            Harassment and Stalking       
      
	 30-3A-2. Harassment; penalties.       
      
	 A.  Harassment consists of knowingly pursuing a pattern of conduct that is      
	intended to annoy,  seriously alarm or terrorize another person and which serves      
	no lawful purpose. The conduct  must be such that it would cause a reasonable      
	person to suffer substantial emotional distress.       
      
	 B.   Whoever commits harassment is guilty of a misdemeanor.      
      
17	15	Chief magistrate judge William Deaton is informed of Garcia's, Smith's and    
   
Bannerman's harassment acts by certified letter on  February 26, 2000.     
     
Administrative settlement of these and other misconduct was proposed.     
     
Deaton is asked to respond by  March 4, 2000.     
     
Deaton does not respond.     
   
WHEREFORE       
      
18	Order Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn, Bannerman and Smith to pay Payne $912.50 

to satisfy lien.   
   
19	Payne asks  for punitive damages of $300,000 from Garcia for disallowing service    
   
by US marshal, failure to remove himself from CIV 99-270 after affidavit was file,     
   
ordering Payne to pay $912.50 after Garcia was removed from case, and denying trial by    
   
jury which Payne paid for and was guaranteed by the Constitution and Federal Rules of     
   
Civil Procedure.   

Garcia  is engaged in pattern and practice of harassment to deny rights due Payne under 

the Constitution and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Payne asks  for punitive damages of $300,000 from Krehbiel, Bannerman & Horn for 

allowing lawyers Smith and Bannerman to harass him.  

Smith and Bannerman have engaged in pattern and practice of harassing Payne. 
   
20	Punitive damages of $1,000,000 each from Sandia Corporation - Sandia National    
   
Laboratories,  American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation Lockheed Martin

WHEREFORE   
  
20	Morales and Payne ask for their $625 taken from them without due process.

illegally sending FBI agents to  family residence to deliver harassment letter.

Svet $300,000, Manuel  Lucero $100,000, Jan Elizabeth Mitchell $100,000 , and so that

upheld rather than abuse.

Forward complaint to New Mexico Attorney General with recommendation for  
 
prosecution of citizens Robert J  Gorence, John J Kelly, Manuel Lucero, Jan Elizabeth  
 
Mitchell, and Don F Svet for violation of New  Mexico state laws.
