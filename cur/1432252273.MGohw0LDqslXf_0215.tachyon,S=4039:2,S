I believe it's a test. The studio has determined that Harry Potter has
already made a (sizable) profit, so using it for an experiment is
acceptable. By testing on a big budget target they can now determine if
copy-protection costs exceed value.

I don't think so, not yet at least. This looks like just a pilot program.
Watch the normal piracy channels though, if Harry Potter shows up stronger
than other releases Macrovision will be around a while. But if Harry Potter
isn't substantially hit by piracy, then you might want to start shorting
Macrovision, they'll start losing customers.
