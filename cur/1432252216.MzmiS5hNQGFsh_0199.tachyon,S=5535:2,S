IIRC, Switzerland and Australia have both had episodes of the president or 
prime minister dying and nobody missing them for a few days or nobody 
recognizing the body when it was found.

The Swiss didn't invent one of their major defense technologies, which was 
mountains that are lousy places to run massed tank battles, but they used 
them quite effectively, just as they did against massed elephant-mounted 
forces.
Also, the banking business was one of the more useful things in Switzerland 
(as opposed to cheese and chocolate), and it's much more difficult to 
usefully steal a bunch of burned fragments of bank account ledgers than a 
harbor or a bunch of flat farmland.

The Conquest actually took quite a lot longer than that.  Sure, after 
Hastings the Conqueror's forces were on the island, and he was able to use 
some of Harald's forces against some of the other lesser kings of parts of 
England, but the solidity of central control over England was always 
dubious, what with various sets of regional kings, Vikings from 
Scandinavia, Scots and Picts in the north, Vikings from their hangouts in 
Ireland, uncles and cousins and younger brothers with claims to the throne 
(and the willingness to fight for them).  The Conqueror stomped down lots 
of this over the next decade or so, and had more control than anybody had 
had since maybe Alfred, but it was a couple of generations before the 
Norman were solidly in control.

The UN were also sent packing.
