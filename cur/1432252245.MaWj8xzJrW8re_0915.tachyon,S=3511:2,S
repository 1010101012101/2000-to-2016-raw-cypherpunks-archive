actually, if you had a properly secured DNS .... then you could trust DNS 
to distribute public keys bound to a domain name in the same way they 
distribute ip-addresses bound to a domain name.

the certificates serve two purposes: 1) is the server that we think we are 
talking to really the server we are talking to and 2) key-exchange for 
establishing an encrypted channel. a properly secured DNS would allow 
information distributed by DNS to be trusted .... including a server's 
public key .... and given the public key .... it would be possible to do 
the rest of the SSL operation (w/o requiring certificates) which is 
establishing an agreed upon session secret key.
