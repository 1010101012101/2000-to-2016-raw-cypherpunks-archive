I'm writing a response to your long reply to my long article.

(You hadn't responded to my article for some number of days after it 
appeared, which is fine, but that's why I haven't felt pressured to 
reply immediately to your reply.)

I'll try to get it out later today or tomorrow.

But so there's no suspense, I'm not claiming a better cryptographic 
protocol, certainly not involving distributed key registries for nym 
reputations. It's that whole approach I'm arguing against.

Which I think I argued for reasonably well in the long post. If you or 
others are not convinced, fine. But I will send off the reply on 
specific points later, tonight or tomorrow.
