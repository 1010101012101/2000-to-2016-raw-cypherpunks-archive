Considering the level of inside agents and provocateurs, not only for
this sort of stuff but tax evasion and monopolies; pretty damn good
I'd guess.

Or are you proposing that the FBI agent who provokes an illegal act is
also working for somebody besides the FBI? Not likely at the scale you
would suggest.

Or perhaps you mean that the people in the unions are being infiltraited
without the FBI knowing? I suspect that when they run the various
background checks they get a clue (assuming they did them and reviewed
them).
