As a public service, I'd thought I'd explain for our
foreign (or just younger) subscribers the root reference
of 'Happy Fun Court'.

The American comedy show Saturday Night Live
usually runs 1-2 fake ads per show. Some are better
than others. In 1990, one ad showed smiling children
playing with their 'Happy Fun Balls'. At the end, the
ad ran a disclaimer (American products often come
with ludicrously detailed warnings and disclaimers, due
to our corrupt legal system). It read:
--------------------------------------
Happy FUN BALL!

-only $14.95- 

     Warning: Pregnant women, the elderly and children under 10 should avoid
prolonged exposure to Happy Fun Ball. 
     Caution: Happy Fun Ball may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds. 
     Happy Fun Ball Contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to
rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.

Incorporated, and its parent company Global Chemical
Unlimited, of any and all liability. 
     Ingredients of Happy Fun Ball include an unknown glowing substance
which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.
