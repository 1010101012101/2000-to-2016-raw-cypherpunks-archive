Jesse,

Thanks for sharing this. My sense is that Main Core existed but was
never leaked (and certainly couldn't be obtained via FOIA) ~ some
figures state that it had around 8 million names, and that was well
before the most recent administration ~ so assuming something like it
is still in use, and based on the source material that has been
released to date, it would seem that everyone and their dogs, cats and
guinea pigs are on some list or another.

In a strange and unlikely occurrence, I recall that recently there was
a court case of some kind where someone was able to convince a court
to tell the TSA that they had to disclose if someone was on a no-fly
list.  I can't remember the name of the case but it was the first time
I'd seen that happen.  Not that I am advocating use of law and the
force associated with it to solve vast societal problems, but
apparently someone had some luck there against all odds.

Well, now I am thinking I should just take a link to my posted
request, as John Y. seemed to suggest and send it through socmedia to
Firstlook / Greenwald and see if I get a reply.

Cheers all
