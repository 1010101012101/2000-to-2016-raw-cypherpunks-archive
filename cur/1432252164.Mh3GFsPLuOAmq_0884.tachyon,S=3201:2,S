Sherman Austin was arrested in New York but not charged and held in
prison there to await an indictment in California. New York said it
had no legitimate charges to make against him and merely did
a favor for California to nab Sherman during a street demonstration --
the only arrest of the day. Grounds for arrest were faults in Sherman's
jalopy he'd driven to NY for the demo.

Ordered transferred to California while an attorney tried to
arrange his release to a family member, he was shuttled around 
federal prisons for more days, his family and attorney not sure where 
he was. He was finally released when  a judge determined he was 
being unfairly punished by prison procedure. 

He was released at the Oklahoma City federal transfer
station, to find his way home on his own, the family had not
been told he was being released.

Not long after his return to California, the prosecutor announced 
there would be no prosecution. 

(During this time some of us mirrored the bomb making material
Sherman had on his RaisetheFist.com site -- the forbidden material 
is still up, see below.)

After some weeks the prosecutor reinstated the indictment and
initiated plea negotiations. Sherman rejected the initial comparatively
mild plea offer.

More time passed with not much happening. Then the feds went
on the attack again and issued harsher plea demands and threats.
This new attack led Sherman's attorney to recommend a bargain.
Sherman considered fighting but he was advised what he legal
fee would be and the maximum penalty if he lost. He agreed to
a four month sentence. The judge upped that to a year.

Sherman was eighteen when this shit began.
