Unfortunately, I'd bet it's just a matter of time until some protected
minority successfully sues such a hospital for "discriminating" against
them for their assumed inability to pay.

i.e. "They *assumed* I couldn't pay my bills I'm black and don't have
insurance.  How dare they turn me away, racists!"

It doesn't seem to require much of a leap to go from "Denny's is public
and can't refuse to serve blacks" to "St. John's is public and can't
refuse to serve blacks."

Hospitals will, of course, remain "free" to turn away adult white
heterosexual males.
