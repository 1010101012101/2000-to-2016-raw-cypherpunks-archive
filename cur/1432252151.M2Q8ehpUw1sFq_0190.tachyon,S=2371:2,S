<Since it is discovered later, isn't that called peer review?

Indeed it is "peer reviewed," just delayed to an unpredictable
future, and still not clear just when the fault was discovered
nor why it was revealed -- as a helpful contribution, a ploy,
a deceit, or a lure.

Peer review is an unending process, and beyond that is
prolonged usage of a system under a slew of conditions
and challenges. It is hard to believe that all cracks and
weaknesses are publicly reported when there are such
great rewards for keeping them quiet and letting believers
continue in ignorance.

Cracks unfold not always at once, some are faked, some are
the result of a deliberate weaknesses inserted into code to
create a malodor of suspicion. Nothing unusual about any
of those. Comsec is nothing if not obfuscation about
capabilities.

<Thanks, John, for a trip inside the mind of a maniac.

Secure crypto believers get riled by unlocking their protective
cage.

No question these issues have been examined here and
elsewhere in the past and present, but nothing better than
to see updates which don't get dismissed because "this
has all been covered before, so shut the fuck up."
