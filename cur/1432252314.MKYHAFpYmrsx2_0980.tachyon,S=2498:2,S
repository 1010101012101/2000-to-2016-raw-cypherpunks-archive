They are not landowners, at least not as westerners understand 
owning land  The Sheiks are as hostile to private property 
rights as commies or Baathists.  In Palestine, when the British 
tried to register land ownership, the people you describe as 
landlords engaged in armed resistance.   Hence the Israeli 
argument that they are not dispossessing Palestinians, it is 
all state property, on which Palestinians happen to be 
illegally squatting.

The Israelis intepreted what you are calling landowners as 
politically controlling people residing on state owned land. 
The British interpreted them as politically controlling small 
private landowners.  Much truth in both these interpretations.
