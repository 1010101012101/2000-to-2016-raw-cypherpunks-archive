the above holds true for both, peace and wartimes. please try again.

I can't remember the US declaring war on any of the recent nations
they've bombed. care to point me to the relevant documents?

body count not of those who died, but of those who killed? yeah, that
works for WW2. does it work for vietnam?

whose common sense?


(I'm refraining from the usual reply of "common sense is what tells you
that the world is flat")

so he who murders his brother is by definition evil? with or without a
look at his reasons?


you didn't answer my two core questions, so I'll present them again in a
short and easily digestable form:


1.) those you call "evil" will often see things the other way around.
how do you resolve this issue without circular reasoning? (i.e. without
saying that their judgement doesn't count because they're "evil")

2.) if "evil" is objective, there ought to be an objective measurement
that can be applied to answer the question of a given person being
"good" or "evil". name this measurement.
