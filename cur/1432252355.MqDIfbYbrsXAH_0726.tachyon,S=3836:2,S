Simple reason: the terrorist acts were despicable. The terrorists, their
funders, their sponsors, their hosts, and probably their fellow
travellers should be hunted down and killed. There is no debate on this
point among civilized human beings. The only real question on this is
how many civilian deaths are acceptable in killing the terrorists.

By contrast, there is plenty of room for debate on the measures being
taken and proposed by the Western nations, and on the motivations of the
politicians behind these measures.

Bull. Annoying though Tim sometimes is, there's a big difference between
denigrating someone because you dislike his views or actions, and
killing thousands just to make a point that you don't like some other
people. And Tim's put his effort where his mouth is, writing articles
and code to further his agenda, while Osama Bitch Laden sent others to
die to further his agenda. No comparison at all.
