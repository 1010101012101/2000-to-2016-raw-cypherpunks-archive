                  2002 (PRIMEZONE) -- Universal Domains Incorporated (OTCBB:<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=udccf.ob">UDCCF</a> 
                  - <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/udccf.ob.html">news</a>):
                  </font></b></p>
                  <p><font size="2">With the current restructuring of ViaCall's 
                  business model back in February, changes have resulted in an 
                  increase in revenue of over 250% for the month of April. 
                  Numbers have increased on a monthly basis. This increase in 
                  revenue was due to the restructuring of the sales process, 
                  marketing strategy and internal personnel. ``We took a careful 
                  look at what was needed to make ViaCall profitable, quickly. 
                  We chose to put our independent video conferencing division on 
                  hold and are currently looking at the possibility of 
                  partnering with an international video conferencing company in 
                  the future,'' stated Alan Brown, President of ViaCall. </font>
                  </p>
                  <p><font size="2">Management Changes - ``Effective the 
                  beginning of March, several of our management have been 
                  replaced by one consultant who specializes in the 
                  telecommunications industry. Tammy Gardner has worked with 
                  several technology companies in the past in restructuring and 
                  streamlining their organizations. The crucial changes she has 
                  made have lead to instantaneous increase in revenue.'' As 
                  President of her own consulting firm, Investor Direct 
                  Consulting Group, Ms. Gardner has committed to spending 
                  several months with ViaCall working on building internal 
                  structure, identifying future acquisitions and maintaining day 
                  to day operations as well as training and supervising the 
                  sales staff. Ms. Gardner has worked with local organizations 
                  such as Internet Direct in preparing them to become large, 
                  national organizations. She was directly responsible for 
                  hiring and building out the sales, marketing and telemarketing 
                  divisions of the organization as well as focusing on investor 
                  relations. With a new, strong and dedicated sales team, 
                  ViaCall anticipates a substantial increase in revenue on a 
                  monthly basis. The focus of the organization has been on the 
                  'Not For Profit' sector along with the Investor Relations 
                  quarterly call sector. Each of these industries holds 
                  conference calls on a regular basis and have proven to be the 
                  most profitable. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2">Increase in Clients - Presently there are 
                  several high profile accounts that ViaCall sales specialists 
                  are working with that would lead to enormous monthly minutes. 
                  As the nature of the teleconferencing business is very 
                  competitive, ViaCall is hesitant to announce a full list of 
                  its present and newest clients but will disclose that its 
                  current client base includes such users as: The World Relief 
                  Organization, Illinois Public Health, Overeaters Anonymous and 
                  The World Affairs Council. ViaCall's client list has increased 
                  from 150 to over 500 new clients. With the hiring of Aurora 
                  Rodriguez, ViaCall's Customer Service Account Specialist, 
                  numerous accounts are activated on a daily basis. Ms. 
                  Rodriguez has extensive experience in the teleconferencing 
                  industry and specializes in creating new business. Wayne Hubbs 
                  has been promoted to Sales Supervisor and is responsible for 
                  guiding the sales team on a daily basis. As a veteran in the 
                  telesales and teleconferencing industry, Mr. Hubbs has given 
                  tremendous insight to ViaCall's young and aggressive sales 
                  team. With the restructuring of the company, and the 
                  downsizing of staff in the last 45 days, the company's 
                  overhead has been decreased by approximately 45%. Future 
                  growth will take place in hiring new junior telesales staff 
                  and the possibility of acquiring other teleconferencing 
                  companies. </font></p>

              and its partners are a teleconferencing services company targeting 
              clients throughout North America. The company gives the customer 
              the power to conduct automated conference calls on their own for 
              small groups or with the assistance of an operator for larger 
              groups.</p>
              <p>A key component of the company's business model is the ability 
              to offer clients and easy, economical and scaleable means of 
              communications that can be customized to meet individual customer 
              needs without the requirement for special equipment. On-demand or 
              scheduled conference calls allow the moderator control to conduct 
              their own conference calls in a convenient, quick and cost 
              effective manner. With firmly established relationships within the 
              industry and extensive knowledge of teleconferencing technology, 
              VCL and its partners are positioned to capture a substantial share 
              of revenues generated within the teleconferencing industry.

              these services will be provided seven days a week, twenty-four 
              hours a day.</p>

                  Opportunity</font></b></i></p>
                  <p>In light of recent events, video and audio conferencing 
                  have surged and experts believe that this trend will continue. 
                  Long-tem gains are expected as business travelers are less 
                  inclined to include air travel in their itinerary. Companies 
                  that provide conferencing services say usage has swelled 10% 
                  to 50% recently.</p>
                  <p>More than 13 million conference calls were placed 
                  throughout North America. Services in the first half of 2001 
                  were up 43% over the same period in 2000, according to 
                  TeleSpan Publishing Corp., an Altadena, Calif., research firm 
                  that tracks the industry. Currently, North America accounts 
                  for 86.6% of worldwide usage of teleconferencing , with the 
                  U.S. being the largest user.</p>
                  <p>A current event that has triggered more demand for 
                  conference services was the introduction last year of a new 
                  &quot;fair disclosure&quot; law. The law requires publicly traded 
                  companies to make &quot;material&quot; information - any news that could 
                  affect stock prices - available to all investors at the same 
                  time. As a result, many companies now hold conference calls 
                  over the web that invests can listen in to for free. 
                  (September 18, 2001, The Wall Street Journal).</p>
                  <p>There are 15,000 companies that have their shares traded 
                  publicly on recognized exchanges in the U.S. and Canada. Of 
                  these companies, some 11,000 to 12,000 companies are U.S. 
                  listed to which the FD (Fair Disclosure) would apply. The 
                  remainder, including those on the TSE and the CDNX, are 
                  expected to adopt similar disclosure policies. These numbers 
                  do not include an additional 10,000 plus companies listed on 
                  secondary markets. A substantial amount of these companies 
                  have either incorporated conferencing services as a means of 
                  disseminating new to the investment community on a regular 
                  basis or will consider using such services in the future.</p>
                  <p>The company will continue to seek and explore other 
                  complimentary business opportunities in the communications 
                  industry. International teleconferencing with the ability to 
                  engage bilingual interpreters as well as many other 
                  communications revenues are to add to the company's business 
                  model.</td>
