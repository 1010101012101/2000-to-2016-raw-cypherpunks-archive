No we did not.

in 1958 pro soviet socialists gained ascendency in Iraq, but a
power struggle proceeded between the communist and baathist
wings of the socialist movement.  In 1963, the baathists
launched a coup, intended to be launched simultaneously in all
arab countries, to establish a united supranational arab state
based on the arab race and socialism. The coup succeeded in
Syria, succeeded only temporarily in Iraq. Allegedly this coup
was supported by the CIA, but there is no evidence for this,
nor does it seem very believable that the CIA would wish to see
the arabs united under a pan arab socialist regime.

Shortly thereafter there was a counter coup against the
baathists in iraq, which established a conventional military
regime, whch was eventually overthrown by Baathists in 1967.

If the CIA gave support to either coup, which one do you think
it more likely to support?

The trouble with your account of events is that the baathists
were then as they are today socialist, pan arabist, anti
american and anti colonialist, hence improbable as
beneficiaries of CIA benevolence.

Saddam was no more "our puppet" than Stalin or Pol Pot was, nor
was he ever deemed a good guy, any more than they were.
