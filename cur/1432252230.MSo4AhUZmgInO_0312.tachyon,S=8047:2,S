First of all, anyone have the latest word about Cryptome?

Second of all, I took a look at these and what's becomming quite clear is 
that they don't really say that much. They basically just show how the LGXs 
are connected and interface into and out of the "secret room" via 
splitters.* It does say that a buttload of traffic is being split and sent 
off to NSA equipmet, but the real missing piece is just how that traffic 
gets back to NSA. I still believe that they just can't send back EVERYTHING, 
and have to have several layers of prioritzation, so that only fairly 
interesting traffic makes it back in real time (this is not to say that they 
don't possibly route and store uninteresting local traffic for future 
reference) but they can't get everything back to, for instance, DC in real 
time.

Another question I've had for a while is how they get around the loss 
budgets in certain cases. Dropping a 3dB splitter into an OC-48 signal 
that's pushed to the limit will result in some signficant BER degredation. 
Do they just avoid those signals? DO they put in some kind of in-line 
optical amplifier? (That's not trivial, as they have to electrically power 
such a device.)

-TD

*: On the other hand, the existence of splitters alone proves that this is 
not standard CALEA, so when the case broke this was significant. But 
technologically it's not all that interesting nor surprising (for 'paranoid' 
Cypherpunks, at least).
