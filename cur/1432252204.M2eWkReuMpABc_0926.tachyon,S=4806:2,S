IIRC Google happened to run across it, and they spend a lot of time
(and money) trying to detect bad ads, but it's certainly not
foolproof. The arms race continues. There are many areas where we
can't really consider Google one of the "good guys" (insofar as that
label means anything), but fighting malware is an area where they
certainly seem to be on the side of good.
