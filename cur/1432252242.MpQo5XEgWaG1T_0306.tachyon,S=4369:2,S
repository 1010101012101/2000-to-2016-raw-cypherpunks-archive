Largely, I am in agreement. However, in the paragraphs I've quoted below,
Tim touches on a counter-argument and dismisses it. I'll like to expand
upon that a bit.

I think that this "danger to others" issue will lead us right back where
we started. It would not simply be an issue of various airports denying
use, but also communities denying airspace rights. And you can bet that,
in a world where airlines were permitted to have no security procedures,
XYZ Airlines would also have to abide by "no-fly zones" set up by the
larger, more security-conscious cities, enforceable by SAMs.

There would probably be places in the mid-west that permitted such
airlines to operate their services. But the market would surely kill them
swiftly if they were denied the ability to fly or land in any popular
area. Customers would go elsewhere, not because of the lax security, but
because of the limited service offerings.

If planes didn't bring down office buildings, if there were no issue of
airline policies posing a danger to others, perhaps this would be
different.
