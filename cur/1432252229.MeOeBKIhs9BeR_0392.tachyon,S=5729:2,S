	0.

	Can't happen, and won't. Why? there's no margin in it.

	RH was always going on about Digital bearer Certs being 2 orders of 
magnitude cheaper to clear than a book entry transaction, and he may 
well be right.

	But Citibank, AmEX and the others make their money making those 
transactions, and they aren't stupid people. They're not going to cut 
their own throats--they realize that the costs of setting up and running 
a clearing house for DBC/Ecash/whatever are trivial compared to running 
a clearing house for credit cards. And the government realizes what 
happens when they can no longer track the money.

	I used to have one thin wedge of hope, that someone with the 
brains, the code and the capital would realize that there could be a 
killing made in the Adult Entertainment side of things--porn and 
gambling. Areas where (1) Participants do not necessarily trust each 
other, (2) People often wish to be anonymous, and (3) large amounts of 
cash change hands.

	However the Porn Sites are obviously doing quite well getting True 
Names from people, and the people obviously don't mind much that these 
sites will often double charge their credit cards &etc. And the gambling 
people, well, they're heavily regulated.
