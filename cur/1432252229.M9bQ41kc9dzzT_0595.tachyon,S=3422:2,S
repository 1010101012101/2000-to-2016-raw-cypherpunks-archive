jya>>Beheading the centers of information warfare would be the end of 
Western culture.<<

What did Ghandi say about Western culture? That it sounded like a good 
idea? If you want to psychologically adjust read some green 
anarchy/primitivist stuff."For the end of civilization"

On this day or thereabouts...1763 -- A troop of 50 armed men enter the 
Workhouse
at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, & hatchet to death the only
14 surviving Conestoga Indians (the rest of the tribe
having been similarly dispensed with 13 days ago).
Having finished their work, the troop, in the
words of Benjamin Franklin, "huzzahed in
triumph as if it had gained a victory, & rode
off unmolested."
