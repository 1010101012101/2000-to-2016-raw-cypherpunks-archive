IMHO, if you light up two or more other identical CRT's and have them 
display random junk it should throw enough noise to make it worthless - 
(and would put out enough similar RF to mess with RF tempest) there might 
be ways to filter the photons from the other monitors out, but, it would 
be difficult.
