The whole /8?  I'd certainly say it's a lot -
it's not even a single Class A owned by a carrier like AT&T or UUNet,
but has a number of different ISPs in different countries owning
chunks of it.  leitl.org has a /24 that's part of an ISP /18 in Germany,
and I saw some Swisstel in another /18 there.

That's the kind of global overkill I'd expect from an
irresponsible spam-blocker list like SPEWS,
and even for them that would be pretty excessive.
