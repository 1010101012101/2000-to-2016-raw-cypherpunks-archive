I will look forward to watching the coverage. Do you plan to take out 
just the censorious bitch Lynne Cheney, or also her censorious 
husband and VP candidate?

And then there's Al Gore (RAT) and his running mate (JEW RAT).

(Subliminal messages brought to you by the Republican Party).

Interesting that 3 out of the 4 top rats--Cheney, Gore, 
Lieberman--have their own censorious attacks on speech, or have 
spouses who lead such attacks. Lynne, Tipper, and   Lieberman 
himself. I wonder why Bush is being left out? Maybe it'll be like 
Nixon in China: the only one of the four not calling for repeal of 
the First Amendment will be the one who pulls the trigger.
