Not sure what mailing list this came from, but the DHS is running
a shindig in Boston in April, if anybody wants to drop by.
I've de-MIME-ified it, so it may be a bit harder to read.

Security, CFP

Dear Colleague,
You are invited to participate in this inaugural, must-attend, national
event, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science and
Technology Directorate, scheduled for April 27 & 28, 2005 in Boston, to
encourage public-private partnering among scientists and engineers from
government, national laboratories, universities, research institutes, and
private sector firms investing in R&D.  Private sector and university-based
scientists can benefit from the technologies and technical approaches
developed and deployed by the national and DHS labs.  The laboratories in
turn can explore leveraging opportunities with leading private sector and
university-based research programs.
Please take a moment to consider submitting a paper presenting your
research at this conference. If you cannot submit a paper, attend and learn
what others are doing and how you can work with them. We are also seeking
conference cosponsors and exhibitors from both public and private sector
organizations. Visit the conference web site,
www.homelandsecurityresearchconference.org

Working Together: Conference on Public/Private R&D Partnerships in Homeland
Security
Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science & Technology
Directorate
         April 27 & 28, 2005
         The Seaport Hotel and World Trade Center
         Boston, Massachusetts, USA

Call for Technical Papers
The First Annual Working Together: Conference on Public/Private Research &
Development (R&D) Partnerships in Homeland Security

This two-day Conference will focus on state-of-the-art science and
technology to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from
high-consequence chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosives
and cyber terrorist threats. The conference will also address protection of
the nation's critical infrastructure, and the harnessing of science and
intelligence to reduce threat and risk.
The objectives of this inaugural event are to encourage public-private
partnering among scientists and engineers from government, national
laboratories, universities and research institutes, and private sector
firms investing in R&D, to address the collective science and technology
research goals of the U.S. homeland security community. Private sector and
university-based scientists can benefit from the technologies and technical
approaches developed and deployed by the national and DHS labs.  The
laboratories in turn can explore leveraging opportunities with leading
private sector and university-based research programs.

Through plenary and breakout sessions, posters and a companion Exhibition
Conference Participants will:
7  learn about DHS awareness, countermeasures and response and recovery
goals;
7  address the most pressing technical challenges;
7  identify the most critical knowledge gaps;
7  be introduced to the core capabilities of national and DHS laboratories,
and the Departments university-based homeland security centers; and

Background
DHS is committed to science and technology leadership, and the creation of
an enduring national capability for homeland security.  Toward this end,
the DHS S&T Directorate supports and recognizes technical excellence in
research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) of homeland security
technologies; encourages collaborations and partnerships among RDT&E
performers across the homeland security science and technology complex;
actively disseminates knowledge generated through the execution of RDT&E
programs and university-based homeland security centers; and to the
greatest extent practical, enhances visibility and recognition of
scientists and engineers dedicated to homeland security missions.

Technical Topics
We are seeking papers on the following topics:
7  Threat Characterization for:  Chemical, Biological, Radiological /
Nuclear, Conventional Explosives (CBRNE)
7  Threat and Vulnerability Assessment including:  Knowledge Discovery
(Semantic Graphs), Technology-based Emerging Threats (e.g., terrorist
exploitation of advances in nanotechnology and biotechnology), Advanced
Risk Modeling, Simulation and Analysis for Decision Support, Modeling and
Simulation (Cognition and Behavior), Discrete Sciences, Visual Analytics
7  Sensors including: Performance Improvement, Next-Generation Designs, and
Architecture for Devices and Systems
7  Forensics and Attribution for Chemical and Biological Events
7  Chemical Countermeasures Including:  Detection (TICs and TIMs),
Surveillance/Detection (Low Volatility/Chemical Warfare Agents)
7  Biological Countermeasures including:  Agricultural Security,
Surveillance (Situational Awareness)
7  Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures including:  Passive and Active
Detection
7  Explosives Detection including: Bulk and Trace Detection and Nanosensors
7  Methods to Disarm/Defeat Conventional Explosives
7  Critical Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security
