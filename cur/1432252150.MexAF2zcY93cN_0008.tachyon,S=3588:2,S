What personal flaws? I mean no disrespect to jim and cj at all.To me 
teenagerhoods good.Very good.(check google if you dont believe me) Im sorry 
that it appears jim missed out a little.I have no way of knowing that 
actually so Im taking liberties.I guess jim got into trouble for 
stinkbombing,destroying mail and stalking because he just wanted to get 
more publicity?
And CJ was clearly set up but from what I read of his he has a great spirit 
that gets crushed out of most of us some time between childhood and 
adulthood.If growing up means accepting 5 million laws and all the grey 
mind dead bureaucrats
that go with them,I refuse to grow up.
The ideas remain undetracted by my petty bitching about jims use of freud 
and his choice of restaurants,what was the supposed 'hate' literature in 
his car btw?
CJ is immaculate in my book.The very model of a modern major madcriminal.I 
just cant read all his stuff,right away.Im fuckin busy man,allright?
