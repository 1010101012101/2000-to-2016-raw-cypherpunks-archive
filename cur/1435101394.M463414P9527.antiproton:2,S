I'll preface this by saying that I'm not fond of censoring list topics; I 
just skim or ignore topics/posts when they cease to interest me.

I think discussing politics and propaganda is on-topic when it regards the 
main focus of the list.  When governments intentionally weaken encryption, 
or threaten to/ actually pass draconian laws that directly affects the work 
we endeavour to do.  Censorship, even, because we need to help reroute 
people around those blocks to get their messages out and essential info in.

The pointless droning on about how much the USA and what it does sucks- and 
it does suck!- can become old.  I know it's tempting because there are a 
lot of people here who agree, but there are other listservs better suited 
for it.

Not meant to be a personal attack on anyone; I don't have a problem with 
any of you & I find it easy to scroll past that which doesn't interest me.  
Sometimes I'll even see a point of view I hadn't considered, even if the 
item in question isn't quite on-topic. Not everyone feels the same, though.
