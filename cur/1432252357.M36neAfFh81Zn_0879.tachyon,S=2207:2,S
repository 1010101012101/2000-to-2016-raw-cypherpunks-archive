Committee on Thurday.
The bill enables the use of facial, thumb, fingerprints, and other
biometric identifiers for *a broad range of state purposes to
authenticate identity.*

Several people on this list have professional experience with the
reliability issues with biometric ID.

** The legislators don't understand the technology. If you have relevant
information, please let legislators know. **

If you'd like to testify or communicate your expertise to the committee
members, please contact Scott Henson at ACLU-TX,  shenson@austin.rr.com,
who will let you know who's most effective to talk to.

Or fax a letter to committee members.
