"Prior to that, the encrypted email I've sent in the past year or so has 
almost always failed, because of version incompatibilities,"

While in Telecom I was auditing optical transport gear, and we adopted the 
practice of encrypting all of our audit reports to vendors. Of course, the 
chance of there being an eavesdropper (uh...other than NSA, that is) was a 
plank energy above zero, but it gave the vendors the imporession we really 
cared a lot about their intellectual property (if we determined a problem 
with their equipment, and if that info ever leaked, it could have a major 
impact on them).
That the mesages were decrypted I know for sure, and it was easy for the 
customers: we would verbally tell them the password for unpacking the 
encrypted file, and they merely typed it in a it extracted itself.
I think the encryption tool was installed directly into the file manager (or 
whatever it's called now), so it was easy to do.
