Many million Americans do so every year.

And Canadians.  Just need a driver's license, I think.

Many or most Europeans don't need a visa for short stays.  Likewise
for Japanese, I think.

And each year at least hundeds of thousands of enterprising souls 
cross the US-Mexican border at, shall we say, other than the usual entry 
points with no documentation at all.
