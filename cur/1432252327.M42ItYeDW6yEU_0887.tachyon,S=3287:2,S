Server hosting is now a boring, commodity business.   You needs some
marketing ploy to get mindshare from potential customers.

The kind of people who decide where their company's servers are to be
hosted are often the kind of people who used to make plastic models of
military hardware when they were kids. Who have coffee-table books about
planes with lots of pointy bits. Maybe even ones who read Bruce Sterling
novels. They also like to think that their data is Really Important.

Sealand or the Bunker (http://www.thebunker.net/) are good PR,
regardless of the technical merits of their locations.
