"STREET level drug dealers, car thieves, burglars, abalone poachers, 
standover merchants and blackmailers face losing all their assets under new 
seizure laws.

Criminals' assets will be frozen upon or before arrest and automatically 
forfeited after conviction.
And police will be able to sell possessions likely to depreciate in value, 
such as luxury cars and boats, even before their owners appear in court.
After conviction it will be up to the criminals to prove they legally 
obtained the seized assets, rather than for police to prove they were the 
proceeds of crime.
They will lose everything they own, from houses right down to watches and 
clothes, unless they can prove lawful acquisition Police Minister Andre 
Haermeyer yesterday defended the reversal of the usual onus of proof as 
necessary to hit criminals where it hurt most – in their hip pockets." 
"police had been foiled in seizing some criminals' assets because of the 
speed with which money could be moved on the Internet."
