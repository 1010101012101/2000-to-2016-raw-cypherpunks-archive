Not at.  All that is required is for a few "early adopters" to point the way and then make their statments through the popular press.  Look at what havoc two Joe Sixpacks caused D.C. operating out of the back of a slightly modified sedan.  Imagine if they had the home addersses of lots of federal agents instead of randomly picking other Joes filling up their gas tanks.

I've heard a project has been underway for some time to create and publish dossiers for federal officers.

No one gives a fuck for Usenet postings, blacknet etc. - and ZPs are unlikely to educate themselves and search for them. Effective means untouchable web site with untouchable DNS entry. Effective means something doable by average determined person. Like tuning to Radio London from occupied Europe in WW2.

Create dossiers on a broad variety the hoster management.  If sites are terminated or their DNS is disabled so will managemnt and/or their familes.  Like a force of nature, no explanation warning or threat.

I2P is coming.  With six months it should offer a stable and fairly bullet proof platform for lots of nice apps.  It should be easy to install and operate in most consumer net situations.

Waaa!!! Waaa!!! What a cry baby.  Pick you target, go out and shake things up.
