      Their point is be disconnected from any central control, for one thing.
It's independance, not a total rejection of modern ways. They'll ride in cars,
for instance, just not, for the most part, own them.
      And my main point was that they do very well financially, where most other
small family farms are going under.

       Well, what's wrong with that? If you have a phone line in your house, it
makes it easy to bug you, doesn't it. I lived without a phone for about 18
years, it's not difficult. At one point, in fact, the phone company, without
asking, ran a buried phone line to the quite rural house we lived in, knocked on
the door and asked if they could install a phone inside. I said no, and, as soon
as they left, dug up the phone line in a dozen places along the route, cutting
chunks out of it.
       No paranoia here.  8-)

      Yes, generally, but I'm not sure about vaccinations. Can't remember. At
one point we lived around a lot of Amish, really wanted to join up with them,
but they weren't taking converts.
