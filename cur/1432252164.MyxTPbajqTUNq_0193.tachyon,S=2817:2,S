"Nomen" assumes facts not in evidence.  Those of us who have been on
Cypherpunks for years--including Greg--have already done that appropriate
"soul searching."  It is because we have come to the conclusion that we are
making the world a better place, that we support strong crypto.  "Nomen's"
moral uncertainty sounds like a personal problem to me.
