Sect 12 Support Offense -- "facilitating meetings." Snip below.

Also see fundraising, money laundering, etc. where all it takes is
"reasonable cause to suspect" ....a negligence standard? This act seems to
mark the advent of "terrorist due diligence." I know many of you offer
paid/pro-bono "privacy"/TSCM consulting, or are providers of some sort that
could be viewed as enabling "designated" terrorist groups. Irrespective of
this specific act, I find this is a disturbing train of regulatory thought.
