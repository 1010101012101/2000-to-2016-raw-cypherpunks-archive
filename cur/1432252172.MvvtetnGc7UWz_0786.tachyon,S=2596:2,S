If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend Don Davis's 
"compliance defects" paper (and slides!) available at 
http://world.std.com/~dtd.  Abstract follows:
  Public-key cryptography has low infrastructural overhead because
  public-key users bear a substantial but hidden administrative burden.
   A public-key security system trusts its users
  to validate each others' public keys rigorously and to manage
  their own private keys securely. Both tasks are hard to do well,
  but public-key security systems lack a centralized infrastructure
  for enforcing users' discipline.  A "compliance defect" in a
  cryptosystem is such a rule of operation that is both difficult
  to follow and unenforceable.  This paper presents five compliance
  defects that are inherent in public-key cryptography; these
  defects make public-key cryptography more suitable for server-to-server
  security than for desktop applications.
