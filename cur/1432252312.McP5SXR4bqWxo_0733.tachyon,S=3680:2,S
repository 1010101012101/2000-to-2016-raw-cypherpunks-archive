Not only will operation soft drill water your plants and walk your dogs it 
now kills all known horsemen of the infopocalypse.
While it will be portrayed as the grim reaper,great satan and everything 
else under a rock,a way must be found to neutralize the 'freak out the 
soccer moms' campaigns that could be coming our way soon.You know the ones...
Crypto pedophiles! crypto terrorists! crypto narcotraffickers! and crypto 
money launderers for them all.
Why not turn crypto assassins loose on the above?
It takes a thief to catch a thief and the authorities are losing all these 
battles.(when they're battling and not joining in)
So,how to turn a negative horseman,crypto assassins,into the ultimate 
killer app? Simple,stop sneaking around and go
"open source" Its a boon.Not doom.A blessing,not the end of the world as we 
know it.If youse can sell yourselves on the
comedy that your 'punks' and 'anarchists' you have great futures in 
advertising.Whats in it for moi? ecash,new markets,fame,70 virgins,hells 
bells,whateveryoufugginwant.Cheney,the evil one,is in the bunker now 
planning nuclear war with china as the ultimate last resort so we havent 
got all day.Give us your answer here!
The media can sniff out the candidates quite 
nicely,condit,oj,USAma,etc.Once we break the ice and the network affect 
kicks in it'll be background before you know it.Operation soft drill,you 
know it makes sense.
