all circuits busy!  oops.  the problem with one way conferences like
this is that you tie up significant switch resources (a "conference
resource" or other such name, in addition to the outbound spans
required for covert relay to destination).  the problems with text
messages probably occurred during peak usage periods when contention
for finite switch resources (provisioned _without_ clandestine
circuits in use :) hits service affecting limits.

we are so familiar with license codes to activate functionality in
enterprise software i don't see why this is much of a point.  of
course there is CALEA like functionality.  the focus on CALEA is more
a bureaucratic aspect; the technical implementation of a one way
conference is trivial, the proper controls and administration for
CALEA implementation using such a technique is probably 10x to 100x
more effort to satisfy all the legal requirements and user friendly
feature richness.

bingo.  a very practical approach assuming you have the insider access
to implement.  maybe even hired a grey/black hat to code it (as SMB
mentioned the free reign hackers have enjoyed on telco neworks in the
past).

it definitely appears to be the work of an Ericson telco coder working
in conjunction with the Vodafone tech to get the configuration and
deployment of the eavesdropping implemented.

the basic prerequisites:
- one telco coder who knows the API / state machine of the soft switch
to code to, either at an API level (sounds like it, as this was a
process working with the legitimate soft switch programs on a unix
host) but could be done at a network level (process monitoring and
injecting call process commands directly to switch hardware at a low
level - harder to do, but can be more stealthy)

- one technician who can supply the current switch configuration
(spans from towers / carriers, their signalling characteristics, etc)

- telco test configuration (a softswitch configuration as close to
target configuration as possible, a tsunami or other bulk call
generator / call test harness)

- time and money.

work out the proper configuration for identifying incoming calls of
interest, bridge to available one way conference, connect conference
outbound to pool of relay/destination cell phones.

that suicide looks really suspicious, doesn't it?

the nature of this relay would be interesting to discover.  was this a
forwarded type relay (i.e. handset not active, forward to this
number?) or a store and forward, like voicemail, or what?

it was intentional, there's no way that was an accident.  perhaps it
was intentional so they could say of course we didn't do it because
we're not that stupid?  or perhaps it's all an elaborate ruse to make
us think in that direction, and clearly i shouldn't choose the cup in
front of me! ..  er,  back to the story:

mission accomplished, too many contradictions and potential deceits
and distractions.  need to talk to someone with knowledge of the
activity (oh wait, that problem is neatly resolved by convenient
suicide)

oh well, speculation is more fun anyway...

not arcane, just highly specialized and complicated.  people do this
all the time all over the world for a living.  ho hum, soft switching
hasn't been rocket science since the 1990's :P

yup, agreed on all counts.  since the Vodafone insider is "expired"
perhaps the Ericsson / telco coder will surface with a additional
digging.  i'd bet on powerball before that outcome though...
