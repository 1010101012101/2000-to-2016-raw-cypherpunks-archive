In better case, this. In worse case, to force the adversary to face an 
unknown, unexpected situation they aren't trained to handle.

Until a Gentoo-like Linux distro for PDAs appears. Then custom-compiled 
code becomes quite common in that segment of consumers.

Another possible way for wrecking the set of file signatures "in the wild" 
could be releasing a product (which then would have to become popular, so 
it has to be useful) to do a function modifying the executables - may be a 
code packer (flash space is still a premium in the PDAs), may be a 
realtime patcher (for eg. protecting against some generic code exploits), 
in extreme cases may be an otherwise benign trojan or worm.

Yes, but the same applies to your colleague. Would you like it to be easy 
for your colleague to betray you?

Unless the adversary beats the passphrase from your colleague and then 
comes for you.

Don't be so selfish. :)
