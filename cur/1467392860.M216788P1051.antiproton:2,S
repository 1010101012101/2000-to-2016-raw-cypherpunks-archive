[OT]  [Friday silly message]

Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this
kind of thing is pure love, ow!  *-*

http://helloworldcollection.de

I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3

https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC

But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D

http://yiap.nfshost.com/esoteric/unnecessary/unnecessary.html

Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.

Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.

The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.

Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)

Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".
