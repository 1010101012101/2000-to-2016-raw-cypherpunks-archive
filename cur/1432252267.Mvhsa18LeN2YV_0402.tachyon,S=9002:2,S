Hi,

okay, fuck that, I'm going to dive in, because the level of FUD is stro=

this one.

Sure:
https://xkcd.com/927/

I don't understand why we need over9000 different, incompatible federat=
ed=20
social web protocols. It would seem to me we need *ONE* with several *G=
OOD*=20
implementations.

I won't discuss that. I will however point out that "possible" is not e=
nough.

Absolutely.

Oh, wow. Do you even understand the words that you use? I mean, "propri=
etary"?=20
It's documented, the code is open, the protocol has at least two FLOSS=20=

implementations. Seriously, what were you trying to achieve here?

No. They created a protocol that other networks implement. For example=20=

Friendica implements GNU Social's protocol, Diaspora's protocol and the=
ir own=20
(documented, opensourced) protocol. Red similarily.

Reading a bit on it would be a good idea.

> So keep calm and implement XMPP ;)

No. Come to The Federation assembly at #31C3, get involved in a more=20=

meaningful way than calling open protocols "proprietary" just because y=
ou=20
don't know them, and try working with quite a few projects that already=
=20
cooperate and federate with common *protocols* (not APIs).

The question is not "which protocol is better", because while we bikesh=
ed on=20
this question, people are still sitting on Failbroke and Shitter, inste=
ad of=20
moving out of these walled gardens.

The question is: "how can we *cooperate* to get people on the libre, fe=
derated=20
side of social networks". 1.5 year ago I submitted to all the fedsocnet=
 devs a=20
simple question, here's the link again:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fedsocweb/2013May/0058.html

The answer was: "impossiburu, we won't, not invented here, my protocol =
is=20
better than yours". So instead of trying to herd those cats, I am grabb=
ing the=20
opportunity arising from the fact that we already have The Federation. =
Let's=20
expand it and build upon it, eh?

Shouting "XMPP! XMPP!" is not helping.
