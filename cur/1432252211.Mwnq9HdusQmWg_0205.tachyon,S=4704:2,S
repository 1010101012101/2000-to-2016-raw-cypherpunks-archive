I'm convinced (for the moment) that the anonymity cost is going to kill the 
project. For http://minco.me (which I wrote in a fit of political speech), I
came to the conclusion that there must be some sort of 'local authority' as 
a 'method' to evaluate human-usable proof-of-work, and this would have to 
utilize the pre-existing legal and court infrastructure. If you can sue the
operator of a node fraudulently collecting 'proof of bandwidth' rewards for
theft, it might work.

However, in a global network with no clear idea where (or who) the node 
operators are, it's going to take a lot more human mathematical and crypto
work to prove bandwidth.

All that being said, I'm encouraged that there is wild-eyed optimism and 
excitement about what's possible, so between my pet project for per-packet
micropayments (I might as well call it IPv7), and bitcloud, we might collective
make enough mistakes to learn how to make it happen.
