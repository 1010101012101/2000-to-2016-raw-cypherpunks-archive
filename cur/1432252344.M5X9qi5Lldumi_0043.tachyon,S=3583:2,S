A friend of mine wonders if they had a Boeing flight simulator.
Apparently they would need to know how to disable the autopilot and do a
couple of other technobabble things a groundling like me doesn't
recognise. But with access to a training simulator they could learn
enough in a few days. Or so I am told.  

I suppose such machines are all over the place these days, Boeing having
more or less a monopoly on medium-large commercial passenger planes. So
there could be training facilities just about anywhere. I have no real
idea how rare and/or expensive they would be.
