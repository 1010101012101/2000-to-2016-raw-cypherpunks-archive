	As I predicted, quote: "And you're a Libertarian and I'm not, too!"

	Sigh. If you'd bothered to *read* my messages before writing
the above, you'd know that there is no secret and no mystery: John Young
forwarded private e-mail of mine to the list, and requested that I
make any other comments about the case not private, but public. Under
the circumstances, I didn't take offense from his concern, and was
willing to do as he wished. After all, I'm not the one in jail.
Or even a person testifying to put someone in jail. It's not a big deal.

	I occasionally read articles on list, from the web through
http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks. I've been following the Jim Bell
case off and on, and more closely since you were subpoenaed. Amusing
anecdote: At the start of CFP 2001, I was telling someone not to trust you,
that you "use" people, and they should avoid you at all costs. I said:
"Declan writes stories encouraging people to be sued, and then he writes
about the lawsuit". I could see they were dubious of my account. After
the subpoena, I said with a grin: "Remember what I told you? *BINGO*".

	Anyway, again, once John Young threw me into the flaming-pit,
I figured that as long I was de-lurked, I might as well ask a question
which for reasons of my own, has been on my mind much over the past
months. I didn't/don't understand why people who apparently feel
themselves at risk of serious Federal criminal prosecution, tolerate
someone who in the end sings like a canary every time he's called to
be a prosecution witness. Note it's not about what I think you should
have done, or how I'd judge it morally. I don't go around talking about 
a police state and overthrow of governments (even via cryptoanarchy).
I don't think I might be next on the defendant list in these sorts
of situations.

	Look, in countries where there really is a police state,
where there is real live revolution in the air, doing what you just
did is the sort of thing which runs the peril of being found one day in
a parking lot with a burning tire around your neck and wearing a sign
reading "I am a collaborator". I should hasten to add that I would 
oppose and denounce finding you in a parking lot with a burning tire
around your neck and wearing a sign reading "I am a collaborator".
It's bad for free speech :-). But the fact is, that's what can happen.

	Observe, I've given you the hardest time about your actions
(at least that's apparent). And the irony of that, is this case (_per se_)
isn't even a reason I think so poorly of you. No-one else even seems to
hold a grudge (well, maybe Jim Bell does, but that's it). You come out
of it smelling like roses. I'm trying to comprehend how you do it.

	This doesn't have a thing to do with Libertarianism or
Liberalism or "anti-cypherpunk".

P.P.S.: Repeat, kindly stay *far*, *far*, away from me in a situation where
I have a significant chance of becoming a defendant. I hope you understand.
