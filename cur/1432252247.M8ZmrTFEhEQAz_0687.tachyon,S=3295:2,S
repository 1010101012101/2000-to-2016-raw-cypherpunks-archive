Coercion: Why we listen to what "they" say.
Douglas Rushkoff
ISBN 1-57322-115-5 (1999)
$25 US

An interesting book by the author of Cyberia, and one which is nearly
diametrically opposite. What makes this book so interesting is the authors
about face with his past views.

"Coercion spotlights the manipulative sides of commerce today, with a
sobering look at its power in the Internet era. A must-read for anyone who
wants an antidote to techno-utopianism."

                                              Mitch Kapor
