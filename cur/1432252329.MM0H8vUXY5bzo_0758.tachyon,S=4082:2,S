I've done a simple chaffing and winnowing implementation, and would like
to invite everyone interested to have a look and give comments.

download: ftp://ftp.lemuria.org/pub/Code/Shaft-0.1.tar.gz

requires: openssl (for hmac)


the program consists of two parts: shaft will encode/decode, while
shaftsort will sort the chunk within a file. shaftsort has two purposes:
first, shaft relies on sorted input when decoding. second, the standard
shaft output is sorted by input files, which makes the whole chaffing
process more or less irrelevant.

bugs: some trailing zeros in final output, and shaftsort still retains
the "order by input file", which is a Bad Thing(tm). it should take all
the chunks with identical sequence numbers and resort them randomly or
by some arbitrary definition ("first 3 data bytes").


usage: see the test.sh or the source. basically, for encryption, shaft
wants input files and keys/passwords on the commandline. for decryption
it wants just one key. shaftsort is a filter (stdin to stdout).
