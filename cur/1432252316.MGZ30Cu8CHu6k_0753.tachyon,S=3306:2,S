Is that a practical way to prevent identify theft?
Almost any document can be forged and any user
information be determined. How does one really prevent
identity theft?

Thanks,
Sarad.

What else makes 20-somethings especially vulnerable to
identity theft?
The other thing is that they don't have a lot of prior
credit records, and credit card companies are really
anxious to give them credit cards. At  the same time
there is a lot of information about them on the
internet since they're in that age group where they
are used to creating web pages on Facebook and
MySpace. A lot of the information also came from
students routinely releasing their information by
putting it in their risumis. Why would anybody put a
social security number on his or her risumi? But  they
did.

All of this simplified creating a fraudulent student
credit card -- a name and address & a social security
number, and date of birth. The challenge of Identity
Angel was to find and combine this information from
the
 internet . It mines information including resumes off
the Internet and looks for ones that have the
information, social security number, date of birth,
etc.
 --
enough information to get a credit card in the
person's name. What does Identity Angel do with that
mined information? If it succeeds, the software then
tries to find an email address and  send [the victim]
an email letting them know we found this information.
