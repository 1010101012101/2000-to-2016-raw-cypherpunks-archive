May it please the court to spell Ed's name Feltun, or Feltren, or Fellwock,
or just et al.

Perry Fellwock wrote the anonymous 1972 Ramparts article that first
described Echelon. Ed Felten is Perry's namesake, though Ed believes
there's no connection between worldwide misspelling of Ed's last
name and getting a free-pass of Dictionary.

Perry Metzger is a different branch of the grammar diagram, find under
*PLONK*, always upper case, always bi-starred as if that would not
be data-mined as PAL-armed.
