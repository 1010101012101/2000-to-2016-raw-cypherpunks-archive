Gotta get that animal analogy stuff right. A viper is an honest to
goodness, fend for yourself, not on the dole, tooth and nail predator.
Perfectly respectable by any reasonable standard. The rent-seekers are
more accurately portrayed as something from a list of parasites : louse
tick flea tapeworm roundworm bilharzia mosquito deerfly botfly giardia.
Some of 'em have a pretty ghastly effect on the host - imaging growing
grubs under your skin or having your sphincter muscles eaten away
permanently from the inside. Yuk!

While I agree in principle that those with disabilities should be able
to participate in everything that society has to offer it seems
inherently dangerous to have the government mandate how this issue will
be addressed. I don't want to see paved roads into great wilderness
areas and I don't think an old building that doesn't meet modern
accessibility requirements should become a target for multimillion
dollar lawsuits. I don't know how to solve this thing and neither do
those who wrote the ADA.
