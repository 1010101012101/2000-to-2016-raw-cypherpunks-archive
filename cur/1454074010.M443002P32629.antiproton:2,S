Why doesn't the gleeful roasting extend to the bigotry and chauvinism on th=
is list? Why are these silently accepted?




Cypherpunks defines government as =E2=80=9Ca home for bullies masquerading =
as a collective defense.=E2=80=9D Interestingly, that is how I would descri=
be your above approach.




Be careful of becoming the oppressor.



Look around. Do the people around you look like you? Think like you? Come f=
rom the same background as you?




This is a problem. The lack of diversity in this group is not a magical phe=
nomenon without a root cause.



There is a deeper problem. If (and how) this should change is up to this co=
mmunity.




Sadly, the ideals of this community are often lost in the (typically incohe=
rent) bigotry spewing from the trolls.




4.12.4. "Crypto Anarchy sounds too wild for me."

=C2=A0- I accept that many people will find the implications of

=C2=A0crypto anarchy (which follows in turn from the existence of

=C2=A0strong cryptography, via the Crypto Anarchy Principle) to

=C2=A0be more than they can accept.

=C2=A0- This is OK (not that you need my OK!). The house of

=C2=A0Cypherpunks has many rooms.




All are welcome. I hope.

Wow. How fucking elitist can you be?=C2=A0
