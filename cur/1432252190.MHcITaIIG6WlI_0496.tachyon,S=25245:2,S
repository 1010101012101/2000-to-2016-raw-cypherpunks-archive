Just a  quick and abbreviated response:

In re what Ashcroft can do as head of the DoJ:  same thing they did after
the 14th Am- protect rkba and other rights, albeit they did it there
selectively.  I'd like to see the DoJ prosecute a gov. agency for denying a
citizen their 2A rights.  You can bet THAT case would make it up to SCOTUS
post-haste. Don't think that's likely, due to "pragmatism" and "compromise".
I am heartened to see Metaja denied advancement- we shall see how they
continue with Emerson, and if they pursue the current DoJ position...

In re Project Exile, sorry, but you did not really answer my questions.
While you don't mind if the fedgov usurps powers not enumerated to them if
the cause is 'worthwhile', ie, taking a gangbanger off the streets, I am
concerned more with the gov assuming powers that are not theirs- as heinous
as the criminals are, they wreak nowhere near the human carnage and misery
that governments unbound do- how much further down this slope are YOU
willing to tolerate our descent?  And, again, yeah, I know NRA says they are
only to use such laws against really really REALLY bad guys- but my point
is, and you have not refuted it, they CAN be applied to anyone.  To think
that a government, already operating extra-Constitutionally, is going to be
ever bound by the niceties of interpreting the application of their
"illegal" laws according to how the NRA wants them to do it, does not
compute with me.  I think your good intentions may just be paving the road
to Hell here- probably not under Bush, but what about under Pres. Hillary?
Sorry, no matter the motive, I just don't think the ends justify the means
here.

I don't recall advocating political firing squads, but as long as you bring
it up, let me add one qualifier- I hope you agree with me that their jury of
peers should be fully informed triers of law as well as fact?

That's it for me on this.  "Uncle!"

Best,
David
