Absolutely, yes; If you ask first for privacy, and there is a good 
option for privacy, then that's the correct answer.

Privacy without free software is a total joke.

Ergo, given a potentially spyware rich platform that *markets* itself as 
Private, as Google, Apple and Microsoft for example *all do*, or a free 
software platform which can be trivially and fairly-well rewritten to 
not be spyware-rich, you choose the latter.

It follows that for a privacy respecting laptop, you must necessarily 
begin with a laptop that can, to some degree of certainty, be wiped 
clean and installed with trustworthy software.

There are many options here; the FSF certify hardware that can be as 
blob-free as possible. There are also lots of pitfalls, because the 
Linux architecture in many places implicitly trusts the intentions of 
device firmwares; it's likely that memory checks aren't implemented well 
enough on so many layers that you can never be sure without literally 
CMOSing your own device control hardware.

Given all these options and pitfalls, draw a "sanity line" somewhere and 
pick some hardware that lets you do modern stuff without torturously 
long waits. In that short-list, the Librem still ranks quite well, I feel.
