The similar clothing is enough to charge with gang membership and invoke 
RICO.  Also, the 'black bloc' tactic has 'premeditated' written all over 
it.  I'd say these kids haven't provided more protection for themselves; 
on the contrary, they've raised the stakes.  The cops will have to arrest 
*more* people in order to deal with the bloc, but the people arrested 
when it happens are going to be charged with more serious crimes, like 
racketeering, conspiracy, and membership in a corrupt organization, than 
if they'd stuck with the simpler tactics.  And most of what they might 
otherwise have claimed as defenses are going to crumble under that 
'premeditation' thing.

I'm not a lawyer, and I don't play one on TV, but this just looks like 
a silly mistake that's going to bite them in the butt to me.
