In fact, isn't that a pretty good demonstration that the market(s?) in 
bitcoins work pretty well? Increased supply pushes the price down. Sure, 
the market might be shallow for now. But if this sort of reactivity 
holds even after greater adoption and depth, isn't that perhaps the best 
sign ever that the Coins are working as advertised?

Really the only thing I worry about is the zero reactivity of the other 
exchanges/markets to MTGox's fall. I would really like to see faster 
arbitrage in a currency I'm considering as one of my media of exchange.
