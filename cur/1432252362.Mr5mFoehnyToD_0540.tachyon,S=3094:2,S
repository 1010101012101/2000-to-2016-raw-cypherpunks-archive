The only way to defeat advanced biometrics is to not be physically present 
or to use anonymized telepresence devices. Because the latter is hardware, 
it is trivial to outlaw. Yeah, sure, you can make them yourself, and clean 
them from traces, assuming the components are available and unlabeled. In 
theory.

You can't trick an advanced biometrics fingerprint if you're being
scanned. Trying to shield some biometrics looks damn suspicious on your
own.

If you have solutions, spill them. I can't think of any.
