 >>I want to comment on something else here, which I find to be a common 
trait with US citizens: "it can't happen here". The Chinese gov't can do 
anything they like, because any citizen who would try to "keep watch" would 
find himself shot. What basic law of the universe says that this can't 
happen in the US? What exactly will prevent them, 10 years from now, to say 
"compelling state interests require that we get to do whatever we want with 
the little box"? You already have an official "gov't against 1st 
ammendment" policy, from what I've read. Mark
I hear Luke and John are concerned as well,Peter?
