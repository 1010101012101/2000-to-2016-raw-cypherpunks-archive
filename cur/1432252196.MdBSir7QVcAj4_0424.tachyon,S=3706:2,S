And what's so special about your website that viewers couldn't find the
same content elsewhere, or would be willing to turn out viewing the ads
just for your site?

If someone's actively filtering out ads from your site, it is of course
your right to not let them have access, but it's not likely that they 
would bend over backwards to tell JunkBusters or one of the other filters
to let them view your banners.  So unless you have some unique and very
compelling/attractive content, you're just going to alienate more users.

And setting a cookie on a web tracking GIF is not likely to win you any
friends either.  Look at it this way, if they're filtering banner ads,
they're likely filtering cookies also.  Even if you redirect them to a 
page that says "To view my great wonderous site, turn on cookies and
allow banner ads" you are now forcing users to go through even more 
contortions.

At which point the smarter ones will realize that they need a specific
cookie, and will just set it by hand.

At which point you're likely going to set up dynamic cookies to keep
them from reusing old ones, and at which point, someone will add a
patch to JunkBusters to allow you to set your cookie, start and abort
the downloading of banner ads, and then you're fucked again, until
you write an Apache module that checks for aborted banner ads, ad
nauseum, etc...

Ho indeed.
