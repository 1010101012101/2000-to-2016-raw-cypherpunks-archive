Oh, what happened to the free market? Let those who flourish be the ones
who can manage the new 'species'...

CDR:'s in the header, messages too long, messages of the right format, not
using the right font, doing 'forwards' instead of 'reply to', not editing
replies according to the 'group will', using different editors which
impliment different attachment protocols, etc., etc.

I say screw all you over bearing anal retentive techno-luddites...
