"In fact, a *moral* argument can be made that restraint of that
information is more fraud than trading on that information to begin
with. Morally -- if morality caused markets and not the other way
around :-) --  "insiders" should be *obligated* to trade on "inside"
information as soon as they believe that information to be true."

To some extent this is already touted as a long-term issue here on Wall 
Street.

The biggest example is when one company is doing "due diligence" when 
contemplating a purchase of another. During that process that have a (legal) 
level of access to information that does not exist elsewhere. During that 
time, then, they have the info-advantage that can be directly exploited 
during the deal and that causes bizarre pricing.

As I've said before, if we had a true blacknet, where even options could be 
traded, then no deal would ever suffer from the advantage of hidden 
info...they'd all be priced far more fairly, and the little 401K retirees 
would actually benefit greatly.



As for the notion of a state being INHERENTLY "evil", I'm still not 
convinced. At least, if I WANT to be butt-humped by the state, then it's OK, 
right?
