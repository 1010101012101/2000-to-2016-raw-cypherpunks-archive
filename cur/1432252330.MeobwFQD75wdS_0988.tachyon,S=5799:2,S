Are you one thirty second Indian, or one sixty fourth?

Bunkum:

The Chocktaw owned black slaves and grew cotton.  The slaves, the
fields, and the cotton belonged to individual Chocktaw, not to the
tribe.

How do you think the horse became extinct in the Americas, the
mammoths, and all the rest?

Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very
large number of buffalo and ate only the tongues.

The South American Indians had better technology than the North American 
Indians, and killed almost everything larger than a dog.  If the North 
American Indians had had metal, would have killed everthing larger than 
a rabbit.

Colonel Calloway, at the urging of Daniel Boone, purchased the south
side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.

This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.

If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible
way.
