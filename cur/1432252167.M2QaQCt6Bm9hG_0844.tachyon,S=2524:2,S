I wasn't suggesting the authorities have access to your vote. The role of
the authorities is to provide the polling/vote-verification facility and to
enforce physical security.  You would keep your receipt private, using it
for two purposes: 1. To unlock a voter registration record to be used by the
authorities to verify your physical credentials.
2. Having been verified as the true owner of the receipt, to allow you to
view your vote detail in private.
