Hm, whatever works, I guess. Sheer stealth isn't as much a factor for me as is
accuracy, reliability and being able to avoid the "woman with a peashooter"
image. All rhetoric aside (but with all that in mind) I've actually been
thinking of getting a 9mm, something along the lines of a Glock 26, a Kahr P9
or maybe a Sig-Sauer P239. Any thoughts? 

I know there's no substitute for getting out there and firing them at a range
to see what I'm comfortable with, but if anyone has any recommendations,
better suggestions, which 9mm to avoid, etc. I'd appreciate it.
