that has been my understanding as well. basically after worked a bit 
with the guys who pushed it in the Fenfire project (in 2002).

i've understood that basically by using URIs as references to assets we 
get that: URLs for current http stuff and location independent URNs with 
distributed things like p2p networks. seems that Tahoe also uses "short 
URI-like strings" - dunno why 'URI-like' and not just URIs but anyway :) 
.. also as SL and OpenSim already uses UUIDs i guess some things are 
basically kind of ready for this.

http://www.ht03.org/papers/pdfs/24.pdf is about the work in that area i 
was interested back long ago, dunno about the current implementations 
whether Tapestry, that Tahoe or something I haven't heard of is the 
thing, but i guess the basic idea is the same. in that Fenfire Storm the 
idea was to use content based hashes as IDs of files (like images), 
similar to Freenode -- the goal not being anonymous publishing in a 
secure p2p net, but instead having a nice storage system for both local 
own files and publishing them on the net. goals included the secure 
storage via redundancy, that seems to be emphasized in Tahoe and is 
indeed a great motivation for these things.

looking forward to learning more, perhaps by testing Tahoe
