Amusingly, Robert Anton Wilson claims in his book "Everything is 
Under Control: Conspiracies, Cults, and Cover-Ups," the following:

"It has even been suggested that Pynchon is a pen name for T.C. May 
(see Crypto Anarchy)."

The fact that both TRP and myself lived in the small coastal town of 
Aptos during the same years is mere coinci-dance. The fact that 
Wilson lives in a nearby town, Capitola, is another coinci-dance. The 
fact that his daughters live on the ridge opposite mine is also 
coinci-dance. The fact that Dr. Bob Newport, one of the original 
slackers, lives nearby is also just an example of there being a lot 
of slack in this area.

(The true site for much of "Vineland," not the Mendocino forests so 
often claimed. Wanda Tinasky lives!)
