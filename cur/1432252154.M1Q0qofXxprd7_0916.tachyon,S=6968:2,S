News from the Farm Worker Movement(www.ufw.org):
For 14 years, workers at Picksweet Mushroom Farms in Ventura County
north of Los Angeles have tried to negotiate a United Farm Workers
contract. Picksweet has ignored its workers desires and violated a host of
state labor laws.
* A detailed nine-count complaint issued on June 26, 2001 by prosecutors
with California's Agricultural Labor Relations Board cited Picksweet for
bad faith bargaining and illegally conspiring to get rid of the union.
* Pictsweet was recently fined $7,475 by the Oregon Occupational Safety and
Health Division for safety violations at its Salem plant. One of them
caused Enrique Diaz Lupian, 46, to lose his right hand in an accident.
Other workers in both Oregon and California have been disciplined or fired
for supporting unions.
* On Sept. 4, 2001, the state of California filed another complaint against
Picksweet for firing Ventura, Calif. mushroom worker Fidel Andrade because
he exercised his right to organize and support the UFW.
Conditions at Picksweet in Ventura are cruel and dangerous. Mushroom
workers labor in dark and damp rooms. Floors are slippery. They only have
the lights on their helmets to guide them. Many suffer vision problems.
Such conduct is why workers have called for a boycott of Picksweet
mushrooms. Picksweet has lost many major customers, including Vons and
Safeway supermarkets, and Pizza Hut restaurants.
Picksweet workers ask consumers to help them ensure Vons and Safeway
continue to keep Picksweet mushrooms off their shelves until a union
contract with the Ventura, Calif. plant is signed.

Scotland Yard probes A-tests
By CHRISTINE MIDDAP in London
29dec01
SCOTLAND Yard has launched a criminal investigation into Britain's atomic 
bomb tests on Christmas Island off Australia's northwest coast in the 1950s.
The inquiry centres on claims from the widow of British RAF pilot Eric 
Denson that military chiefs ordered him to fly his plane through a mushroom 
cloud several times to collect radioactive samples for scientists in 1958.
More than 22,000 British servicemen were involved in, or witnessed, 21 
atomic bomb tests in Australia, Christmas Island and other Pacific Islands 
between 1952 and 1958, according to a report in British newspaper The 
Guardian.
The police inquiry will look at whether it was legal for military chiefs to 
order Mr Denson to fly through the radioactive cloud.
His widow, Shirley, claims the British Government knowingly and maliciously 
exposed her husband to deadly levels of radiation, which ultimately led to 
his death.
Mr Denson, who developed chronic respiratory and psychological illnesses, 
committed suicide in 1976.
He told his father that as he battled to control the plane in the powerful 
mushroom cloud, the Tennyson lines: "Into the jaws of Death, into the mouth 
of Hell," kept going through his mind. Electrical fitter Ken Sutton, now 
dead, said in a statement that he took recordings from the radioactively 
"hot" plane the day after Mr Denson's flight.
He said in a statement that he was scared to death of the radiation: "You 
couldn't see it, you couldn't smell it, you couldn't touch it or anything, 
but you knew damn well it was a killer," he said.
Other servicemen have told of their horror at witnessing a nuclear 
explosion on Christmas Island.
Royal Engineers sapper Ken McGinley, then aged 20, said he and others were 
ordered to sit on a beach before the April 1958 explosion and jam their 
fists into their eyes.
But when he heard the blast he opened his eyes and saw the bones of his 
hands light up like an X-ray.
"The noise was deafening, like a thousand horses thundering towards you. 
The man next to me broke down and cried," he told The Guardian.
The servicemen were ordered not to reveal any information about the tests, 
but their resolve fractured by the 1980s when they started to develop 
illnesses and cancers believed to have been caused by the tests
The plutonium is in the post Tim.boil away.
