Yes, but I think Justin is mistaking my meaning.  In order for the
trial to be fair and valid, it must adhere to certain standards, some
of which I enumerated.  They are not necessarily US procedures, per se.
Based on these discussions, I think it is clear that the war crimes
tribunal should be composed of elected Iraqi judges.   This would have
the advantage of adding democratic legitimacy to the process so that the
result would be widely accepted, something terribly lacking in any
proceeding under US auspices.  Moreover, this solution addresses US
exceptions to the international courts as well, since the case would be
heard in US-occupied Iraq.
