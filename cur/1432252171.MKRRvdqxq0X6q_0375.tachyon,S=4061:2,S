I've searched for other references to this and haven't found any... I 
work at a very large ISP and because of my job function, I would need 
to (a) know about such an order; (b) supervise its implementation; 
and (c) actively monitor compliance with it.

And I can tell you that we've received no such order or even had a 
sniff that one was coming down (and yes, we do get served by various 
LEAs to disclose account details and account contents -- but they 
have always been specific court orders in the past; and no, no one 
has shown up with a Carnivore box under the arm asking us if they 
could plug it into the nearest router port).

In addition to the blanket statement that Baker makes, there's also 
the suspicion that he doesn't really understand the subject.... what 
does he mean by "CALEA compliance"? Does he mean archiving packet 
data (if so, the notion is ludicrous)? Does he mean archiving just 
email POP3 contents? Does he mean archiving web/ftp space? What about 
colo boxes?

CALEA as it applies to voice networks (packet switched or not -- most 
voice networks are packet switched already, just not necessarily IP 
packets) is really an expression of two specific things: a) 
transaction logging detail (Acme calls Beta on a specific date and 
time and for a specific duration) and b) the ability to easily and 
quickly get copies of the packet stream (the voice conversations and 
any data associated with them or in them) to a centralized 
distribution at which such data is made available to the LEAs. But 
this is a different thing entirely from data IP packet networks.

So is this guy (Stu Baker) just blowing smoke?
