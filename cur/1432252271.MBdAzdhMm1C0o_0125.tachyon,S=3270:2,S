There will be a PGP key-signing party held during the
Advanced Linux Users Meeting on Wednesday January 17,
2001 from 8:30pm to 9:00pm at the Market Street Pub
in Gainesville, Florida.

Full details at:

	http://www.cryptnet.net/events/pgp-party-1.html

Graphs of the Web of Trust formed at the last keysigning party
in Gainesville are available from:

	http://www.cryptnet.net/people/vab/dog/

We would be grateful for participation by individuals/cypherpunks
in other parts of the state.  Linking together the different
webs of trust in the State of Florida and surrounding areas
would be a significant accomplishment.

Please forward this note to anyone who may be interested in
attending.


	- VAB
