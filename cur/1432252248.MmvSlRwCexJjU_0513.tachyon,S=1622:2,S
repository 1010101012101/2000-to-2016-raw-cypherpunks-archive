Thank you for your response, however (for the record) that code requires

at least a 16bit CPU.  From bnlib.doc (an amusing read, BTW):

It is written in C, and should compile on any platform with an ANSI C
compiler and 16 and 32-bit unsigned data types

"Small" is defined as less than 65536, the minimum 16-bit word size
supported by the library.
