                        The Judge in the case was a Carter appointee who

                        came out of retirement just to hear Al’s case.
Judge
                        Tanner’s behavior in the trial created a court
transcript
                        that can only be described as Kafkaesque. There
is not
                        a single page that does not reflect judicial
abuse and
                        misconduct.
