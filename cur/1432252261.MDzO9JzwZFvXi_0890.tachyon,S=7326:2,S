Police have found the former leader of the Victorian branch of the 
Manufacturing Workers Union (MWU), Craig Johnston, has no case to answer in 
relation to allegations of sexual assault.
Dirty tricks in the Union movement?

Psychological warfare includes propaganda (also known simply as 'media'), 
work in youth and student organizations, work in labour organizations 
(trade unions, etc.), work in professional and cultural groups and in 
political parties. Paramilitary operations include infiltration into denied 
areas, sabotage, economic warfare, personal harassment, air and maritime 
support, weaponry, training and support for small armies.
Closely related to paramilitary operations are the disruptive activities 
known as militant action. Through organization and support of 'goon squads' 
sometimes composed of off-duty policemen, for example, or the militant 
sections of friendly political parties, stations attempt to intimidate 
communists and other extreme leftists by breaking up their meetings and 
demonstrations. The Technical Services staff of the DDP makes a variety of 
weapons and devices for these purposes. Horrible smelling liquids in small 
glass vials can be hurled into meeting halls. A fine clear powder can be 
sprinkled in a meeting-place becoming invisible after settling but having 
the effect of tear-gas when stirred up by the later movement of people. An 
incendiary powder can be moulded around prepared tablets and when ignited 
the combination produces ample quantities of smoke that attacks the eyes 
and respiratory system much more strongly than ordinary tear-gas. A 
tasteless substance can be introduced to food that causes exaggerated body 
colour. And a few small drops of a clear liquid stimulates the target to 
relaxed, uninhibited talk. Invisible itching powder can be placed on 
steering wheels or toilet seats, and a slight smear of invisible ointment 
causes a serious burn to skin on contact. Chemically processed tobacco can 
be added to cigarettes and cigars to produce respiratory ailments.
Increasingly, as the oppressed in capitalist society comprehend the myth of 
liberal reform, their ruling minorities have no choice but to increase 
repression in order to avert socialist revolution. Eliminate CIA stations, 
US military missions, AID Public Safety missions and the 'free' trade-union 
programmes and those minorities would disappear, faster perhaps, than they 
themselves would imagine.
How fitting that over the rubble of the CIA's old temporary buildings back 
in Washington, the new building that rose was called 'Watergate'.
When the Watergate trials end and the whole episode begins to fade, there 
will be a movement for national renewal, for reform of electoral practices, 
and perhaps even for reform of the FBI and the CIA. But the return to our 
cozy self-righteous traditions should lure no one into believing that the 
problem has been removed. Reforms attack symptoms rather than the disease, 
and no other proof is needed than the Vietnam War and Watergate to 
demonstrate that the disease is our economic system and its motivational 
patterns.
Reforms of the FBI and the CIA, even removal of the President from office, 
cannot remove the problem. American capitalism, based as it is on 
exploitation of the poor, with its fundamental motivation in personal 
greed, simply cannot survive without force - without a secret police force. 
The argument is with capitalism and it is capitalism that must be opposed, 
with its CIA, FBI and other security agencies understood as logical, 
necessary manifestations of a ruling class's determination to retain power 
and privilege.
Now, more than ever, each of us is forced to make a conscious choice 
whether to support the system of minority comfort and privilege with all 
its security apparatus and repression, or whether to struggle for real 
equality of opportunity and fair distribution of benefits for all of 
society, in the domestic as well as the international order. It's harder 
now not to realize that there are two sides, harder not to understand each, 
and harder not to recognize that like it or not we contribute day in and 
day out either to the one side or to the other.
