Indeed it is appearing more so, I found a link to this on CNN.com's front
page http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/27/nyt.nyt.friedman/index.html .
First non-bolded sentence "As far as I'm concerned, we do not need to find
any weapons of mass destruction to justify this war." It's becoming clear
that many people in the US simply wanted to beat someone up. The
justification for this war simply hasn't materialized and now at least one
reporter has clearly stated that it doesn't matter.
