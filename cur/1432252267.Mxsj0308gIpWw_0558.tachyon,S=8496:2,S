For this to be taken seriously one must be able to -define spam- as if it
were a mathematical entity (eg a 'point'). It must be absolutely
differentiable from -all- other speech.

You can't do that, nobody can.

Anti-spam bills are worse than spam because they put transient feelings of
anger above the principles of freedom.

Freedom is -not- free!
