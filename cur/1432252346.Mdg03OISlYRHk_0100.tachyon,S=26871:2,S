"Are they just basically saying we just can't travel without identity
papers? If that's true, then I'd rather see us go through a real debate
that says we want to introduce required identity papers in our society
rather than trying to legislate it through the back door through
regulations that say there's not any other way to get around,"

Actually, that's a very interesting comment. In a way, it harkens to the 
open source movement: The secrecy of these laws is precisely what weakens 
security, as folks a little more active-minded than bureaucrats will get a 
chance to think about the problem.

And of course, if just one terrorist gets a hold of those secret laws, 30 
minutes after that all of them will have a copy while the rest of us (trying 
NOT to get blown up) will be at a distinct disadvantage. But then again, 
maybe that's no coincidence...government seems to have a knack for finding 
reasons for itself to exist...
