<http://www.harveysilverglate.com/Books/ThreeFeloniesaDay.aspx>

Three Felonies a Day is the story of how citizens from all walks of
life—doctors, accountants, businessmen, political activists, and
others—have found themselves the targets of federal prosecutions, despite
sensibly believing that they did nothing wrong, broke no laws, and harmed
not a single person. From the perspective of both a legal practitioner who
has represented the wrongfully-accused, and of a legal observer who has
written about these trends for the past four decades, Three Felonies a Day
brings home how individual liberty is threatened by zealous crusades from
the Department of Justice. Even the most intelligent and informed citizen
(including lawyers and judges, for that matter) cannot predict with any
reasonable assurance whether a wide range of seemingly ordinary activities
might be regarded by federal prosecutors as felonies.
