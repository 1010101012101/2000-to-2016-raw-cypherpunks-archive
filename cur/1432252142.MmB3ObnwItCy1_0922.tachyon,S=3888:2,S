I don't understand this last paragraph at all.  If you put a proxy on
amazon.hackeddomain.com and I connect through the proxy to the real
amazon.com, where is the threat?  If the SSL connection is established
with the proxy, then the X.509 certificate on that host does not match
www.amazon.com and the connection would not verify.  If the connection
is proxied to the real www.amazon.com the SSL connection will verify,
and because it is protected end to end the proxy will not be able to
do anything other than disconnect the connection at an arbitrary
time.  There is no man in the middle attack here.
