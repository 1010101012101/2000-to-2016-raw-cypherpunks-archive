So from your reply, I'll assume the answer to my "So are you finally
evolving?" question is still No.

I, and everyone in the world, is aware that commerce != capitalism, and
that you are avoiding the question.  As there are no CACL promoters
(except in Choate') it is not possible for them to suppose
otherwise.  Even in Choate' CACL promoters are aware that commerce !=
capitalism.

Capitalism is of course the system that allows commerce to happen.  
Commerce is not legally possible in a communist or fascist system as such
a system does not allow private ownership.

You still have avoided the question of the ants and the grasshopper.  To
quote you again:

> And no, a meritocracy isn't disriminatory. You get what you put into it,
> not what somebody else thinks it's worth.

So by this answer you are stating that the grasshopper merits death and
the ants merit survival.  There is no amount of twisting you can perform
to escape this, other than a retraction of your statements.

As such a system (a meritocracy) necessitates the reward of those who
perform work and the demise of those who do not, socialism does not fit in
here.  You don't get a C- and get to pass in a meritocracy.  You work and
survive, or don't and die.

One good example of a meritocratic system is capitalism.  You work or you
have money, you make money, you get to buy food, you get to buy/rent
shelter, you get to attract mates and thus propagate.  You don't work and
you have no money, you don't get to survive.

Therefore by your statement above that you have no problem with a
meritocracy, and my statement that capitalism is a meritocracy, you have
to agree that you also have no problem with capitalism.

Notice, I did not say greed.

Nor does Merriam Webster mention greed in the definition of capitalism.
