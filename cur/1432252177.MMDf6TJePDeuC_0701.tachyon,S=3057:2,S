Check http://developer.axis.com/products/mcm/ - this looks like a good
chip. Together with embedded Linux it could be pretty useful for this
purpose, could shorten the development time considerably. For $249 they
offer a readymade developer board.

Has built-in Ethernet and serial ports, and with a chip like FT8U232AM it
could work with USB as well.
