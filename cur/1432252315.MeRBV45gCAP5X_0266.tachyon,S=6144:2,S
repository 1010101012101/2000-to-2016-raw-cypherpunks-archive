>This is an unusual case. The Ohio law -- a 1970s version of which Politech

>http://www.moralityinmedia.org/obsclawlinks.htm#oh
>"No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance 
>involved, shall do any of the following... Create, reproduce, or publish 
>any obscene material that has a minor as one of its participants or 
>portrayed observers... Buy, procure, possess, or control any obscene 
>material, that has a minor as one of its participants..."
>
>Anyone who possesses such a visual or written description -- including a 
>diary entry or an erotic story -- is guilty of a felony. That means 
>Ohioans who have on their hard drive an "obscene" text file from 
>alt.sex.stories are felons.
