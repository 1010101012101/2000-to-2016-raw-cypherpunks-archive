 This is a loaded statement. Money laundering is only a concern in so far
as it means government control over the economy is diminished. (And to the
extent that it allows one to seize the funds a their title converts the to
United States at the instant of commission).

 Money laundering is a "tack on" offense. (Much like, say, mail fraud). The
number of original cases which derive from actual money laundering
investigation is vanishingly small. Instead it is usually added on to an
indictment when the defendant is or has been under investigation for
something else.

 Because money laundering statutes are generally phrased something like
"knowingly concealing the proceeds of a criminal act," usually you find the
criminal act first and then look to see if attempts were made to conceal
the funds. Professional money launderers are rarely caught.

 I disagree rather strongly. Currently the favorate method is to hand the
cash, in bulk, to the professional money launderer who, on the spot, cuts a
clean bank check (perhaps from a reputable import/export or realestate
company) for the cash amount minus fee (5-20% usually). The launderer takes
all the risk in the process, including smuggling the funds out, hashing
them through iterations and (usually) returning them right back into the
United States as legitimate overseas investment. It's like the separation
of capital and management skill. The money launderer is free to concentrate
100% of his time to managing his extensive laundering empire, the hundreds
or thousands of shells and webs of accounts and maintains the liquidity to
drop 5 million on the notice of a phone call.

 The $750 limit is going to do about nothing for the problem of money money
laundering. It will inconvenience the casual launderer, and that is about
all. What it will do is put a significant cost on the head of the consumer.
A CTR costs a bank between $5 and $15 to file today (according to the ABA).
$17 if you listen to the Report of the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering.

 In 1993 the 368 largest banks (assets over $1 billion) filed 4.5 million
CTRs. The cost was estimated at $72 million dollars. (John Byrne, General
Counsel, American Bankers Association). 10,765,000 CTRs were filed in 1994.
About .5% are marked "suspicious."

 Now the $750 limit? The number of reports to be filed is staggering and
.5% is beyond government to police properly without 5,000 new hires. No,
clearly the $750 limit is not to catch money launderers, but to create and
perpetuate detailed transactions record keeping.

 FinCEN is much more useful to link transactions to defendents in non-money
laundering cases. "What do you mean you weren't in California in May? Our
records show you accepted two wire transfers there on the 15th and the
16th."

 And consider this. If I build a machine which has a 95% accuracy rate in
detecting money laundering, that is to say that it will identify a given
transaction as money laundering or legitimate with 95% accuracy, I still
have a serious problem. Given 10,000 transactions, with .2% (20)
representing money laundering we find the following figures: 19 (95% of 20)
money laundering transactions will be flagged as illegal 1 (5% of 20)
laundering transaction will be incorrectly flagged as legal. 500 (5% of
10,000) legitimate transactions will be incorrectly flagged as illegal.

 For every one money laundering transaction flagged there will be 26
legitimate transactions flagged and only about 3.6% of all the flagged
transactions will actually be illegitimate. Now consider all this in
context. There are over 700,000 wire transfers a day amounting to over $2
trillion. About half go through FedWIRE and CHIPS. SWIFT is harder to count.

 The most pro-government figures have somewhere on the order of $400bln a
YEAR being laundered. The figure I used above (.2% of transactions are
money laundering) is high by orders of magnitude. Depending on who's
figures you use it's more like 0.008%.

 What you do not address is what is wrong with money laundering. Money
laundering was never a crime until 1986 in the United States, [Money
Laundering Control Act of 1986 (Codified @ sections 1956 and 1957 of Title
17 of the U.S. Code)] and then only made so because it fit in the "war on
drugs."

 The result: Total financial transparency in the U.S. Money laundering is a
created offense. Also consider that becuase current efforts to curb money
laundering are basically useless, you may see identity checking anyhow.
(The $750 limit is basicially an identity checking provision already).
Money laundering is a crime because the drug market in the United States is
so substantial it is impossible to police it without following the money.
You can't do that unless you have near financial transparency.

 Deep down even you seem to recognize that Money Laundering has nothing to
do with catching criminals. It's all about control and revenue. The feds
would do better to concentrate intelligence assets (more so than now) on
counter narcotics and do their best to schedule raids to seize cash when
it's sitting around than to track every transaction on the planet. I don't
have it here, but if anyone is interested I had a report on the costs of
Money Laundering enforcement I can try and dig up.

 One of the interesting figures was the number of dollars spent to stop one
dollar from being laundered (Around $35,000 as I recall) and the number
spent to seize one dollar of laundered money (Around $110,000).
