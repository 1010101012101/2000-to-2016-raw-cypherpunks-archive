A very local jammer won't. You underestimate how weak GPS signals are

GPS will be obsolete in urban environments in less than a decade. Jamming UWB
is much more difficult, since being local -- especially if the target doesn't
cooperate (you don't know the PRNG state).

And of course you can't send without revealing your position if location
services are locked into the protocol. Use onion routing, then.
