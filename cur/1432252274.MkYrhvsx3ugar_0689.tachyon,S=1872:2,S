Here we go again.  Get ready for more FUD from the LEO's, I can see Fox
news now.  "Cypherpunks a hotbed of crypto-anarchist scum is now being
used by Al Qaeda to setup new terrorist attacks..."  Expect to see a
sidebar about "rogue" or "evil" anonymous remailers and how they're
un-patriotic, etc.

Bah, some feeb had too one too many Crappachino's with lunch today and
pulled a Cornholio.... :(  

A few years ago it was requests on how to make bombs, now it's this shit.
