"We hope that the mislabelling of Freegate is a simple mistake, soon 
rectified,
rather than yet another example of an IT firm helping Beijing implement
restrictions."

I'd say this was naive, but they give an example after this that shows they 
know the score. Symantec wants in to China and their $$$, and Jong Nan Hai 
holds the key.

Hum. Seems the Chinese government is pretty effective at self-preservation. 
Does this contradict the widely-held Cypherpunk belief in the inevitability 
of deterioration of the state?

Perhaps from a Crypto-anarchy perspective, there's a bootstrap point: once 
there exceeds a certain level of state info-control, it's very hard to get 
rid of it. Below that level it seems the state can't hold on. (Perhaps W is 
a little smarter than we thought!)
