Hans is either being coy or naif.    Of course he wasn't on our side;
he was after the facts, not revenge, or colonialism.

One wonders about the mindset of the UN folks.  Don't they realize
they are 0wn3d?   Or at least herded?   Perhaps I underestimate
the human capacity for idealism, or gullibility.

In any case, it should be clear why the US 'tolerates' the UN
and planted its HQ in NYC.  A fine source of PR sometimes,
and a good source of intel other times.  Rather tough for the
UN counterintel force I imagine.

PS: what's the price of gas masks in Athens these days?
