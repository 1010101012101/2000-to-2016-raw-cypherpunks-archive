My unscientific observations 
are that there's at least 6 or 8 different formats.

Some are pretty long, i.e.:

>Subject: RE: your medications                             fygbzdwvyyjqvvpnj  uyaecf ixoimctgdtrn kwqs mxatjr

(that one could be encrypted text)

others are short or have only numbers.

My favorite spam-obfuscation technique is where they break up key words
with HTML comments, i.e. pen<!--Mary had a little la-->is.
(that won't show if you are using a mail reader that
interprets HTML... read the source).
