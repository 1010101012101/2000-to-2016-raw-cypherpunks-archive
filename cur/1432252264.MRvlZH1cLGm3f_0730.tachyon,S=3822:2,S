The difference between Stalinists and Trots is that the Trots
were from the beginning more extreme, more brutal, and more
contemptuous of ordinary Russians.  The original point of
dispute between Stalin and Trotsky was that Trotsky though
Stalin was too soft on the kulaks.  The moderate faction in
Russia were the Zinovievists.  No one outside Russia thought
himself a Zinovievist, all identifying with the more extreme,
not less extreme, factions of Soviet communism.

There once upon a time was difference between those you
falsely call anarchists, and the commies, but after the
incompatibility between anarchism and socialism was
demonstrated in 1936-1938, the difference vanished.  Chomsky
illustrates this well.  Wherever the masters boot smashes
repeatedly into the face of a child, we can always rely on
Chomsky to find a good word for the master, and demonize the
child as a CIA agent. Chomsky defended the Pol Pot regime in
Cambodia, the slave labor camps employed to pacify South
Vietnam, rationalized the Soviet reinvasion of Czechoslovakia
and Hungary as defence against US aggression, and supported
Stalin's attacks on Greece.
