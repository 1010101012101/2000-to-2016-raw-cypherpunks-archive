Has been for years. Most fertilizer sold to the proles  at garden supply 
stores is now stuff like ammonium sulfate.

It used to be that all it took to order fuming nitric was a phone call 
and a credit card number to a chemical supply house. I expect (but don't 
know) that this is no longer quite so easy to do. Probably more due to 
the proliferation of meth labs than fears about bomb-making--lots of 
"precursors" and "ingredients" are now less available.

(Turns out my little area of canyons and hills has had three major meth 
lab busts in the past two years. Those with access to deep newspaper 
archives online, more than what Google offers, can search on these 
roads: Eureka Canyon Road, Corralitos Ridge Road, Eno Lane, and Redwood 
Gulch. Meth labs out the wazoo are tucked-into these hollers. Local cops 
say that for every one busted, there are likely to be 5 others. Crystal, 
ice, rock, crank...)
