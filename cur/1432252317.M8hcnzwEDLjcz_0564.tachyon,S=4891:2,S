What????

Chambers defines geodesic as "the shortest line on a surface between two
points on it" and that is precisely the meaning in general relativity.
Saying that it has anything to do with distributed systems is making it
up as you go along.

And if RAH is now going to claim that's what he meant then he's making
it up as he goes along, too (well, we knew that anyway, but redefining
geodesic in this way is going too far).

Cheers,

Ben.
