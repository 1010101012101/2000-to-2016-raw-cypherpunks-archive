	There never was a Mac version.

	For two years we've been hearing "We're working on it".

	Now the story is "Due to strong customer preference for the 
Windows platform, there are no longer any plans to release Freedom 
Internet Privacy Suite for Macintosh.".

	Huh, funny that. Of course their customers prefer Windows, 
THEY NEVER HAD A MAC CLIENT.

	And now they've discontinued Linux support.

	Typical.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
