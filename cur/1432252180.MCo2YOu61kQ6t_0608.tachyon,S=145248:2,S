Dear Mr. Greenberg, Forbes Magazine=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 You've been =
mighty silent, not sending me a single email since the one (November 18, 20=
13) which is quoted below.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Apart from correcting your egr=
egious error, claiming that I had fired "all" of my attorneys (when in fact=
 I hadn't been successful at firing even a single one!), I also quote below=
 my accusations against government employees in regard to phony, fake, forg=
ed 'appeal' case 99-30210, as well as my more recent allegations (albeit of=
 a much older event) concerning the government sneakily commandeering the a=
ddress 7302 Corregidor, in order to spy on me.=C2=A0 The average 'journalis=
t', at least ones that actually consider themselves to be real journalists,=
 would be very interested in this kind of material.=C2=A0 But you are not e=
ven interested enough to ask simple follow-up questions.=C2=A0 Why is that?=
=C2=A0 I think I know the answer:=C2=A0 You consider yourself, now, aligned=
 with precisely the people who committed these crimes against me during the
 period of 1995 through 2013.=C2=A0 You yourself admitted in an article to =
having contacted the government:=C2=A0 Alone that would not necessarily be =
a problem, but I think you realized that if you did any effort to help expo=
se the government guys, they would be hostile to you.=C2=A0=C2=A0 That's wh=
y you haven't investigated, and that's why nearly two months later you have=
n't even emailed to me,, despite the fact that I previously cc'd this mater=
ial to you.=C2=A0 Perhaps you are terrified that some day soon, you will yo=
urself be the center of a scandal, "What did Andy Greenberg know, and when =
did he know it, and why didn't he investigate further?".=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0=C2=

 here to screw you=0A =0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 One clue would come from my sus=
picion that agents of the Federal government, in March 1995, lured away the=
 former resident of 7302 Corregidor (see=C2=A0 http://www.redfin.com/WA/Van=
couver/7302-Corregidor-Rd-98664/home/14565030=C2=A0 ), the house immediatel=
y to the east of mine, and bought that house.=C2=A0 =0A(In the picture prov=
ided, my house at 7214 Corregidor is just to the =0Aleft of the house shown=
.)=C2=A0=C2=A0 The prior resident was a local school (high =0Aschool?) scie=
nce teacher, and he was hired at the Pacific Northwest =0ANational Laborato=
ries in Richland Washington, a Federal government =0Alaboratory akin to Oak=
 Ridge, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, etc. =C2=A0http://www.pnl.gov/=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The purpose of this was to be able to acqui=
re that house, and use it as a =0Aspying location against me. (The names os=
tensibly buying the house were =0ADaniel J. and Dori J. Saban, and they ran=
 a remodeling operation named "Sundown Development Construction =0ACorporat=
ion".=C2=A0 http://www.sundowndevelopmentconstruction.com/ =C2=A0 ) =C2=A0 =
Note that the date the house was sold is shown as March 10, =0A1995.=C2=A0 =
(This is odd, because school teachers' lives are oriented around =0Athe 'sc=
hool year', which in most locations in America go from about =0ASeptember 1=
 to about June 1.=C2=A0 They sign contracts with the school to =0Awork for =
that year, and are bound to do so. =C2=A0 While I don't recall when =0Athe =
prior, lured occupant left, based on the sale date it appears that =0Ahe so=
ld that house months before the end of his school year.=C2=A0 For a =0Ascho=
ol teacher, this would have been highly unusual.)=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 The sale price is shown as $180,000, which I think was rather hig=
h for that time. (But not unexpected if the government wanted to lure him a=
way =0Aquickly.=C2=A0 Presumably he got a large raise, as well.)=C2=A0 They=
 immediately =0Abegan an extensive remodeling and enlargement operation on =
that house, =0Aincluding adding a second floor.=C2=A0 As I recall, this rem=
odel took nearly a year; seemingly the house was unoccupied during that tim=
e.=C2=A0 Further, =0Aduring a long period very little work was actually bei=
ng done, as I =0Arecall.=C2=A0 (This remodeling would have dramatically inc=
reased the value of that house; the sale price in 1995 of $180,000 cannot b=
e directly =0Acompared with the current value of the much-larger and more-u=
p-to-date =0Ahouse as it exists today.)=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 While I don't remem=
ber precisely the date I published the first part=0A of my AP essay, I beli=
eve that it was no=0A more than a few weeks prior to March 10, 1995, on the=
 'Digitaliberty' discussion area.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0http://www.skeptic=
files.org/hacker/cud6105.htm =C2=A0 (Hence my reference to Digitaliberty in=
 the essay; it wasn't until =0Amany weeks later that I'd heard of the 'Cyph=
erpunks' list.)=C2=A0 My =0Arecollection that the person who initiated 'Dig=
italiberty', Bill Frezza, was interested in the use of technology for the d=
evelopment of =0A'liberty', although the first part of my AP essay apparent=
ly exceeded =0Ahis tolerance for radicalism.=C2=A0 At some point somebody t=
ransported Part 1 of the AP essay to Cypherpunks, and informed me of the ex=
istence of CP; I acquired Internet access and joined the Cypherpunks list.=
=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The acquisition and operation of nearby government sp=
y locations was/is certainly not new.=C2=A0 Consider the case of Robert Han=
ssen,=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen =C2=A0=C2=A0 =
=C2=A0 While this Wikipedia article does not mention it, I read contemporan=
eously =0Avarious news reports (2001) that said the government set up a spy=
 =0Alocation near Hanssen's house.=C2=A0 How far away that location was, th=
ose =0Areports did not say. =C2=A0 Presumably, this was a standard tactic, =
and =0Anon-controversial. (At least in the case of actual criminality being=
 =0Asuspected and investigated.)=C2=A0 The difference, in my case, was that=
 not =0Aonly did they not suspect me of any crime, they knew that I was inn=
ocent of any crime.=C2=A0 It is obvious, therefore, that they engaged in th=
is =0Aactivity not because of any crime (which, had it existed, would have =
=0Amade me a 'criminal') but because of my writing and publication of Part =
1 of my Assassination Politics essay.=C2=A0 (Which made me 'an enemy', 'a =
=0Adissident', an opponent of not merely the Federal government, but all go=
vernments everywhere.)=C2=A0 In other words, the government engaged in =0Aa=
ctivities more appropriate for the former Soviet Union, and seemingly =0Ano=
t for America.=C2=A0 =0A=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 One question that should be a=
sked, is:=C2=A0 "What what the government did, =0Aacquiring that house at s=
urveilling me from it, legal?"=C2=A0=C2=A0 They would =0Apresumably say, "y=
es".=C2=A0 But why wasn't that "stalking", within the =0Ameaning of the cri=
minal statute?=C2=A0 After all, in November 21, 2000 I was =0Aaccused of "I=
nterstate Stalking", simply for going around, looking at =0Avarious locatio=
ns, not confronting (nor even seeing) anyone.=C2=A0 I was =0Ainvestigating =
things, because I knew that something was (and had been) =0Ahappening.=C2=
=A0 Was I less entitled to do what I did, than what the =0Agovernment was t=
o do what it did?=C2=A0 An inmate/informant named Ryan Thomas Lund (his rec=
ent activity:=C2=A0 http://www.localblotter.com/news/oregon/man-detained-on=
-multiple-counts/8340383.html=C2=A0 )=C2=A0 was instructed to attack me, wh=
ich he did on November 25, 1997, because I was beginning to resist the plea=
 agreement that I had been offered, =0Aand initially accepted.=0A=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 Don't think that I didn't already suspect the house at 7302 Corre=
gidor =0Aduring that time.=C2=A0 In fact, I informed my (corrupt) attorney =
Peter =0AAvenia=C2=A0 http://www.avvo.com/attorneys/98101-wa-peter-avenia-2=
0216.html=C2=A0 of some of my suspicions.=C2=A0 (But, of course, I didn't k=
now at that time =0AAvenia was corrupt.)=C2=A0 Sometime about December 1, 1=
997, Avenia visited me at FDC Seatac jail and I told him of Lund's attack.=
=C2=A0 His answer?=C2=A0 "I =0Adon't know anything about.....that")=C2=A0 (=
Avenia was also Lund's =0Aattorney.)=C2=A0=C2=A0 And in about July 1998, af=
ter I was re-arrested, ostensibly for a 'supervised release violation', the=
 =0Aprosecutor Robb London (who is currently the direction of communication=

=A0 Which, of course, was true:=C2=A0 I DID suspect, and say, that the =0Ag=
overnment was spying on me!=C2=A0=C2=A0 Problem is, London was using this b=
are =0Aassertion to justify me being sent to the Federal Medical Center at =
=0ASpringfield, Missouri, for a mental evaluation (!).=C2=A0 Another proble=
m =0Awas, London didn't say I was _wrong_ when I said (or suspected) that.=
=C2=A0 =0A(Without at least an allegation that I was wrong, what justificat=

ge the (implicit) allegation of falsity in my =0Aassertion that the governm=
ent had been spying on me.=C2=A0 However, I used =0Athe situation (a hearin=
g) to extract a promise (only partly kept) from =0AAvenia that he would inv=
estigate my allegations.=C2=A0 Many months later, =0Aperhaps in February 19=
99, Avenia send investigator Sharon Callas to =0AVancouver.=C2=A0 Mysteriou=
sly, Callas was said to have 'disappeared' (or =0Aperhaps 'resigned') later=
.=C2=A0 I never saw the results of her =0Ainvestigation.=C2=A0 Later, in ab=
out April 1999, attorney Avenia resigned, =0Abut NOT at my request.=C2=A0 I=
 suspected then, and still suspect today, that his resignation was triggere=
d by something =0Athat Sharon Callas discovered during that investigation:=
=C2=A0 Perhaps she =0Aconfirmed enough of my allegations that Avenia knew t=
hat I was correct.=C2=A0 http://www.shmoo.com/mail/cypherpunks/jun00/msg001=
54.shtml =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 So, what=
 had been going on?=C2=A0 Presumably, the interest in me (including =0Aloca=
l spying) was NOT based on allegations of crime, or even suspected future c=
rime, in March 1995.=C2=A0 =0AIn other words, no government law enforcement=
 agency would have been legally entitled to spy on me.=C2=A0 =0APresumably,=
 the spying that did occur was, itself, illegal:=C2=A0 And, had it become e=
xposed (which it should have been if I had not been assaulted =0Aby Ryan Th=
omas Lund on November 25, 1997), the Federal government would =0Ahave suffe=
red an enormous hit of bad publicity.=C2=A0 This corruption must =0Ahave be=

30210, initiated secretly and kept from me for 10 months, with =0Anumerous =

ut me in your book.=0A=0AMr Greenberg,=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I will contin=
ue about the history of 'my' attorneys, who were 'my' attorneys in name onl=
y:=C2=A0 They were actually the attorneys of "The United States of America"=
, and of their colluding employees.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 While I would like to say =
that my 'next' attorney was Jonathan Solovy, given the paperwork I should f=
irst deal with a couple of 'asterisks', named Catherine Floit and David Buk=
ey.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 At some point after I wrote that letter to the Ninth=
 Circuit Court, I received a letter (about June 2000?) from an attorney nam=
ed Catherine Floit.=C2=A0 I called her by telephone, and I explained a bit =
about the history of prior attorneys Peter Avenia and Judith Mandel.=C2=A0 =
I further explained that I had very, very serious suspicions about governme=
nt corruption by these attorneys, and the government in general.=C2=A0 I sa=
id that I would be suing those attorneys, and any other people who assisted=
 the government corruption I then suspected.=C2=A0 (Note:=C2=A0 Remember, a=
t that point, I did not know about the pre-April existence of phony, forged=
 Ninth Circuit Court appeal 99-30210.)=C2=A0 I was surprised when that phon=
e call to Catherine Floit didn't last very long after that!=C2=A0 (A minute=
?)=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 'What happened?', I thought!=C2=A0 It turns out that =
Floit later contacted the people who had appointed her (the Public Defender=
s' Office in Seattle Washington, I think.) and asked to be de-assigned to m=
y case.=C2=A0 I later heard that she CLAIMED (quite falsely) that I had 'th=
reatened' her!=C2=A0  But I hadn't threatened her at all!=C2=A0 I had no re=
ason to do so, particularly at that early stage in her representation.=C2=
=A0 But at this point I knew very little about the law.=C2=A0  Eventually (=
a few years later, after I first saw the docket for the forged appeal case =
99-30210, in late June 2003; see Jonathan Solovy's 'representation', which =
I will shortly write about) I realized that Floit must have been informed a=
bout the fact that the case she had been assigned to handle, 99-30210, was =
ALREADY a fraud, and in my phone call with her she learned that I was rathe=
r well-informed about the corruption of those two prior attorneys, Avenia a=
nd Mandel, AND that I intended to
 sue them, etc.=C2=A0 In other words, she understood that if she took that =
case, and if she did what the government wanted her to do, she herself was =
almost certainly going to get sued, and for exactly the kinds of things tha=
t Avenia and Mandel were already 'in the crosshairs' for having done in the=
 past.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 When an attorney is ASSIGNED a case (by a judge o=
r a court) it's fairly hard to 'get out of it'.=C2=A0 Such an attorney has =
to have a rather 'good' (but not necessarily, 'valid') reason to be relieve=
d of that responsibility.=C2=A0 Floit (I realized, years later) could not h=
ave simply said, "Jim Bell is on to them/us!!!=C2=A0 He's going to sue us!"=
.=C2=A0  Floit could not have said, "The government is engaging in corrupti=
on against Bell, and I don't want to be part of it!".=C2=A0 =C2=A0 So, what=
 was she going to do?=C2=A0  It turns out that the easiest way for her to g=
et out of the assignment was to (falsely) claim, "Jim Bell threatened me!!!=
".=C2=A0  Which she, apparently, did.=C2=A0 But I DIDN'T threaten her.=C2=
=A0 But that didn't matter:=C2=A0 Floit's mere allegation amounted to a "Ge=
t out of representation free" card, analogous to Monopoly's "Get out of jai=
l free" card.=C2=A0 She was not obligated to actually prove I'd done anythi=
ng:=C2=A0 No proof was required, or even requested.=C2=A0 The
 allegation itself was quite enough.=C2=A0 As she, no doubt, knew quite wel=
l.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0  A few weeks later, another attorney (David Bukey) wa=
s assigned, but I didn't hear of that.=C2=A0 I was not given any notificati=
on that Bukey had been assigned:=C2=A0 Apparently Bukey heard of his assign=
ment, refused it, and he never contacted me.=C2=A0 Nor did anyone else cont=
act me, either, on any subject, including that of Bukey or his (brief) assi=
gnment to my case.=C2=A0  During this time, I wrote yet another letter to t=
he Ninth Circuit Court basically asking, "Where's my representation?".=0A=
=0ANotice, now, that the count is up to FOUR:=C2=A0 Avenia, Mandel, Floit, =
and Bukey:=C2=A0 None of these attorneys did I ever attempt to 'fire'.=C2=
=A0 (And I didn't even learn that Bukey was supposed to be representing me,=
 until after he had been relieved of that.)=C2=A0  The closest to even 'att=
empting to fire' I had done was when I tried to prevent Avenia from being r=
elieved, because I didn't want his successor (who turned out to be Mandel: =
I didn't want anybody assigned, because I had already gotten promises from =
Avenia to do investigation, which eventually he never effectively did) to b=
e assigned.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 But at that, I was unsuccessful at both, of course=
.=0A=0AJonathan Solovy:=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Eventually, Solovy was assigned to =
case 99-30210, as I vaguely recall in about August 2000.=C2=A0 Keep in mind=
 that I STILL didn't know about the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210=
 as of then:=C2=A0 I would only learn of that pre-May-2000 existence when I=
 wrote for, and received, the docket for 99-30210 in late June 2003.=0A=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 Solovy didn't do anything OBVIOUSLY wrong.=C2=A0 At least, I did=
n't recognize that in 2000.=C2=A0 He wrote the appeal, 99-30210, filed it, =
and it lost. I think he may also have written a Petition for Certiorari to =
the Supreme Court, which also obviously failed.=C2=A0  (I don't recall what=
 they contained; I didn't learn the law until beginning December 2000).=C2=
=A0  But I can say this much:=C2=A0 At no time during Solovy's representati=
on did he EVER say to me anything that would have alerted me to the pre-May=
-2000 existence of case 99-30210.=C2=A0 I may not have known much (or even =
'anything') about Federal law in September, 2000, but if he had said someth=
ing like "Jim, I see you've been assigned pro-se to this appeal since July =
1999:=C2=A0 What are your theories as to appealing this case?"=C2=A0 I woul=
d have been alerted, with a distinct start, and I would have instantly aske=
d him, "What do you mean?=C2=A0  I thought I began this case in April 2000,=
 when I wrote a letter to the Ninth
 Circuit Court of Appeals?=C2=A0 What's this about July 1999?!?".=0A=0A=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0  By the time I first saw a copy of the docket for case 99-30210,=
 on about June 20, 2003, I knew FAR more Federal law.=C2=A0 I'd spent since=
 about December 2000 in a jail/prison law library.=C2=A0 In fact, two of th=
e REASONS I wrote to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in early June 2003=
, asking for the docket for 99-30210, were:=0A=0A1.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Clearing u=
p loose ends for my Portland Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, I remembered t=
hat I had (thought!) initiated that appeal (99-30210) by means of mailing a=
 letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asking for an appeal.=C2=A0 =
(In case 97-5270, as I recall).=C2=A0 As of June 2003, I understood that th=
e rules required that to appeal, somebody needs to file a 'Notice of Appeal=
' within about two weeks of the date of the order-entry.=C2=A0 My letter of=
 April 2000 was, I then realized, nearly ten (10) months too late to initia=
te an appeal in that case.=C2=A0 "So why," I thought, "wasn't that letter i=
mmediately rejected?!?"=C2=A0  and "Why did they give me that appeal?"=0A=
=0A2.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 At some point, I recognized that the case-number of that=
 appeal (99-30210) started with the number, "99", which stands for "1999", =
the date that appeal was initiated.=C2=A0 In other words, I eventually real=
ized (June 2003) that that appeal had been begun in 1999, NOT in 2000.=C2=
=A0  Evidently, my letter of April 2000 DIDN'T 'start the ball rolling' on =
that appeal.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Therefore, and being quite suspicious, I wr=
ote a bland, routine note in early June 2003 to the Ninth Circuit, asking f=
or the copy of the docket for case 99-30210, which I had never seen before.=
=C2=A0 I received an envelope about June 20, 2003, containing a copy of tha=
t docket.=C2=A0 The most obvious thing that struck me about that docket was=
 that case 99-30210 DIDN'T start in April 2000, as I had previously assumed=
.=C2=A0 It was quite clear, instead that it had begun in July 1999.=C2=A0 (=
Although, the 'Notice of Appeal' had actually been filed about June 20, 199=
9).=C2=A0  Something VERY VERY suspicious had been going on!=C2=A0 Secondly=
, I looked through the various docket entries, and I could see that this ca=
se had appeared to have been active:=C2=A0 Ostensibly, I had actually been =
'pro se' (representing myself) which I knew that I hadn't been doing!=C2=A0=
 (because, of course, I hadn't even known about the existence of that case,=
 prior to May 2000, thinking I initiated it with a
 letter to the Ninth Circuit in late April 2000).=C2=A0  In fact, I could s=
ee that there were two filings, about November 10, 1999, and March 2, 2000,=
 which purported to have been filed by me!=C2=A0 (And, obviously, I knew th=
at I hadn't filed them!)=C2=A0 Most importantly, I realized that I had not =
received ANY of these many mailings while I was at Seatac FDC (until Sept 3=
, 1999) nor any while I was at Phoenix FCI (From Sept 10, 1999 though April=
 13, 2000, when I was released; I was at the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer=
 Center for a week from Sept 3 to Sept 10, 1999.)=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Note:=
=C2=A0 I received NONE of the mailings from the Ninth Circuit Court during =
July 1999 through April 2000, because the Bureau of Prisons staff at both t=
hose locations hid them from me.=C2=A0 (Did not deliver them to me).=C2=A0 =
If I had received EVEN ONE of those mailings, I would have been alerted tha=
t an appeal existed.=C2=A0 I didn't receive even a single one.=C2=A0 Of cou=
rse, I wasn't EXPECTING a single one, either, because I was not then aware =
that appeal 99-30210 existed.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 But there was more.=C2=A0 =
 I looked at the docket item numbers at the middle of the docket pages (bet=
ween the dates on the left, and the descriptions of the entries on the righ=
t) and I noticed that they were not all there.=C2=A0 Some were out of order=
 (I later understood that merely being out of order is not abnormal) but 29=
 of the first 79 docket entry numbers simply were not present!=C2=A0  Since=
 I already knew there had to be a dramatic amount of corruption associated =
with this case, I considered that a very significant clue.=C2=A0 Later, wee=
ks and months later, I showed this docket to numerous 'jailhouse lawyers', =
and to a person, they said they had never seen even a single 'missing' dock=
et entry number on any dockets they had ever seen.=C2=A0 Over the subsequen=
t years, I also looked at any docket I could get my hands on, and never onc=
e was I able to identify even a single 'missing' docket entry number on any=
 docket.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 An explanation is in order.=C2=A0 I believe tha=
t in about May 2000, some of the staff of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal=
s engaged in a 'forgery party' of the docket for case 99-30210.=C2=A0 I thi=
nk that they realized that they could not deny me an appeal in that probati=
on-revocation case, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY GIVEN ME THAT APPEAL!=C2=A0 Bu=
t, they also realized that they couldn't simply continue on with that forge=
ry, because they knew that I DIDN'T KNOW of the existence of appeal 99-3021=
0 during the time of June 1999 through April 2000.=C2=A0 They knew that the=
y couldn't simply initiate a new appeal, because a record of appeal 99-3021=
0 already existed.=C2=A0 They also knew that they couldn't allow me to see =
a copy of the docket for 99-30210, because that would have alerted me (just=
 as it eventually alerted me in June 2003) that the appeal had existed, yet=
 had been concealed from me during the period June 1999 through April 2000.=
=C2=A0 What they had to do, I think,
 was to RE-forge that docket, which they did in May 2000, and then assign a=
 colluding attorney (First Floit, then Bukey, then Solovy) who would help c=
onceal the history of this case from me, and then write a serviceable 'appe=
al', so that it could lose:=C2=A0 Their hope, apparently, was that I would =
be satisfied with that.=C2=A0 And until June 2003, I was indeed 'satisfied'=
.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0  Perhaps a couple months after I first saw that copy o=
f the docket for case 99-30210, I wrote a letter to Jonathan Solovy.=C2=A0 =
(He had never been 'de-assigned' to my case).=C2=A0  I don't recall,=C2=A0 =
precisely, what I said (It's been 10 years!), but I asked him to look into =
into the problem.=C2=A0 His response?=C2=A0 Well, suddenly he had developed=
 'carpal tunnel syndrome' (I was well aware of that condition) and he could=
n't handle my case anymore!=C2=A0  I insisted; He wrote to the judge, askin=
g that he be allowed to withdraw.=C2=A0 Actually, I think he wrote to the W=
RONG judge!=C2=A0  I think he wrote to Judge Burgess, of the District Court=
 case, 97-5270, NOT the Ninth Circuit appeals court=C2=A0 (99-30210).=C2=A0=
 But it didn't matter:=C2=A0 he was allowed to withdraw.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0=
 Please note:=C2=A0 Jonathan Solovy was my FIFTH attorney, if you are count=
ing Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and Bukey before him.=C2=A0 And note that I didn=
't try to get Solovy, either, 'fired'.=C2=A0 Indeed, yet again I wanted to =
see Solovy to continue to handle that case (99-30210) in large part BECAUSE=
 I knew that he had committed fraud against me and, kinda-sorta, against th=
e court as well.=C2=A0 But, Solovy's fraud was in league with the U.S. Atto=
rneys (Seattle), the Federal Bureau of Prisons staff at FDC Seatac, and at =
FCI Phoenix, and the staff of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and possi=
bly others.=0A=0A=C2=A0 =C2=A0 So, where did you come up with that claim th=
at I fired "all" of my attorneys, HMMMMMMMM?????????=C2=A0  Sorry if I disp=
lay a little schadenfreude, but I think I've earned the right to complain.=
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 And I still haven't yet mentioned attorney Robert Leen, and A=

 separation.=C2=A0 The main reason my optical fiber is practical is that th=

ear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Mr Greenberg,<br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbs=
p; &nbsp; I will continue about the history of 'my' attorneys, who were 'my=
' attorneys in name only:&nbsp; They were actually the attorneys of "The Un=
ited States of America", and of their colluding employees.&nbsp; &nbsp; Whi=
le I would like to say that my 'next' attorney was Jonathan Solovy, given t=
he paperwork I should first deal with a couple of 'asterisks', named Cather=
ine Floit and David Bukey.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbs=
p; At some point after I wrote that letter to the Ninth Circuit Court, I re=
ceived a letter (about June 2000?) from an attorney named Catherine Floit.&=
nbsp; I called her by telephone, and I explained a bit about the history of=
 prior attorneys Peter Avenia and Judith Mandel.&nbsp; I further explained =
that I had very, very serious suspicions about government corruption by the=
se
 attorneys, and the government in general.&nbsp; I said that I would be sui=
ng those attorneys, and any other people who assisted the government corrup=
tion I then suspected.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; Remember, at that point, I did no=
t know about the pre-April existence of phony, forged Ninth Circuit Court a=
ppeal 99-30210.)&nbsp; I was surprised when that phone call to Catherine Fl=
oit didn't last very long after that!&nbsp; (A minute?)<br clear=3D"none"><=
br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What happened?', I thought!&nbsp; It turns=
 out that Floit later contacted the people who had appointed her (the Publi=
c Defenders' Office in Seattle Washington, I think.) and asked to be de-ass=
igned to my case.&nbsp; I later heard that she CLAIMED (quite falsely) that=
 I had 'threatened' her!&nbsp;  But I hadn't threatened her at all!&nbsp; I=
 had no reason to do so, particularly at that early stage in her representa=
tion.&nbsp; But at this point I knew very little about the law.&nbsp;=20
 Eventually (a few years later, after I first saw the docket for the forged=
 appeal case 99-30210, in late June 2003; see Jonathan Solovy's 'representa=
tion', which I will shortly write about) I realized that Floit must have be=
en informed about the fact that the case she had been assigned to handle, 9=
9-30210, was ALREADY a fraud, and in my phone call with her she learned tha=
t I was rather well-informed about the corruption of those two prior attorn=
eys, Avenia and Mandel, AND that I intended to sue them, etc.&nbsp; In othe=
r words, she understood that if she took that case, and if she did what the=
 government wanted her to do, she herself was almost certainly going to get=
 sued, and for exactly the kinds of things that Avenia and Mandel were alre=
ady 'in the crosshairs' for having done in the past.<br clear=3D"none"><br =
clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbsp; When an attorney is ASSIGNED a case (by a judg=
e or a court) it's fairly hard to 'get out of it'.&nbsp; Such an
 attorney has to have a rather 'good' (but not necessarily, 'valid') reason=
 to be relieved of that responsibility.&nbsp; Floit (I realized, years late=
r) could not have simply said, "Jim Bell is on to them/us!!!&nbsp; He's goi=
ng to sue us!".&nbsp;  Floit could not have said, "The government is engagi=
ng in corruption against Bell, and I don't want to be part of it!".&nbsp; &=
nbsp; So, what was she going to do?&nbsp;  It turns out that the easiest wa=
y for her to get out of the assignment was to (falsely) claim, "Jim Bell th=
reatened me!!!".&nbsp;  Which she, apparently, did.&nbsp; But I DIDN'T thre=
aten her.&nbsp; But that didn't matter:&nbsp; Floit's mere allegation amoun=
ted to a "Get out of representation free" card, analogous to Monopoly's "Ge=
t out of jail free" card.&nbsp; She was not obligated to actually prove I'd=
 done anything:&nbsp; No proof was required, or even requested.&nbsp; The a=
llegation itself was quite enough.&nbsp; As she, no doubt, knew
 quite well.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbsp;  A few week=
s later, another attorney (David Bukey) was assigned, but I didn't hear of =
that.&nbsp; I was not given any notification that Bukey had been assigned:&=
nbsp; Apparently Bukey heard of his assignment, refused it, and he never co=
ntacted me.&nbsp; Nor did anyone else contact me, either, on any subject, i=
ncluding that of Bukey or his (brief) assignment to my case.&nbsp;  During =
this time, I wrote yet another letter to the Ninth Circuit Court basically =
asking, "Where's my representation?".<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">=
Notice, now, that the count is up to FOUR:&nbsp; Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and=
 Bukey:&nbsp; None of these attorneys did I ever attempt to 'fire'.&nbsp; (=
And I didn't even learn that Bukey was supposed to be representing me, unti=
l after he had been relieved of that.)&nbsp;  The closest to even 'attempti=
ng to fire' I had done was when I tried to prevent Avenia from being
 relieved, because I didn't want his successor (who turned out to be Mandel=
: I didn't want anybody assigned, because I had already gotten promises fro=
m Avenia to do investigation, which eventually he never effectively did) to=
 be assigned.&nbsp; &nbsp; But at that, I was unsuccessful at both, of cour=
se.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Jonathan Solovy:<br clear=3D"none"=
>&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, Solovy was assigned to case 99-30210, as I vague=

 about the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210 as of then:&nbsp; I woul=

 Solovy didn't do anything OBVIOUSLY wrong.&nbsp; At least, I didn't recogn=

t. I think he may also have written a Petition for Certiorari to the Suprem=

 Court, which also obviously failed.&nbsp;  (I don't recall what they conta=
ined; I didn't learn the law until beginning December 2000).&nbsp;  But I c=
an say this much:&nbsp; At no time during Solovy's representation did he EV=
ER say to me anything that would have alerted me to the pre-May-2000 existe=
nce of case 99-30210.&nbsp; I may not have known much (or even 'anything') =
about Federal law in September, 2000, but if he had said something like "Ji=
m, I see you've been assigned pro-se to this appeal since July 1999:&nbsp; =
What are your theories as to appealing this case?"&nbsp; I would have been =
alerted, with a distinct start, and I would have instantly asked him, "What=
 do you mean?&nbsp;  I thought I began this case in April 2000, when I wrot=

me I first saw a copy of the docket for case 99-30210, on about June 20,
 2003, I knew FAR more Federal law.&nbsp; I'd spent since about December 20=
00 in a jail/prison law library.&nbsp; In fact, two of the REASONS I wrote =
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in early June 2003, asking for the d=

sp; Clearing up loose ends for my Portland Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, =
I remembered that I had (thought!) initiated that appeal (99-30210) by mean=
s of mailing a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asking for an =
appeal.&nbsp; (In case 97-5270, as I recall).&nbsp; As of June 2003, I unde=
rstood that the rules required that to appeal, somebody needs to file a 'No=
tice of Appeal' within about two weeks of the date of the order-entry.&nbsp=
; My letter of April 2000 was, I then realized, nearly ten (10) months too =
late to initiate an appeal in that case.&nbsp; "So why," I thought, "wasn't=
 that letter immediately rejected?!?"&nbsp;  and "Why did they give me
 that appeal?"<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; At some=
 point, I recognized that the case-number of that appeal (99-30210) started=
 with the number, "99", which stands for "1999", the date that appeal was i=
nitiated.&nbsp; In other words, I eventually realized (June 2003) that that=
 appeal had been begun in 1999, NOT in 2000.&nbsp;  Evidently, my letter of=
 April 2000 DIDN'T 'start the ball rolling' on that appeal.<br clear=3D"non=
e"><br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, and being quite suspicious, =
I wrote a bland, routine note in early June 2003 to the Ninth Circuit, aski=
ng for the copy of the docket for case 99-30210, which I had never seen bef=
ore.&nbsp; I received an envelope about June 20, 2003, containing a copy of=
 that docket.&nbsp; The most obvious thing that struck me about that docket=
 was that case 99-30210 DIDN'T start in April 2000, as I had previously ass=
umed.&nbsp; It was quite clear, instead that it had begun in July
 1999.&nbsp; (Although, the 'Notice of Appeal' had actually been filed abou=
t June 20, 1999).&nbsp;  Something VERY VERY suspicious had been going on!&=
nbsp; Secondly, I looked through the various docket entries, and I could se=
e that this case had appeared to have been active:&nbsp; Ostensibly, I had =
actually been 'pro se' (representing myself) which I knew that I hadn't bee=
n doing!&nbsp; (because, of course, I hadn't even known about the existence=
 of that case, prior to May 2000, thinking I initiated it with a letter to =
the Ninth Circuit in late April 2000).&nbsp;  In fact, I could see that the=
re were two filings, about November 10, 1999, and March 2, 2000, which purp=
orted to have been filed by me!&nbsp; (And, obviously, I knew that I hadn't=
 filed them!)&nbsp; Most importantly, I realized that I had not received AN=
Y of these many mailings while I was at Seatac FDC (until Sept 3, 1999) nor=
 any while I was at Phoenix FCI (From Sept 10, 1999 though April 13,

I would have been alerted that an appeal existed.&nbsp; I didn't receive ev=

ed that they were not all there.&nbsp; Some were out of order (I later
 understood that merely being out of order is not abnormal) but 29 of the f=
irst 79 docket entry numbers simply were not present!&nbsp;  Since I alread=
y knew there had to be a dramatic amount of corruption associated with this=
 case, I considered that a very significant clue.&nbsp; Later, weeks and mo=

I also looked at any docket I could get my hands on, and never once was I a=

br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">&nbsp; &nbsp; An explanation is in ord=
er.&nbsp; I believe that in about May 2000, some of the staff of the Ninth =
Circuit Court of Appeals engaged in a 'forgery party' of the docket for cas=
e 99-30210.&nbsp; I think that they realized that they could not deny me
 an appeal in that probation-revocation case, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY GIVE=
N ME THAT APPEAL!&nbsp; But, they also realized that they couldn't simply c=
ontinue on with that forgery, because they knew that I DIDN'T KNOW of the e=
xistence of appeal 99-30210 during the time of June 1999 through April 2000=
.&nbsp; They knew that they couldn't simply initiate a new appeal, because =
a record of appeal 99-30210 already existed.&nbsp; They also knew that they=
 couldn't allow me to see a copy of the docket for 99-30210, because that w=
ould have alerted me (just as it eventually alerted me in June 2003) that t=
he appeal had existed, yet had been concealed from me during the period Jun=
e 1999 through April 2000.&nbsp; What they had to do, I think, was to RE-fo=
rge that docket, which they did in May 2000, and then assign a colluding at=
torney (First Floit, then Bukey, then Solovy) who would help conceal the hi=
story of this case from me, and then write a serviceable 'appeal',
 so that it could lose:&nbsp; Their hope, apparently, was that I would be s=

&nbsp; But she never sent me a copy of that notice.&nbsp; Of course, I
 didn't know that at the time.&nbsp; (And she never mailed to me a copy of =
her file on my case, which she should have done if she had been going to 'a=

this combination is that there was careful collusion between Mandel, the Ta=

that in order to obtain an appeal, I would have had to have filed a "Notice=
 of Appeal" within two weeks after the entry of the order:&nbsp; About June=

 I get 10% market

one of a few dozen inventions I have thought of involving isotopically-modi=
fied materials, although it is the most readily doable and is like the most=
 profitable.&nbsp; In principle, however, my fiber optic inventions number =
far more than this:&nbsp; The main problem is that isotope separation is ra=
ther expensive, and any such invention isn't worth doing unless the benefit=
 from the material or device exceeds the cost of that separation.&nbsp; The=
 main reason my optical fiber is practical is that the isotopically-modifie=
d core of the 125-micron fiber is only about 30 microns in diameter, so tha=
t it uses very little isotopically-modified material.&nbsp; My estimate of =
5000 patents is still reasonable, based on what I know now, but it
 will require the development of ever-cheaper ways of separating isotopes.<=

The article says (page 133) that "he had fired practically every court-appo=

true, although the truth requires some explanation that you didn't bother t=

for weeks, months, or in one case years, and if and when that attorney fina=

 get the judge (Burgess) in about April 1999 to REFUSE Avenia's request to =
withdraw.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In 1998, I consented to an unnecessary 'mental e=
valuation' (in Springfield Missouri) based on Avenia's promise that he woul=
d investigate my allegations that the government had been spying on me.&nbs=
p; In fact, the only basis for the government's request for a 'mental evalu=

 note that the government didn't deny that it had been spying; the prosecut=
or didn't comment on that.&nbsp; Can you see why this is a problem?&nbsp; I=
t turns out that the government was, indeed, spying on me, including during=
 the period of April 1998 and June 1998, after which they arrested me for a=
 'supervised violation'.&nbsp; In fact, they had placed a tracking device i=

, in 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled (U.S. v. Jones) that such a placement =
was a "search" under the 4th Amendment.&nbsp; Indeed, in a 1999 9th Circuit=
 Court of Appeals case (U.S. v. McIver) , that court ruled that it was lega=
l (under certain circumstances inapplicable to me) for 'cops' (term used ge=
nerically) to place a tracking device on a subject's car.&nbsp; Problem was=
, in the McIver there was actually a CRIME being investigated (Marijuana
 growing) and the subject was directly linked to that crime.&nbsp; In stark=
 contrast, I was neither suspected or known to have been involved in any cr=

their arguably-illegal placement of the tracking devices(s) openly mentione=
d in any court hearing.&nbsp; I, quite the opposite, DEMANDED to my attorne=

 to prove that the Feds were employing what should be illegal tactics (such=
