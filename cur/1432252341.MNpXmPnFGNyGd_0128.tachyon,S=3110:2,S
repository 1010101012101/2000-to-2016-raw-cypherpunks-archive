The UK is broke, no more free ride in the territories. This isn't about 
stopping the rich from hiding their money which is the primary function 
of government. For the middle class tho...

They are now opening up ALL safety deposit boxes over there, and taking 
whatever they want, until you can prove it's yours - which you cannot 
obviously. How convenient.

Not as bad as what they do in California, but then again keeping your 
family jewels in a building that is controlled by those that will do 
anything to maintain power, isn't such a great idea is it.

When the drug dealer and other underground economy workers are the only 
ones left that have jobs, you have to do whatever is necessary to get 
your cut if taxes don't work, right? It's always the tax evasion that 
they get you for, because that is THEIR money you're not paying.

The governments are broke, and those government jobs all still need to 
get paid, so now we have entered the kleptocracy phase where they take 
stuff and print money exponentially.

Fun times, fun times...
