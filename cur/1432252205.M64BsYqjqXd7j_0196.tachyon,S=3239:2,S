Some would say the last few presidencies have been based upon the Marx
Bros. (Especially "Duck Soup".)

Another couple of "honorable mentions" that come to mind are the "Flint"
movies.  (_Our Man Flint_ and _In Like Flint_.)  Crypto plays a part in
most of the communications.  (Although the mathematical sequence is based
on a guessable series of numbers.)

Others will probably come to mind later...
