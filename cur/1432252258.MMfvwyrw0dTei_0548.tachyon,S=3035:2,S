We've put up some 80 court filings in the Bell case,
hyperlinked to the August 25 docket cited here yesterday:

   http://cryptome.org/jdb082501.htm

Recall that Judge Tanner sealed all the public
files that were available when he learned one of
the filings provided names of the jury pool and names
of jurors selected for the trial. The court's online files
were removed. He subsequently unsealed most
of the files (except 7 which remain sealed) but
the pre-trial filings have not been restored to the 
court's web site. Now only post-trial filings are 
available there.

Our offering is for the whole kaboodle that appeared
on the court's site from day 1, starting with the complaint 
from November 2000 through the sentencing order 
of August 24, 2001.

The files are in the multi-image TIFF format used
by the WWA court (and a number of other courts). 
The files can be viewed by a multi-image viewer 
such as Kodak's Imaging for Windows (included with
W98 et seq), Quick Time, Graph Works (a shareware), 
and others.
