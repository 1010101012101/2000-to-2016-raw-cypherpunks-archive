 Security show set to spark debate

Catch it if you can
Roger Howorth, IT Week 11 Feb 2005

The RSA Conference 2005, hosted by security specialist RSA, kicks off in
San Francisco on Monday. Keynote speakers include Bill Gates of Microsoft
and fraud author Frank W Abagnale.

Roundtable discussions will cover possible legislation affecting vendor
liability for security products. Some observers argue that the number of
flaws in computer products might be reduced if vendors were held legally
accountable for damage caused. Gates is unlikely to cover vendor liability
in his keynote, but could face a stiff grilling on the matter by attendees.

Personal identity theft is one of the fastest growing types of crimes, and
also one that is ripe for tackling at the event with emerging technologies
based around biometrics and encryption.

Other briefings will cover a range of industry topics, including
compliance, cryptography, web services and new ideas about mobile &
wireless security.

Computer Associates will also unveil details around the next phase of
integration between its own products and those acquired with last year's
purchase of identity management firm Netegrity.
