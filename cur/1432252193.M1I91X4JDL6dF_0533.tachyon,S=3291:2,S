 >>Al Qaeda computer files bought from a seller in Kabul
which were encoded and encrypted....<<

The Horsemen are loose,the Plagues of Egypt,the Dogs of War,the Grapes of 
wrath.Round up the usual crypto suspects.
Theoretically, because violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 
1986 have been included in the terrorism crackdown, hackers and spammers 
could be sentenced to life in prison.Encryption can pose potentially 
insurmountable challenges to law enforcement when used in conjunction with 
communication or plans for executing serious terrorist and criminal acts.- 
Terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers of the world unite,you have nothing to 
lose but your dongle.
Direct action_ is what it's all about.Killing the president,undermining the 
state through the spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith 
in the tax system,through even more direct applications of the right tools 
at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.HEIL 
CRYPTO-ANARCHY.HEIL!
