No. Feds enter houses for whatever reasons they deem appropriate to invent
(at least in Bavaria they do, and it goes downhill from that, and, yes,
Murrika is downhill from that). Pointing out possible targets makes no
damn reason at all, unless you've got a personal vendetta, or a crappy
personality.

Are you really thus clueless, or are you just a natural?

We seem to have very different understandings of "friendly". Friendly is
if they do have a search warrant, but don't incapacitate or kill you
first.

Yah, whatever. You suck, have halitosis, and are generically an idiot. Do
you feel better now?

Um, is this bad soap opera, or what?

What's "statute of limitations" spelt in German? (And if vee don't like
your nase ve haff vay to obtain a warrant, you knovv.).

There's no point in mentioning a person's name wantonly, especially on
this list.

As I said, it's a male weakness, and there's absofuckinglutely no point in
playing with it. He's a big guy, if/assuming he wants to kill himself in
a spectacular way, it's his problem. Not yours.

Live and and let live (he said, while stuffung a sock in his cake hole).
