WHERE?  WHERE DOES HE SAY THIS?

Exact source with quote, or shaddup.

I'm not a Chomsky fan.  I'm not a Chomsky hater.  Prior to a few months
ago, Chomsky was a name I'd heard only on this list, but not checked out.
But what James here seems to be up to is something I'm very much familiar
with, character assassination.  Give me a quote Chomsky has offered up
that is unverifiable, James, tell me where I can find this Chomsky quote
myself, so I can verify the Chomsky quote you offer up.  Verify that it
does properly exist, and then I'll seek to verify or refute the accuracy
of the Chomsky quote myself.  As it is, I'm left to verify the accuracy
of your quoting of Chomsky.  If that is all you can offer up, just get
the fuck out of my face.

Fucking illiterate slob with a political agenda.  ;)

20 years or newer, remember?  Within the last decade, or two?  Remember?

Learn how to read.

Comprehend what you read.

Get some lessons at your local community college.

Idiot.
