Its only egregiously if the manufacturer fails to inform the prospective 
purchaser that performance is only guaranteed with OEM cartridges.  Because 
consumers will base buying decisions on a dollar the sellers have resorted 
to pricing the printers so that they make their money on the supplies.  A 
valid model to me.  (Steve, who retrofit his Epson Color 740 for continuous 
ink supply and never has to purchase or refill a cartridge on the printer 
again.)
