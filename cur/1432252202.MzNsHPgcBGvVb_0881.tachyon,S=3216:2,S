When e-currency handlers (cambists) are accused of money 
laundering terrorist's money, the feds steal the money, but 
they do not obstruct them from travelling, or, surprisingly, 
even from doing business - well, perhaps not so surprisingly, 
for if they stopped them from doing business there would be 
nothing to steal.

When the state uses repressive measures against those that seek 
to murder us, there is still a large gap between that and using 
repressive measures against everyone.

We are not terrorists, we don't look like terrorists, we don't 
sound like terrorists. Indeed, the more visible real terrorists 
are, the less even Tim McViegh looks like a terrorist and the 
more he looks like a patriot.

When people are under attack they are going to lash out, to 
kill and destroy.  Lashing out an external enemy, real or 
imaginary, is a healthy substitute for lashing out at internal 
enemies.  We do not have a choice of peace, merely a choice 
between war against external or internal enemies.   Clearly, 
war against external enemies is less dangerous to freedom.

War is dangerous to freedom, but we do not have a choice of 
peace.  The question is where the war is to be fought - in 
America, or elsewhere.  War within America will surely destroy 
freedom.

What we need to fear is those that talk about the home front 
and internal security, those who claim that Christians are as 
big a threat as Muslims - or that black Muslims are as big a
threat as Middle Eastern Muslims.
