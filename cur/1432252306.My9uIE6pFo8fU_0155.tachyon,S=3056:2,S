I'm not an expert. However, you can make extremely silent devices. It's
not rocket science, and one of the major points towards wearables. A LART
board burns about 1 W, and a hud type of display is low power. With less
than braindead engineering this is trivial to shield. A hud which contains
a built-in framebuffer will be essentially impossible to detect.  If you
want to grow fancy, you can even encode the serial links sending commands
to it.

Can anyone give me real world data on HF signature of a Twiddler2?
