Claim: Coulter would never want to see the NYT building harmed
Melik Kaylan says Ann Coulter's foes have "tried long and hard to keep 
ranks closed against her to shut her out of the media game." Americans who 
have pushed her book to the top of the bestsellers list understand Coulter, 
he says, while her "infuriated critics" don't. Kaylan asks: "Why would 
anybody even pretend to believe that Ms. Coulter wishes any real harm to 
the New York Times or wishes to convert all Muslims forcibly to 
Christianity (a post-9/11 flight of fancy that got her fired from National 
Review)?" (Wall Street Journal)
 > Earlier: Coulter regrets McVeigh didn't blow up the NYT building
Mmm,journalism as entertainment,right arm! I didn't mean to threaten any 
P.I.Gs!
