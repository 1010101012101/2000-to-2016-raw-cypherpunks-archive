I heard some governmental official on the radio the other day (I paid
attention too late to catch the name) that the War on Terrorism should
be won in about 60 years, at which point the American citizens would see
their civil liberties returned. Obviously, only traitors, agitators, and
other enemy combatants would make the outrageous claim that this war
will likely last perpetually.
