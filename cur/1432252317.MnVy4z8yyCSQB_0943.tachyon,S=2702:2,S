This is a terrible day for privacy advocates that used the once (perhaps
never true) "anonymous" Java Anonymous Proxy. According to a  story (
http://theregister.co.uk/content/55/32450.html) by The Register

(It was also posted to

JAP was back doored by court order. It was a forced upgrade (after a
service interruption) to monitor "one site" that continues to be
unnamed. How sad it is when a group have a motto of "Anonymity is not a
crime." and then hand logs to the police without a word? Clearly if they
are able to defend themselves on alt.2600
(http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&frame=right&th=f4ef43
f695ca29e8&seekm=3f3d3740%241_1%40news.vic.com#link10), they aren't under a
gag. Read it and weep.
