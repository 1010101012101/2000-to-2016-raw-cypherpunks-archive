The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a leading supplier of VoIP technology inc|uding the fo||owing 
milestones:

On November 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any telephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any cellu|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,O00 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce|lu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|oba| sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met
