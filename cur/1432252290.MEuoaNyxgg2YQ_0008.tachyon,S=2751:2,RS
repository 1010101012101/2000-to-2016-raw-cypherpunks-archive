Well that's ALMOST right. Sendmail (and most other programs for that
matter) allow different levels of logging. Tell sendmail not to log and it
won't.

Nah, there's all kinds of ways around that. If it was as simple as
grabbing the source address in a sendmail log most of the spammers would
have been put out of business a long! time ago.

As to finding them, those socialist bastards at ORBS and the like keep
handy lists available.
