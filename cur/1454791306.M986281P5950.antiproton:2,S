Indeed. Having a spotter there is probably the best solution.

This is why you use an attenuator. I wouldn't think law enforcement DF
equipment would be fooled by such a thing, since for example FCC will often
be looking for people who are outputting too much power, which on the ham
bands is going to be multiple kilowatts (I think they've mostly given up on
CB except when it starts interfering with licensed users).

Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.

How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?

Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some
blind humans can use clicks to get a picture of their entire environment.
(I use humans and not bats because I think bat sonar is pretty directional,
whereas human ears can localize sound quite precisely without any need to
turn one's head.)

This is definitely an area I'm interested in, so I'd love to hear more of
your ideas, as may Jeremy, so if it's beyond what is generally tolerated on
this list, private email would be fine, or if you have a list in mind I'd
be happy to subscribe if I'm not already.
