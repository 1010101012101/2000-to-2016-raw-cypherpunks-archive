 From my weekly Wired column...

Thuggish cops: Police in Key West, Florida, arrested a newspaper editor 
last week for printing an article that criticized an internal police 
investigation.
The editor of Key West The Newspaper, Dennis Cooper, is being prosecuted 
for allegedly violating a state law. Under Florida law, it's a crime to 
disclose information about a police investigation -- even if you're the 
person who had filed a complaint alleging police wrongdoing, as Cooper 
seems to have done.
Cooper's site was offline earlier in the week, but, as usual, the Net 
community pitched in and mirrored copies of some of his articles that 
criticized the local cops.
A disturbing side note: According to a report in the Miami Herald, the 
police knew some judges had ruled this law was unconstitutional before they 
charged Cooper with violating it.
