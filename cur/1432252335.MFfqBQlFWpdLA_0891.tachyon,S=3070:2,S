It would be stupid to hit now.  The terrorists will wait until after
the U.S. takes overt action.  Their counter-blow will then have the
most impact.  If Americans learn that every time their troops attack,
American civilians die, it will increase pressure to end the campaign.

Terrorists might have scheduled something for Saturday, on the assumption
that the U.S. would have attacked by now.  But the unexpected restraint on
the part of the U.S. leadership will require a revision to the timetable.

Is this why the airlines are going to stop serving food?
