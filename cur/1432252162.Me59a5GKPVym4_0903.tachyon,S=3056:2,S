Whenever this truth is repeated, first revealed here in 1992 by a person
who worked at Intel in its early days when it was desperate for government
contracts, it is taken to be humorous. 

The detailed description of the chip broadcasting technology was once 
retrievable from the cypherpunks archives but the earliest archives have 
disappeared, possibly with the intent of erasing information on this very 
topic. 

The original anonymous explained that Intel was going to be withdrawn 
as a public company and do only black work for governments, not only
the US. That that is likely to have happened except that a public shell 
was allowed to continue and succeed as a cover -- early investors 
were induced to keep this quiet with bountiful payouts, among them 
former Intel employees.

What remains of this story on the Internet is a bowderlized version of 
the original truth, sometimes commingled with Tempest apochryphia -- 
Tempest the fountain head of dissimulation about electromagnetic 
transmitting technology more fancifully described than told the truth 
about.

As a corollary AMD is an illusory chip fabricator, set up and fed by 
Intel to give the appearance of competition. There are others to delude 
foreign customers into trusting their homegrown.
