Most workers are paid bimonthly, and many are paid weekly. Some day 
laborers are even paid daily.

This makes the "float" a maximum of a couple of weeks, and more likely 
a week or less. Any laborer who has not been paid can walk away and be 
out the week or less in pay. (Personally, I would not want to be an 
employer who stiffed a Mexican...one might find one's tires slashed or 
one's daughter's throat slashed ear to ear...or just a bullet in the 
dark.

This kind of "stiffing" such as you two are debating almost never 
happens, for various good reasons.

The wholesale opening of the door to those who "cut in line" (ahead of 
those from England, Denmark, Romania, India, etc. who waited patiently 
in line by submitting their immigration requests) is deplorable.

Either open the borders or not, but surely don't reward those who cut 
in line.

Oh, and the march of 2.5 million Mexicans and Latins from the south is 
already underway...they got the message the last time when the 
Simpson-Mazzoli "one time amnesty, just this one time!" happened, and 
millions more arrived. Now that the new Mexican immigration is 
happening, several million more will arrive.

By the way, there is no acceptable hospital in the region near me 
because "legal but won't pay their bills" Mexicans have utterly swamped 
the W*ts*nv*ll* Community Hospital. It is unable to collect from those 
who show up at its emergency room (and must be treated, by law) that it 
is now running short on so many things that it is not safe to use. 
(They'll probably threaten to sue me, so I'll disguise the above name.)

I'd favor letting all in who want to get in, provided nobody demands 
that I pay for any services for them. Any services, not just "few" 
services. There are a couple of billion in the world who would gladly 
come to America if the borders were open...I'm not exaggerating at all. 
Between 1 and 2 billion, at least.

Let them come. But let them starve when 950 million of them find no 
work and a limit to charity by the do-gooder minority. Let piles of 
their corpses fertilize our crops...it's why God made bulldozers.
