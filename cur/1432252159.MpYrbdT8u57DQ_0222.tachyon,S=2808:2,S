We have from time to time phantom "accesses" from odd 
addresses such as yesterday:

   http://161/1.035 

These accesses and addresses do not show up in the log 
files but are listed in summaries of accesses produced by 
Analog on our dedicated server. When we run Analog of
what should be the same log file on our machine the 
addresses do not appear.

The odd addresses change, none repeat, and
do not appear every day.

Got any ideas what such entries indicate? Machine 
camouflage, snoops by spooks, spoofs, debris,
taunts?

We do see in the logfiles our ISP's regular checks of our 
machine for operability, showing log ins from 127.0.0.0, but 
the odd addresses not at all.
