FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - Crews on Saturday installed a clamp over a 
bullet hole in the trans-Alaska pipeline, finally stopping a leak that 
spewed 285,600 gallons of oil onto the wilderness over three days.

KNOB NOSTER, Mo. (AP) - They heard the rumbles and their houses shook. 
As they sat in their homes next to Whiteman Air Force Base, residents 
knew the retaliations had begun.

BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) - A co-worker of the man who died last week from 
anthrax also has tested positive for the disease and the building where 
both worked was closed after the bacterium was detected there.
