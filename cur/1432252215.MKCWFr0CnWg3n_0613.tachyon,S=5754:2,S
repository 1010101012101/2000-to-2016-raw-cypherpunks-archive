[Trying to get this posted to the moderated cryptography list...]

Peter Gutmann should be declared an international resource.  With one
foot in the commercial world, one in the government world and one in the
cypherpunk world, he has a rare perspective on the big security issues.
His irreverance, iconoclasm, frankness and humor make his essays a joy
to read.

Having said that, his recent analysis[1] falls prey to the conventional
wisdom in certain respects.  This gives him a curious blindness which
contrasts with his usual clear vision.  He scrupulously shines his light
on all the dirty corners which the powers-that-be would like to keep
hidden, all the while ignoring the elephant standing in the middle of
the room.

First is the fundamental claim that PKI is not working.  Peter goes into
detail about all the problems that are keeping PKI from success: CRLs,
user interface problems, cost issues, etc.  It's a sad litany of failure.

Only one little thing mars this picture.  PKI IS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS
WHICH IS USED EVERY DAY BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.  Of course this is in
reference to the use of public key certificates to secure ecommerce
web sites.  Every one of those https connections is secured by an X.509
certificate infrastructure.  That's PKI.

One might even go so far as to say that PKI saved the internet, by
allowing people to engage in commerce without fear.  People have been
trained to look for the lock icon which tells them that they have a
secure connection and can safely enter their credit card information.
Certainly it is true that the internet today would be vastly different
if we did not have a deployed, successful, and heavily utilized public
key infrastructure.  Any discussion of PKI's supposed failure ought
to at least recognize that it has been an overwhelming success in this
extremely important market segment.

Another, less fundamental but equally annoying, blind spot is Peter's
allegience to what is conventional wisdom in certain circles, namely that
global names do not exist.  It's one thing for Carl Ellison to make such
a claim; after all, he's worn his SPKI blinders for so long that they
have practically grafted themselves onto his head.  But someone like
Peter ought to be capable of a little more independent thought.

Peter even goes so far as to refer to "a locally unique identifier such
as an email address."  Anyone who would refer to an email address as
being only locally unique is blinding himself most carefully.

The truth is that we are surrounded by globally unique identifiers and
we use them every day.  URLs, email addresses, DNS host names, Freenet
selection keys, ICQ numbers, MojoIDs, all of these are globally unique!
"pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz" is a globally unique name; you can use that
address from anywhere in the world and it will get to the same mailbox.

The existence of globally unique identifiers may not fit into some
people's ideology but it is a matter of fact all the same.  And likewise
with the fact that there are extremely important areas where PKI has been
massively successful.  Let's hope that Peter's legendary clear vision
will allow him to pierce the orthodoxy that comes from his friends as
easily as that which comes from outsiders.
