Insert here the usual quotes about "in war, the first casualty is truth."

Why anyone expects scribblers to stick to the truth (even their flaky 
conceptions of it) in these strange times is beyond me.

We have "Wired News" (not DM) nattering about "gun show loopholes," we 
have "Reason"  opining that free speech is rilly, rilly scary and like, 
ya know, there are no libertarians in foxholes.

I've had a couple of reporters try to reach me for "quotes." When I 
turned them down, they replied along the lines of "But it'll only take a 
minute of your time." All the worse, but they miss this point.

The time for careful consideration of crypto, civil rights, stego, 
biowarfare, and other such issues was over the past decade or two. And 
these issues _have_ been beaten to death.

But I guess a newspaper or magazine or even an online "newschat" service 
would not do well if it advised readers in 30-point type:

READ THE FUCKING ARCHIVES!

USE SEARCH ENGINES!


And so the sheeple are given aerosol sprays of factoids and rumors.
