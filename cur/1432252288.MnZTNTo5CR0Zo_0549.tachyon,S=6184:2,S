I never said they do have an obligation to tell the truth.  I think
they SHOULD, but they often don't.  All I said was that, because the
media often doesn't tell the whole truth, people don't know about bad
stuff that corporations are doing.

Your original question was "Are you against car insurers ASKING [my
emphasis]" about gender.  I'm not against them asking.  I'm against
them discriminating based on that information, however.
