By the way, I've been subscribed to cypherpunks@lne.com for the past 
week or so. It's been a joy not to see the spam and junk and "can u 
help me mak bombz?" noise.

(I was filtering a lot of this junk out by simply filtering all 
cypherpunks@toad.com posts into a special folder and then 
occasionally looking for posts by people I recognized, as sometimes 
even _good_ posters were posting to the toad.com address (usually in 
a reply-to-all mode, one assumes). But a lot of junk was still 
getting through.)

Latency from when I post to lne.com to when I get my own message back 
is usually a couple of minutes. I have no idea what it is to other 
nodes. Probably not much longer.

However, I see the address in my Reply-to-all is 
"cypherpunks@slack.lne.com". This is needlessly confusing, even if 
slack.lne.com resolves to lne.com.
