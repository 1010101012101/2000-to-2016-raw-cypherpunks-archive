Here is a solution:

Everyone is, as with Bitcoin, identified by a public key - but by quite a 
few public keys, providing not anonymity but pseudonymity.

When you store stuff on someone else's system you issue an IOU, which IOU 
is anonymously transferable, using a chaumian protocol, which *does*  
provide anonymity - you pseudonymously store other people's stuff, and  
anonymously use the resulting IOUs to store your own stuff.

>From time to time you check that stuff that is stored on someone else's  
system is available by random sampling.

When stuff stored on someone else's system becomes inaccessible, you note 
him as unreliable, and thus decline to issue IOUs or services to him in 
future, though since IOUs are transferable, you are still up for any IOUs 
you have issued to him in the past.

The software attempts to cancel out IOUs - so that if Bob provides  
services to Carol, Carol provides services to Edwards, and Edwards  
provides services to Bob, they cancel out.  If someone's IOUs get  
cancelled out in a cycle of IOUs that include your own, or include those  
you have confidence are reliable, this is evidence he is reliable in that 
his IOUs are good.

You try to store stuff with those that you have reason to believe are  
reliable, and with those where storing stuff with them enables you to  
cancel out IOUs.

You give low priority to storing stuff from people whose IOUs you have no 
reason to believe.

Repeating: You pseudonymously store other people's stuff, using a nym that 
gains reputation thereby, and anonymously store your stuff on other  
people's systems, using a nym with no reputation.
