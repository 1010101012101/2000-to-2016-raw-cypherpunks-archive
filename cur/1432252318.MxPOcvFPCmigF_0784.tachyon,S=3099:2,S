Response to...This is often known as "collaborative filtering", and pops up in
systems like NoCeM and GroupLens.  What's cool is that you don't need
transitive trust or even poster reputations (anonymity without so much
vandalism!).  Just give the right reviewers the reputation "good/bad
judgment about which articles are worth reading"--and you can find
them by reviewing some articles yourself and measuring similarity of
answers.  Etc,etc.

The last 2 aussi elections have featured something called 'the worm'.Its a 
dial that the studio audience control at the main debates.Individually 
control and all results show as a wavey line(the worm) on TV for the 
masses.A very strong plunge in the worm when talk turned to the new VAT 
tax,the GST. Some biometric feedback on the political reputation of 
politicians.
The fact barely 50% bother voting in the US and UK being another.Rating 
articles is possible at sydney IMC.Often abused IMO.
