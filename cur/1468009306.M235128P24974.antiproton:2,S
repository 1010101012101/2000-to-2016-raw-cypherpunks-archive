	No because the colonies were created by invasion/conquest.
	Australia is not a 'new' state. It's just a rebranded part of
	the british empire. 

	And isn't the australian state still subservient to london, both
	'legally' and as a matter of fact? 
	
	But even more important, the australian state is the
	biggest criminal gang in the region known as  'australia'. The
	people who call themselves the gov't of australia are an
	invading army.
