	Funny, I don't think the people running Cleopatra Records, or 
any of a number of smaller labels wear suits all that often.

	The reason unauthorized copying takes place is because it is 
at least one, and sometimes two orders of magnitude cheaper to copy a 
CD (depending on whether you go to tape or another CD) than it is to 
go buy one.

	People, when given a choice, will almost always opt for the 
*CHEAPEST* method of obtaining a desired good or service.

	I don't buy movies or DVDs, mostly because any cost to me is 
more than it is worth. For music, I would prefer to give the money 
directly to the artists, but until they start selling direct, I'll 
continue to buy what I can find.

	As to supply and demand entering into it, I've purchased 
stuff for two to three times store prices from Europe, simply because 
there isn't the demand in this country for the artist I wanted to 
hear.

	When one has tastes outside the mainstream, be it in music, 
clothing, guns, or whatever, one has to pay the price.
