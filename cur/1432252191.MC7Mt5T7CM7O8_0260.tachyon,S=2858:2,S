Have to in what sense?  If they're constantly reconfiguring the FPGAs
(new software revs, or some sort of evolutionary "learning" process---
the latter not likely in telecom, of course), sure, they have  to be on
reprogrammable structures.

If, on the other hand, you're building a custom hash cracking machine,
you don't need to reconfigure your gates. You could design your
parallelized SHA1 cracking machine and dump it onto a bunch of FPGAs,
but if you really have unlimited resources you take the plunge into
ASICs, at which point you can tighten your timing substantially.
