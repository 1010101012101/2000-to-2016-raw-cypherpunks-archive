That is certainly a good point but don't confuse the "nexus" with NCAs
(agents). I think the nexus just provides services to the NCAs which
actually do the work. Think of it as a core library that services can
draw on.

So having to trust the nexus, is rather like trusting kernel32.dll or
some other core components. Choosing to trust/run NCA sounds pretty
grainular, so you can trust your validated P2P stack from your favorite
independent developer and ignore (if you can) the restrictive DRM
solutions that are offered.

Problems certainly remain though:

In the validated P2P scenario, an Adversary with enough influence to
have Intel/AMD/... hand out a signed internal key can circumvent any
such "protections".

Thoughts?
