"Bello Coffee appears to be the cafe from which police say Ulbricht logged
into the virtual private network (VPN) that he allegedly used as an extra
layer of protection to access Tor and Silk Road. The prosecution says they
have records from Google showing Ulbricht logging into his Gmail account
from the Internet cafe on a regular basis, including on days when the VPN
was used from the same cafe."

oh its too funny....

so what jeremy says about his case is that they just did lots of different
types of investigations and that is what got him - he also states that he
should have been mobile - nomadic ... maybe solutions should be nomadic as
well
