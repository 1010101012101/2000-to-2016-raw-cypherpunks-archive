Quite. The problem here is what happens when the mean expected error of the
estimate given by the ballot starts to get significant with respect to the
mean popularity difference being measured. There is always some error, but
it is not often that the actual difference in votes given to the main
participants shrinks too low for the error to have any relevance. Simply
put, we are faced with the scourge of binary decision problems based on
noisy data.
