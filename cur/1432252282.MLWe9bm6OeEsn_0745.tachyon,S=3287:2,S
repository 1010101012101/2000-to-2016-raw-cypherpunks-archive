What's Our National Identity?
By Duncan Frissell 12.06.01

Oracle's Larry Ellison and Harvard's Allen Dershowitz have been all over
the media recently pitching a National ID Card. One poll indicates 70%
public support for the notion.

Most critics of a National Identity Card mention Hitler, police stops,
and personal privacy to argue against the proposal.  Those are good
reasons to oppose a National ID Card, but they  miss the idea's worst
features.

Proponents of a National ID Card have a responsibility to tell us
exactly what the system will do to day-to-day life in America.  They are
unlikely to do so because most thoughtful Americans would be alarmed at
the prospect.

A National ID card is *not* really about identity. It is about
authorization.
...
When you present your National ID to complete a transaction, you will
actually be asking the Federal Government for its permission. It
converts most significant transactions that you make from private ones
to public ones. It creates a government license for all jobs, all
travel, all medical care, and many purchases. This is a profoundly
troubling departure from American traditions.
