I certainly never implied in any way that a simple G-M tube would be 
useful for this. Implicit in my radioistope mapping comment was that a 
gamma ray spectrometer would be used.

As for portability, the one I used in my lab in 1979-82 was not 
terribly heavy. The heaviest part was the LN dewar, which was large and 
floor-standing. A large dewar is certainly not needed.

The rest of the assembly, even 20 years ago, was mostly portable: the 
germanium detector head, some preamps and pulse-height analyzers, and a 
multichannel analyzer. Most of this stuff is now done on laptops, the 
MCA and analysis software part. Without researching this on the Net, I 
would thus conjecture the entire gamma ray spectrometer could fit in a 
small carry-on case, using a small dewar.

Certainly for the cost of operating a light plane, such a spectrometer 
would be a minor cost by comparison.

And note that this is just what can be easily bought on the open 
market...N.E.S.T. (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) and similar LEO 
people almost certainly have more miniaturized detector setups.

I expect most of the N.E.S.T. detectors are also gamma ray 
spectrometers, probably now so portable they fit unobtrusively into 
briefcases for use in crowded areas. As we discussed a few months ago 
(and I think I discussed this in _particular_ with Thomas!), the S/N 
advantages of using a spectrometer are enormous. Thousand-to-one 
improvements in general S/N are easily achievable. Even more if the MCA 
software is looking for pairs or triples or n-tuples of gamma peaks and 
inferring likely radioisotopes.

(I used this approach in 1981 to solve a major problem in IBM computers 
which were using Intel chips...and I don't mean the alpha particle soft 
error problem. This was a different problem, involving a beta source 
trapped in some of the packages. For this I used a pair of large sodium 
iodide crystals (which my well-equipped lab just happened to have in a 
storage cabinet, fortunately for us) and looked for a specific decay 
mode that resulted in a pair of gammas sent out in opposite directions. 
By using coincidence logic over microsecond intervals, enormous 
improvements in S/N could be achieved. Basically, background radiation 
vanished and only the specific beta decay mode we were looking for 
appeared.)
