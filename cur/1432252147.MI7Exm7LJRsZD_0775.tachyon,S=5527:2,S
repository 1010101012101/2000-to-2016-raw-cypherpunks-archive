Do you know where in China the hotel was? I'm assuming it was out by 
Afghanistan, in which case Hawash looked like practically everybody there: 
Western Xinjiang province is very Muslim (Tajiks, Uzbeks, Uigurs), with not 
too many Chinese (well, no Han Chinese...there may be some Hui Moslems out 
that far west). Half of the guys there will look like the Hawash picture 
they're floating these days (yeah, the one where he's wearing a beard and 
looking real scary...).

FYI...the largest Mosque in the world is actually located in that area 
(Urumqi, maybe? Tashkent? I can't remember...)

In other words, that's exceedingly flimsy evidence.
