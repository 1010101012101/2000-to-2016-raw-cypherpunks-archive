I've written about this book, and my contribution, in the past. Briefly, 
I was contacted by Vernor and Jim several years ago, asked to write a 
chapter, did so in a rushed 10-day period over Xmas 1996, and 
then....nothing. Nothing for several years, until Jim contacted me a few 
months ago and said the book was "On" again and that I needed to make 
some galley page corrections in the next 36 hours! "Hurry up and wait," 
indeed.

Jim had made some edits, which I didn't object to. I checked the galleys 
and made a few changes...I haven't checked my copy to see if he accepted 
by changes (in some cases, my changes to his changes).

It's done, and that's that. I doubt it will change the world.

The "fork in the road" metaphor comes from my strong liking for 
geometrical/picture/map thinkiing (which I can't express here in ASCII 
very well, except through talking about paths, spaces, XY plots of 
cost/benefit, millicent ghettoes, sweet spots, and other things better 
expressed in the form of chalkboard drawings).

I don't want to recount what I wrote in "True Nyms," so I won't. People 
should read it if they want to see what I said then. And it's worth the 
$12-15 just to get Vernor's novella (earlier publications are going for 
absurd levels on Ebay and Amazon).

I expect we are on the "liberty" or "crypto anarchy" side of the fork in 
terms of basic speech (or encrypted speech, which is the same thing). 
However, we are on the other fork, the fork toward statism, on the 
"money" side. Now, a plausible argument can be made that "all money is 
speech," that is, what one spends money on is protected speech 
(vis-a-vis the U.S. Constitution, and vis-a-vis "normal market 
anarchies" in Indonesia, Russia, Afghanistan, etc.).

However, the Authorities seem to think that our money is _their_ money, 
and are severely restricting how we spend our money. Speak politically 
incorrect words and one may find one's bank accounts frozen under the 
PATRIOT Act. And so on. I don't need to fill in the details.

It  goes without saying that anyone attempting a real digital cash 
system must do so with no traceable nexus to himself, his programmers, 
his assets, or his physical nexus. Freezing of assets under earlier 
FinCEN and money-laundering laws would be the least of his worries.

I don't disagree with your view. The nature of the upcoming battle is 
becoming clear. This is one reason I have been hoping in recent years 
that someone simply wipes out Washington, D.C. Vaporizing the millions 
of statists and liberal fascists who work in that viper pit would be a 
public good. If some innocents die, big deal. They should get out while 
they can. If they don't, think of it as evolution in action.

Don't forget that WD I was lost by the statist side: Prohbition was 
eventually repealed, with folks dancing in the streets in ways similar 
to the way Afghanis are dancing in the streets as the Taliban were 
defeated. WD 2 is still underway, but the proles are getting restless at 
the costs, the suppression of liberties, and the jailing of their sons 
and daughters.

Again, the vaporization of Greater Washington would go a long way toward 
ending this War on (Some) Drugs. Let's just hope the reports that UBL 
and Al Quida smuggled two RP-59 suitcase nukes  to the West are correct.
