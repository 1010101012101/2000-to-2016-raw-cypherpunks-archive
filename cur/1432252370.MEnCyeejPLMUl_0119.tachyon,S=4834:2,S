Maybe, but what you're talking about is fighting for crumbs falling from 
those hoarding ever shrinking pieces of pie.

What there is a real market opportunity and need for are venues for the 
younger (and older) progeny of ruling elites from Saudi Arabia to the 
U.S., to wherever, to excercise their territoriality and personal 
hegemony, instead of fomenting jihads, revolutions, wars, coups, etc. 
Space is a logical opportunity.

The war on "terrorism" is doomed. This bunch is fucked, but there will 
*alwayy* be more to replace them, and always just cause for their 
actions, in their minds if not in reality.

I'm suspending my cynicism for the moment because this has been such a
shock to so many, but it's hard not suspect malice on the part of those 
in positions to do something about this for so long, who didn't, with 
every opportunity. I'd hate to think they were just stupid instead. It'd 
mean they didn't deserve their advantages, maybe.
