Yes, property they have an interest in. An interest that is not measurable
in economic metrics.

Who didn't believe in property? Which group didn't believe in property. As
a journalist who is supposedly well versed in this area it's surprising
that you would try to attempt to show the many groups involved as having a
single agenda or theme, when you know that isn't so.

Some don't believe in a world government. Some don't believe in
trans-national economics becoming the primary force in government. Some
object to a combining of the two. Some object to the crass commercialism
that has ravaged Afria with AIDS. Some object to the belief that pledging
a $1B to 'fight AIDS' isn't sufficient when what is needed and what is
required (though they don't want to do it) is to 'end AIDS', without
turning the people into chatels of the state in some eco-socialist wet
dream.

No, there are many views and you're trying to lump them all into one
category is nothing more than evidence to the strength (really complete
lack thereof) of your case.

Provided they're given the opportunity to even make that choice. This is
another of the bitches.

One does not claim to own a culture (demonstrating your lack thereof), one
IS a culture. To have a culture destroyed, especially for nothing more
than profit, is rape.

It's not just 'commie', again your single mindset reveals your shallow
understanding.

The lack of 'control' is exactly why they're so upset. Why they're so
worried. It's exactly why they don't want it to get larger. It's why they
don't want people to know what's going on. These are the same people, who
when they want to search your home, who ask "what have you got to hide?"
What have they got to hide?

You have a shallow sense of ownership if you believe it must be 1-to-1.
