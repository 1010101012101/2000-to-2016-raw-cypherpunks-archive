Gee, this wouldn't look suspicious hanging off your machine would it?

Why bother with HW when the guy was probably running MSWindows?

If you're running an open source OS on one of the machines under test
you should be able to add logging to the driver. Maybe log to a buffer
instead of disk and retrieve the buffer from a simple app.

Alternatively, you could probably just add a 3rd party to the setup and
use one serial port Rx to snoop each Tx ( Pins 2 & 3 ). The chances are
that one driver could drive the two receivers. Just timestamp what you
read and log it. If there is concurrent exchange you might want to use
two separate logfiles. If the parties are politely taking turns one
logfile is fine and easier to read. This requires a fairly simple
application instead of driver level work.
