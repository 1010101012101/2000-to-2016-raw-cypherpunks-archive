...I was thinking 'Hotel California', myself...

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,' said the night man,
'We are programmed to receive.
You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave!'

:-)

Cheers,
RAH

Hmmm. So first they scared off foreign investors who wanted to by
assets as opposed to paper.
Then they started killing off the tourism industry by making visitors
feel as unwelcome as once upon a time communist Albania.
Now they make people think twice before considering living there and
accepting residency (which will of course encourage well healed, smart
people to refrain from paying any tax in the US altogether by not
becoming residents, but commuters of one type or anither, for tax
purposes).

What I don't understand is why on Earth wealthy political dynasties
have sent the current generation of legislators to public schools? I
mean, how else could they be so God-forsakenly dumb?

The "law of unforseeable consequences" has outlived its purpose, and
someone needs to formulate a "law of predictable hardship as a result
of any action by US officials".

If you ask me - - - well, nobody ever does ;o)

Cheers,
Robert.
