I am beginning to think that this whole thing is not so much
"Cypherpunks vs. FBI" as it is "mullets vs. coolnecks".  Obviously,
the average mullet is no more qualified to understand net and crypto
than the average coolneck is qualified to understand... well whatever
it is that the FBI does.  This is ok though, because c'punks and FBIs
each represent the elite of the elite of mullets and coolnecks
respectively.
