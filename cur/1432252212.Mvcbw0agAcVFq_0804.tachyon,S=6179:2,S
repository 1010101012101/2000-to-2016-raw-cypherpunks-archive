Maybe. The important thing is to understand what security is provided
and what is not. Then you can make an informed decision about whether
or not it's bad news.

The short but incomplete answer is yes. Generally, what you are
describing we experimentally verified on the live Tor network back in
2005.  See "Locating Hidden Servers" by Lasse Overlier and myself.
Available at 
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ 
or
http://www.onion-router.net/Publications.html

These sorts of attacks are what motivated us to introduce guard nodes,
also described in that paper.  We all knew, and had seen analyzed in
earlier work by Wright et al., that onion routing circuits were
subject to predecessor attacks, and that what Wright et al. had called
helper nodes would, well help.  What Lasse and I showed was that the
public Tor network as of 2005 was subject to such attacks working very
quickly (minutes) using very limited resources. You could generally
find a hidden server within minutes using just a single hostile Tor
relay (no cooperation from evil web server required). We wanted to
show what you could do with a single relay, which limited us to hidden
server circuits. If you owned at least two relays, you could attack
arbitrary Tor circuits. This was confirmed in simulation on PlanetLab
shortly after by Bauer et al.  ("Low-Resource Routing Attacks Against
Tor", also available at anonbib).

Entry guards don't change the asymptotic threat of such attacks, they
just move it around. Since you could be screwed so quickly and easily
by building random circuits, Tor was changed so that you pick just a
few relays as your entry guards. If one of them is evil, it will see
the entry side of (a large fraction of) your circuits and will be able
to associate you with your destination whenever you go to a hostile
destination or use a hostile exit. What Lasse and I showed was that
you weren't really much worse off from this than when choosing
circuits with random entry relays. And if none of your guards is evil,
an adversary can never de-anonymize you in this way. (Never say
"never". ;>) Cf. the experiments and discussion of layered guards in
"Locating Hidden Servers", and our subsequent research on building
trust into path selection.)

aloha,
Paul
