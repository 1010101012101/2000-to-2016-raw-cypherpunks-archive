The Register took a look at the recent Honeynet Project's
listing of where zombies live - apparently the UK
slightly exceeds the US in total zombie count,
each with about 25% of the zombies that were detected.

But third place was interesting - it's China, with 7.6% of the zombies.
Everybody makes such a big deal about China's Great Firewall,
which is supposed to censor people looking for Ungood Thoughts,
but apparently it not only doesn't stop spammers,
it doesn't stop zombies either.

And Korea's a disappointing 9th place in the list;
you'd think that one of the most heavily-wired countries
in the world could do better than that.
