An interesting thing to try is to play with the "phase" button on many 
high-end gear. This supposedly matters for low frequencies, but despite my 
unarguably golden ears, I'm still not convinced I can hear the difference.

My Thiel speakers, however, claim to be "phase coherent", and that seems to 
be an entirely different matter. In other words, the different frequency 
components of a sound are transmitted in correct phase relationships (ie, 
true to the original sound), and the result is a (sometimes) astonishing 
level of spacial detail. Of course, non-audiophiles will poo-poo that claim, 
but even they will hear that the Thiels are far more accurate than the crap 
that's sold in Circuit City or whatever. So I figure I may as well believe 
Jim Thiel's claim that phase coherence is important in a speaker.
