As a basic idea it seems relatively workable. However, there's one detail 
that perhaps you might want to know about:

"We can push the idea a step further, making a stripped-down CD/DVD drive
that would be able basically just to follow the spiral track with its head
in constant linear velocity"


Unlike a vinyl record, the CD grooves don't form a spiral...they are 
concentric circles. Also, the beginning of the CD is towards the center, the 
end towards the edge.
