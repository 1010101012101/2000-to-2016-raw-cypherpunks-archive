Just thought someone should take the trouble to rebut the anonymous
pro-treacherous-computing rantings...

I have heavily trimmed our anonymous ranters verbose writing style to
keep just the bits I'm responding to (inline...)

Unsubstantiated claim: what incorrect assumptions did Schoen make?  I
did not see any.

> It fails to sufficiently emphasize the many positive uses of the

Schoen points out that TC can be broken out into desirable and
undesirable features.  If you omit the undesirable features, as he
describes, you get the remaining desirable features.

There is no loss from blocking the undesirable features.

> And the recommended fix to TC is not clearly described and as

I see no contradition.  More unsubstantiated claims.

They are not lying and you do your credibility no favors by making
such unsubstantiated claims.

You are just misconstruing the obvious meaning of their warnings: the
features they describe (and plenty more and worse) are technically
feasible with the TC hardware enforcement, and given microsoft's
history of repeated dirty tricks campaigns in the areas of document
format wars, reporting private information back home to microsoft,
browser wars, interface wars, restrictive business practices regarding
licensing it would be fool hardy in the extreme to not expect more of
the same in the area of platform control based on Palladium.

Of course _you_ are not wishing to admit or emphasize these points,
but you can hardly get away with impugning the integrity of high
reputation individuals like Prof Ross Anderson with such paltry
mischaracterisation.

Your arguments are crass and of the form: "but the current microsoft
PR documents don't admit that it could do that, nor of course that
microsoft are planning to do that, so it's not fair for you to point
that out and caution people about the kinds of things microsoft may be
planning".  Technology is criticized and discussed based on the
potential and most likely inferred directions given microsoft's
history and prior demonstration of interest to control various aspects
of the software platform.

It's far from obvious that TC will have no part to play in the next
few decades of open warfare against linux from microsoft.  There are
any number of ways to extend the existing dirty tricks regarding
formats, protocols, licensing etc using the TC hardware enforcement.

Yes indeed and they are quite right.  That is exactly the problem with
remote attestation.

More unsubstantiated claims.  This statement is both false and not
backed up by any of your following text.

> some service conditional on the software being used to access it.
> But that's not really a limitation of choice, because the user could

This is really strange logic: you have a choice not to use a client
because you don't have to use the service?!!?  

Of course it detracts from choice.  Absent remote attestation things
would be as they are today and users could modify existing clients,
write their own clients, or obtain third party clients for any
service.  Removing _that_ choice is the problem.  And it is a big and
significant detraction from the current open nature of the internet.
One that favors large companies such as microsoft with an interest to
stifle innovation and competition.

> The implicit assumption here seems to be that if TC did not exist,
> the service would be offered without any limitations.  

Yes it would.  It either wouldn't be offered or it would be offered
without such limitations.  These are the trade-offs we like because
they are open and offer a level playing field and user choice.

The "choices" you promote come down to the end-user not owning and
controlling their own hardware.

Freedom of choice be damned.

And indeed it does add limitations as I discussed above.

Yes indeeed it is true that it will create ever worse lock-in and
interoperability problems.

They are both problems.  You are right in the limited sense that
Schoen should _also_ have objected to the lock-in enabling aspects of
the sealing function.

That creates lock-in problems yes.  Network effects are worse
multipliers of interop problems were (one of Ross Anderson's
scenarios) microsoft uses sealing to prevent openoffice etal reading
MS word documents.

It's artificial lock-ins which are bad economics for consumers.  They
result in higher prices to prop up the profits of those creating the
lock-in.  Commoditization is good for consumers.  Lock-ins are
attempts to decommoditize by microsoft to extend their waning days as
a virtual monopoly.

But it doesn't do that.  It brings in a new era where the defacto is
controlled and owned up by microsoft and the user has no rights and no
control over their own machines.

Here's that falacious argument again.  In theory what you say may be
true.  In practice it is utterly false and you know it.  Microsoft
will do it's worst to ensure that it does stop people doing things the
old way.  That means that the next sweep of intentionally not
backwards compatible and yet still defacto standard software from
microsoft will not be available without it.  And so your only "choice"
will be shutting yourself off from the rest of the world, or putting
up with ceding control of the platform wholly to microsoft.  Of course
given your contorted logic further up, this would seem like a fine
"choice" to you.

Wrong again.  Microsoft will ride the pain barrier between this
lock-in and the cost of switching.  It may even subsidize short term
to gain the longer term lock-in to put others out of business.

Wrong.  It's just your own microsoft centric myopia doesn't enable you
to see the obvious.  You stick legalistically and pedantically to what
is released in microsoft PR documents, but refuse to acknowledge or
even think for yourself far enough to realise the obvious conclusion
this horrendous wrong-turn for netfreedoms will reach given the long
term business plans and obvious previous tactics which will be
translated to apply and extend the effect of this until it has a
stranglehold on the world.  Again freedoms be damned.

No it doesn't.  Hostile software can't undermine the users
configuration or software.  It just makes the machine act once again
under user control.

No.  It's like allowing user blinding of certificates to ensure
privacy.  You allow user change of software to enable user control.

Wrong.  See above.

Wrong.  The host security aspects still exist with owner override.

Ah so you do concede that despite your claim to the contrary above.
