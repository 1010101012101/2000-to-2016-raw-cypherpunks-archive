I was driving 70 mph on the edge of downtown St. Louis when the exploit
began to take hold.
...
Though I hadn’t touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee
started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on
my back through the in-seat climate control system. Next the radio
switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full
volume. I spun the control knob left and hit the power button, to no
avail. Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the
glass.
...
The result of their work was a hacking technique—what the security
industry calls a zero-day exploit—that can target Jeep Cherokees and
give the attacker wireless control, via the Internet, to any of
thousands of vehicles.
...
I mentally congratulated myself on my courage under pressure. That’s
when they cut the transmission.

Immediately my accelerator stopped working.
