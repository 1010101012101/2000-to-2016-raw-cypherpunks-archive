Below you can read one of the product testimonials:"The patch is great. I should mention that I never felt truly comfortable with the size of my cock. I wanted to have bigger one, but like many men I didn't believe spam letters advertising "some pills which are a breakthrough in medical science" or something like that. My friend advised me to try the VPXL and it works." 

Ivory, Fort Payne.Enjoy your life with the our products.
