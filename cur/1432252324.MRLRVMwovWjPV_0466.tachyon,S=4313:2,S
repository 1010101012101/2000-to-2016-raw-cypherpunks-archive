This is the main reason it is ESSENTIAL that the "rest of the world" NOT 
(repeat NOT) support the U.S. in their upcoming actions against the 
likely WTC terrorists.

If Russia, China, India, Pakistan, the Arab countries, and of course the 
European nations "sign on," this will truly usher in a New World Order. 
Strong crypto will be banned so quickly our heads will spin (those of us 
not already arrested and dealt with).

I have no idea how to derail this freight train that is beginning to 
gather speed.

Dark times are coming. I'll bet a complete ban on strong, unescrowed 
crypto is passed in all European countries, Russia, China, Japan, and 
the U.S. by, say, December 15th. Congresscriminals are stumbling over 
their feet in their race to repeal big chunks of the Bill of Rights. For 
most countries, with no real Bills of Rights, the statists will use this 
to cement their own power.

Dark times.
