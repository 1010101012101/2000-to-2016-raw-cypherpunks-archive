The brother of Congressman Condit, Darrell Wayne Condit,
a bad boy with a record of DUI, driving with suspended
license, MJ possession, is wanted for a violation of probation.

FoxNewsChannel: "One report also has him as a sex offender".

Congressman Condit is hiding something: no one takes
a private polygraph and refuses to take a police one
unless they are hiding something. The police poly
is much tougher because the will ask questions
whose answers they already know from investigating.
