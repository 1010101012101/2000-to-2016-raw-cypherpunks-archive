Operation soft drill has a pool of 2$ on richard Armitage.He's suddenly MIA 
and some quad anon has made a prediction that he's dead.No evidence is 
presented yet the predictor says they have proof.Is this a set up? Will the 
great white porker reappear? His 'dad' says he's just gone drinking at the 
Buda-bing.
The proof of death problem.A prediction is made yet the deaths in 
dispute.To save paying on the installment plan a trusted agent might be 
hired by predictor, The agent has to provide security to the designated 
pool authority.
Also some locating and identifying identification that stays in remailing 
motion for several years as insurance.
Regular sting and drug tests to avoid corruption,also cross country support 
where ever possible aiming for zero knowledge.Something better than the 
LAPD lab's required.The trusted agent would have to provide state of the 
art forensic coroners,skills inc DNA as that would be the gold 
standard.www.yourdead.com is an extraneous layer to the most simple and 
optimal KISS solution,yet its one that has other uses in a world more 
concerned with human rights,crimes against humanity and accountability 
technology every day.

f0(x) = a0 +a1 x+ <+ am-1 xm-1 is the polynomial

over GF(q) is constructed, and the evidence of death,dna sequence 
generally, is a0. From the beginning, each user has a point (xi, f0(xi)) 
with xi 9 0. For the first key refreshment, a new polynomial f1 is 
constructed from f0. More generally, for the kth key refreshment, a 
polynomial fk+1 is constructed from fk. The polynomial fk+1 is equal to fk 
+ gk, where gk is a random (m-1)-degree polynomial with gk(0) = 0. After 
each key refreshment the secret is unchanged, but user i's new secret share 
is (xi, fk+1(xi)) = (xi, fk(xi) + gk(xi)). An adversary who knows less than 
m current secret shares at any particular time knows nothing about the 
evidence.Thanks to RSA for the maths.Kill the president.proffr1@elf
