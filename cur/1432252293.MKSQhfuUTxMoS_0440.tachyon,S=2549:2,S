I don't think the readers store an image of the fingerprint, just some information to make it easy to verify a match.  I don't think you could reconstruct a fingerprint from that information, though you could presumably reconstruct a fingerprint image that would fool the detector.

>From what I've seen, the whole field of biometrics needs a lot of work on characterizing the attacks and defenses against them, and coming up with reasonable ways to verify that a reader resists some attack.  I think individual vendors often have some ideas about this (though I gather their defenses are often disabled to keep the false reject rate acceptably low), but there doesn't seem to be a clean process for determining how skilled an attacker needs to be to, say, scan my finger once, and produce either a fake finger or a machine for projecting a fake fingerprint into the reader.   Anyone know whether some kind of standard for this exists?
