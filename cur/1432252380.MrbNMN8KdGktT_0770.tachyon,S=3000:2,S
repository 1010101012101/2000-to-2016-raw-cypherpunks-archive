Indeed.  And ambiguous.  I always write out the month, which
confuses americans, and telling them that its ambiguous otherwise
just confuses them more :-)   I have settled for "I used to work
with Europeans".

Because little Kevin used that big word.  Isn't he cute?  Too bad
its inappropriate and gratuitous.

Yes, we can all afford sanity checks in our code now.  I would
caution that sometimes you need to override the sanity checks,
e.g., to cause a flood to save the dam.   Note that overriding
will often require you to go through the same control system ---not
some big red lever you manually pull.

Can't wait until Detroit sells Joe Sixpack a drive by wire car
that thinks for him when it shouldn't, to say nothing of failing
digitally (ie catastrophically).

Eg, it's

All-red stops everyone, forever, or until they start to think.  Blinking
red is what you mean.
Blinking yellow isn't in the official lexicon AFAIK.

All-black = blinking red but often taken as green, leading to red
asphalt.
