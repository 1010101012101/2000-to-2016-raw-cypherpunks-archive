Presumption of Guilt: Human Rights Abuses of Post-September 11 Detainees
'The veil of secrecy the Department of Justice has wrapped around the 
post-September 11 detainees reflects a stunning disregard for the 
democratic principles of public transparency and accountability. The 
Department of Justice has sought to shield itself from scrutiny by keeping 
from the public information that is indispensable to determining the extent 
to which its September 11 investigation has been conducted in accordance 
with US law and international human rights law' ( Human Rights Watch )
