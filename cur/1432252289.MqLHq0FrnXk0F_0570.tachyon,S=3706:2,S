Yes, but they don't do that when they're bombing pubs or department stores.
Bobby Sands's suicide for his cause didn't kill other people,
but that doesn't mean the IRA as a whole aren't murderers and thugs
(nor does it mean the British overlords or the
more extreme Protestant groups aren't murderers or thugs either.)

On the other hand, US tobacco merchants, who kill about 7000 Americans per 
week,
plus some harder-to-estimate number of people in other countries,
have been putting warnings on their products for 35 years,
and lots of people still don't get out of the way in time.
(Plus the US government has not only subsidized growers over the years,
they've actively subsidized tobacco export marketing.)
