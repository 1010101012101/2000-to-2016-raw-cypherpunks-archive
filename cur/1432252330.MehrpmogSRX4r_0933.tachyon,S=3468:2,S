Big Japanese firms claim encryption breakthrough

Elliptic curve cryptosystems

By INQUIRER staff: Monday 28 July 2003, 07:36


NTT, MITSUBISHI and Hitachi today said they have succeded in developing a
more effective type of cryptography based on what the companies call
elliptic curve cryptosystems.

Earlier this year, the European Union started NESSIE 5, a plan to use next
generation cryptography, and chose Camella 6, Misty1 7 and PSEC-KEM as
algorithms - developed by Mitsubishi and NTT.

NESSIE stands for the New European Schemes for Signatures Integrity and
Encryption.

Camellia is a 128-bit block encryption algorithm, Misty1 is a 64-bit block
encryption algorithm, while PSEC-KEM is an NTT public key encryption
algorithm.

The firms said that the new project, codenamed CRESERC, creates public key
cryptosystems using mathematical operations over elliptic curves. µ
