   U.S. Will Monitor Calls to Lawyers
   Rule on Detainees Called 'Terrifying'

   By George Lardner Jr.
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, November 9, 2001; Page A01

    The Justice Department has decided to listen in on the conversations
    of lawyers with clients in federal custody, including people who have
    been detained but not charged with any crime, whenever that is deemed
    necessary to prevent violence or terrorism.

    Attorney General John D. Ashcroft approved the eavesdropping rule on
    an emergency basis last week, without the usual waiting period for
    public comment.  It went into effect immediately, permitting the
    government to monitor conversations and intercept mail between people
    in custody and their attorneys for up to a year at a time.

    The move, which the Justice Department said was necessary "in view of
    the immediacy of the dangers to the public," stunned defense lawyers
    and civil libertarians.  They assailed it as an unconstitutional attack
    on the right to counsel and, in the words of American Civil Liberties
    Union official Laura W. Murphy, "a terrifying precedent."

    The monitoring of attorney-client conversations is the latest in a
    series of extraordinary law enforcement measures the government has
    taken in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and
    Washington.

    President Bush last week signed the USA Patriot Act, a bill that gives
    the government a freer hand to conduct searches, detain or deport
    suspects, eavesdrop on Internet communications, monitor financial
    transactions and obtain electronic records on individuals.  The
    administration also has promised to crack down on immigration
    violations, Congress is considering legislation to tighten airport
    security, and Ashcroft announced yesterday that he is reorganizing the
    Justice Department and FBI to concentrate on terrorism.

    Until now, communications between inmates and their attorneys have
    been exempt from the usual monitoring of social phone calls and visits
    at the 100 federal prisons around the country.

    According to a summary published in the Federal Register Oct. 31, the
    monitoring will be conducted without a court order whenever the
    attorney general certifies "that reasonable suspicion exists to
    believe that an inmate may use communications with attorneys or their
    agents to facilitate acts of terrorism."

    The definition of "inmate" previously covered only people in custody
    of the federal Bureau of Prisons, but it was changed to cover anyone
    "held as witnesses, detainees or otherwise" by INS agents, U.S.
    marshals or other federal authorities.  Since Sept. 11, the government
    has detained nearly 1,200 people, many on immigration violations.  The
    Bush administration has declined to say how many have been released.

    Explaining the new rule, the Justice Department said authorities "may
    have substantial reason to believe that certain inmates who have been
    involved in terrorist activities will pass messages through their
    attorneys (or the attorney's legal assistant or an interpreter) to
    individuals on the outside for the purpose of continuing terrorist
    activities."

    The president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
    Irwin Schwartz of Seattle, denounced the eavesdropping as "an
    abomination" and said it would be challenged in court at the first
    opportunity.

    "The Code of Professional Responsibility is quite clear: a lawyer must
    maintain confidentiality," Schwartz said.  "If we can't speak with a
    client confidentially, we may not speak with him at all.  And if we
    can't do that, the client is stripped of his Sixth Amendment right to
    have a lawyer."

    The Justice Department said it will set up "procedural safeguards" to
    protect the right to counsel.  Inmates and their attorneys will be
    notified "of the government's listening activities," and the
    monitoring will be done by a special "taint team" that will not
    disclose what it hears to federal prosecutors or investigators without
    approval by a federal judge, officials said.

    Records of clearly privileged information, such as a discussion about
    a client's defense, will not be retained by the monitors, the
    department said.  "Apart from disclosures necessary to thwart an
    imminent act of violence or terrorism, any disclosures to
    investigators or prosecutors must be approved by a federal judge," it
    added.

    The critics were not mollified.  "Who's going to be on the taint team?"
    asked Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security
    Studies, a nonprofit group in Washington.  "The government says it's
    building a mosaic, processing thousands of bits and pieces of
    information that may seem innocuous at first glance.  How is the 'taint
    team' going to know if something a person says to a lawyer is part of
    the mosaic or not without sharing it with others?  This seems to be a
    useless safeguard.  What if they think what they overhear is in code?"

    Martin said monitoring of witnesses and others who have not been
    convicted would be "particularly outrageous." Murphy, who is director
    of the ACLU's Washington national office, agreed, saying, "the idea
    that this could be happening to innocent people is really disturbing."
    A lawyer's effectiveness, she added, can be dramatically diminished if
    the government is listening in, making a client fearful of disclosing
    all that the attorney needs to know to mount a forceful defense.

    The attorney-client eavesdropping authority is an addition to the
    "special administrative measures" the government has imposed on
    certain inmates since the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the
    bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.  They include
    solitary confinement, interception of mail and restrictions on
    visitors and telephone calls.  But until Ashcroft signed the new
    regulation, they were limited to 120-day periods.  Now, all such steps
    can be ordered for a year at a time and renewed indefinitely at
    one-year intervals.

    Those under "special measure" regimes include Omar Abdul Rahman, the
    blind sheik convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Abdul
    Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah, convicted of conspiracy to blow
    up 12 civilian jumbo jets; Eyad Ismail and Ramzi Yousef, two others
    convicted in the WTC bombing; Wadih Hage, convicted of conspiring to
    kill Americans around the world; and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed
    Rashed Daoud Owhali, who were convicted in the 1998 bombings of the
    U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

    At a trial last June, an Algerian witness said Rahman issued a "fatwa"
    or religious ruling from prison, telling followers to "fight Americans
    and hit their interests everywhere."
