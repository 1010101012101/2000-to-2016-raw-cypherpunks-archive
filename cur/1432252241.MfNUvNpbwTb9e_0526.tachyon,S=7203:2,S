Future pervasive communication systems aim at supporting social and
collaborative communications: the evolving topologies are expected to
resemble the actual social networks of the communicating users and
information on their characteristics can be a powerful aid for any
network operation. New emerging technologies that use information on
the social characteristics of their participants raise entirely new
privacy concerns and require new reflections on security problems such
as trust establishment, cooperation enforcement or key management.

The aim of this workshop is to encompass research advances in all areas
of security, trust and privacy in pervasive communication systems,
integrating the social structure of the network as well.

=============================
Topics of Interest
=============================

- new aspects of trust
- privacy concerns
- availability and resilience
- community based secure communication
- data confidentiality, data integrity
- anonymity, pseudonymity
- key management
- secure bootstrapping
- security issues in forwarding, routing
- security aspects regarding cooperation
- new reputation systems
- new attack paradigms
- new requirements for software security
- malware


=============================
Important Dates
=============================

Submission deadline:        October 18, 2009
Notification date:          December 21, 2010
Camera ready submission:    January 29, 2010

=============================
Submission instructions
=============================

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for
publication. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be limited to
6 pages in IEEE 8.5x11 conference format, and formatted in accordance
with the IEEE Computer Society author guidelines. The link for the
templates and further guidelines for preparing and submitting the
manuscript are available on the workshop website. All papers are managed
electronically through easychair, the submission website is:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sesoc2010
Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous and double-blind review process
handled by the Technical Program Committee. Authors' names must not
appear in the paper.

All accepted papers need to have a full registration to the PerCom
2010 Conference (There is no workshop only registration). Moreover,
no-shows of accepted papers at the workshop will result in those
papers not being included in the IEEE Digital Library.
