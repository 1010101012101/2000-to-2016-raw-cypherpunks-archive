What a dreadfully awful series.  I side-eyed my way through parts of the 
first two episodes, the second only because I wondered how they'd cover 
grinding/biohacking, and it was so poorly done I could hardly get through it.

There is much ado made about "evil" RFID chips, usually by insane religious 
whack jobs (e.g. Katherine Albrecht) or scientifically illiterate tinfoil 
hat-types, but it's much more benign to have some self-selected info 
contained on a passive chip in a finger than to carry a GPS-enabled 
tracking device on one's person at all times.

My voluntary chip-implanted info is much more private and secure than the 
personal info all of you voluntarily divulge on Failbook daily.  Hey, post 
another "selfie" and be sure to tag all your friends!  Check-in at your 
favorite restaurant (and don't forget to post pictures of your food, 
everyone cares about what you're stuffing into your face.)  Post your 
vacation pictures with the GPS coordinates in the EXIF data.  Let Facebook 
harvest your contact info!  Make it easy for the feds and every advertiser 
on Earth to profile you and track your every move.  And then have the nerve 
to talk about Orwellian surveillance and the "evils" of RFID chips.
