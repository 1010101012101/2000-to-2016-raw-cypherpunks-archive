	Yeah. Just like used car dealers do =)

	I want the tor project to explain what tor is, exactly. To
	explain what the state is, how it is funded. To explain
	what the US state is, what it has done and what it does.
	

	And to finally explain that they, the tor project, work for
	those motherfucking psychos known as the American State, helping
	their imperial project while vomiting hypocritical nonsense
	about 'human rights' and 'oppresed womyn'

	Let me know when they behave like decent humans being and do
	that.

	Come on, not that one...

	No. It's timing, counting packets that kind of thing. Nothing
	fancy. I suppose they have dedicated hardware to do that sort
	of correlation, well call that 'number crunching' if you want...

	Yes. Do you 'trust' them? =)

	For instance? I think 'stupid' in this context would mean
	"things that reduced their power and influence". I don't think
	the power of the US military, which is of course the heart of
	any state, is decreasing. Quite the contrary. So, I'd describe
	as rather clever in their little brown-children-murdering game.

	Look the US military blew up the WTC to have an excuse to
	impose a global 'cyber' police state. How's their little plan
	proceeding?
