I disagree with what many say is the "Illegal Occupation" of Northern =
Ireland. England conquered Ireland over 800 years ago, just like the USA =
conquered the Indians of the Great Plains. What i'm getting at is that =
Countries Conquer.

Yet Ireland was always English if you go far back enough, the First =
Irish where from England, the Irish Patron Saint, Patrick, was from =
England. Ireland was first properly civilised by the English and it goes =
on.

People say the Army should pull out, well if they where never sent in, =
the troubles would have been long over! The Loyalists had "republicans =
and nationalists" on the run and would have kept Ulster or NI totally =
British, it was the Amry that was sent in to "protect" the Irish that =
stopped Loyalists and Unionists from winning the "war" in NI!

People seem oblivious to the fact that the "minority" cause the trouble =
in NI! What aboout in Corsica and Sardinia that have a MAJORITY that =
want independance from Italy and France, what about the Catalonia Region =
of Spain and the Basque they want Independance but no you never hear =
about it!

The IRA, ETA (Basque group) and other republican groups are a bit left =
wing paramilitary or in otherwords slightly communist and even if NI was =
given back to the republic, the IRA will want control of ALL of Ireland! =
They would have a bigger army than the Irish Republic have and so could =
beat them (like they almost done in the Irish Civil War around 1922, =
which was when it had already got independance in the south).

One final thing, if Ireland was reunited (pray to God it doesn't, for =
the safety of the Irish), the Loyalist Paramilitaries will go mad =
bombing anywhere they like as its the Irish money that is going to be =
used to rebuild almost everything, killing many more people and also =
will be demanding Independance FROM Ireland, and as the irish army do =
not have the money or resources to really prevent them, like the British =
could (the SAS should have been effective if used!) and the troubles in =
Ulster will go on, till all Catholics there are dead or all Protestants =
are!

Remember 1690! Londonderry, remember NO SURRENDER!
