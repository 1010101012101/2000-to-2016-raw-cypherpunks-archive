hi,

thank you Mr. Jim,one more query, regarding Godel's
incompleteness theorom.

with reference to
http://www.miskatonic.org/godel.html

"
Gödel asks for the program and the circuit design of
the UTM. The program may be complicated, but it can
only be finitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for
Program of the Universal Truth Machine. "

we know that there are unprovable and provable
statements and there is no way to distinguish all
solvabe problems from unsolvable ones as you said
below.

In godel's  theorom,above mentioned,it says circuit
design and programme must be finitely long.

Is that necessary?we can't say for sure,right?Isn't it
an unprovable statement which is made or more likely
an assumption.

if we say other wise,why has the programme to be
finite?
Thank you very much.

Regards  Data.
