I thought it was trivial all along.

Oh please. They (well, many of them) sure didn't forget their dislike of 
the US when they saw those newsreels of the twin towers tumbling down.

Actually, they mostly systematically manipulated and fucked themselves 
over, with occassional help from different factions in the rest of the 
world. 

And they already have a "symbol of how we've", etc. - American military 
presence in the most holy of Islamic countries, Saudi Arabia. That's 
one of the largest reasons for Al-Qaeda growth in recent years. Compared 
to infidel military bases somewhere near Mecca and Medina, whatever's 
done to some dictator who has presided over a mostly secular regime is 
insignificant. And American military presence in Saudi Arabia is 
actually subsiding now because Iraq is no longer a threat.

This is just so much armchair psychology. Most of it is silly 
theoretising that has no grounding in reality.

One side says: look, we had to humuliate him publicly, because those 
Arabs only understand power, they only respect you if you clearly show 
them who's the boss, bla bla bla.

The other side says: we shouldn't humiliate him, because the Arab 
culture is built around the all-powerful concept of pride, and they'll 
never forget how we hurt their pride, bla bla bla.

Both sides are spewing idiotic garbage with some marginal relevance to 
reality, which is much, much more complicated than that. You can't 
predict what "the crowd" will say, and the Arab "crowd" is no more 
symplistic than the American one. It does "work" somewhat differently, 
and does display different "mentality", whatever that means, but none of 
it is exploitable with any useful degree of certainty by cheap armchair 
psychologising.

Truth is always relevant.
