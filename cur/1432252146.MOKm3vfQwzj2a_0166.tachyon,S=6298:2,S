I must have misunderstood the reports of the part involving Beacon =
Press, since  the documents published there were the same ones as he had =
placed in the records of the committee. On reflection, ISTM that the =
mistake Gravel and Beacon made was that Gravel had obtained it as =
classified material, and so couldn=92t publish it until it was =
declassified, even though anyone else could have obtained identical =
documents as an open matter of public record. (A similar quirk affects =
people who read the Snowdon documents in that the handling rules still =
apply even though the documents have been published openly, which also =
makes the mistake of confirming the authenticity of at least some of the =
documents.)=20

For any lawyers out there - do state legislatures have an equivalent of =
parliamentary privilege, and if so does it protect state legislators =
from federal law? I know in Australia they do, but there parliamentary =
privilege mostly relates to defamation law rather than official secrets =
(and that=92s a matter of state law).
