The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you will stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
