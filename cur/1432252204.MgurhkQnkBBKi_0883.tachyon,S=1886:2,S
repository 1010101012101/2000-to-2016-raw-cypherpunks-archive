I don't care about The Rat's postings like some of
my anonymous associates, but someone's razor
reporting is inaccurate.  Some spam from this list
has been revoked at razor so it drops down below
30% confidence, when it shouldn't be revoked at
all [1].  Inversely, some legitimate postings are
getting reported to razor when they should not be
[2].

If you auto-report stuff to razor, please be
extra-careful with this list.
