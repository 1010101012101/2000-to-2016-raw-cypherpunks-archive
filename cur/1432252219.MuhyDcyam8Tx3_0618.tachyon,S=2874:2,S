I understood black unicorn, and Sandy, to be claiming it was inappropriate, and quite dangerous.

You, while more cautious than they, seemed to endorse their position, without being very clear as to what it was you were endorsing.

Black Unicorn's argument seemed to be "Everything is forbidden, therefore you need to hire a lawyer who will issue the magic incantations to make it legal.

This is nonsense on two counts:

1.  Not everything is forbidden.

2.  If everything is forbidden, then lawyers have no magic incantations.
