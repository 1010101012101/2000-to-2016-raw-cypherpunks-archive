The pages about 'pringle's chip canister yagis' show a piece of plumbing PVC
enclosing the final package, a tube about the size of an arm.  It
doesn't look like a TV antenna, more like the microwave uplinks (Funny that.)
from mobile tv vans, though those are usually helical.  

So the Ghz yagi is readily hidden.

The 802.11 hacks claim a good 15 db with a homemade yagi.  I think the RF
deal is that you can't scale a yagi as far as you can a dish -past some
number of segments the yagi doesn't give you more, but a dish keeps on
giving  
(Areceibo for instance...) if you have the space for it and can take the wind.
