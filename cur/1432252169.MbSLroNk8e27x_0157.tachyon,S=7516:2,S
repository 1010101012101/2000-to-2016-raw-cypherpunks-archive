	Governments are pretty homoneneous criminal organizations. The
	fact that sometimes different government factions within a
	given government quarrel a bit over the spoils is basically
	meaningless, from the point of view of government victims at
	least.


	In the case of tor - employees of the american nazi military, it
	should be pretty obvious that they are aligned with american
	nazi policies, despite their hypocritical alleged support for
	'free speech'. 


	By the way, if the american nazi government had to fund
	something like tor, what would be the best approach? 

	Two options : One, try to do it secretly. Problem is, it's
	difficult and sooner or later (sooner) people would find out
	and the project reputation would rightfully suffer. 

	So what to do? Well, hide in plain sight! Get the money openly
	from the government and brag about how 'transparent' the scam
	is!! Clever.

	As mentioned ad nauseam tor is 'useful'  for the 'intelligence'
	'community'.

	bla bla bla 

	Name calling! You are a witch! You are a conspiracy theorist!!
	You hate AMERIKKKAAA!!!!

	Absolutely none of the government actions are secret.
	Especially things done by the most brutal faction, the
	military. Anything the military do is public, published in
	www.nazis.org and for the common good!!!
