And in answer to various e-mails sent to me, including I think from 
this rvlpeiru@cots.com person, I don't know when the new edition is 
coming out. Amazon is saying March 2001.

Though this is 3 years after I was told it would be coming out (when 
Jim Frenkel was haranguing me about working over Xmas to finish my 
chapter, 4 years ago!!!!!!), I think Vinge's winning of the Hugo this 
past year may make the 2001 date more plausible. Most publishers try 
to ride the coat tails of things like Hugos.

My point about the old edition is that $25 is a lot to pay for what 
is basically a novella. I predict those who pay $25 and finish the 
novella two hours later will be saying "I paid $25 for _this_?"

TN is a seminal novella, but people should not be expecting it to be 
the Second Coming.
