Cuuuute! :)

Could be even more interesting if combined with a suitable kind of 
encryption; I don't know how much I should trust Google, they are way too 
big to not be more than attractive "focus point" for "carpet-watching" 
people.

The author is aware of this issue.

Question for the crowd: How difficult it would be to write a suitable 
crypto engine as a plug-in module for FUSE itself? Then we could have 
support for encrypted files on any filesystem accessible through FUSE.

What to do with all that extra, network-based storage that comes with your 
Gmail account? If you're using Linux, you can turn it into a mountable 
filesystem with GmailFS.

GmailFS provides a mountable Linux filesystem which uses your Gmail 
account as its storage medium. GmailFS is a Python application and uses 
the FUSE userland filesystem infrastructure to help provide the 
filesystem, and libgmail to communicate with Gmail.

GmailFS supports most file operations such as read, write, open, close, 
stat, symlink, link, unlink, truncate and rename. This means that you can 
use all your favourite unix command line tools to operate on files stored 
on Gmail (e.g. cp, ls, mv, rm, ln, grep etc. etc.).
