I'll add two words to the list: "support" (as opposed to "provide"), and
"accountability." I prefer to say that a digital signature is a tool that
"supports accountability."  I suppose that "supports non-repudiation" would
be fine as well.  My concern is when the phrase "provides non-repudiation"
is used it implies that complete non-repudiation can be provided technically
(which I don't believe is the case).
