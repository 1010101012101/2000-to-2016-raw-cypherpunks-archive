The Observer tomorrow reports that the bin Laden
video is likely the result of a CIA sting operation,
arranged through the Saudi sheik who was induced
by one or more intel agencies to lure bin Laden into
a picture perfect setting and induce him brag.

The report notes that the sheik appeared to be aware
of the video but not bin Laden.

It goes on to say that the tape looks very much like
tapes of Mafia stings by the FBI.
