Hmmm, in the news here in the Netherlands a Dutch law professor
said that a guilty plea from Milosevic would obviate the "(dis)proving
of guilt"-part of the trial and everything would therefor move to
determining the measure of punishment. A plea of not guilty means the
trial can start immediately. If no plea is entered, the trial will
proceed after a month without a guilty plea. This is not the same as
recording it as a non-guilty plea, it's just giving the defendant a
month the time to decide whether he wants to skip the part about proving
he did it. Seem logically sound to me.
Obviously, this is not in the interests of Milosevic.

With kind regards,
