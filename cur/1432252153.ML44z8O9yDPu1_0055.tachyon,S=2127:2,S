It now appears to be a suicide, or _very_ subtle wetwork indeed!

No surprise that Blair would like the Kelly tragedy put to rest.  After
all, much of the government has Kelly's blood on their hands
(figuratively speaking).  Oh how they were hoping that it was
suicide, so that the truth is beside the point.  There are now many
facts that Blair and the US warmongers would like to have laid to rest. 
Then again, what is a little murder after you have unleashed
devastating war on the world. ;-\
