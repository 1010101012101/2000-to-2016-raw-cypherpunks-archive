This has been proposed for, but it fails for the usual reasons.

An ISP is free to say "anyone requesting a tap is required to pay a 
fee," just as any ISP is free to say that it will handle installation 
of special Carnivore equipment for a certain fee.

But when Big Brother commands that his Carnivore boxes be added, ISPs 
are afraid to shoot his agents who trespass.

And so the work is done for free. And so, too, will the fees you talk 
about be waived.

I think my solution may be best: take a few ISPs who have bent over for 
Big Brother and kill their owners and staff. A few ISP owners found 
necklaced and smoking may send a message to others. It works for the 
Mob in a way none of the more civilized approaches can possibly work.

"You narc us out, we douse your children with gasoline and light them 
off. Your choice."

Sometimes freedom demands harshness.
