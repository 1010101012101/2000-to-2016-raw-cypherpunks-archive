Liars,cheats and bullies never prosper,or do they? This fine pair sure seem 
to.Sometimes we shoot for the moon and do those other things not because 
its easy...but because its hard.Its time for a new generation of 
crypto-anarchists to ask not what freenets can do for me but what I can do 
for freenets.
We have irrefutable evidence that gates and May are capitalist robber 
barons intent on preserving hegemony even after collapse of govts.These 
corporate criminals live holed up in heavily armed and surveilled compounds 
yet at some point every scummy little crook has to come out from under 
their rock.Even if like BG,its to promise to give back some minuscule 
fraction of what he stole.Is there any evidence that the wealth they 
accumulated showered down as a result of their intrinsic worth?The sheer 
quality of their contributions? Read them both and make up your own 
mind.Some minor stuff here and there,not enough to save them,simply enough 
to show that even the worst humans that ever lived had at least one faintly 
redeeming feature hidden somewhere.
The only interesting thing now about the certain fate of these 2 is if they 
realize how close to  death they are and run.I hear there are some empty 
caves available in afghanistan.The APster justice posse will still find and 
destroy them.
