Hi there lovely,
I was searching the neat few days ago. I am new to this thing.
and saw your profile. I decided to email you cause I found 
you attractive. I might come down to your city in few weeks.
Let me know if we can meet each other in person.
I am attractive girl. I am sure you won't regret it.
