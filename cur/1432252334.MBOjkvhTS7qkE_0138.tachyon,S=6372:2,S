Check out firegloves. It's outdated, and I'd love to see it getting
some love, but it's a great POC for anti-fingerprinting in Firefox.
Still works with Iceweasel 20, so it's aged well for an apparently
unmaintained academic project. Among the key features; a restricted set
of fonts sent to sites, possibly including cycling the fonts randomly
to confuse fingerprinting by recurrent font-lists.

Note though, it breaks some websites in a manner akin to
fascist-maxima-noscript. So you'll sometimes need to disable it; Paypal
is a good example.

User-agents are the devil, though, because whatever about other sources
of browser entropy, the User Agent is a big honking bonus score every
site gets for zero effort. Worse, most efforts to minimise User-Agents
can end up maximising them instead, and there don't seem to be any
*current* lists of "most common user-agent string" to work from to
reduce entropy. I've set mine to a super-generic-looking
Windows/Firefox setting, but as other people upgrade their browsers and
OSes and as architectures get more diverse, browser UAs are getting
more and more diverse, too..

I vote we ditch them entirely and just assume that all browsers to
HTML5 or GTFO.
