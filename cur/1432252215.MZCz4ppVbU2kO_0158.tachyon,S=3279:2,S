No, but it is very interresting that all of this didn't matter while 
Saddam was the "good guy" for our causes (and by that I mean the 
Western world general).

To use those people as a reason to wage war (even if the outcome would 
better their lives and the votes on this is still out) still has moral 
implications, and if it is only by the sanctions that did nothing to 
prevent those cruelties from happening but actually adding more to 
their daily lives.

I don't know about you. But I know that if I would have lost family 
members in the past 12 years because of Sanctions and Saddam I would 
(at best) find the current arguments FOR the war (if I would know about 
them) more than cynical.
