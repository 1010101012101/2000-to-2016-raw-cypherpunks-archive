Hum.

Can anyone figure out a way to determine if one's hotmail, etc...has been 
looked at or not?

The only thing my limited mind can think of sounds superficially like it 
won't work:

Use a gmail account to forward all email to some routine that time-stamps 
and then hashes the message+timestamp and then sends the email on to the 
hotmail account.

Of course, "they" can just start looking at the gmail account and monkey 
with things before they get over to the hotmail account. But that might be 
an improvement...depending on how gmail forwards, they might not be able to 
interfere without at least notifying gmail. That's a lot better than 
nothing.
