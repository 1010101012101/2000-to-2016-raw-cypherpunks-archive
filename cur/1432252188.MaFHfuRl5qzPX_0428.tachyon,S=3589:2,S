Not that I know of.

Want to run one?  It doesn't take much bandwidth, just
a host that's up most of the time.  You or anyone else
who wants to set up a node is welcome to use some or all of
the majordomo mods I made to filter spam.

Sure.  It might be difficult to pass such a law in the US, and
completely unconstitutional, but that doesn't always stop them.

It's more likely that the cypherpunks list would be declared
a "terrorist organization" under sealed FISA orders, and the various
"ringleaders" rounded up in the middle of the night.

But I don't think even that is likely; it's easier and more
productive to ignore the list and target the rare list member
who does something chargeable in real life..
