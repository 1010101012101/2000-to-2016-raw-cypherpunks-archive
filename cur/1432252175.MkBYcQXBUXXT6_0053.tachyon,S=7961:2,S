I see the problem as this: not everyone can run Tor on the machines from
which they browse the web, and not everyone can configure their proxy
settings to point at an open Tor proxy.

I hacked serifos to function as a proxy that sends traffic through Tor.
It is not entirely perfect, but it usually works.  Known limitations
include failure to properly munge image and link tags on SSL-encrypted
pages and an inability to properly handle redirections resulting from
Javascript code.

So, you can visit:

http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/proxy/TOR_HTTP_URL

where TOR_HTTP_URL is any HTTP or HTTPS URL, and the Tor client running
on serifos will take you to your specified URL.  For example,

http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu/proxy/http://www.whatismyip.com/

This is how it works:

First, I configured apache on serifos to use mod_proxy:

<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    ProxyPass /proxy/ http://localhost:8119/
</IfModule>

Then, I ran my own proxy script that feeds requests to Privoxy and
munges HTML replies to properly translate image and link tags.  The code
is here:

http://afs.eecs.harvard.edu/~goodell/blossom/src/edgeproxy

I invoke this script as follows:

$ edgeproxy -l localhost:8119 -r localhost:8118

Finally, I ran Privoxy on port 8118, in the normal manner specified
on the Tor website.

Please check it out if you are interested and feed me bug reports if you
find anything broken (other than what I described).

Thanks,

Geoff
