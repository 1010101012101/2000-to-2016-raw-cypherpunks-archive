	Nonsense.

	If Insurance companies were completely (or even greatly) 
deregulated, they could offer *seriously* ala-carte policies. They 
could easily write a policy that simply excluded--say breast 
cancer--from the policy of a woman who has a strong genetic 
predisposition to it, and *greatly reduce* the overall cost of her 
insurance for *all* other illnesses.

	Leaving her free to either (a) find a high risk policy *just* 
for that, or spend the money on getting a radical mastectomy to 
eliminate the problem. Or any of a dozen other issues.

	That's what Nathan "I'm a thoughtless whiner" and Sambo A. S. 
seem to miss, is that increased costs for a few mean *savings* for 
everyone else.
