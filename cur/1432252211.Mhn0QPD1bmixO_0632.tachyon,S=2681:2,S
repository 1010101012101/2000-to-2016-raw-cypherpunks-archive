Is there a copyright law in Islam? Some people say
that knowledge is a common property and it cannot be
restricted. They use the Hadith of the Prophet, peace and
blessing be upon him, that "Wisdom is the lost property of a
believer, it is his, wherever he may find it." What do you think
of making copies of computer software?
