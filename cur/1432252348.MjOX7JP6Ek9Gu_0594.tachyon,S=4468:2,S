U.S. - MEXICO: NO ONE IS ILLEGAL  Aug 15 2002
  'Borderhack!' Hits San Diego and Tijuana

Borderhack! forms part of the 'No one is illegal' chain of bordercamps, 
which have been held on various national borders throughout Europe since 
1998. From August 16-18, a camp will be established in Tijuana, Mexico next 
to the border fence. The event will include a campground on the beach, 
conferences, expositions of photography, digital art, documentaries, and 
interactive multimedia. The festival will also operate online, transmitting 
live video feeds, net radio, website updates. A similar camp titled 'Una 
festival de resistencia contra la frontera' examining similar issues will 
be held at the same time in Nogales, Sonora and Arizona.

In San Diego County, the INS and the U.S. Border Patrol are planning to 
complete the final stages of a three-tiered fence at the U.S.-Mexico 
border. The fence would run from the ocean eastward destroying 
environmental and cultural resources. In addition to the borderhack! 
festival, numerous groups are calling attention to border issues, including 
the Southwest Alliance to Resist Militarization.
Further coverage on these issues can be found in the July26 and July 21 
features on the bordercamp in Strasbourg, and the June 7 feature on the No 
Border movement.
