        Proposed New Bioterrorism Law Prepares for
        Worst

        By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent

        WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A model bioterrorism law being
distributed to U.S. states
        and territories would help them prepare for the worst by
clearing up a confusing mass
        of antiquated rules and powers, legal experts said on Tuesday.

        Drafted at the behest of the Department of Health and Human
Services (news - web
        sites) and with the help of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (news -
        web sites), the new law proposes ways to legally quarantine
people, confiscate
        hospitals and get quick information to doctors in case of a
bioterror attack.

States are being urged to use the law, published on the Internet at
        http://www.publichealthlaw.net, either as a template or to patch
holes in their own
        measures.
