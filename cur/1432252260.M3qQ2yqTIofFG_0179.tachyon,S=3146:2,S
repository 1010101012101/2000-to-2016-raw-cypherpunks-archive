One could argue that all electromagnetic radiation is in the public
domain and receivable. However it is illegal to have equipment capable
of receiving cell phone conversations because the rights of the
telephone company and the rights of the conversants could be violated.
IR equipment is capable of seeing far more from outside a house than
just the wall temperature. This kind of surveillance is clearly
invasive, in my opinion.
