In my mind the sudden appearance of that momentarily almost-famous
"pole dancer girlfriend" of Snowden's is of a piece with the rest
of The Snowden Affair:  It raises more questions than it answers,
and adds more reasons to suspect a double game.

Did the "pole dancer girlfriend" ever exist, and is that really
her?  I will assume so, for the sake of a fun story.  What are the
odds that she has travelled more than one mile in any direction
since Ed went walkabout, without that motion being logged for
analysis by a consortium of TLAs?  Other than "she has always
worked for us and is still passing polygraph exams," how could her
bona fides as a person of no interest be so confidently endorsed
by the public servants who let her walk away?  If on the other
hand Russia worked some hocus pocus on her behalf, why have public
officials and partisan propaganda mills that already call Snowden
a Russian agent remained silent on that subject?

Painting the young lady in question as a Russian agent who used
her pole dancing skills to steal U.S. secrets would not be hard:
The story sells itself.  Part two of the story would be how she
fluttered away free as a bird to the waiting welcome of her
Russian paymasters:  First Benghazi, now Boris and Natasha in a
Moscow love nest?  It's an outrageous story that would suit many
of our partisan political propagandists very nicely right about...
now.  But all I hear so far is crickets.

"Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not
learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do
not reason it by using reason. To let understanding stop at what
cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it
will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven." -- Ursula K. LeGuin
