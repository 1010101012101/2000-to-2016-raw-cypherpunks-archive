Don't even bother trying to destroy the original. Chances are
they will make a backup of everything before attempting anything.
And destroying something is likely to be very obvious, and very
damning. Best bet is to hide a second thing, which is kind of
incriminating, but not much. And hide it less well that the real
thing. People who think they understood the trick won't look any
further, because they think they understood it.
So, be sure to wail and complain when they discover the fake data,
and not bear a knowing smile :)
