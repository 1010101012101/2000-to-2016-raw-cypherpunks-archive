 >>"Shoes for industry!" The general point is that it is going to be very 
difficult to stop persons willing to die in their acts from carrying them out.

Like real anarchists? Ones that propertarians want to shoot.Hard to get em all.

 >>Planes are very fragile things and explosives can be formed into 
ordinary-looking objects (cases of computers, coffee mugs, belt buckles, 
etc.) and with very little vapor emission (smell).<<

Reputations are very fragile,tammies is gettin a bit on the nose.

  Chemical timers even let bombers get away (acid eating through something 
in a sealed ampoule...). An attacker who opens an aircraft emergency door 
in flight could also do a lot of damage (to the airline and travel 
industry, if nothing else). Fact is, soft targets abound.

Jim bell picked up on that.

  >>There are solutions, but not necessarily the police state measures now 
unfolding. We talked about this a lot after 911.<<

Your talking a lot.But your not sayin much.Say something once,why say it again?
