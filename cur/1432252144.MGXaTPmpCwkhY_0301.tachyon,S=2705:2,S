It appears that they can't tell the medical isotopes from others....

High Security Trips Up Some Irradiated Patients, Doctors Say 

AL BAKER / NY Times 4dec02

In one case last spring, a man being treated for an overactive thyroid gland

was stopped by the authorities on two occasions while at a
subway stop at Pennsylvania Station. In another case about a month ago, 
a woman who had undergone a diagnostic heart study was
stopped while trying to drive out of Manhattan through a tunnel.

In both cases, the people involved had been treated with radioactive
materials.
And in both cases, doctors said, they were stopped by law enforcement
officers armed with radiation detectors used to track possible terrorists.

Such reports are flowing into doctors' offices, physicians in the
metropolitan
region and elsewhere say.
