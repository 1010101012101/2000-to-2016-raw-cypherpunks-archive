Yes, I'm one.  AMD all the way.  Anyway, it's cheaper and has better
performance.

Yes, I'm one.  Linux or *BSD.  It's cheaper and better than Windows.
I admit that MS Office is the best office suite around, but I'm doing
ok with Star Office and Koffice.  Konqueror is a better browser than
IE, too.  Adobe products are much more replacable than MS products.
Acroread?  We have xpdf and some others.  PS interpreter?  We have gs.
Photoshop?  We have the gimp.  Illustrator?  We have Kontour.  These
products are all as good as or better than the competing Adobe
products, and they're all free.  They can all be modified in any way I
need.  xpdf and gs can be patched to ignore encryption (although I
guess that's a felony now).  Now, lets see, what did we need Adobe for
again?  I can't think of anything!

I would imagine that Dmitri has the "typical" geeky programmer
personality (ok, making very broad stereotypes here), which tends more
towards playful than vicious... but what if he doesn't?  What if he is
vicious, vengeful and irrational?  Russia is quite a violent place.
Adobe's people in Russia could be in a lot of danger from this.  I
hope not, because violence is bad and the people to blame are probably
a few lawyers and executives and some FBI agents and a lot of
legislators, none of whom are in Russia, but people act irrationally
sometimes.
