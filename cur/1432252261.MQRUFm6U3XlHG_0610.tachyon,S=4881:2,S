But in practice, in real practice out on the streets, this has never 
been where the anti-smoking laws have been invoked. No state in the 
U.S., to my knowledge, bans smoking outside, on public streets.

There may be a few places near public congregation areas, near air 
intakes, etc. There may even be a few isolated cases of towns passing 
"no smoking anywhere on our streets" laws. But, by and large, the 
anti-smoking laws are confined to restaurants, office buildings, 
stores, city offices, and other indoor places.

So the real debate is not about Harmon's extreme example of not liking 
the smell of cigarettes when he walks past a smoker, but the issue of 
anti-smoking laws in the above examples.

And here the issue is about as nearly unambiguous as one can get: it is 
up to the property owner to decide on smoking policies on his property. 
This was as it once was, and it worked very well. Some restaurants 
barred smoking, some permitted it, some set up different sections. 
Likewise, some companies barrred smoking, some permitted it, some set 
up smoking lounges, etc.

(As a nonsmoker, as one who has never taken a single puff on any kind 
of cigarette or cigar or pipe, I thought smoking was incredibly 
wasteful, dirty, and annoying. I used to see engineers and technicians 
going off to take smoking breaks (they would have argued that their 
alertness was then raised by the nicotine hit). Whatever my views, it 
was up to my employer to establish his policies. It was not up to some 
outside party to tell my employer what to allow and what not to allow.)

The Schelling point for such rights was agreed-upon a couple of 
centuries ago with the protection of property rights. My house, my 
rules. Your house, your rules.

Examples like Sarin are not  helpful, as they differ massively from the 
annoyance of smoking.
