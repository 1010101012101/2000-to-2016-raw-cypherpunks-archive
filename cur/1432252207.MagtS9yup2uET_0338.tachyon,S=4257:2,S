NBC Balks at Sharing Election Night Tapes
                          Politics: Congressman threatens to seek
subpoena for disclosure.
                        Rumors say executive pushed for Bush call.

                        By MEGAN GARVEY, Times Staff Writer

                        WASHINGTON -- A showdown between
                        a Democratic congressman and the head of
                        NBC over what exactly happened in the
                        network's newsroom on election night is
                        reviving questions about whether Congress
                        should have any role in overseeing the news
                        media.

                        What began as a friendly offer by NBC
                        President Andrew Lack at a Valentine's Day
                        congressional hearing quickly degenerated
                        into an exchange of angry letters between
                        Lack and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
                        Angeles) over access to internal videotapes
                        of NBC's newsroom on election night.

                        While some observers said they doubted
                        Waxman, who has threatened to seek a
                        subpoena if the tapes aren't turned over by
                        Labor Day, could force NBC to turn over
                        any tapes, they said the dispute highlighted
                        the pitfalls for executives from 1st
                        Amendment-protected industries who
                        voluntarily appear in front of Congress.

                        At issue in Lack's case is sworn testimony at
                        the February hearing into botched election
                        night news coverage. In his testimony, Lack
                        offered to turn over a copy of tapes--if they
                        existed--that showed the newsroom actions
                        of his corporate boss, General Electric
                        Chairman Jack Welch.
