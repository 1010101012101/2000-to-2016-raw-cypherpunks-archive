Where did I write to you that it's horrible thing to lock people up in
Gitmo, or that "we" (whomever that is) deserve to be attacked?  Show me
the email, with headers that says such a thing.

Oh, wait, you can't, because I never wrote such.  


Let's see, so you've got lots of people questioning your version of 
various events, and you've got claims that various people wrote things 
that they did not, and lots of people challenging the accuracy and indeed, 
truth of your statements.

Hmmm... So what is the obvious conclusion there?  The whole world must be
against you?  Nah, you're not important enough to be paranoid.  

So, what is the obvious conclusion?  No, no, 2+2 is not 5, even for
extremely large values of 2...  

Come on, come on, out with it, say it, say it...  That's right!  *Ding*
you're reality challenged.


Ah!  There, doesn't that feel better?  Now, please, go back and take your
meds before the nice men in the white coats come to take you to the funny
farm.
