House Passes Anti-terrorism Legislation
Sensenbenner Urges Senate Action Today
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House today passed anti-terrorism legislation by a 
357-66 margin.  H.R. 3162, introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-Wis.), is expected to be considered by the 
Senate today or tomorrow and then sent to President Bush for his signature.
"Today, the House came together in a bipartisan manner to pass landmark 
anti-terrorism legislation which provides federal law enforcement and 
intelligence agencies the tools they need to combat the scourges of 
international and domestic terrorism.  Our country remains vulnerable to 
terrorism and our President needs this bill to fight the clear and present 
danger posed by Al Queda and other terrorist organizations," said Chairman 
Sensenbrenner.
"I have heard that certain Senators have placed holds on this 
anti-terrorism bill to press their own parochial issues.  This is the time 
to dispense with business as usual.  It is time for leadership; I urge the 
Senate to pass this legislation today."
