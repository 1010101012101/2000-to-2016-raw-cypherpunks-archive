Hmm ... I'm thinking on an empty stomach (no lunch
yet), so I am not quite sure, but my gut feeling (no
pun intended) is that you have a point ...

I can sympathize with that viewpoint, but I assert that
it is just one viewpoint among many legitimate ones.  I
do not believe this was actually written into the law,
but if someone proves conclusively to the courts that
the intent was already in the law, I have no problems
with that.

Um ... actually no.  I assert that the bulk of the
people voted for his wife, because they were assured
that she would take the seat.

If someone else was appointed instead of her, I would
say that there was bait and switch, and no matter how
popular that person might be (perhaps even more popular
than she was in the election), this change would fraud
for sure.

I agree with your statement here except that I did not
make that specific claim of the generic vote for
Democrats.
