Grisham might be better - it's the legal wrangling that would tie up
people's imagination, more than the technical.

Someone needs to inject a story about e-voting fraud into the popular
imagination.
Is Tom Clancy available?  Maybe an anonymous, detailed, plausible,
(but
secretly fictional)
blog describing  how someone did this in their podunk county... then
"leak" this to a news reporter..
Failure to be *able* to assure that this *didn't* happen in that
podunk
county would make
an important point.
