Belief is cowardice

I dont believe in belief

Suggestion: go outside of what you have been told is the capacity of your
identity by the parasitic state and ask questions of how many ways you can

just asking the questions changes conciousness levels

To remain in willful disconnect from questioning self is the state
apparatus inside each
