I tend to just string up lots of characters, so my passphrases look like this:

 ^#.;Odfi9@7f$}'~%42w0,m:Qe_|33+\  and so on.

How do you memorize this?  You break it up in chunks, memorize each chunk, then link them together.  And then you type it in a lot
of times the first few days you use it.  It's not that hard.  If you don't use it on a daily basis, the danger is in forgetting it.

Yep, most people would have a coronary before accepting the above as a passphrase.  Fuck'em.  They deserve the security they're
willing to provide themselves.

Passphrases from books are nice, but if they're all text, they're a hell of a lot easier to brute than the above.  Especially if you
have the texts in electronic form.
