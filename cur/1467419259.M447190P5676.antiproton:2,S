Zenaan, my dear, your country serves Vegemite to children.  It's a pretty
serious crime against humanity and it occurs daily, in all Australian
schools.

It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my
disastrous homemade Sauerkraut.  Am I saying "Hail Australia", Land of
Vegemite and Home of Crocodilo Dundee?  :-)

This crime was horrible, really shocking and sad, but the point is
recognizing publicly the existence of a repulsive crime and never more
permiss that something similar occurs in the whole world, not just
criticizing a country.  Sorry, it doesn't make sense.

I do love my country, but it never will be a blind stupid love.  There are
lots of disgusting crimes here and also in your country, in the USA, in
Russia, in the whole world.  No exceptions.

The USA are not my favorite country, but it was not a regional problem.
Violent crimes happen in every single country of this world, including
Russia.  Please, remember it.

Ah, for your knowledge, I hate all the governments, including Russian.  No
exceptions here too.  As Mirimir, I love Russian people, but it is too much
innocence believing that Russian government is better than North-American
government.  Both are disgusting.
