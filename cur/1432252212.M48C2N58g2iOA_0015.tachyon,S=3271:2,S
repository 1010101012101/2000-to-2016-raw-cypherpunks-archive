I've been on the list for about 12 hours now, and have also recieved three spams, and what appears to be a reply to the group to discuss a spam.  I was expecting spam (as it is an unmoderated list), but was hoping for some actual traffic as well.  I'm certainly going to give it more time, but I'm still wondering where the moderated list went, unless securityfocus.com was mistaken and there was no moderated list.  I know either securityfocus or the majordomo hinted at some moderated list! Oh well.


As for _Cryptonomicon_, it was a great book, and also piqued my interest in the field.  Going to have to give it a re-read soon, I think.  One thing I was wondering, and perhaps the list can help me out here if they also read the book, is how much the events and procedures in the book correlated to methods used by cypherpunks in the real world?  I don't have any specific event from the book in mind, indeed, it's been so long since I read it, I probably couldn't come up with one, just wondering in general.

Thanks
