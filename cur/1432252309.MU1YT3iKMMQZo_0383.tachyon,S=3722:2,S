Believe me, I've looked into it. The absentee ballot thing is, as 
we've discussed, not an issue, as even California doesn't require the 
draconian stuff Declan was mentioning.

As for machine guns, I personally don't care to own one--I appreciate 
the constitutional point, but I don't personally have a compelling 
desire to own one. I'm happy with semi-automatic FALs, HK91s, and 
AR-15s. So far, California has not tried to take mine away. If they 
try, I should have the several months of warning I need to move to 
Nevada or some other nominally free place.

Income tax is a bigger issue. California collects about 9.5% from me, 
currently, but other states tend to make up for lower income tax by 
having higher property taxes and suchlike. Nevada doesn't, because of 
gambling. However, if the gambling business in Vegas and Reno suffers 
the way I expect it to, for various reasons beyond the scope of this 
piece, then I expect the large numbers of "blue collar workers" 
(hotel workers, casino workers, maids, restaurant workers, etc.) to 
vote for taxes on wealth of a kind that will make California look 
like a libertarian paradise.

This is one major reason I'm not moving to Nevada. Another is that 
California basically staked out the claim on the Mediterranean 
climate in America! 1200 miles of coastline that has a classic 
Mediterranean weather and climate pattern: mild and rainy winters, 
sunny and mild the rest of the time.

It would take a _lot_ for me to give this up to live in Montana, or 
Utah, or Texas.
