There were no "Purges" in Vietnam.

If you read ANY account of those alleged purges carefully what you'll
discover is the article title says so, and the first paragraph says so,
then the rest of the information is about the Laotian and Cambodian
purges, which could have only happened with America's assistance in
bringing (this will sound familiar) warlords who were willing to collude
with the US to power in those countries.

Don't drink the koolaid about the Vietnam War, and NEVER believe an
alleged 'pacifist'. They DEPEND on you believing lies like "Vietnam -
Purges" to continue the rationalizations that the US has EVER fought a
'righteous' international war. The pacifist need that belief as well, to
to rationalize what was typically utterly ineffective action, if they
ever really did anything at all, as the slaughter continued unabated for
a decade or more.

The US government is going to spend millions of dollars over the next
decade to reinforce those myths too.
