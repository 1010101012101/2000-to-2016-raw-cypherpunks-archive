Or, at least -someone- faked the data - he made have made an
assumption. Or his site was hacked at one brief point. Or it's
irrelevant in the face of the arrangement he has for the cryptome
server anyway - he might not control the actual/ relevant logs.

Or you really did fake the data. :D

To assume, to assume, makes an ass of u and me.

Good advice. If there's an issue of any sort, it's good that someone
looks into it to the best of their ability. Encouraging individuals to
pursue grievances, or at least perceptions of, is adjectively noun. If
you have nothing substantial, you have to keep going till you do, or
you give up, or you realise people are looking at you strange and
wondering whether you trolled them.

Sure. One can imagine you still have his blessing. You still have
mine, and that's one very expensive very shiny blessing, which you may
continue to use until I say otherwise.

Just as well or your new feather would not be so big and imporessive.

The perfect cover for an artful troll. Did you thank them?

I've seen slides fade, swipe, slide, rotate and pop, but never fxck.

You must be new around here...

You have everyone's blessing. Well, at least JYA's - mine might be
fake gold coat though, so not really expensive, but a blessing
nonetheless.

I'm not totally unfamiliar with getting caught up in insecurity for
insignificance perception causes.

A, penetrating, insight that one.

Of course. Not. Or yes. Or I'm lost in the double negative.

First rule of punk - be the fool, NEVER take it personally. I have and
continue to struggle with that one sometimes, but it's a good lesson
if you can get it on board. Hell of a good lesson. Makes those alien
probes go much smoother.

See Michael, this is simply the best, that moment where you race
around the yard catch the best chicken yank the best feather out and
stick it to the list, or your best hat, and promptly seize this fine
moment as you slowly nod your head, raise a smile and say "yeahhhh ...
I trolled cypherpunks; dude!"

Pretty good effort when all you had was good intention. And now it's
all been fully deconstructed by half a dozen people over a week. Hard
to achieve that in a real bar.

Peace,
Z
