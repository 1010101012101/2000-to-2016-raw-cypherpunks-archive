Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them did have nightmares about the
Constitution. Not as a piece of paper dancing around on Mickey Mouse legs or
whatever the hell you were getting at, but as an idea representing the rule of
law that would lead to them being jailed for murder. Which unfortunately never
happened, but so it goes.

I'm sure anyone who speaks English as a first language didn't find it the least 
bit odd or have any problem at all understanding such a common expression. 
It's an idiom, not a metaphor. Your English is generally excellent, but you
might want to have another look at an online ESL dictionary of idiomatic usage
if you have time. It might make things a little easier for you around here.

The language issue probably explains why you missed my original point as well.
No hard feelings; I'd rather talk about the issues than quibble over this
sort of thing anyday. I'm sure that if I were trying to do this in French
or German instead, I'd be having the same sort of problems myself.

So here's hoping miscommunication doesn't -->stand in the way of<-- getting on
with a perfectly interesting thread. ;)
