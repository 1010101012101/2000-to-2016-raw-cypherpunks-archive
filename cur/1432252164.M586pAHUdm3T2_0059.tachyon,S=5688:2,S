No.Too much competition for that big headed pissant,speaking of which...THE 
BIG HEADED ANT Charles Darwin is a name that¹s synonymous with evolution 
and the theory that evolution is based on the principle of "survival of the 
fittest". Peter Kropotkin¹s fame is much more limited, he¹s known in 
anarchist circles as a significant 19th century anarchist thinker and 
author. Few people even in the anarchist movement realize that he made a 
contribution to the theory of evolution that¹s on a par with Darwin¹s. He 
believed that Darwin¹s central evolutionary tenet was wrong and that 
evolution was based not on competition, but on Co-operation. In enters the 
big headed ant. The big headed ant was introduced to Australia from Africa 
over a hundred years ago. Since its introduction it has slowly displaced 
indigenous ant species and has had a major impact on other insect species 
and animals in the Australia bush. The big headed ant has turned ant to be 
a major threat to indigenous ant species. Green, bull and other Australian 
ant species are normally wiped out when the big headed ant colonies a new 
area. Currently Darwin the capital of the Northern Territory has became the 
new front line in the battle to stop the speed of the big headed ant. The 
big headed ant¹s evolutionary advantage is based on its social behavior. 
Indigenous ant groups display competitive behavior within their subspecies. 
If two colonies share the same resources they compete against each other 
for these resources. The big headed ants behavior is diametrically apposed 
to the behavior of indigenous ants. If two colonies are forced to share the 
same resources they merge and Co-operate and don¹t waste time and effort 
battling each other over who shall use these resources. The big headed ants 
Co-operative behavior gives it the edge it needs to survive and prosper in 
a world that¹s dominated by competitive behavior. The story of the big 
headed ant¹s evolutionary success mirrors the story of human society. 
Although competitive capitalism is currently on the ascending across the 
world, the destructive tendencies of competition hold the seeds of its 
demise. Co-operative forces will always win out against competitive forces. 
Anarchism¹s underlying message is one that promotes Co-operation and 
opposes competition. Anarchism is based on the principles of voluntary 
Co-operation, the very principle that has given the big headed ant into the 
evolutionary advantage it needs to displace its competitive neighbors.
