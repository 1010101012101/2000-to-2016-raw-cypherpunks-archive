I think this is what you call "taxation without representation"

Note also, that the judge in the case was the brother of the supreme
court judge who bush appointed who's totally opposed to these sates
right cases.=20

Great how bush's daughter, the cocaine addict, isn't in jail, but this
man, who was deputized by the city of oakland to grow this marijuana,
is going to be in jail for 20 years. Bush himself was arrested for
DUI, I wish he was rotting in jail instead of ed.=20

disgusting.=20
