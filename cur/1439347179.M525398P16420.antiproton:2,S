	If that's the case, shooting the messenger will solve nothing.
	But that's not even what I said.

	Somebody asked about a particular idea and I commented on it.

	Governments have point-and-click wiretapping capabilies for
	instance. Are you saying that any script kiddy has the
	'passwords'  to those systems?

	Usable/unusable for what? It seems quite obvious that
	'network administrators' can spy on users whereas users can't
	spy on networks administrators. The system is hierarchical by
	nature and design.

	And a rogue system administrator switching sides is not the same
	thing as users having power.

	And before the internet, people read the newspapers.
	Newspapers that 99% of the time worked (and work) for the
	powers that be. 

	I don't think the discussion was about publishing information
	but about surveillance anyway. There may be some overlap but
	it's two different things.

	That's fine and dandy, but getting and publishing some secrets
	doesn't counter the surveillance capabilities of the system. 

	Also, there were (many) people who correctly assumed that the
	'programs' that Snowden leaked information about, were already
	in place.  You know, people who wore tin foil hats...

	But now that the information is 'officialy' public, has the
	nature of the surveillance mechanisms changed? 

	Can we now track the movements of the millions of state
	employees? Listen to their calls? Browse their 'metadata'? Read
	their mails? I don't think so.

	No. I'll see if I get a copy.
