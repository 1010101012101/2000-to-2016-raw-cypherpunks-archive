Ok, if you map hyperlattice to a sphere surrounding Earth (for
other gravity wells, use a hierarchical subnet) derived mostly
from WGS84 position fixes, and otherwise visibility/ToF mutual
triangulation and store only local deviations from idealicity, 
and implement long-distance via VPN over Internet initially,
and use geographic routing where are the scale limits?

I mean, sure, there are a gazillion ways to do it wrong, and
only a couple to do it right. But this doesn't mean the problem
is unsolvable.
