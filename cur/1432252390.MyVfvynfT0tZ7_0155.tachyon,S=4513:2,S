September 2, 2005 -- Who is jamming communications in New Orleans? Ham
radio operators are reporting that communications in and around New
Orleans are being jammed. In addition, perplexed ham radio operators
who were enlisted by the Federal government in 911 are not being used
for hurricane Katrina Federal relief efforts. There is some
misinformation circulating on the web that the jamming is the result of
solar flares. Ham radio operators report that the flares are not the
source of the communications jamming.  If anyone at the National
Security Agency is aware of the source of the jamming, from direction
finding or satellite intelligence, please discretely contact me at
waynemadsendc@hotmail.com (from a private or temporary email account).
In this case, the Bush administration cannot hide behind national
security and it is the duty of every patriotic American to report such
criminal activity to the press. Even though the information on the
jamming may be considered classified -- it is in the public interest to
disclose it. Also, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
reporting that no aircraft over New Orleans have been fired on over New
Orleans or anywhere else in the area. Are the reports of shots being
fired at aircraft an attempt by the Bush administration to purposely
delay the arrival of relief to the city's homeless and dying poor? The
neocons have turned New Orleans into Baghdad on the Mississipppi

Sept. 9, 2005 Forecasters at the <http://www.sec.noaa.gov/>NOAA Space
Environment Center in Boulder, Colo., continue to observe significant
flares on the sun Friday in NOAA sunspot Region 808. This is the same
region that yielded a powerful X-17 flare on Wednesday-R4, severe radio
blackout, on the <http://www.sec.noaa.gov/NOAAscales/>NOAA space weather
scales. NOAA cautions satellite and communications groups are already
experiencing problems due to this activity. Other agencies impacted by
space weather are at increasing risk for service disruptions. This includes
other space activities, electric power systems, high frequency
communications and navigation systems such as global positioning systems.
