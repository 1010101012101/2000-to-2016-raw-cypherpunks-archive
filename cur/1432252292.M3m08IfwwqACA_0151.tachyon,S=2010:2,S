For some reason I don't understand, people actually drive to queue up
and vote
in a booth on a given day.  So that was the model addressed.

Personally I vote absentee, so I have plenty of time
to photoshop what I fax to Vinny.  As well as being able to submit a new

blank ballot if Vinny demands to see the original I faxed (but before
its mailed in -that
is my commit point, just like "opening the curtain" used to be on
mechanical
voting machines).
