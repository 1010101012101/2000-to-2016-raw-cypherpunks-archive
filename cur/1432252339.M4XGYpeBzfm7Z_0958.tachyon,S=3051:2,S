Hey kids,

Dmitry and his lawyer got his now-infamous Defcon presentation exposing
Adobe's pathetic attempts at eBook security read into his pre-trial
agreement.

The agreement, available from Ashcroft Central in PDF format, can be
downloaded at:

http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/assets/applets/2001_12_13_sklyarov.pdf

Somehow, I think that as soon as his plane clears US air space the only
words of assistance the US Attorney is going to from him will consist of
'bite' and 'me'.
