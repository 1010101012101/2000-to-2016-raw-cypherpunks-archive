THE WALLSTREET UNIVERSE REPORT - NOVEMBER 10, 2001
Next Holiday - Thanksgiving:  Turkey, Football and Relatives!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>



Hello All  Investors,

On Sunday night we will be sending out a new stock profile.  Our
last few profiles have performed with increased volume and nice
gains!!!  We look for this new stock to have an explosive next
week.  Keep your eyes open and Have a Great Weekend!!!



+>+>+>  AND COMMING UP...  Next week will be moderately busy in
terms of economic reports.  On Wednesday  we’ll get the October
Retail Sales report, which is most likely to show growth over the
month of September thanks to record-setting auto sales as well as
to discount shopping.  Also a number of readings on the
manufacturing industry will be issued including the Philadelphia
Fed survey, Business Inventories and  Industrial Production. 
Those reports for the most part are not expected to reveal
anything encouraging.  Finally, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is
due out next Friday, and like today’s PPI numbers it is expected
to indicate that inflation remains under control.  

Although the corporate earnings season was over in October, a
bulk of key tech companies will report their results next week. 
Among them are Dell Computer, Hewlett Packard &  Applied
Materials.   Besides earnings and economic reports, developments
on the Afghanistan front will undoubtedly remain on everyone’s
radar screen and any further military progress over the weekend
could be an important catalyst for this market.
