I don't think they're as heterogeneous as all that and some, perhaps a
large number. will be 'left behind' or absorbed into other societies.
The Baathists they were ALLEGEDLY collaborating with, miraculously
stripped of any socialist tendencies by US/Iraqi execution and 'other
means', will eventually re-insert itself in the Iraqi government without

(again) the political tendencies the US would like to see in a
submissive-to-the-West Iraq.
