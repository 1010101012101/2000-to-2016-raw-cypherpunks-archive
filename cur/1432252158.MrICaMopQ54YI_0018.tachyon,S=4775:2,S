	Generally speaking, a militant organization, be it the Marine 
Corps or the Aryan Nation does not put it's best and brightest on 
security details. They realize that yes, sometimes you *do* need to 
have that bunker charged, or that hill taken, and you need people who 
are bright enough to do that, and dumb enough not to think about it.

	In some cases putting yourself in front of the bullet, or 
charging the machine gun nest *is* the best thing to do for your 
cause.


	I'm not saying that only stupid people join these kinds of 
groups, but that of the people who join these groups, the stupid ones 
will wind up in the "bullet stopper" positions.

	The AN doesn't have the majority of the mainstream media 
hanging on it's every word, like the Democrats (and to a lesser 
extent the Republicans) do. They don't pretend to be fair and honest, 
and then bleed you to death with a thousand little cuts 
(metaphorically speaking). They are pretty much nasty creatures, but 
in a way honest. If they don't like you, they make it very plain they 
don't like you.

	The AN is no more and no less intolerant than most other 
political parties. The scope of what they tolerate is smaller, but 
they are no more vicious and nasty to those outside their lines than 
most other groups.
