I didn't miss any point. I simply rebutted a one-sided statement.

I'm a 'democratist' I believe the ONLY way a society will ever survive is
to develop a sense of 'acceptance' and 'tolerance' for alternate views. I
also, in contrast to crypto-anarchist and libertarians, don't believe
'money' or 'wealth' has a damn thing to do with that.

It's an interesting observation about many cypherpunks that they want open
technology in every venue EXCEPT legal and medical. Directly contrary to
'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' and most especially contrary
to 'equal protection under the law' or the basic goal of civilization and
law - self-defence.

Too many people want to use it to coerce, Libertarians being no exception.

If that, in your or Declans view, makes me a 'non-cypherpunk' then the
failing is not mine but rather yours.
