Can someone clarify the definition, in this context, of "smuggling" ?  
Does this mean that $10,000 in cash can no longer be taken out of the
country, or does it mean that it can no longer be taken out of the country
in a secretive manner ?

For as long as I have been traveling internationally, I have been required
to declare all cash amounts larger than $10,000.  Does this mean that
previously it was not a crime to not make such a declaration, and now it
is ?
