Not what I said, though that is one possible way of 
implementing the proposal.

Another possible way is that the client program hashes 
the password in one fashion, known to everyone, and in a 
different way, known to everyone, gives the second hash 
to the server, which then hashes that in a secret way, 
and the client program then constructs the secret key 
from both numbers.

Of course, if the user clicks on the menacing "Advanced 
custom cryptographic key management" he can construct 
the key in some other fashion.

Re-read:

"That server then ... emails a certificate asserting 
that holder of that key can be reached at that email 
address."
