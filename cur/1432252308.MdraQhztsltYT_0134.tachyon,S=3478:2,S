I wonder if the GenXers (and younger) will be taking out their nose 
rings, tongue studs, and other bits of metal stuck through their bodies, 
primitive-style. (And not just so they can pass through metal 
detectors...)

I wonder if the white suburban kids wearing gangsta baggies down to 
their ankles and listening to gangsta rap and pretending like they're 
inner city negroes will drop these pretensions...

Naw, never happen. People will cheer when the U.S. sends cruise missiles 
to kill Afghan women and children, then they'll go back to nose 
piercings and gangsta rap.

And when the militarized smallpox from Biopreparat hits....
