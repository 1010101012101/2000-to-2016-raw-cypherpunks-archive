Ross Anderson charged that Microsoft "censored" Newsweek because the
Stephen Levy article disappeared.  Actually Newsweek moves articles to
their for-pay archives after a week.  You can still find a pointer to
it by going to www.newsweek.com and entering Palladium in the "Search
the archives" box.

Will Ross Anderson withdraw his charge that this was an act of censorship
by Microsoft?
