Cypherpunks,

I sent this out this morning. I left the huge "To:" list intact, even 
though many/most are censorioius, closed lists. I knew I would get a 
bunch of bounces, saying I was not authorized to post to their elite 
list.

What I didn't check was whether the _real_ list, Cypherpunks, was on 
the distribution list. It wasn't.

The fuckheads out there who blather about being "coderpunks" and 
"cryptorights" warriors are not even posting to Cypherpunks.

And yet they claim, falsely, to organizing the "first cypherpunks 
physical meeting in Europe."

I guess what Churchill said is right: "The Hun is either at your 
throat or at your feet."
