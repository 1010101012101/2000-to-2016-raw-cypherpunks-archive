			 Call for Participation
			    HOPE Number Six

			    July 21-23 2006
			 The Hotel Pennsylvania
			     New York City


HOPE Number Six (www.hopenumbersix.net) is this summer's hacker
conference sponsored by 2600 Magazine.  Presenters and artists from all
nationalities and disciplines are again invited to participate in this
forum.  HOPE Number Six covers all aspects of hacking, the community
surrounding it, and its effects across the world.

For three days, The Hotel Pennsylvania will be the nexus of discussion,
planning, and activity for hacker ideas, opportunities, and
understanding.


There are several ways to participate:

   * Speak: Presentation ideas should be submitted with a synopsis of
the topic along with presenter bio, and will be chosen by relevance and 
peer review.  Panels, talks, tutorials, debates, or other types of
presentations are all welcome.  Most presentations will be 55 minutes.

   * Interact: Demonstrations of new and interesting technologies or
system elements as well as artistic exhibits are welcome.  We have
20,000 square feet of presentation space to fill, so projects of all
sizes will be considered.  Robots, Segways, Legos, RFID, digital
graffiti -- submit your creative ideas!

   * Display: All sorts of presentations, demos, workshops, classes, 
posters, and other ways of sharing information are encouraged.  Space and 
time will be provided to accommodate proposals.

   * Sell: Space is also available for vendors.  Prospects should describe
their group and the items they are selling.  Vendors are chosen by
relevance to the conference topic and organization size.
