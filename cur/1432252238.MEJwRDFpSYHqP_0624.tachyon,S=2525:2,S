Unfortunately, this appears to be the case.  

All of the presently-operational nodes of which I'm aware (pro-ns,
algebra, minder, and al-qaeda) still communicate, so any traffic to
other nodes does get through to al-qaeda.net subscribers.  The traffic
just isn't there any more.

That said, please don't refrain from talking just because it seems
like fewer are listening now.  A little controversy goes a long way in
generating interesting (or at least non-noise) traffic.
