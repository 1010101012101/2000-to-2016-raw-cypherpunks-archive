Why?  Neither U-235 nor Pu-239 is particularly radioactive.  Vitrified
plutonium disks have been used as poker chips by workers in fuel
fabrication facilities.  Most of these materials are only dangerous when
ingested, radiating your tissues with alpha particles directly. They also
have very low rates of spontaneous fission, so neutrons aren't generally a
big deal.

As long as you stay clear of criticality, you aren't going to get radiated
at all.

My bullshit detector is starting to go off.

Well, that depends on your moderator, doesn't it?  The "bare sphere"
critical mass of U-235 is over 50 kilograms, if you don't mix it with a
moderator, or surround it with a neutron reflector.  Fast neutron fission
cross-sections aren't particularly large.  Plutonium is somewhat better,
but you'll need at least 11 kilograms, even with a nice tamper to bounce
the neutrons back.

A sub-critical mass won't do squat.  A criticality accident will kill you,
and require a hazmat crew to clean up your lab, but it won't blow anything
up.  Generally, what you make critical will just melt and splatter into a
non-critical shape, if no effort is made to confine it.

This is silly.  Nuclear weapons can be made to work by compressing a solid
sphere to double density with explosives, or by removing an "apple core"
third of a supercritical sphere, and shooting it back in with a gun.  The
hollow sphere myth remains pervasive because scientists had the idea of
imploding a hollow sphere with explosives when the Manhattan project
begun, and because the government has been less than forthcoming with what
methods actually turned out to work.

While a generous hollow sphere with a small void might work, something
made by beating nuclear material into a salad bowl certainly wouldn't,
even if you managed to time the explosives perfectly.

I suggest you look uranium up in your materials handbook before you start
whacking it into your salad bowl.  Pure uranium is only slightly softer
than steel, and with a little molybdenum added, is harder than the finest
tool steel.  Malleable means the material doesn't break when you work
it.  It is not a measure of how much force is required to work it.  Gold
is soft.  Uranium isn't.

Did Jack Lemmon write this laughable tract back during his "China

I think you need to look up "velocity of detonation" as it pertains to gun
powder.

U-235 radiation?  This person would flunk even the elementary school
course in nuclear engineering.  Clad unirradiated nuclear fuel can be
safely handled without protective clothing, and isn't particularly
radioactive.

Well, anyone with a few minor mechanical engineering clues, a calculator,
and the ability to calculate fission cross-sections.

Dying isn't required, unless you stand near the bomb when it goes off.
