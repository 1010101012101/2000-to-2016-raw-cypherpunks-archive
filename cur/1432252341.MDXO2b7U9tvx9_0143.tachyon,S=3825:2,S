Yes. Except the military absentee ballot category, under federal law,
include U.S. citizens living abroad permanent-wise. I posted the
language over the weekend.

Here it is again:

http://www.military.com/Content/MoreContent1/?file=vote_uocava
(5) "overseas voter" means --

(A) an absent uniformed services voter who, by reason of active duty
or service is absent from the United States on the date of the
election involved;

(B) a person who resides outside the United States and is qualified to
vote in the last place in which the person was domiciled before
leaving the United States; or

(C) a person who resides outside the United States and (but for such
residence) would be qualified to vote in the last place in which the
person was domiciled before leaving the United States.
