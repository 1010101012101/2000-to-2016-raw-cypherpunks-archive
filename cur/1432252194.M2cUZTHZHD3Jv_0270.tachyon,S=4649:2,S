The below is typically muddled.

Netiquette says one should not send one message to someone privately
and *the identical text* to the list in a different message. It
leaves the recipient unsure about whether the thought was a private
communication or not. This is what Jim has done twice this week.

It is, however, perfectly acceptable to do a reply-to-all when engaging
in list conversations (provided that the CC line is not too long, etc.),
and that is what I have done and am doing.
