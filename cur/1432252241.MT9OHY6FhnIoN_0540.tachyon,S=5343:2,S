Somehow I doubt telling somebody to stuff gun powder into a pipe, and
carefully wipe the ends this would be interpreted as any sort of aid in
and of itself.

Hell, Dover prints a book called "Chemical Magic" for $5 that'll provide
all you need to get started.

Not to mention that if one wanted they can mosey on down to the local
bookstore and order "Bombs and Bombings: A Handbook to Detection,
Disposal, and Investigation for Police and Fire Depts. (2nd Ed)" by Thomas
G. Brodie (ISBN 0-398-06551-9 (hrdbk), 0-398-06552-7 (ppbk)) you could
have the fine co-defendent of the FBI to stand trial right beside you (it 
was used as the training manual at one time).

Or you could just go down to your local movie outlet and buy "Fight Club"
where they describe how to make Nitro and Dynamite from basic soap. Then
you could have the appropriate movie studio, producer, and (hell, go for
broke) Brad Pitt to stand right along side of yourself.

When the IRS came in and asked me about the instructions I sent to the
list the issue was had I ever actually discussed it with CJ (off the
list) as he was carrying a copy of my posting when he was arrested (or so 
I and my lawyer was told). Since that never happened there wasn't shit
that could be done about it.

My suggestion, use a lawyer with more savy than Mr. Boone.
