They do. And I'm not so sure POTS is going to be where things will be the 
most interesting...cable modem telephony might be where things get 
interesting.

As for the Telcos allowing a call to be terminated on their copper, they'll 
never let this happen without going through the 5ESS, and recent legislation 
means they probablyt won't have to let you use some higher frequency band 
either.

I've heard of some P2P startups that leverage the discovery mechanisms in 
P2P networks in order to setup a SIP session for telephony. It's interesting 
to consider the possibility that, depending on the P2P system, it's 
conceivable that one could call another user without having any way to 
"trace" that call, or payment for that matter. So if bin Laden were feelin' 
lonely one day and signed onto the network, you could give him a call, 
without him worrying about the missles falling within a few minutes.
