Again, this is only a very small part of the problem. The Inspector General's 
office reports that the average identity fraud in the Social Security 
Administration costs over $100,000. Texas Medicaid loses approximately 25% of 
its $4 billion budget to fraud. The ABA reports that the average cost of each 
credit card fraud for the issuer exceeds $3500. Each incident of identity 
fraud in recruiting costs DOD over $500,000.
