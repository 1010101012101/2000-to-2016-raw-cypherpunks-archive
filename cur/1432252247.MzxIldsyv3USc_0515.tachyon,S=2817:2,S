Yep.  I've often thought that one benefit to playing RPGs when I was 
younger was directly observing lots and lots of rolls of various kinds of 
dice.  That gives you an intuition for how unlikely things can happen 
sometimes, for the difference between "very unlikely" and "impossible," etc.

In fact, I believe this is the trick that makes it very easy to distinguish 
between sequences of coin flips that really happen, and ones that are made 
up by a human.  The human tends to try to make things even out over time.
