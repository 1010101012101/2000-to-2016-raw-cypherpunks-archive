Steve,

Take a look at :

http://www.cdrecordingsoftware.com/acer4406eu.html

Seems like there are quite a few products that are built this way. Maybe
people have come to expect expect bugs in released SW and are willing to
take the price hit for FLASH. In any event I think it's something that
can be done and has value for the privacy aware. Actually getting it
done is an entirely separate issue. As is the issue of the effort
required to support mutliple brands and models. Damn it.

Mike
