I suppose this has also been discussed, but if anyone has a favorite
compelling argument I'd be interested in seeing it.

Several Web archives include signatures.  Checking, e.g.:, debian-user,
I found I couldn't validate my own posts.  However, archives in mbox
format with full text of mail as received should work.

I can think of several compelling arguments for supporting signed list
messages, should the sender wish to sign.
