James, you are simply full of shit. I don't believe you're incapable of
seeing the difference between calling Saddam a crippled tyrant and
"support[ing] Saddam". I do believe you're willfully attempting to twist
other people's words, and not even doing a good job of it. "A equals A" 
reasoning is for high school. If you look at the words I typed, instead
of your fantasy-land model of reality, you might notice that you're
making a fool of yourself.

I have no idea what you've said in other forums. I merely pointed
out what you have said here.

There is ample evidence that you fail to argue about what people have 
_actually said_, impute motive and behaviour where there is none, 
and point to a grand Ellsworth Toohey-ish conspiracy that needs to be 
fought, improbably enough, by a nation-state.

As I said, you're being boring. I suppose someone had to step up to the
task of being the resident Choate.

I have some cooking to do. Happy holidays, all!
