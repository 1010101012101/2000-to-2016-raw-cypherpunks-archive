First I've heard that. Frankly, I'm suprised. 

One solution, which I've long advocated, is for the remailer to drop mail
which has an unencrypted body after it's applied it's decryption key. 

Provided this is an announced policy, substantially increases the 
protection of the mail and the remop. It does mean that only people
capable of using encryption can receive mail via the remailer, but
that's probably a *good* thing.
