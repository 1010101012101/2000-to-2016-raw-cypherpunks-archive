	Not necessarily. It is argued both that Libertarians are 
chicken-shit anarchists (afraid to take the last step)  or that 
Anarchists are just extreme Libertarians.

	Also, keep in mind that there are many "anarchist" philosophies, in 
fact almost as many as there are anarchists, and all of them (well most 
of them) have rules or laws.

> 2. redundant ('capitalist' and libertarian)

	No. Libertarians are for "free markets", which are inherently 
capitalistic in nature, but the reverse is not true.  There are many 
*wealthy* capitalists who are all for strongly regulated markets and 
high barriers to entry. One could argue that they are not Capitalists.

	The "Crypto-" part of "Crypto-Anarchist" may in fact have nothing 
at all to do with cryptography.

	Not by much. It's almost always between 48 and 51 MPG.
