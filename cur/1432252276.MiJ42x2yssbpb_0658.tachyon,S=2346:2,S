Indeed, there is a group of GeigerCounterEnthusiasts on Yahoo whose
members
have/make this kind of thing.  You use scintillation plastic &
photomultiplier tubes;
you can get these on eBay.

Sometimes they mount their detectors in cars and find that some sections

of roads are hotter than background, or a hot railroad car.

Also the principle behind PET scans.  Mr. positron meets Ms. electron,
and bang, two little Gammas carry the momentum away...

GM tubes use avalanche to amplify; the scintillators, NaI, semiconductor

junctions measure analogue energy, so you get an energy spectrum.
Add a few comparators and a logic gate and you get a channel.
