Osama,

 From the excerpts published in the Times, it looks like you plagiarized 
major sections of the U.S. Army manuals, e.g., the famed Improvised 
Munitions Handbook and various explosives manuals. You even copied the 
CD-ROM distribution system!

Now if you set up a "College of the Arabian Lands" patterned after our 
own College of the Americas school, and you copy the curriculum of 
teaching methods for assassination, execution of villages, mining of 
harbors, and using shaped charges to collapse suspension bridges, then I 
plan to report you to the RIAA!
