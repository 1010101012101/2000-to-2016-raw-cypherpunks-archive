You're confusing hype with the real thing. Show me a 64 qubit register
in solid state at ~room temperature, and then we'll talk about how that
is relevant to elliptical curve crypto.

Of course NSA is pimping ECC, so they might have
their own reasons.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography

Key sizes

Since all the fastest known algorithms that allow to solve the ECDLP
(baby-step giant-step, Pollard's rho, etc.), need O(\sqrt{n}) steps, it
follows that the size of the underlying field shall be roughly twice the
security parameter. For example, for 128-bit security one needs a curve over
\mathbb{F}_q, where q \approx 2^{256}. This can be contrasted with
finite-field cryptography (e.g., DSA) which requires[11] 3072-bit public keys
and 256-bit private keys, and integer factorization cryptography (e.g., RSA)
which requires 3072-bit public and private keys. The hardest ECC scheme
(publicly) broken to date has 109-bit key (that is about 55 bits of security),
it was broken near the beginning of 2003 using over 10,000 Pentium class PCs
running continuously for over 540 days (see [12]).
