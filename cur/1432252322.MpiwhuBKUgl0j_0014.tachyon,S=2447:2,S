All you get access to as a library card holder is a Web browser (or
pathetic excuse for same, as I think it's a hacked-up IE).

The computers at the Houston libraries don't allow access to the USB
ports from what I have seen, and in order to get access to anything
besides a Web browser you would probably need to reboot the machine and
you then have maybe 15-20 minutes before a librarian notices you. Now,
the Harris County libraries might be different; I have not gone to one.
