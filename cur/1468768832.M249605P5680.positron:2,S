Being kind, you might say they put a good face on it. Being more
realistic, they try and mostly succeed in slipping it through with the
nastier parts unnoticed.

That's what they did with RIPA, the previous act.

Oh, and afaict there are no contradictions anywhere in what I have said.

If you think I trust any of them, you are sadly mistaken.

The Lords however are slightly better than the Home Office, who write
the bills and tell their patsies in the Lords and Commons what to say
the bills mean - which is frequently quite different to what they
actually mean.

However I am expert - repeat expert - in reading the actual damn Bills,
and working out what they actually say.

Better than the members of the Lords or Commons, better than the
politicians who tell the Home Office cunts what to put in the Bills,
better than the DPPs who apply them - most of whom don't read the actual
Bills, just summaries, because the Bills are so complicated - and I am
approaching as good as the people who write the damn things.



If I don't go through all the details here it's just because the bills
are so obscure and complex it would take megabytes and days of arguments.

Then you would have to know the general legal framework behind the
wording of a Bill, and the general legal framework of the UK, before
knowing what it meant. And even then you might occasionally be surprised
by a decision, some Judges just make stuff up as they go along, and not
everything which should be appealed is.

But you are welcome to read it yourself, it is available at:

www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2016-2017/0040/17040.pdf

Enjoy!
