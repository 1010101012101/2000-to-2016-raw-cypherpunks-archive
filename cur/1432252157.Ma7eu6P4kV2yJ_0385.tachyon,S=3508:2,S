I have never had a background check until after I was hired at my current job.  After I had been hired for a long time, suddenly they did background checks on everyone, though surely by then they knew everyone well enough to know that none of us were likely to run amuk and start shooting 
coworkers.

Suddenly background checks are in.  I do not know why.  Guess I should ask.
