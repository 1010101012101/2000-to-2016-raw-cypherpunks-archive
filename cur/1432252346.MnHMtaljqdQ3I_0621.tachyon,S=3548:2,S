No-one ever got fired for buying Verisign.  Unfortunately in order to
understand that buying your certs from anything but the cheapest CA present is
a waste of money, you need a certain amount of understanding of how PKI (or at
least certificate manufacturing, as currently practiced) works.  Verisign have
invested an enormous amount of time and money into communicating the message
that it ain't secure if it doesn't say Verisign, and that's been very
effective.  I have, very occasionally, run into people who've told me how they
managed to locate a CA that sold them their certs for $29.95/year instead of
$495/year, but this is very much the exception to the rule.

Peter.
