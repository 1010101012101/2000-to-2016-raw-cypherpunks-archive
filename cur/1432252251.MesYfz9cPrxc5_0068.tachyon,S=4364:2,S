About 95 EUR in Australia for the Huawei IDEOS (network locked, but
that doesn't matter for mesh networking) which ServalProject.org is
already using as a mesh telephony platform.
We also have PV panels that we can use with them.  The trick at the
moment is that if the phone goes flat, it won't turn back on by
itself; but I am sure some clever person can find a solution to that
problem.

This is particularly valuable if you wish to avoid purposeful
interference which is trying to take your mesh down.

Personally I think that plug computers, mobile phones and more
"ordinary" wifi devices like the VillageTelco.org Mesh Potato together
provide diversity and specialisation to various tasks and
appplications; no one solves all problems.  This is why I am
passionate that ServalProject.org phone software and VillageTelco.org
Mesh Potatoes be interoperable (which they are), and I hope, also that
they will interoperate with what this community generates.  This also
distributes the maintenance and leadership of these platforms further
removing single points of failure.

Paul.
