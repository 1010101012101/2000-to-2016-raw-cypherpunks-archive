Utah is Southern?  I do not want directions from you. :-)

And as an aside why is Southern=Stupid.  Most of the truly dense people
I have met in my life are self-righteous Yankees.  

Southerners, by and large, will say "Idda know" instead of spout
foolishness.

A Southern senator.  Need I say more?

Trivial to do, and legal, if they are advised and consent by clicking
through.
M$'s auto bug- / RAMsnooping- reporting is legal since the lUsers
agreed.
One man's trojan is another's remote control / file sharing program,
baby.
Similarly an encryption program that won't decrypt without a license.

I have often considered releasing binaries with a EULA that stipulates
various actions taken if found to be running on machines whose IP
address
reverse-lookups to an evil, (specified) TLD.  No different than a demo
program that won't save results without a license; if the license is
granted
automatically for non-evil TLDs.  Similarly with M$'s auto posting of
RAM.

Of course, that astronomy Professor Usher would be pretty bummed when
his research was toasted by an RIAA killbot, but then the Prof employs a

provocatory surname, no?  "Collateral damage" -hey, he could change his
name, after all.  Maybe to David Nelson :-)
