"On Tuesday July 30, 9 members of the RCMP, Canada's national police 
agency, led by Cpl. Derrick Ross of the Integrated National Security 
Enforcement Team (see sidebar article, "Insidious INSET" below), executed a 
Search Warrant and raided my home and office in Courtenay, British 
Columbia. The search and seizure was carried out on behalf of law 
enforcement from two counties in the State of Maine, under the auspices of 
the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty."
