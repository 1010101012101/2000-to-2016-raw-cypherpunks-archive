&gt; Subject: Ripple&#39;s consensus algorithm.<br>
&gt; Message-ID: &lt;<a href=3D"mailto:53E7F54C.80805@echeque.com">53E7F54C=
.80805@echeque.com</a>&gt;<br>
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3DUTF-8; format=3Dflowed<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Bitcoin&#39;s consensus algorithm is weight of computing power, which =
is OK<br>
&gt; as long as weight of computing power aligns with interest in bitcoin<b=
r>
&gt; being a useful currency.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Weight of stake would be better, but so far I am unaware of any<br>
&gt; satisfactory proposals for weight of stake.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
This is called &quot;proof of stake&quot; not weight of stake and is differ=
ent from<br>
Ripple&#39;s consensus process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Ripples consensus algorithm is weight of club members, and the process=
<br>
&gt; for getting into the club is opaque, as are the interests and incentiv=
es<br>
&gt; of the existing club members.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
This doesn&#39;t really describe how Ripple works. Ripple relies on the<br>
agreement of 80% or more of validator nodes per gateway to verify if a<br>
transaction took place or not. I write more about this in<br>
<a href=3D"http://rippleinvestmentguide.com/" target=3D"_blank">http://ripp=
leinvestmentguide.com/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would suppose one gets into the club if no existing member blackball=
s<br>
&gt; you, which would be fine if there is already sufficient diversity of<b=
r>
&gt; interests within the club.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Only if 80% of the networks validator nodes do that which is in practice<br=
>
not likely to happen on a large enough scale.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It is not obvious to me how well the ripple consensus algorithm would<=
br>
&gt; work in the event of substantial conflicts between club members, or ba=
d<br>
&gt; behavior by club members, or bad things happening to the network.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Has it been analyzed for performance in the event of bad behavior by<b=
r>
&gt; some club members?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll ping David Schwartz one of the co-inventors about this question.<b=
r>

It includes many types of sanctions, but most interesting is that ones:<br>
<br>
9) the prohibition or restriction of the retransmission of television<br>
and radio channels;<br>
10) the prohibition to use radio frequency resource of Ukraine;<br>
11) the restriction or termination of the media or other information<br>
activities, including those in the Internet;<br>
12) the restriction or prohibition of production or distribution of<br>
printed materials and other information materials;<br>
24) the prohibition of political parties, movements and other civil<br>
society associations and foundations;<br>
<br>
So if that bill will be passed, National Security and Defense Council<br>
can ban any foreign media, website, foundation, movement, printed<br>
material, etc. without court.<br>
