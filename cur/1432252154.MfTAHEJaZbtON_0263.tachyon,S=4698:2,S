Subject: Peer to Peer Services

Dear all:

It is time to get coordinated and aggressive with the new round of peer
to peer services. The amount of music being downloaded is, as you know,
reaching unprecedented levels. Since college started last week Morpheus
traffic was up to 19 million downloads per day. AND THAT'S JUST
MORPHEUS. With the imminent launch of legitimate subscription services
we have to get our customers back. 

I know you want your new businesses to be successful. So do I. Given the
overwhelming volume of these alternative services, RIAA can't handle all
of the enforcement alone. If they are not controlled more effectively
and consumers redirected to legitimate offerings, there won't be new
businesses. That's obvious. 

You are all competitors, but you have common interests in enforcement.
Help me help you. I'd like to have a meeting at the RIAA in October as
soon as possible. If you agree to participate, I will have my assistant
try and work with schedules to get a date that works. 

I want to keep the meeting small to start (we can expand participation
to other companies later). 

We need to discuss: 

1. Spoofing and/or interdiction methods for existing peer to peers -
(perhaps by adding promotional messages about the launch of various new
systems) 

2. A PR campaign

3. We will share the latest legal strategies and RIAA's thinking on
options 

Please plan on attending. I am cautious about sending alternates because
we need people who have the ability to make decisions and commit to
spending. 

Best regards, 

Hilary
