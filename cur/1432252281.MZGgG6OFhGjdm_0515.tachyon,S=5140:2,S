Regarding Tim May, Tyler Durden, and Anonymous's stupid
thread, Robert, why are you reposting this shit?  This is supposed
to be a "Digital Bearer Settlement List <dbs@philodox.com>".

Is killing blacks, or racism, a commonly held belief or practice,
in the digital settlement industry?  Is this somehow, like,
business enhancing for you, in IBUC?

For that matter, is there any conceptual association between
killing people, and payments with digital currencies?

What's your point, in mirroring the worst of the crypto lists?
There's plenty of good stuff there... are you doing this to
be cool?  For the shock value or something?

What are you doin?  Just entertaining yourself?
Whiling away the years?

I thought you had some goals, or purpose, in what you're
doing.

Todd
