This is something to watch. Many first-time offenders in the War on 
Some Drugs get rehab time...but she's been in rehab some number of 
times.

If she were a street kid, she'd be facing X years in prison.

But she's not. She's part of the First Extended Family. On the other 
hand, she's half-Mexican, so that may cancel out her FEF status.

If there's justice, she'll face exactly the same 5 years in prison that 
civilians face.

But there isn't, and she won't.
