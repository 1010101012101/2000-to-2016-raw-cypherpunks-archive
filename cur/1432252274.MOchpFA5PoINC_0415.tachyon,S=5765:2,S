yes quatloos, injustices occur every day.

answer this, what class of citizens existed before the 14th amendment?
was every congressman and every president that served prior to the 14th
amendment frauds? NO .
Before the 14th Amendment "citizen of the United States" did NOT exist.

Again, were every congressman and every president that served prior to the
14th
amendment frauds?

California Couple Sentenced for Helping Clients Evade Taxes

February 23, 2001

By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

A California couple who helped their clients evade at least $13.8
million in federal income taxes were sentenced to long prison terms
yesterday, sentences the judge extended after they said that the
tax laws were invalid and did not apply to them.

 The couple, Dorothy and George Henderson of Roseville, Calif.,
sold trusts through which, customers were told, they could put
their money beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. The
couple kept 5 percent of the deposits.

 Mrs. Henderson, 56, was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison
and Mr. Henderson, 59, was sentenced to six and a half years by
Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. of United States District Court in
Sacramento.

 The Hendersons did not testify at their trials, but at a
sentencing hearing yesterday they told Judge Burrell that the
I.R.S. had no authority over them and that they would pursue claims
against the government.

 They also said they were exempt from tax under Section 861 of the
Internal Revenue Code, contending that the statute excludes most
Americans from income taxes.

 Donald Dorfman, Mrs. Henderson's lawyer, said that he tried to
show his client that she had misread the law and that rather than
exempting anyone from taxes it extended the reach of American tax
law to income from foreign sources.

 "She wouldn't listen," Mr. Dorfman said. "She insisted on speaking
and telling the judge about the 861 position and how as a sovereign
citizen of California the federal courts had no jurisdiction and
all sorts of gibberish."

 Mr. Dorfman said the speech caused the judge to add five months to
Mrs. Henderson's sentence beyond prosecutors' request.

 The judge gave Mr. Henderson an extra eight months.

 The 861
position is being advocated by a small but growing number of
business owners and others who, calling themselves the tax honesty
movement, say that the government operates the I.R.S. illegally.
These business owners have boasted in ads in USA Today and on the
Internet that they do not pay taxes and say the I.R.S. has not
acted against them. They cite that as proof that the tax laws are a
hoax.

 The case against the Hendersons began several years ago and grew
out of another case in which four other Californians, including a
lawyer, were convicted and are now in prison.
