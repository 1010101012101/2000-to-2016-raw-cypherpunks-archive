Wonder how many of the Danish 3863 censored URLs posted 
by Wikileaks are FBI stings:


http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Denmark:_3863_sites_on_censorship_list%2C_Feb
_2008

And how many of those not originated by the Feds have been expropriated 
for entrapment. Know of anybody who clicked the URLs and got a visit? 
Or due for a raid as the IP harvest is processed.
