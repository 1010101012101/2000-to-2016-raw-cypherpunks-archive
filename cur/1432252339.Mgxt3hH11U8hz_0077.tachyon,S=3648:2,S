Commercial VHS tapes have had trailers (and occasionally ads) at the start
for several years, but they can be zapped with FF.

Over 20-30 DVDs I've seen none *forced* you to watch the
trailers - they have always been part of the 'extra features' stuff off
the main menu.

OTOH, they all *do* force you to sit through the FBI and Interpol
warnings for about 15 seconds.

BTW: my VCR has a feature that allows it to automatically
FF through ads. It works about 90% of the time, and is a very nice
thing to have.
