HUMINT FOR DUMMIES
Chapter 1.......Elicitation Tactics
====================================
Rule #1: NEVER ASK A DIRECT QUESTION.
A direct question is so close to the information you are trying to elicit,
that asking it arouses suspicion.

So, that rules out everybody but Sheriff Podunk, (uhm, and me).

I've been fascinated by these discreditation posts since I got here. I have
trouble attributing it to bona-fide law enforcement or other legitimized
interests, because it's bad enough to look like somebody is blowing smoke
and that this is provided for my amusement. Could the appropriate cointel
personnel, historian, and/or sympathetic parties clue me in, please?
