SF Bay Area Cypherpunks August 2001 Physical Meeting Announcement

General Info
DATE:   Saturday 11 August 2001
TIME:   1:00 - 5:00 PM (Pacific Time)
PLACE:  Tressider Student Union Courtyard,
         Stanford University Campus
         Palo Alto, California, USA
<P>
<H2>Agenda</H2>
    "Our agenda is a widely-held secret."

As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited.
Some events and topics that have been happening recently
include Sklyarov, Defcon, Worms From The Borg, and New FBI directors.
PGP is ten years old!  Several of us were at Phil Z's talk.
The 802.11 WEP Wireless Encryption Protocol has been cracked
even more thoroughly.  The Fedz couldn't crack Nicky Scarfo's PGP key,
but they could steal his passphrase by cracking his computer.

Location
    The Stanford meeting location will be familiar to those who've been to our
    outdoor summer meetings before, but for those who haven't been, it's on the
    Stanford University campus (in Palo Alto, California), at the end of
    Santa Theresa, at the tables outside Tressider Union, just west of
    Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

    We meet at the tables on the West side of the building, inside the
    horseshoe "U" formed by the Tresidder building. Ask anyone on campus
    where "Tresidder" or the "Student Union" is and they'll help you find it.

    If the weather is bad, we'll meet inside.

    Food and beverages are available at the cafe inside Tresidder.
