+ cypherpunks

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRESOR - Keys are stored in debug or SSE
registers and never leave the CPU. Use of AES-NI gives you solid
performance. [side-channel DPA/timing etc vulnerable, though :(]

That + trusted boot + dm-verity & FDE. Delicious. [Add Xen bare-metal &
qubes-esque setup.]

I've never seen TRESOR work, that might be a fun side-project for someone.
