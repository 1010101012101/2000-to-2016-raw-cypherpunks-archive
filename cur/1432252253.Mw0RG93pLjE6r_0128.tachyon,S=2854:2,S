This is why you can't buy ecash with your credit card. Too easy to
reverse the transaction, and by then the ecash has been blinded away.
If paypal can be reversed just as easily that won't work either.

This illustrates a general problem with these irreversible payment
schemes, it is very hard to simply acquire the currency. Any time you
go from a reversible payment system (as all the popular ones are) to
an irreversible one you have an impedence mismatch and the transfer
reflects rather than going through (so to speak).
