<P>Dear Cypherpunks:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I whole-heartedly endorse Nortel Entrust CAST, it is cryptographically strong, with</P>
<P>RC-4/RC-5/MD-5 message digest, seams to be the solution of choice.</P>
<P>I am not opposed to single or 3DES. 3DES for single-key systems makes sense.</P>
<P>Rotor-machine, Base64, clipper-chip, P.C.T is of very little value.</P>
<P>Cygnus/BNR G.S.S.A.P.i, or, best yet, Transport-layer security, is best.</P>
<P>i-button is of interst, as is chrysallis Luna/Luna-2 hardware dongles.</P>
<P>Software-based firewalls are not very impressive.</P>
<P>I advocate RSA, DES/3DES, RC-4/RC-5, MD-4/MD-5, Diffie-Hellmann ciphers,</P>
<P>verisign, CAST, secure electronic transaction protocol, </P>
<P>Radius password authentication, messaging based upon secure IP,</P>
<P>x.400, x.500, x.509.</P>
<P>Wireless networks to put the sneaker net out of business should be 802.11 wireless D.S.S</P>
<P>based upon Proxim/Farallon.</P>
<P>ISDNn based upon Gandalf/Mitel with high compression-ratio.</P>
<P>ISDNb, ADSL, Wireless network access products, cable/DSL routers with hardware based</P>
<P>firewalls are of interest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rule 1 of realtime design: user MUST maintain control <BR>at all times. Applications MUST trap ALL user interrupts, <BR>including persistent IO interrupts, even when not in <BR>active IO cycles. <BR><BR>Realtime Embedded firmware design, <BR>secure network evaluation/design/installation <BR>data design/modalling/capacity planning <BR>discrete and continuous simulations <BR>software/hardware technical troubleshooting <BR>software application instruction/teaching/guidance <BR></P><br clear=all><hr>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.<br></p></html>
