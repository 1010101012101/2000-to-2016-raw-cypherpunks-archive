We're tweeting these posts. Blowback: is any evidence available to
support the narrative? Sample of the data, say, for close examination,
with credible provenance, not the GG secret pact bloviation.

Mild critique: is this sci-fi or legit or both, advancing the literary-video
prize winning breaking news big screen Hollywood Neal Stephenson
spirit of the Snowden "NSA disclosures."
