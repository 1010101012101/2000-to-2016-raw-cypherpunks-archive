Steve:

[Don't take this as an Official RSA Statement - it's just my personal
opinion. -pt]

1. The floor space - the north half of Moscone - was identical to last
year. We sold out the booths months ahead of time. 

2. Attendence was up over last year, well over 10,000, with
3,000+ full memberships - again up over last year.

I've been going to the conference almost since the start, and 
while it did not match the euphoria of the dot.com boom period, 
the atmosphere felt more upbeat than last year (which was just 
a few months post-911).

There is turnover, of course. But many of the old players are
still there. I got my 'regime change' button from Bruce Schneier,
along with an dedicated copy of 'Secrets and Lies'. (Trivia alert:
Bruce was actually the very first vendor at the RSA Conference. 
At the second one (11 years ago) he set up a card table in the 
hall and peddled copies of the first edition of "Applied 
Cryptography".)
