Perhaps it is time to consider a new and different mailing 
list which accepts messages ONLY from remailers.  It would 
be publicly archived and unmoderated just as cypherpunks is, 
and monitored by the lions just as cypherpunks is, but now 
that the thought-crime laws are setting in full force, it 
could provide a forum where there wouldn't be such a simple 
evidentiary chain from post to poster. 

Given the recent spate of events, and the fact that some forms 
of political speech now seem to be a crime, or at least grounds 
for legal harassment and admissible as evidence of other crimes, 
I will probably have to set up such a list -- more info when 
it's ready to accept posts.

The best name (cypherpunks) seems to be taken.  Hmm.  I will 
have to consider.  The naming of things is a ticklish business.
