 >>mattd and all the other pinkos and commies<<
I'm an anarchist you dickhead,one who doesnt like pinko commies and doesn't 
trust ex-trotskyshits like you.
 >>think this is the
second coming of the communist revolution.<<
More crap from a professional crap artist specializing in Spain.See 
archive's last few weeks.I think it falls into the category of "collapse of 
Govts."and Tim Mays silence speaks volumes.
 >>In actual fact what happened is the umpteenth Argentinian
president in the last couple of weeks issued a ringing
denunciation of capitalism,<<
Maybe the one reason he is still El presidente for life.
 >>and then told the Argentinians
that in order to save them from capitalism, he was going to
confiscate their dollars and replace them with nonconvertible
pesos. <<
Some C/punks have come here suggesting we switch to e-dollars.The Euro and 
Peso conversions are fascinating.
 >>When the Argentinians understood just how they were
going to be protected from the evils of capitalism, their
enthusiasm for these measures diminished considerably. <<
We seem to have similar problems with untracable e-cash.Very interesting,go on.
 >>As we speak, while the Argentinian government is implementing
all sorts of half assed socialist measures,<<
Que? Such as,oh brilliant one.(I cover the waterfront.)
 >>the Argentinian
public, whatever their views on politics in theory, <<
There is a long tradition of anarchism in Argentina going way back,its 
worth searching for.Viva l'anarqia!
 >>are as
individuals implementing the most radical free market cure
for their problems: Dollarization. <<
In South America many see this is synonymous with Yankee 
Imperialism.Jamesd's touching concern for the Govt and wealthy is noted.
 >>The situation in
Argentina is akin to the situation in the Soviet Union
shortly before the fall, in that socialism is being
dismantled in practice without regard to government policy.<<
So we will see robber barons and their private armies take over,billions to 
be streamed through offshore banks into US and Swiss accounts? Thanks for 
the heads, up oh brilliant one.
 >>If, as seems likely, the Argentinian economy makes an
unplanned and prohibited coversion from pesos to dollars, in
defiance of government policy, the likely result is that the
value of the peso will drop to zero. --digsig
James A. Donald<<
Collapse of Govt predicted by jamesd.the new Cypherpunk seer.We must learn 
porto/spanish and popularize our e-cash ASAP.Thank you,oh brilliant 
one.Only if you ever call me a commie again Ill break your bolo's.
