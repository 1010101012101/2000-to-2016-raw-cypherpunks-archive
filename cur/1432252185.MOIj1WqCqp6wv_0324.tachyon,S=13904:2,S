<br>
<br>
Dear IRTF Chair, IAB, and CFRG:<br>
<br>
I&#39;d like to request the removal of Kevin Igoe from CFRG co-chair.<br>
<br>
The Crypto Forum Research Group is chartered to provide crypto advice<br>
to IETF Working Groups. =A0As CFRG co-chair for the last 2 years, Kevin<br>
has shaped CFRG discussion and provided CFRG opinion to WGs.<br>
<br>
Kevin&#39;s handling of the &quot;Dragonfly&quot; protocol raises doubts th=
at he is<br>
performing these duties competently. =A0Additionally, Kevin&#39;s employmen=
t<br>
with the National Security Agency raises conflict-of-interest<br>
concerns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dragonfly Background<br>
----<br>
Dragonfly is a &quot;Password-Authenticated Key Exchange&quot; protocol (or=
<br>
&quot;PAKE&quot;). =A0Dragonfly was proposed to CFRG 2 years ago [PROPOSAL]=
.<br>
Compared to better-known PAKEs, Dragonfly has no security proof, a<br>
lack of extensive security analysis, nonfunctional complications added<br>
for IPR reasons, and some security issues [REVIEW].<br>
<br>
Dragonfly became a hot topic recently when the TLS WG disputed CFRG&#39;s<b=
r>
alleged report that Dragonfly was &quot;satisfactory&quot;, as well as disp=
uting<br>
that this report reflected CFRG consensus [TLS_1]. =A0After extensive<br>
criticism of Dragonfly, the TLS WG ceased work on a Dragonfly<br>
extension [TLS_2].<br>
<br>
<br>
NSA Background<br>
----<br>
The National Security Agency (&quot;NSA&quot;) is a U.S. Intelligence Agenc=
y<br>
which is believed to devote considerable resources to:<br>
=A0- &quot;Influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial<=
br>
public key technologies&quot;<br>
=A0- &quot;Shape the worldwide cryptography marketplace to make it more<br>
tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities&quot; [BULLRUN]<br>
<br>
While much is unknown about these activities, the NSA is known to have<br>
placed a &quot;back door&quot; in a NIST standard for random number generat=
ion<br>
[ECDRBG]. =A0A recent report from the President&#39;s Review Group<br>
recommends that the NSA:<br>
=A0- &quot;fully support and not undermine efforts to create encryption sta=
ndards&quot;<br>
=A0- &quot;not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable<br=
>
generally available commercial software&quot; [PRESIDENTS]<br>
<br>
This suggests the NSA is currently behaving contrary to the recommendations=
.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reasons for requesting Kevin&#39;s removal<br>
----<br>
1) =A0Kevin has provided the *ONLY* positive feedback for Dragonfly that<br=
>
can be found on the CFRG mailing list or meeting minutes. =A0The<br>
contrast between Kevin&#39;s enthusiasm and the group&#39;s skepticism is<b=
r>
striking [CFRG_SUMMARY]. =A0It&#39;s unclear what this enthusiasm is based<=
br>
on. =A0There&#39;s no record of Kevin making any effort to understand<br>
Dragonfly&#39;s unusual structure, compare it to alternatives, consider<br>
possible use cases, or construct a formal security analysis.<br>
<br>
2) =A0Twice Kevin suggested a technique for deriving the Dragonfly<br>
password-based element which would make the protocol easy to break<br>
[IGOE_1, IGOE_2]. =A0He also endorsed an ineffective attempt to avoid<br>
timing attacks by adding extra iterations to one of the loops [IGOE_3,<br>
IGOE_4]. =A0These are surprising mistakes from an experienced<br>
cryptographer.<br>
<br>
3) =A0Kevin&#39;s approval of Dragonfly to the TLS WG misrepresented CFRG<b=
r>
consensus, which was skeptical of Dragonfly [CFRG_SUMMARY].<br>
<br>
4) =A0Kevin&#39;s NSA affiliation raises unpleasant but unavoidable<br>
questions regarding these actions. =A0It&#39;s entirely possible these are<=
br>
just mistakes by a novice chair who lacks experience in a particular<br>
sort of protocol and is being pressured by IETF participants to<br>
endorse something. =A0But it&#39;s hard to escape an impression of<br>
carelessness and unseriousness in Kevin&#39;s work. =A0One wonders whether<=
br>
the NSA is happy to preside over this sort of sloppy crypto design.<br>
<br>
While that&#39;s of course speculation, it remains baffling that an<br>
experienced cryptographer would champion such a shoddy protocol. =A0The<br>
CFRG chairs have been silent for months, and haven&#39;t responded to<br>
attempts to clarify this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
----<br>
The position of CFRG chair (or co-chair) is a role of crucial<br>
importance to the IETF community. =A0The IETF is in desperate need of<br>
trustworthy crypto guidance from parties who are above suspicion. =A0I<br>
encourage the IAB and IRTF to replace Kevin Igoe with someone who can<br>
provide this.<br>
<br>
Thanks for considering this request.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trevor<br>
