Bull. But to specifics...

Is the point to live your life or piss people off with impunity? If it's
the latter then there is no hope for you because wherever you go you're
going to piss the 'man' off. Trying to cover this up (a social pathology) 
with some lame ass excuse that you're just trying to get by won't cut the
mustard. That's not indivuality, nor is it social responsibility. It's
just plain mean and self-absorbed.

However, if you're goal is to do what you want to do and not piss people
off then moving around every couple of years is a viable strategy. By the
time anyone figures out what it is you're doing, and get's pissed off
you're already gone. In addition, if you're smart anonymity will prevent
any 1-1 association (rather cypherpunkish) simply because you won't go
around bragging about what a bad ass you are.

Somehow I don't think 'cypherpunk' equals 'egotist' or 'rampant self
promotion'.

Maybe, but then again we'll never know since Phil did it in the US and
chose to live here. What happened to him actually is a good example of how
not to do something like that.

He'd been better served writing the software here but releasing it
anonymously over-seas. He made a tactical error in that he not only wanted
to help people but wanted credit for it also.

Greed will get you killed.

You're lack of imagination is in no way a boundary condition on mine.

This omnipotent and omnipresent 'they' you speak of simply doesn't exist
in the context you claim. If I were to live in England for a couple of
years writing some nifty anonymity code, or perhaps in some less 'legaly
diligant' clime for some more 'invasive' goal then it would only make
sense to execute in a different place. Anonymity is likely to be much
easier to manage in such an environment as well.

If you do attract their attention you've already failed.

Bell's case is not an acceptable example for a variety of reasons.

They're inherently frightened, it's only a question of what now...

He should have released PGP anonymously. It would not have been a
difficult proposition.
