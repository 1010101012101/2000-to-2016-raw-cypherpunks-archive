We're not disagreeing. By a "single" value I meant a universally
agreed upon value.  It's likely true that the owner of any item will
have a single value that he thinks he'll be out if that item is
destroyed (I can't see how there could be more than one),
but unless the item is a commodity, nobody else will know for
sure what that value is.
