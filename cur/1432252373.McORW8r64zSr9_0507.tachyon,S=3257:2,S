Read this from Tim May, November 3:

   It really is no business of government to know the identities of those 
   whose bags/etc.  they are checking. Having government able to single out 
   some travellers for special processing is a recipe for this kind of 
   mischief.

   BTW, the _wrong_ tack to take would be some argument about a "right to 
   travel," some over-ruling of Southwest's or United's right to pick its 
   customers as it wishes. The preferred approach should be to have no ID 
   at the _security_ checkpoint and to not have any laws requiring ID tied 
   to tickets.

He suggests having no ID or other history information available to
help screeners make their decision, nothing but whatever clues can be
gleaned in the brief moments available.  Anybody want to fly *those*
friendly skies?
