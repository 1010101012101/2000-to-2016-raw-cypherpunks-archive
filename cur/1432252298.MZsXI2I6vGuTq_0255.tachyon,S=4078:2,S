Yep. The "why can't we all just get along, it's for the children, 
guns are icky, we want more health care, you men leave the seat up, 
capitalism exploits womyn" commies and fellow travellers.

The mother of all gender gaps, so to speak, is opening up.

Chalk it up to too much democracy, too many things up for popular 
vote by the herd.

One good note, though, CNN is reporting that Ohio went to Bush and 
that gun owners probably had a major effect.

Women vs. gun owners. Why am I not surprised?

If and when it comes to us shooting to protect our rights, the PMS 
set had better work on their marksmanship.
