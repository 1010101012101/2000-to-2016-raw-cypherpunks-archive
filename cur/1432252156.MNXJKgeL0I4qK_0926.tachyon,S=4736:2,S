	"Privilige (sic) of running a business"?

	Huh?

	Do you have the "Privilege" of being allowed to work?

	To say running a business is a "privilege" is to say that 
every action, everything that a person does besides breathing is a 
privilege.

	Who can bestow that privilege?

	Asinine.

	Unless you are chaining people to their desks, posting armed 
guards to prevent them from leaving, or using the law to prevent them 
from quiting and finding another job, you aren't treating them as 
property.

	You are treating them as adults, as independent people who 
can make up their own minds as to where and under what conditions 
they are willing to work.

	Utter nonsense. But then the further the subject strays from 
programming and computers, the more that is common from you.

	Money, or rather the trade of goods and services *is* the 
morality of a society.

	Or to put it a little better, Money is the INDICATOR of the 
morality of a culture. It tells you what they value, what they want 
and what they think important.
