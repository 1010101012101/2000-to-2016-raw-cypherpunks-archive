	My sincere thanks to Lucky Green for arranging server space and
bandwidth for a public demonstration server. I can setup the server at
any time.

	However, eliminating Lucrative accounts is a major change. It
will rearrange the server API, significantly change the schema, and
impact the Purse as well. I think it would be a good idea to go to v8,
with the accounts->envelope revision done, before starting the public
server.

	I don't know how long it will take - at least two days - but I'm
working on it now.


Patrick
