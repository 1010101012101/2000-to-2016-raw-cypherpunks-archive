   [1]DrSkwid writes "The UK Police are building a network to [2]monitor
   the movement of every vehicle in the U.K. through an extensive
   Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system. The data will be
   retained for 2 years. The Register further reports that the system
   will likely be used for issuing speeding fines." From the article:
   "The primary aims claimed for the system are tackling untaxed and
   uninsured vehicles, stolen cars and the considerably broader one of
   'denying criminals the use of the roads.' But unless the Times has got
   the spacing wrong, having one every quarter of a mile on motorways
   quite clearly means they'll be used to enforce speed limits as well,
   which would effectively make the current generation of Gatsos
   obsolete. Otherwise, checking a vehicle's tax and insurance status
   every 15 seconds or thereabouts would seem overkill."
