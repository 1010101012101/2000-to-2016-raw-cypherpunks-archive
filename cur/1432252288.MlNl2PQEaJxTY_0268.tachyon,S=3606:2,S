Sure, also GlobaLeaks 0.2 is designed in a way to minimize the impact on
TorHS latency and avoid "white page effect" on user's browser.

Totally agree, especially it's absolutely reasonable that we will see a
growing number of Applications that include Tor as part of their code
and use Tor Hidden Services a unique way to communicate.

It would be very useful to have an official statement by Tor Project on
the current scalability / performance impact of Tor Hidden Service with
a Guideline to let Application Developer (bundling Tor, using TorHS)
avoid breaking/hurting the Tor Network.

That way the limits are clear and the way to be "Polite with the Network
considering it's current limitations" would be explicit.
