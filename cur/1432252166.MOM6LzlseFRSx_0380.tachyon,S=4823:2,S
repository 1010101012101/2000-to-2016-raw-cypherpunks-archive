Indeed. There are some big names there, but of question is the amount
of actual pressure they are applying. So, big x fractional = ???. And of
that, what fraction is adopted by the receiver. Nor do the really strong
questions seem to be being asked yet. Too many people ducking and
weaseling on interviews, too many going easy on the questions. Sure,
there are course adjustments being made. But will the future outcome
be significantly different...
We need a good prediction market. At least some of us onlookers
could make a bit of change while in the peanut gallery.
