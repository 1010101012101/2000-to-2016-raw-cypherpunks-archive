It is really hard to police when you do not speak the language. 
Furthermore, soldiers are terrible as police.  They tend to  
solve all problems by killing the criminals and everyone in the 
vicinity.

The looting will solve itself soon.  All regime targets have 
been looted, which means that everyone now has guns.  Naturally 
the looters start hitting non regime targets.  Those targeted 
proceed to execute looters.  Looting rapidly declines.

Unfortunately this means that large public hospitals will cease 
to exist, but small private practices should be resuming soon,
a quite satisfactory outcome unless you happen to be seriously
injured during the fall of the regime.
