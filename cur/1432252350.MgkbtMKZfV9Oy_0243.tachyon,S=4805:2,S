Excellent idea as the wayback is it really doesn't seem to capture anywhere
near as wide a range of pages as google, and it also seems to be straining
under the weight of requests. the number of internal server errors it
generates is absurd, especially considering the size of some of it's
sponsors.

perhaps a google mirror that was archived periodically would be a better
bet?

It's not as outrageous as you'd think.  100GB drives are around $200,
which means that a terabyte will cost you about $3K if you throw in a PC
and some networking gear to connect it, so you could replicate that
in your basement next to your DES-cracker for about the same price -
the more expensive problem is getting the fiber optic connection
from the Presidio to your basement to keep it updated.

More to the point, recent news articles say the Feds have been
getting Google to delete things for them.
         http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/current/msg00505.html
Anybody know what's been deleted, and whether it's still in Wayback,
and whether we can get copies out into the public before anyone pressures
Brewster Kahle?
