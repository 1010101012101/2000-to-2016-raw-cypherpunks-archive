Among the top echelon of the Bush terror network, Donald Rumsfeld is one of
the more disturbing characters. Donald Rumsfeld occupies the position of the
U.S. Secretary of War (officially known as Secretary of Defense). His
aliases range from "Rummy" and "Dr. Strangelove" to "Darth Vader."
Rumsfeld has come to be known for his near glee when commenting on
successful U.S. bombing missions in Afghanistan. A videotape of a recent
Pentagon press briefing catches him making a chilling, bloodthirsty
statement. Asked if the U.S. had run out of bombing targets in Afghanistan,
Rumsfeld answers: "First, we're going to re-hit targets. And second, we're
not running out of targets, Afghanistan is." According to a press report,
Rumsfeld's remark was "greeted with gales of laughter in the briefing room."
Rumsfeld has a reputation for a nearly fanatical infatuation with weapons of
mass destruction. He was described as a "despot" by none other than Henry
"Machiavelli" Kissinger--a long-time high-ranking terrorist operative
personally responsible for the deaths of millions of people in Southeast
Asia. He has been linked to various shadowy right-wing organizations. In
short, beneath his cheerful and bubbly persona lies the cold-blooded killer
instinct of a dangerous master of terror.
Psychological Profile
According to experts, Rumsfeld has two great passions--money and power. Like
many in the Bush terror network, Rumsfeld is a multi-millionaire--his
personal financial holdings are estimated to range from $50 to $210 million.
He alternates between the corporate boardroom and the terrorist war
room--though often the distinction is non-existent. His business dealings
reflect the same callous view of human life shown by his terrorist actions.
As head of one drug company, he used his connections to get approval for a
food supplement that is linked to brain cancer. He founded and ran another
drug company whose goal is to make a fortune by getting exclusive rights to
peddle its products to severely ill people who in effect become a captive
market for the corporation.
Apprentice to Terror: Heartlessness and Racism
Rumsfeld's initiation into terror began in 1962 as a minor functionary (aka
"Congressman") in the U.S. rogue-state bureaucracy. He showed complete
indifference to those without wealth--opposing food-stamp funding, Medicare,
or even a measly 35" raise in the minimum wage, which was then $1.25 an
hour.
His proven heartlessness was rewarded with a promotion to a responsible
position within the terror network headed up by Richard "Tricky Dick" Nixon,
which at that time was running amok around the world. The crimes of this
particularly vile network ranged from targeting, imprisoning and
assassinating radical Black leaders within the U.S. to the mass murder of
Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians.
Nixon was a renowned paranoid, schemer and proponent of the bizarre American
cult of "White Supremacy." On an audio tape recently examined and verified
by expert analysis, Nixon can be heard uttering obscenities and racist
remarks about Black people, including sickening comments concerning Black
men's anatomy and intelligence. Rumsfeld's voice is also heard on the
tape--dutifully playing the yes-man toady to the terror chieftain and
chiming in with approval. Despite Rumsfeld's denials of even remembering the
meeting or the conversation, the tape is clearly a smoking gun.
Membership in Shadowy Groups
Over the course of Rumsfeld's career in terror, experts have linked him to
an assortment of shadowy right-wing organizations with sinister agendas.
They sport names such as Committee for the Present Danger, International
Rescue Committee, Center for Security Policy, and the Committee for a Free
World, which Rumsfeld himself headed up.
With major funding coming from the likes of Richard Mellon Scaife, member of
one the wealthiest families in the U.S., these groups are noted for their
unabashed militarism, rabid anti-communism, support for pro-U.S. rogue
states, love of nukes, and enthusiasm for deploying weapons of mass
destruction into outer space. Individuals connected to these groups are
truly an evil cabal--Latin American death squad leaders, former Nazi
collaborators, operatives from Reverend Sun Myung Moon's cult-like
Unification Church, spy operative Oliver North and his coterie from the
Iran-Contra arms and cocaine deals, and a generous sprinkling of "retired"
U.S. terror network generals and "CIA" agents. This is the nasty sea in
which Rumsfeld has been swimming most of his adult life.
Infatuation with Nukes
According to researchers, Rumsfeld trained under Andrew Marshall, a Bush
henchman and an "expert" on military matters who spent 50 years figuring out
the best way to blow up half the world by "thinking the unthinkable." With
this pedigree, it should be no surprise that Rumsfeld is a devout follower
of a weapons cult that revels in discovering faster, newer and more powerful
ways of destroying one's enemies. He really is quite mad, in a Dr.
Strangelove kind of way. This was one of the qualities that earned his
selection to defense chieftain in the Bush terror network, where he is like
a kid in the weapons-of-destruction candy store.
Rumsfeld is against a ban on chemical weapons. He opposes a nuclear test ban
because such a ban would make it difficult to develop new generations of
nukes. He and a team of experts advocate turning outer space into another
arena of war. Rumsfeld is particularly keen on setting up a missile grid
that would allow the U.S.-based terror networks to wage war, including
nuclear war, without fear of retaliation. This amounts to a scheme for
casualty-free (on the U.S. side) nuclear genocide.
For his work, Rumsfeld was given the "Keeper of the Flame" award from the
Center for Policy Studies, a terrorist support group that advocates the use
of weapons in space. In the past, Rumsfeld has both advised and contributed
funds to the group, which is also financed by the major military contractors
who stand to make a fortune in building space weapons.
Association with Rogues around the World
An examination of Rumsfeld's travels reveals a close (and opportunistic)
association with heads of various pro-U.S. rogue states. One day he flies to
Uzbekistan to make an ally of the Uzbek dictator Islam Karimov and gain
access for military bases. Karimov's iron rule--enforced by 40,000 secret
police in the capital alone--allows no public criticism. He practices
torture and has put thousands in prison camps. He violently suppresses
believers in Islam and once boasted that "these people should be shot in the
head, and if necessary I will shoot them myself."
The next day Rumsfeld is hobnobbing with the Islamic fundamentalist rulers
of the rogue state of Saudi Arabia, where the Bush terror network has
stationed thousands of soldiers. This is a place where oil is king, the
"Committees for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" ensure
strict adherence to reactionary religious laws, and court-ordered
punishments range from 1,500 lashes for protesting against the royalty to
amputations for theft to the death penalty for "sorcery."
Unrepentant Cold-blooded Killer
Above all things, Rumsfeld is a killer. As defense chieftain, he is the one
who carries out the military agenda of the Bush terror network in its war on
the people of Afghanistan. He does his job with gusto: 15,000 pound "Daisy
Cutters," B-52 carpet bombings, cluster bomblets that tear through human
flesh like butter--for Rumsfeld, no weapon is too grisly. An admiring
reporter observed that Rumsfeld "is comfortable with the word 'to kill.' "
In one short briefing, he used the word "kill" nine times, while the general
standing next to him used old Pentagon euphemisms like "degrade."
While expressing bubbly elation over each bomb that drops, Rumsfeld coolly
brushes off all reports of rising civilian deaths--now over 3,500 according
to one researcher in the U.S. "No nation in human history has done more to
avoid civilian casualties than the United States has in this conflict" is
his preferred mantra.
When confronted with specific accounts of an entire village flattened by
U.S. bombs, a hospital destroyed or children buried beneath the rubble of
their homes, Rumsfeld musters up all his skill to evade responsibility by
employing his patented four-step "If you can't deny, justify" method. First
step: "They aren't dead. These aren't body parts. These are not bomb
craters." If that fails, try step 2: Insist "We didn't do it" and then blame
it on someone else. If that doesn't work, go to step 3: Get self-righteous
and say, "We did it--and the people must've been doing something wrong if
our bombs fell on them." If all else fails, use step 4: Simply state "that's
just how war goes" and move on.
A videotape caught Rumsfeld saying these words as he derided his critics:
"These people stand up and fuss at the United States because there's a baby
in the street who was killed by something."
Summary
The evidence and documentation above make it clear that Donald Rumsfeld is
unquestionably a dangerous man. He moves in and out of corporate,
government, and military seats of power like a phantom. He kills without
hesitation or remorse. His mad visions of hi-tech military superiority and
global nuclear dominance could result in an astronomical loss of life. He is
crafty, deceptive, ruthless, and thoroughly evil--truly an international
terrorist to be reckoned with.
