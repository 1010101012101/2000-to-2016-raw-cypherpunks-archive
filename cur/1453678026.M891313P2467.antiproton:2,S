Does the source of the warning make the warning less relevant?

Do you see no potential problems/dangers in private sector having such =

Fair enough. Let's work with that. Does that mean that orphans should n=

the government's candy? Does that mean that orphans that *do* take that=
 candy=20
are "sellouts" and are to be ostracized or considered akin to governmen=

Again, fair enough. Never been a fan of "imposing a plan by force".

So we have a mafioso that became a *victim* of the very mafia he was a=20=

Okay, let me be more specific. Imagine if you will a situation, in whic=
h the=20
mafioso in question does not *know* that the mafia gave out orders to k=
ill=20
him. There was no clear beef between him and the mafia, but some extern=
al=20
circumstances cause the capos to decide that this guy has to go.

So the mafioso in question does not *know* that he is going to be kille=
d.

And let's assume he has been killed while he was sleeping. So that he h=
ad no=20
chance of realising what's going on.

My question is: does the sheer fact of being killed by the organisation=

We're trying to establish what does it mean to be a "voluntary organisa=
tion",=20
and if all victims by definition are not voluntary. You seem to put a l=

that, so I am trying to understand how you use those words.

Cool, so we agreed that Wikipedia is an "involuntary victim" of a civil=

A-ha! Aims! So we arrive at the dreaded "No True Scotsman". :)

So, what's *your* definition* of "civil society", then?

WorldWide Fund and Greenpeace seem to have "coercive aims", as in: they=
 are=20
trying to influence decisions of other people in a certain way. Sometim=
es even=20
using intimidation.

Yet many would agree that these are civil society organisations. So:
 - could you define "coercive aims"?=20
 - are Greenpeace and WWF civil society organisations, or not?

Interesting. Could you define "militant society" and perhaps draw the l=

between the two?

"militant society".

Okay. So why use two words for it?

Also, does that make the Internet Watch Foundation "criminal"?

Well, it actually highlighted the definition problem. So, how do you de=

Wait, does your definition of "civil society" *require* an organisation=

a "libertarian voluntarist" one? And what would that mean?

So basically you make up your own meaning of words/phrases and call peo=

names because they use it in a different way, without first explaining =
your=20
way of using these terms? Uh-huh.

Ah, now we're getting somewhere! So we can have private companies that =

Can they be corrupt without government's help?

I try to avoid most of your rants, to be honest.

I don't see where he said it's a "bigger" threat. He just points out th=

Before we dive into this rabbit hole, do I understand correctly that ab=

just agreed that:

1. in and of itself the fact that a project (say, Tor) takes government=
 money,=20
does not *automagically* mean that the project is corrupt/coercive/in b=
ed/etc?

2. that it is *possible* that such a project (not necessarily Tor; some=
=20
hypothetical project) can have good outcome *despite* taking money from=
 the=20
government?

Now now, let's not bundle two distinct things. Nice try, but no bone.

I do hold that encryption systems should be as unbreakable as possible,=
 or=20
perhaps even more.

And at the same time I hold strongly (and have data to back it up) that=
 this=20
will not seriously hinder governments' ability to "enforce laws".

That's exactly why I call LEA's "argument" of "we need backdoors becaus=

and means to do whatever it is they're doing without breaking encryptio=
