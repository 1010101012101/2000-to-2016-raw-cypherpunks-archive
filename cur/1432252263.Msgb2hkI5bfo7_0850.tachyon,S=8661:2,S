It's far easier and less error-prone to hand them a CD-ROM
full of symmetric keys indexed by date.

The problem is that most people will not take the care needed
to properly use a one-time pad.  For text communications like
this forum, they're great, and a (relatively) small amount of
keying material, as you suggest, will last for many years.

But modern applications are concerned with communicating *DATA*,
not original text; someone on the system is going to want to
send their buddy a 30-minute video of the professor explaining
a sticky point to the class, and where is your keying material
going then?  He wants to be ignorant of the details of the
cryptosystem; he just hits "secure send" and waits for magic
to happen.  Or if not a 30-minute video, then the last six
months of account records for the west coast division of the
company, or a nicely formatted document in a word processor
format that uses up a megabyte or two per page, or ...
whatever.  The OTP is nice for just plain text, but the more
bits a format consumes, the less useful it becomes.  And
fewer and fewer people even understand how much or how
little bandwidth something is; they think in terms of "human
bandwidth", the number of seconds or minutes of attention
required to read or listen to or watch something.

An OTP, as far as I'm concerned, makes a really good system,
but you have to respect its limits.  One of those limits is
a low-bandwidth medium like text-only messages, and in the
modern world that qualifies as "specialized."

Given a low-bandwidth medium, and indexing keying material
into daily chunks to prevent a system failure from resulting
in pad reuse, you get 600 MB on a CD-ROM.  Say you want a
century of secure communications, so you divide it into 8-
kilobyte chunks -- each day you can send 8 kilobytes and
he can send 8 kilobytes.  (Note that DVD-ROMs are better).

That gives you a little over 100 years (read, "all you're likely
to need, barring catastrophic medical advances,") of a very
secure low-bandwidth channel.

Of course, the obvious application for this OTP material,
other than text messaging itself, is to use it for key
distribution.
