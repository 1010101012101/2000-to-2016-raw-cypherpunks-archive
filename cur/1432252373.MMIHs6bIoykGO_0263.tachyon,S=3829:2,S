And what was your first clue? I'm speaking of the Constitution as it was
intended. You're as stupid as Declan (of course this should surprise
nobody since both of you are protecting the status quo). Like I've said
before lawyers and reports are whores, they sell their integrity to the
highest bidder. None of you believe in the Constitution, and you're so
scared of it you'll take an oath to protect it and then turn around with
full pre-meditation and break that oath in order to protect the status
quo. Democracy and real 'equality under the law' must scare the holy shit
out of you everytime the thought enters your pea-sized noggin.

Both of you should see a doctor about your attention deficit. I suspect
it's too late for your soul.
