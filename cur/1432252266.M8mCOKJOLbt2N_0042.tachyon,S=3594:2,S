At the RSA conference I saw a company selling Starium-equivalent
units, both for voice and data encryption. The voice only units were
about $1400 apiece. (frankly, at that price, you could plug a PC
with an A/D converter card between the handset and the base, and
roll your own). 

I'm still decompressing, and have not unpacked all my bumph, else
I'd have more specific data.
