What you do is hash the ID, then compare it to the list of hashed entries,
using the ID as the key to decrypt the data associated with that entry
while that isn't subject to reverse engineering, the abuse it *is* open to
is random guessing of IDs (every "success" gives someone else's record,
with failures having no penalty)
Adding a password (and combining it with the ID to give your key) will
address some of that, but really you need to encrypt each entry
individually to prevent someone simply decompiling your code and obtaining
your full data list.

no.
if you trial encrypt the sample ID for comparison, you hand them the key
to the whole list.
