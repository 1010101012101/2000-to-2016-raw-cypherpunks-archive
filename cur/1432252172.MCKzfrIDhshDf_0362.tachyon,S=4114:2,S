On my planet, people talk to each other in a pleasant, decent, and 
reasonable way by actually _talking_ to them. That is, by listening, 
responding, making points, etc. In particular, when the arrive on new

They don't spew stilted jargon to lists which they are new to.

I still vote that we find our where it lives and kill it before it multiplies.
