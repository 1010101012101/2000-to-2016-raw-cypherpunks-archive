Hmmm. There's a missing conjunction in the list.  That's a signature 
usage that his father was famous for.  I haven't been paying much 
attention to him, but it might be worthwhile to do some text analysis 
and see how much of this crap is being written by his father. 

On the other hand, it may be a signature usage he learned *from* 
george senior when he was just a kid.
