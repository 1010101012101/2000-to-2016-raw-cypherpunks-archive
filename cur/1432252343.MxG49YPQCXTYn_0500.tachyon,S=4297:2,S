Note that the defendants are not said to be in custody.  I take it then
that they are not.

> WASHINGTON - Hansruedi Schumacher and Matthias Rickenbach,

> the United States, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue
> Service (IRS) announced. According to the indictment, Schumacher
> worked as an executive manager at Neue Zuercher Bank (NZB), a

> worked as a Swiss attorney who provided legal advice and services

> The indictment further alleges that Schumacher and Rickenbach

> investment activities with their U.S. clients and that when they
> traveled they concealed their business activities in the United
> States by falsely representing to American authorities that they

> The defendants told their clients that their assets and
