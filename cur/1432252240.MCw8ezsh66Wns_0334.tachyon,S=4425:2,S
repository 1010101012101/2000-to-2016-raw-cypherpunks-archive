Why try to pick a Medeco when it's locking a glass door?  :-)

-derek

PS: This isn't a hypothetical; I visited a friend's parents a number
of years ago, and noticed that their front door, all glass (with
nothing behind it) was locked using a Medeco lock.  For those who
don't know, a Medeco is a top-of-the-line lock, practically impossible
to pick, drill out, etc.
