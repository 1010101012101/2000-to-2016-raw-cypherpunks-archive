"The Fatherland Security troops are publicly embaressed and showing
their brown shirts."

Well, I'm not convinced you guys have detected the right intended message 
here.

Basically, the real message may be: "it's impossible to protect Americans 
through local policies alone". In other words, there's no serious desire 
high-up to truly seal our ports in the short run. American perceived 
insecurity will allow "us" to eventually move into places like Indonesia, in 
order to "defend" our ports. The fact that it may actually be impossible to 
screen everything coming in is immaterial. No wait...it's beneficial.
