Okay, that clinches it. You're a moron.

Why *shouldn't* ZKS, or any other company, sell their products to the NSA?
Do you honestly think that ZKS could prevent the NSA from obtaining a copy
of a commercially available product?

"Welcome to Faustine's Privacy Shoppe, your one-stop shop for privacy

Next you're going to argue that PGP is now more secure than it ever was,
because the source code is closed.

Please. Educate yourself.
