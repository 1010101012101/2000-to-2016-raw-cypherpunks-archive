The Pirate Bay Attacks Censorship With Low Orbit Server Drones
ErnestoMarch 18, 2012145 tpbPrint
In recent months The Pirate Bay has drastically changed its site to make
it less vulnerable to ever increasing censorship attempts across the
globe. But that was just the start, as the torrent site now says its
getting ready to put some of its hardware in GPS controlled drones.
Everyone knows WHAT TPB is. Now theyre going to have to think about
WHERE TPB is, The Pirate Bay team told TorrentFreak.

It is no secret that Hollywood wants The Pirate Bay to shut down. But to
accomplish this authorities may soon have to shoot down the sites
servers as these will be hovering in the air.

The Pirate Bay today unveiled their new mission. Theyre working on
hosting parts of their site in GPS-controlled drones, instead of
old-fashioned data centers.

Everyone knows WHAT TPB is. Now theyre going to have to think about
WHERE TPB is, The Pirate Bay team told TorrentFreak. We were further
informed that the first drone will probably fly above international waters.

Were already the most resilient and the most down to earth. Thats why
we need to lift off, being this connected to the ground doesnt feel
appropriate to us anymore, TPB told us. Although the line between
reality and fantasy can be rather thin at The Pirate Bay, we were
assured that the plan to launch a drone is real.


TPBs new host?


In a blog post Hollywoods arch-rivals half reveal some more details
about the unconventional plan.

With the development of GPS controlled drones, far-reaching cheap radio
equipment and tiny new computers like the Raspberry Pi, were going to
experiment with sending out some small drones that will float some
kilometers up in the air. This way our machines will have to be shut
down with aeroplanes in order to shut down the system. A real act of war.

Were just starting so we havent figured everything out yet. But we
cant limit ourselves to hosting things just on land anymore. These Low
Orbit Server Stations (LOSS) are just the first attempt. With modern
radio transmitters we can get over 100Mbps per node up to 50km away. For
the proxy system were building, thats more than enough.

The drone plan is yet another move to make it harder to censor or
shutdown The Pirate Bay. Last month the file-sharing site traded in
torrents for magnets for the exact same reason, and behind the scenes
The Pirate Bay team is making more adjustments.

Looking ahead, The Pirate Bay team thinks the site may no longer be
hosted on this planet.

When the time comes we will host in all parts of the galaxy, being true
to our slogan of being the galaxys most resilient system. And all of
the parts well use to build that system on will be downloadable.

Interesting times..
