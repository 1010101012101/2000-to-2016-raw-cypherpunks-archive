May it be true the spies admit defeat. But not likely, more likely
a ruse, for they are highly trained liars and tricksters. Feints are
commonplace to disarm and delude opponents.

Pardons of Manning and Snowden, shutdown investigating
of Assange, and several other intimidating and chilling
operations would be persuasive. Hearings on abuse would
help air the stench. But will not eliminate the rot of secrecy.

These formulaic conciliatory gestures would be cheap discounts
of giant budgets for ancient practices of extorting money from
the public, for, what else, protection, protection against
government defined threats, identified by secret means.

The spying apparatus will re-surge as it has forever, governments
cannot survive without spying on its taxpayers. IRS and global
revenue agencies the main data collectors on citizens and subjects
from birth to death for everyone everywhere, even spies. SSN the
ubiquitous UID. Got a problem with that, go to jail. Tax refusers and
evaders more stigmatized and loathed than terrorists.

Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the world spend more time
chasing and prosecuting voluminous tax cheats then the tiny
number of terrorists. With their contractors this produces handsome
tax revenue, confiscations and fines. Prison populations too.

Spying was invented to catch tax cheats and assure revenue
for government operation and rule, and nothing unites the
world's governments more than that essential transfusion
of money to sustain government beneficiares, in the US the
three branches, state and local. Military merely cops to
control obedient payment.

In NYC, the racket of Wall Street is to pay NYPD to stay
away from finance through the Police Foundation. The
recently published "Enemies Within," by two AP reporters
recount how this has come about through the services of
David Cohen, formerly CIA Director of Operations, who
has set a completely unaccountable spying operation.

Prior to setting this up, Ray Kelly, NYPD chief, and Cohen
worked for Wall Street firms. Mayor Bloomberg happily
endorsing the 1% bribery methodology.

Nobody should believe this will change without a lot more
than hopeful dreaming.
