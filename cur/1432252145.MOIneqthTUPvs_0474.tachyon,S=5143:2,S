FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

Chockstone Acquires Peppercoin,
Strengthens Its Leading Position in Real-Time Loyalty Marketing Programs
for the Restaurant and Convenience Store Industries

Portland, Ore. - April 16, 2007 - Chockstone Inc., provider of the world's
most innovative customer loyalty marketing programs and stored value
solutions, today announced that it has acquired Peppercoin, a provider of
card-based merchant loyalty programs and related consulting and analytical
services. Peppercoin's PCI-compliant services are used by leading
restaurant brands to tie customer loyalty programs to credit and debit
cards at the point of sale. Both companies are privately-held, and
financial terms of the Peppercoin transaction were not disclosed.

"This is a strategic acquisition for Chockstone," said Jeffrey Lipp, CEO
and President of Chockstone. "Peppercoin's focus on delivering targeted
offers to credit and debit card customers to increase frequency for
restaurant companies is a perfect fit with our business. We're fortunate to
strengthen and extend our loyalty marketing capabilities with Peppercoin's
innovative and proven services."

"There is a lot of talk about loyalty marketing services in the processing
industry, but Chockstone is the only company that has delivered on the
promise of loyalty on a national scale," said Mark Friedman, CEO of
Peppercoin. "Combining our portfolios of business and highly complementary
technology creates an unbeatable offering for merchants seeking to improve
profitability through loyalty and rewards programs."

Peppercoin: Easy Enrollment, Real-time Rewards and Reports
Peppercoin gives merchants secure access to their customers' payments data
- the most relevant and important customer behavioral data - so they can
increase the effectiveness of their loyalty programs based on the analysis
Peppercoin's platform provides.

Consumers can enroll in a Peppercoin-driven loyalty program with a single
swipe of their credit or debit card. And with real-time reporting and
customer analytics tools, merchants using the Peppercoin system are able to
fine-tune offers based on business needs and consumer response.

Chockstone: Driving Effective Loyalty Marketing Programs, Enhancing Services
More than 30,000 retail locations are currently using Chockstone's loyalty
marketing, gift card and payment programs worldwide, with the market for
additional loyalty services continuing to grow. Chockstone's restaurant,
convenience store and retail loyalty programs have proven to:

	*	Increase consumer 'stickiness' and brand affinity

	*	Increase sales and profitability between 8% and 14%

	*	Increase average ticket price more than 12%

In addition to this acquisition, Chockstone has recently announced several
major upgrades to its loyalty marketing platform, including a 'do it
yourself' Promotions Manager for marketers to launch and manage their own
loyalty programs; and Receipt and RespondTM, a receipt-based, national
advertising network that delivers targeted ads at the point of sale.

About Chockstone

and stored value solutions available to merchants today. Chockstone's
programs are used by leading brands like Subway, Ticketmaster and Plaid
