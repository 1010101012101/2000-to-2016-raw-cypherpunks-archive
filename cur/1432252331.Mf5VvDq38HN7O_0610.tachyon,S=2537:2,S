Don't forget zero tolerance.  If caught, they'll be suspended or
expelled or transferred.  I've never understood the concept of expulsion
from public school before age 16.  "You must go to school" then "you
must not go to school" seems rather silly to me.  I guess it's better to
have them running around neighborhoods in gangs with real guns than
going to school and using chicken strips to shoot at teachers.  About
the cd swapping, maybe their parents will go to jail, too.  That's going
to be really productive for shaping the child's or young teen's
perception of society.
