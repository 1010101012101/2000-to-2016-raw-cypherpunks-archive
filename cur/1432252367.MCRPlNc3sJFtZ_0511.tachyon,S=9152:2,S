More of the same, from businessmen this time, not bureaucrats. A telling pulled
quote: "I kind of feel like if the FBI wants to follow me around, God bless
them. I've got nothing to hide."

Disgraceful.

Nation weighing value of security vs. privacy; An edgy America struggles with
technology's role

ALAN GOLDSTEIN and VIKAS BAJAJ BODY:

But there will be no high-tech silver bullet this time, according to the panel
of business and academic experts that convened Tuesday in a special session to
discuss technology's role in the crisis.

The panel was asked about proposed measures in which airlines could use
electronic wizardry to search aggressively for high-risk passengers, culling
through myriad databases from both corporations and law enforcement agencies.

Security personnel at airports and other high-profile public places would have
access to powerful databases brimming with sensitive personal information. FBI
records, individual addresses and travel patterns could all be incorporated
into the system to help raise red flags.

Credit card records could be a particularly illuminating indicator of
suspicious behavior, said Tom Klein, president of Fort Worth-based Sabre
Holdings Corp.'s airline reservations and emerging businesses units. "It is
much broader than how I booked a flight. There are things that will make lots
of people uncomfortable. But there are people who say that's where we need to
go."

The public may be more willing to give up some measure of privacy in exchange
for security, said Matt Yarbrough, a former federal prosecutor.

The FBI's Carnivore system for monitoring e-mail traffic over the Internet
stirred a huge controversy last year, said Mr. Yarbrough, who heads the
cyberlaw group in the Dallas office of Fish & Richardson PC. "For some reason,
everyone was upset about Carnivore a few months ago. Today, you could probably
get it through in a heartbeat."

Personal privacy

One member of the board said he was willing to subject himself to such scrutiny
if it helped make the country more secure.

"I kind of feel like if the FBI wants to follow me around, God bless them. I've
got nothing to hide," said Guy Hoffman, a Dallas-based partner at TL Ventures,
a venture capital firm.

But the majority shot back that such systems, perhaps tied to some form of
national identity card, could do more harm than good.

"You don't know enough about the FBI," said Anne K. Bingaman, chairwoman and
chief executive of Valor Telecommunications LLC in Irving.

The agency has had a long history of abusing authority through violations of
personal privacy, said Ms. Bingaman, a former antitrust chief with the U.S.
Department of Justice.

"It's one thing to have a card that says who you are. I don't think people
object to that. It's what the driver's license is," she said. "But tying it to
a database that has all kinds of information that is ostensibly for terrorism
but is accessible to thousands of law enforcement people permanently - we have
some pretty good reasons to feel threatened by that."

Constitutional issues

Americans' guarantees of civil liberties were put in place to protect
individuals from an invasive government, said Hasan Pirkul, dean of the
management school at the University of Texas at Dallas.

"The Constitution has not become obsolete because of a terrorist attack," he
said.

Another threat to the public comes from unauthorized access to the database.

>From mischievous teenagers across the planet to sophisticated organized crime
rings, computer hackers have breached systems that had once been considered
impregnable.

"I don't trust the hackers. Those guys can get into anything. Anything we design, they can break," said Mr. Shank of Ericsson.

Board members also worried that flawed data could wreak havoc on people's lives.

"Mistakes happen," said Laura Rippy, chief executive of Handango Inc. in Hurst,
which sells handheld and wireless equipment. "What if they mistake you for
someone and you're sitting in jail for a week?"

Physical security procedures may prove a better solution for reducing terrorism
than their high-tech counterparts, board members agreed.

"I still think - the low-tech thing - lock pilots in the cockpit if we're
worried about airplanes being used as bombs again," Ms. Bingaman said. "To me,
that's far more fail-safe than any of this identification or screening or the
rest of it."

Limits

High-tech screening wouldn't prevent an attack such as the Oklahoma City
bombing in 1995, board members said, because the tools were rudimentary and
authorities weren't seeking the plotters.

Technology isn't just defensive, said board member Shiek Shah. Surveillance
tools and advanced weaponry can "exterminate the breeding grounds of
terrorism," said Mr. Shah, co-chief executive of Akili, a Dallas firm that
integrates software and other technology for corporate customers.

"I agree, eradicate them, but part of the eradication is to wipe out the
breeding grounds in positive ways," said Leon Kappelman, director of the
Information Systems Research Center at the University of North Texas in Denton.

Evaluating the impact of the attacks on the telecommunications and computing
infrastructure of Wall Street, board members concluded that systems held up
relatively well.

Dr. Kappelman, a leading expert in the Year 2000 computer problem, said the
financial services industry's preparations for the millennium bug helped get
the markets running again. "A big part of Y2K, especially in those businesses,
as dealing with disaster recovery and business continuity," he said.


"Having those things in place made it very much possible to deal with this
faster."

The attacks should encourage businesses and governments to rethink their
technological vulnerabilities, said John Breen, vice president of consulting
services at SBC DataComm Inc., a division of SBC Communications Inc. of San
Antonio.


"Assess what you have learned over the last three weeks," Mr. Breen said.

"Analyze whether it's for your business or for your personal life, and then
act," he said. "As Americans, we act. And we need to act as best we can to try
and address these failures."

Technology will probably be just a piece of a broader response, board members
said.

"Maybe we looked at technology as the answer," Mr. Hoffman said. "Today we
recognize that technology is only part of the solution."

Coming Monday: The tech industry's new challenges.

First of two parts.
