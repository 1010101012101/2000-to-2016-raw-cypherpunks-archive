Respected Sir,

We are working in the field of drug deaddiction (any type) through the use of essence of Herbal Plants from last 5-6 years. We would like your hearty co-operation for drug deaddiction programme. FAQ about deaddiction is attached / available in deaddiction section of our website http://www.selfhelpgroup.inbox.as

Basically the medicine in essence form is obtained by getting the Sparigic Essence of non-poisonous multi herbs by Cohobation Method and treating - exposing this to particular phases of Sun & nature for about 12 months.
