Jesus H. Christ on a popsicle stick! Now that's a fine piece of psychobabble if
ever I heard any.  You really ought to spend some quality time with the MMPI and
the DSM-IVR instead of dismissing it as "chick stuff". Not only would your
insults be more to the point, youd also figure out what "normal people" have
to say about YOU.

Pot and kettle be damned, here you go, you beyond-good-and-evil Overman, you:


The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So-Called
Psychopathic Personality by Hervey Cleckley (Hardcover - November 1988)

***

Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) used the term insanity without delirium to describe
behaviour that was marked by complete remorselessness, but the modern concept
of "psychopathy" was put forward by Hervey Cleckley (1903-1984) in his classic
work The Mask of Sanity (1941). According to Cleckleys criteria a psychopath
is an intelligent person characterised by poverty of emotions, who has no sense
of shame, is superficially charming, is manipulative, who shows irresponsible
behaviour, and is inadequately motivated. Interspersed in Cleckley's vivid
clinical descriptions are phrases such as "shrewdness and agility of mind,"
"talks entertainingly," and "exceptional charm" (Hare, 1993, p. 27). Cleckley
also provides a striking interpretation of the meaning of the psychopath's
behaviour:

The [psychopath] is unfamiliar with the primary facts or data of what might be
called personal values and is altogether incapable of understanding such
matters. It is impossible for him to take even a slight interest in the tragedy
or joy or the striving of humanity as presented in serious literature or art.
He is also indifferent to all these matters in life itself. Beauty and
ugliness, except in a very superficial sense, goodness, evil, love, horror, and
humour have no actual meaning, no power to move him. He is, furthermore,
lacking in the ability to see that others are moved. It is as though he were
colour-blind, despite his sharp intelligence, to this aspect of human
existence. It cannot be explained to him because there is nothing in his orbit
of awareness that can bridge the gap with comparison. He can repeat the words
and say glibly that he understands, and there is no way for him to realize that
he does not understand (Cleckley, 1941, p. 90 quoted in Hare, 1993, pp. 27-28).

...The American Psychiatric Association's category of antisocial personality
disorder (introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Third Edition, 1980) was supposed to have covered psychopathy, but
because clinicians were not thought sufficiently competent to assess
personality traits the DSM definitions have concentrated on the antisocial and
criminal behaviours associated with the condition. This has blurred the
distinction between psychopaths and criminals, and of course most of the latter
are not psychopaths. Antisocial Personality Disorder (category 301.7) is
described in DSM-IV simply as "a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and
violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early
adolescence and continues into adulthood This pattern has also been referred
to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder" (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 645). This confusion of terminology is
especially damaging for research because whereas DSM-IV describes APD
as "associated with low socio-economic status" (1994, p. 647)psychopathy "seems
less likely to be associated with social disadvantage or adversity" (Rutter,
Giller & Hagell, 1998, p. 110).

Robert Hare has described his attempts to identify true psychopaths as a prison
psychologist in the early 1960s. Most of the personality "measures"
or "instruments" popular at that time, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory (MMPI), were questionnaires based on self-reporting. When
administered to psychopaths, who are expert at "impression management" (Hare,
1993, p. 30) these instruments are less than reliable. One of the inmates in
Hares research program even had a complete set of MMPI tests and
interpretation manuals and, for a fee, would advise fellow inmates on the
correct answers to show the steady improvement more likely to lead to parole.

...Hare decided to construct his own Psychopathy Checklist in order to have a
method of separating psychopaths from the rest of the prison population, and
this method is now used throughout the world. The Checklist highlights the key
emotional and interpersonal symptoms of psychopathy: psychopaths are said to be
glib and superficial; egocentric and grandiose; to lack remorse or guilt; to
lack empathy; to be deceitful and manipulative; and to have shallow emotions.

...while the non-psychopaths made the moral/conventional distinction, the
psychopaths did not; secondly, and in contrast with predictions, that
psychopaths treated conventional transgressions like moral transgressions
rather than treating moral transgressions like conventional transgressions; and
thirdly, and in line with predictions, that psychopaths were much less likely
to justify their items with reference to victims welfare (Blair & Morton,
1995, p. 20).

...What is most outstanding about psychopaths is that they appear extremely at
ease with themselves. They can be articulate, are often highly intelligent,
and are regularly described as "charming", and "convincing". Psychopathy is not
associated with low birth weight, obstetric complications, poor parenting,
poverty, early psychological trauma or adverse experiences, and indeed Robert
Hare remarks "I can find no convincing evidence that psychopathy is the direct
result of early social or environmental factors" (Hare, 1993, p. 170).

...psychopaths use psychotherapy sessions to develop their skills in
psychological manipulation, and because they see no need to change their
admirable personalities (Hare, 1993, pp. 192-206).
