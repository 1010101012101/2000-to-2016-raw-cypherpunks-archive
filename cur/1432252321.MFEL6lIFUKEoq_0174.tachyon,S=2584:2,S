   [1]cnet-declan writes "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been
   flying over Iraq and Afghanistan, but now the Bush administration
   wants to use them for [2]domestic surveillance. A top Homeland
   Security official told Congress today, according to this CNET News.com
   article, that: "We need additional technology to supplement manned
   aircraft surveillance and current ground assets to ensure more
   effective monitoring of United States territory." One county in North
   Carolina is already using UAVs to [3]monitor public gatherings. But
   what happens when lots of relatively dumb drones have to share
   airspace with aircraft carrying passengers? A pilot's association is
   [4]worried."
