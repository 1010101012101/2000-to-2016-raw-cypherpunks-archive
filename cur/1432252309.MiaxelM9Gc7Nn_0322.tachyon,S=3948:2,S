It's a false distinction. What it boils down to is two or more groups
taking up arms to control all groups. One can eulogize about ethics and
morality until the cows come home. Won't change the basic fact that any
such conclusions are not only arbitrary but transient. There is no
absolute right and wrong outside of human psychology. The American
colonist certainly qualified in the 'terrorist' department with their
burning of warehouses and physical assaults on British sympathisers. At
the same time they were sitting in various political offices and economic
posts.

To 'hate' is the issue, the scale is irrelevent. Stop the hate. Stop the
use of violence. Their failure does not justify yours.
