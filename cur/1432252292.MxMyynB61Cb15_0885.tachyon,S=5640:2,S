DEAR FRIEND, 

I AM MRS. SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC). I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. 

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS 
SOLOMON AND BASHER OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED TO SETTLED IN 
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER 
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO 
CHANGED MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER

FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW

HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE

MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO 
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND

CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM THIRTY MILLION 
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$30,000,000,00.) WITH A 
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE 
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY
RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE
THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY 
SON (SOLOMON) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE 
CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING 
THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED.
I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN 
MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND 
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT 
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH 
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY 
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN 
CONCLUSION, IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL 
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU 
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND 
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION 
FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE. 

BEST REGARDS, 

MRS M. SESE SEKO
