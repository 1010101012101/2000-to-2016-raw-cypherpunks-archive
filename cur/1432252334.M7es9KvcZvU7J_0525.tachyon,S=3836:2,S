Not this time. Some additional research says that the federal "Uniformed 
and Overseas Citizens Voting Act" requires states to take special 
procedures for voters who are in the military overseas or:

Tourists abroad during that time need not apply.

Further, state law anticipates this:

As soon as the remainder of the absentee ballots are printed, the 
supervisor shall provide an absentee ballot to each elector by whom a 
request for that ballot has been made by one of the following means:... By 
forwardable mail to voters who are entitled to vote by absentee ballot 
under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voting Act.
