Of course there is, the question is does one use the key logging to get
probable cause; or as the 4th requires probable cause to do the key
logging.

The current trend is to use surveillance technology to obtain 'probable
cause', this is in direct opposition to the letter and intent of the 4th.

Got a warrant, scan, search, collect all you want. Don't have a warrant
then leave people the hell alone.
