Why should I killfile fools like mattd and others?? its MORE FUN to
use  procmail and villification to accomplish what I wish to...
eventually the interlopers leave and the list gets back to
business in spite of agent gordon and his ilk. whats a matter?
Agent Gordon, CJ and bell are easy targets for threatening the shrub
 and mattd is NOT??? why dont you go supress his free speech rights also?
So much for your tax dollars at work...
