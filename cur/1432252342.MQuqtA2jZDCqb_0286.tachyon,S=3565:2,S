Acoustic Kitty

One of the benefits of going to school in the DC area is you get some
pretty neat professors. I am currently taking a class on the History of
American Spying taught by the Chief Historian of the CIA. This class is
full of all kinds of interesting tidbits. But this one was too good to
keep to myself. And seeing as how it was an operation inside DC it applies
to our site. (note: altho I am fairly certain this violates the edict that
the CIA can not operate on American soil - but we'll ignore that for right
now)

The operation was known as "Acoustic Kitty" - the CIA were having no luck
eavesdropping on the Soviet Compound on Wisconsin Avenue after an
extensive tunnel project had been blown by Soviet spy Robert Hanssen.
Eventually one group in the Agency noted that Soviet notables were
congregating around a park outside the compound. The group then launched
this plan.

It centered around a cat. A very special cyborg cat. Yes I did just say
cyborg cat. The CIA trained a cat, then surgically inserted an antenna
inside its tail while inside its chest they installed a power-source and a
microphone.

They let "Acoustic Kitty" out of their surveillance van, intending for it
to "stray" into the park and eavesdrop on the Soviets. But wouldn't you
know it - poor "Acoustic Kitty" got run over by a taxi cab on Wisconsin
Avenue his very first day on the job.

As if being mutilated by CIA surgeons and getting run-over weren't enough
of an insult to this poor cat - an agent dodged traffic on Wisconsin and
scooped the CIA technology out of "Acoustic Kitty's" remains.

You can read a little more about this in a redacted CIA memo here and in a
brief summary under Article 27

every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from
authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but
have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions
about them were not worth a brass farthing."
