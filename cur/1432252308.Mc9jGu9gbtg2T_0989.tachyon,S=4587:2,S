Note: I did not originate the title of this thread. I mention this 
because Certain Prosecutors have taken such things out of context and 
produced them in court documents as evidence that someone is planning 
to kill some judge, and as grounds for publishing the Social Security 
Numbers and home addresses of certain persons. I'd sue these 
criminals, except there would be no point. Hundreds of thousands in 
expenses, and in their rigged court rooms. Better to plot vengeance 
in other ways.

In Florida the Drug Army has seized million-dollar boats becaue a 
single marijuana roach (butt) was found in the seat cushions during a 
fishing expedition search. They sell these boats and exotic cars, or 
use them in their own operations. And they pocket some fraction of 
the cash they illegally seize.

A couple of Mexicans were driving across the southern U.S. from 
Georgia to Texas. They were stopped in one of the common "shake down" 
stretches of highway. Their savings from a year's worth of labor on a 
farm were "seized." No charges filed, no drugs found (not that this 
would justify seizing their cash), no trial. They eventually got most 
of their money back after their employer in Georgia, a white woman, 
spent her own money travelling to Texas, hiring lawyers, calling 
reporters, and arguing their case. In thousands of "civil forfeiture" 
cases we never hear about, because nobody wrote stories about it, the 
narcs and corrupt deputies simply pocket the proceeds.

Welcome to Amerika.

As for the title of this thread, a lot more than some judges need to 
be dealt with. Some prosecutors, some Marshal's Service folks, some 
cops. Hundreds of thousands, overall.
