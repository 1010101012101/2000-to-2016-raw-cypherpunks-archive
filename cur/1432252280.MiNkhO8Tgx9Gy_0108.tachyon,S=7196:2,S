Internet Terrorism

Dave Cummings writes: If any of you have involved any government 
authorities in any aspect of the past emails from the below person (aka: 
bryan sullivan?), please let FBI Special Agent Mike Wagoner at the San 
Diego FBI office (858-499-7736) know so that he can contact those agencies 
and integrate information and coordinate with them on any ongoing 
investigations -- the San Diego FBI has now opened an active investigation 
into the below email, and others of a threatening nature that seem of 
concern to them.

I've advised FBI Agent Wagoner that there was a posting a few months ago 
about the St Louis FBI office supposedly having contacted the individual; I 
also advised him that I reported the below email to the Army's Criminal 
Investigative Division and Department of Defense, in case "war crimes" 
might be involved. And, that my copy of the "Chad Luke" latter was faxed, as
requested by them, to Postal Inspectors (just in case, as some folks have 
speculated, the letters many of us received might possibly have actually 
been from bryan sullivan).

The FBI asked that I place my letter and envelope into a sealed plastic bag 
in case it might later be needed for examination for fingerprints and other 
tracings of evidence--if you still have your copy, you might want to do 
likewise?

If sullivan gets wind of this email, I imagine that there might soon be 
emails forthcoming from him (possibly disguised as another name/sender?) 
with disparaging remarks about me; but, though I strongly and 
wholeheartedly defend his right of free speech and right to voice his 
opinions, I feel that we all have a responsibility to report info of a 
possible criminal nature to
the authorities.

Again, so that the FBI has access to ALL info that might be being processed 
presently by other agencies, please advise FBI Agent Wagoner of anything 
you might have initiated--to email him, use sandiego@fbi.gov and make the 
subject "For Special Agent Mike Wagoner", or phone him at 858-499-7736.
