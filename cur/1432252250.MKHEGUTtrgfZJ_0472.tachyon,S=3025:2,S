This is often known as "collaborative filtering", and pops up in
systems like NoCeM and GroupLens.  What's cool is that you don't need
transitive trust or even poster reputations (anonymity without so much
vandalism!).  Just give the right reviewers the reputation "good/bad
judgment about which articles are worth reading"--and you can find
them by reviewing some articles yourself and measuring similarity of
answers.  If reviewers aren't willing to highly rate articles they
disagree with there's a danger of shutting out unpopular ideas (a
common complaint about /. moderators), and you need a critical mass of
people willing to rate most of a forum to get started (and it can't be
much more than an extra keystroke or two or they won't bother).
