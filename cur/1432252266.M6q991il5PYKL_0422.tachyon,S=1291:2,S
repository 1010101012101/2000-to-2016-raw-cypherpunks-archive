I was just reading Richard Clarke's book and the following quote (from Bill
Clinton) sort of stood out:

  "I want to announce new airline security measures while I'm at Kennedy.  So
  develop some" (p.123).

OK, I assume this way of developing airline security measures comes as no
surprise to anyone on this list, but it's interesting to hear it confirmed
from the highest levels.
