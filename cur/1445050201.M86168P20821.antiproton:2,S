If anyone knows anything about, or can recommend any sources on, the
cypherpunk equivalents (and related missions) in the Office of Strategic
Services (OSS - the WW2 predecessor to CIG which basically became CIA in
'47) please let me know.

To be relevant to my research, it needs to be OSS related. Venona, Enigma
et al are interesting and historically relevant, but right now my focus is
limited to OSS.

So far, the most interesting thing I've come across is the Tizard Mission
by Stephen Phelps... unfortunately for me, it's more Britain and navy
oriented than OSS, and the surveillance issues are more aerial/naval than
cypherpunk-y. Since it's interesting nonetheless, I figured I'd share the
link and summary along with my request for help.
