punk <> anarchy

'punk' actually means 'anti-establishment' and 'activist' in viewpoint.
anti-establishment/activist <> anarchy either.

The black leather and anarchy crap didn't 'happen' on the punk scene until
the late 70's and early 80's. In particular the club scene in England
(those crazy Brits and their unemployment, crank & horse).

When punk really took off (it began in the 60's w/ folks like Iggy Pop
and the Stooges) in the early 70's (New York Dolls, Germs, etc.) it was a
direct result of the crappy music (if only every Grease soundtrack would
self-implode...here's hoping). It was intended to be a return to the
'roots' of rock and roll and to attempt to escape from the large record
companies and their contracts. It fathered the current 'indy' music scene.

It's also interesting that this is when the 'industrial' music genre began
with bands like Throbbing Gristle (ie Genesis P. Orridge) and Einsturzende
Neubauten (Go Blixa!!! - You can't build without destroying). At one point
P. Orridge was looking to engineer/produce Suzie and the Banshee's first
album, Billy Idol told here to stay away from those crazies...
