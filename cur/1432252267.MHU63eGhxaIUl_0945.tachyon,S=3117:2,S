Lots of machines don't accept pings anymore,
either for security reasons or whatever.
That's independent of whether those names accept email,
or whether you can find MX records for them.
In particular, most big ISPs have multiple machines
accepting mail; if you wanted to ping, you'd have to try
box1.bigisp.com, box2.bigisp.com, box3.bigisp.com, ...

Pipeline was in the big-ISP business, and I suspect
they've been eaten enough times that pipeline is just
an alias on a big email server farm.
