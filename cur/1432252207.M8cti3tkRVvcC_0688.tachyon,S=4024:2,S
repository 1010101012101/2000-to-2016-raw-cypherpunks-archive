Actually, a person or business can "refuse to serve" on nearly any basis 
except race or gender or a few other politically-correct things. "Tim's 
Surf Shop" can choose not to wax the board of Reese, for whatever reason 
it chooses.

This is why I said in an earlier piece that the Godfrey/Oden cases 
should not be used to further the notion of a "right to travel" (if that 
"right" is construed as trampling on the rights of Southwest, United, 
Tim's Surf Shop, etc. to pick and choose their customers).

The focus should be on these things:

-- the presence of soldiers and cops in inspection points, with way too 
much lattitude to inspect bags, pull people out of line, question their 
reading materials, etc.

-- the requirement that ID be presented, which has very little to do 
with airline security (for reasons Cypherpunks are very familiar with)

-- the general headlong rush into police state measures, with the 
sheeple saying "I want to feel safer. I have nothing to hide. Please, 
officer, take away my rights! Please, soldiers, check what we are 
reading! I want _more_ rights taken away!!"

--Tim May, Occupied America
"They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety 
deserve neither liberty nor safety." -- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.
