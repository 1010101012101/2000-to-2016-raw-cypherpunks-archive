It was in the news today that RIAA is switching strategies
away from suing individuals toward pressuring ISPs.
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122966038836021137.html

In USA the EFF might help with legal defense if you are sued or charged,
but that doesnt preserve your server or internet connection if your ISP just cuts you off.
Read your Terms and Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy and switch providers if necessary.
Help lobby against big government and fascist (corporate+police/military) states, etc.
Encourage everyone to use Free Software and strong encryption, and produce works licensed CC-by-sa.
What else can we do?

Nevertheless, some Tor operators (myself included) do so for specific reasons.
We might not help at all if we could not choose our exit policies.
Some who don't want to deal with complaints choose to run middle nodes.
I'm grateful for every byte of bandwidth.
