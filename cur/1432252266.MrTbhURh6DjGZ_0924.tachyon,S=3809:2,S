Indeed! I also employ one additional measure, which, admittedly, may not  
be to everyone's taste - I have all my  
browser/system/email/everything-else-you-care-to-name root certificate  
store wiped out clean!

If I have to access a specific (https) site or access a new email account 
(by using secure pop/starttls, secure smtp or secure imap) I tend to get 
the site's certificate well in advance via other means (not through tor, 
obviously) and store it manually on my system for use by these programs. 
That way, I know that if the "certificate unrecognised" error pops up there 
is either 1) a new site I have never accessed before (most likely); or 2) 
someone is trying to use spoof certificates.

The latter doesn't occur very often, though I've had this on a number of  
(rare) occasions when a tor exit node for example (prior to being banned  
in my torrc file and banished forever) tries to pretend to be my email  
server and gets caught out with its pants down, quite literally... This  
measure also prevents the likes of hacked/rogue CA's out there leaking  
certificates to people/organisations who use them for various  
criminal/unsavoury purposes.
