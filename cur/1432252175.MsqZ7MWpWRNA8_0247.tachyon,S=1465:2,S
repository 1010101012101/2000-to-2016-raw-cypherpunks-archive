  Man With Chain Saw Allowed to Enter U.S.

  On April 25, Gregory Despres arrived at the U.S.-Canadian border crossing at
  Calais, Maine, carrying a homemade sword, a hatchet, a knife, brass knuckles
  and a chain saw stained with what appeared to be blood. U.S. customs agents
  confiscated the weapons and fingerprinted Despres. Then they let him into
  the United States.

I guess he wasn't on the (possibly-a-)terrorist watchlist so they waved him
through.

Peter.
