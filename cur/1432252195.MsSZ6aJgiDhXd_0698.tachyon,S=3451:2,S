It's not a zero-sum game for the insurance companies. Most insurance
companies make  quite a bit of money investing premiums.

In addition, they spread the risk. They are betting that more people will
stay well than get sick.

And I'm not talking about people "engaging in risky behavior". I'm talking
about someone who has a genetic predisposition for a disease THAT THEY HAVE
NO ABILITY TO MITIGATE.

I have no problem charging someone who smokes, takes drugs, or over eats.
THEY HAVE A CHOICE.

I am also not saying that Mr. Insurance CEO can only make $XXX in profit.
I'm sure they can make a profit.

In fact they are making profits right now WITHOUT using genetic testing.
