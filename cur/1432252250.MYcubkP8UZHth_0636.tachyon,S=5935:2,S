QUEERS ARE REVOLTING!  And you can join us! 
(english)
by The Love Revolution
Heterosexism CAN BE CURED!
Why Indeed?
Gender and Race form the foundation of our current oppression under the 
white heterosexual Christian regime in the United States.
Until issues of sexuality and gender are included in the fight for peace, 
there will be no peace.
As long as heterosexual men feel that they must reign supreme in all 
political affairs, there will be no peace.
As long as gays, lesbians, intersexuals, transgendered and bisexual people 
continue to be harassed, imprisoned, and killed simply for living their 
lives honestly, there will be no peace.
And when you are ready to hide your heterosexuality in the closet, (no 
kissing your girlfriends at the protest rallies,) then we will talk about 
me stopping my visibility as a gay man.
Gays and lesbians for Peace organizations.

Want to learn more about Heterosexism and how it affects our culture?

A few questions to ponder:
1. What do you think caused your heterosexuality?
2.  When and how did you first decide you were a heterosexual?
3.  Is it possible your heterosexuality is just a phase you may grow out of?
4.  Could it be that your heterosexuality stems from a neurotic fear of 
others of the same sex?
5.  If you've never slept with a person of the same sex, how can you be 
sure you wouldn't prefer that?
6.  To whom have you disclosed your heterosexual tendencies? How did they 
react?
7.  Why do heterosexuals feel compelled to seduce others into their lifestyle?
8.  Why do you insist on flaunting your heterosexuality? Can't you just be 
what you are and keep it quiet?
9.  Would you want your children to be heterosexual, knowing the problems 
they'd face?
10. A disproportionate majority of child molesters are heterosexual 
men.  Do you consider it safe to expose children to heterosexual male 
teachers, pediatricians, priests, or scoutmasters?
11. With all the societal support for marriage, the divorce rate is 
spiraling.  Why are there so few stable relationships among heterosexuals?
12. Why do heterosexuals place so much emphasis on sex?
13. Considering the menace of overpopulation, how could the human race 
survive if everyone were heterosexual?
14. Could you trust a heterosexual therapist to be objective?  Don't you 
fear s/he might be inclined to influence you in the direction of her/his 
own leanings?
15. Heterosexuals are notorious for assigning themselves and one another 
rigid, stereotyped sex roles.  Why must you cling to such unhealthy 
role-playing?
16. With the sexually segregated living conditions of military life, isn't 
heterosexuality incompatible with military service?
17. How can you enjoy an emotionally fulfilling experience with a person of 
the other sex when there are such vast differences between you?  How can a 
man know what pleases a woman sexually or vice-versa?
18. Shouldn't you ask your far-out straight cohorts, like skinheads and 
born-agains, to keep quiet?  Wouldn't that improve your image? 19. Why are 
heterosexuals so promiscuous?
20. Why do you attribute heterosexuality to so many famous lesbian and gay 
people?  Is it to justify your own heterosexuality?
21. How can you hope to actualize your God-given homosexual potential if 
you limit yourself to exclusive, compulsive heterosexuality?
22. There seem to be very few happy heterosexuals.  Techniques have been 
developed that might enable you to change if you really want to.  After 
all, you never deliberately chose to be a heterosexual, did you?  Have you 
considered aversion therapy or Heterosexuals Anonymous?
