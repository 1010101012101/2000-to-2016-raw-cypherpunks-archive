Smileys are almost never needed. Those who miss irony don't deserve 
smileys and emoticons for hints.

As for packing iron, of course I do. Various weapons bought 
untraceably, long before the current bans. I don't recognize the gun 
laws which violate the Second Amendment. John Ross had it right.

I even rigged a flame thrower a while back. I keep it ready to go and 
practice with it occasionally. Seeing some ninja thugs running around 
in flames would be a wonderful sight to behold, I think..screaming for 
their mommas as their flesh bubbles and chars.

My perimeter alarms I don't discuss. And whether I have set booby traps 
and claymores is something I won't discuss, either.

I've had Feds threaten me, I've had them publish my Social Security 
Number (a major sin, in my opinion, and worth of extreme retribution, 
when the time is right). They know I am their enemy and I know they are 
my enemy.

They seek to disarm us, to generate so many laws that we are all 
lawbreakers (even them, but they rarely prosecute members of their own 
clan), and to force everyone into plea bargains or face draconian, 
mandatory sentencing, illegal combatant laws.
