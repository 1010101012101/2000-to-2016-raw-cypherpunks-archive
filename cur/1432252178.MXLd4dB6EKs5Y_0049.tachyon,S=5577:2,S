Apologies for the anonymous remailer. My mail setup is a little confused
at the moment, but you can reply to me at wolf@priori.net as always.

The answer is "G".

Biting the apple is stupid.  TANSTAAFL is rarely false under any
circumstance, and absolutely never false when it is a woman offering
gifts.  If that apple isn't poisoned or rotten, it's at least going to
cost you more than it is worth. What do you want an apple for anyway? Do
you need this apple? Are you starving? There might be certain
circumstances where the apple is worth more to you than your continued
well-being and sanity, but these would be rare. Usually you are better off
dead. One is never advised to enter into contract with the devil simply
because Mephistopheles appears in your living room. Be sure to have a damn
good reason if you accept the apple, and be aware that this isn't a gift.
It's a strategic barter for an exchange of goods or services unknown.

> (b) you take the woman.

"Take" is ambiguous, but this can be interpreted as "advance the
relationship with the woman past that of "stranger met in a passing
encounter in the woods". This is a bad idea. Generally, one should avoid
all relationships with women if it can be helped. The cost/benefit ratio
is weighted heavily against them.

Beauty is a flawed idea, and since beauty is indeed in the eye of the
beholder, it is much more economical for you to consider the mundane
beautiful. That way you won't be tempted by such things.

And nothing a woman says can ever be trusted, *especially* one who is
naked. Naked women always lie.

> (c) you run away.

At first glance, this may appear to be the right thing to do. However,
running away will make the woman more determined to ruin your life. A
better option would be to back away very slowly, and hope she doesn't
follow. If that fails, look for a big stick, and knock her unconscious,
then run away.
