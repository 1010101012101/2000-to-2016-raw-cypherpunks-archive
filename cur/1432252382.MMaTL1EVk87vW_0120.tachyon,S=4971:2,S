I don't follow the other list you mentioned, so I don't know what the 
actual problem to solve is - my guess is that this is an anti-bot 
protection measure, intended to make sure that only human participants can 
engage in a conversation.

If that's the problem - or if it's similar - you'll also need to make the 
puzzle difficult enough that
it's hard to brute-force or solve statistically - let's say you provide the 
other party with 20 images,
19 cats and 1 dog, and ask them to identify the dog.

What keeps a bot from answering the question 20 times? Let's assume the 
first arms-race countermeasure prevents answering the question more than 
once by generating puzzles on-the-fly from known cat and dog images - so 
the bot just picks an answer randomly, and keeps doing that until they hit.

Can God create a rock so big he can't lift it?

I think you're barking up the wrong tree, thinking about "known algorithms" 
and such - just like with crypto, the real way in isn't to attack the 
strong front door, but to just go around it.

This sounds like maybe it's essentially a credentialling/ID problem, where 
you're generating credentials on the fly based on a short-form Turing test. 
Can you restate the problem so that instead of a Turing test it's a more 
familiar multi-channel authentication process? (e.g., require new 
participants to have "introductions" from existing participants, track 
introductions, and remove the access for accounts found to be bots, or 
found to have introduced bots .. or similar.)
