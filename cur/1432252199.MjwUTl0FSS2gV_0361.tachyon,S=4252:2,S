An arab asking for blueprints right now is on par with

FBI monitoring suspicious
blueprint requests

http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/10/10/rec.fbi.buildings/index.html

                  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI is asking architects
                  and building engineers across the country to report
any
                  suspicious requests for building plans, especially for
                  federal buildings and projects, according to two
industry
                  groups. 

                  Since Sept. 11, a number of design and engineering
firms
                  have contacted their professional organizations about
recent
                  or past "unusual" requests for blueprints. These
requests
                  came both before and after the attacks. 

                  According to Phil Simon, a spokesman for the American
                  Institute of Architects, the requests included plans
for
                  structures such as airport terminals and towers,
federal
                  office buildings, parking garages and museums. 

                  Simon would not characterize the
                  number of these requests but said the
                  subjects of the requests, and the
                  details asked for, raised some
                  concerns. 

                  The American Institute of Architects
                  and the National Society of
                  Professional Engineers reported their
                  concerns to the FBI. The groups then
                  sent a joint letter to their members,
                  saying "The FBI is advising us to
                  heighten our awareness." 

                  CNN Radio obtained a copy of that
                  letter, sent in the past few days,
                  asking architects and engineers to
                  notify the nearest FBI bureau field
                  office of any unusual requests. 

                  An AIA official said there may be
                  nothing sinister about the blueprint
                  requests. Often students ask for
                  blueprints as part of their studies.
