Hold on while I unslime myself from
that barrage of Choatian Crap.

Boundary Blockhead Brett Benson, a 73% vote winning Republican
elected along with the Bush-ster.

http://foxnews.com/story/0,2933,27300,00.html  [snipped]
#
#    Boundary County Prosecutor Brett Benson announced Thursday he 
#    will dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge filed by his 
#    [Republican] predecessor. He said it was unlikely the state
#    could prove the case and too much time had passed.

I guess it's okay to shoot at the back of someone going through
a door of a wooden shack containing women and children.

To kill.

Timothy McVeigh, among others (i.e. Congressional hearings),
did indeed force the U.S. government to reconsider its
confrontational ways.

Let us remember this BATF/FBI operation once more.

The U.S. Department of Justice...

----

Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge.

Persisting, a BATF informant persuaded Weaver, a DECORATED GREEN BERET
VETERAN of Vietnam with NO CRIMINAL RECORD, to sell him two shotguns,
but insisted that Weaver saw the barrels off one-quarter inch short of
the legal limit.

Monitoring him, they knew Mr. Weaver needed money for his family.

Why did the government target Mr. Weaver?

Blackmail.

One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on political organizations.

They wanted to use him to infiltrate white supremacists groups for the
government. Or face prosecution.

When Weaver refused, he was indicted on guns charges. He was sent two
conflicting court appearance dates. He became paranoid the Government
was out to get him, so he didn't show up. [He was eventually acquitted
of all charges except the original not showing up in court!]

To justify a militaristic retaliation, BATF agents lied to the U.S.
attorney's office. BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record
and that he was a suspect in several bank robberies.

Both charges were fabrications, even according to BATF Director John Magaw,
who admitted the accusations were "inexcusable" in testimony before Congress.

THREE HUNDRED armed federal agents conducted a siege of the Weavers' mountain
home, first killing Randy Weaver's dog, then his son, then his wife.

A law enforcement wilding.

*
*   The Marshals, wearing camouflage and carrying silenced machine guns, did
*   not identify themselves or their purpose, but they did shoot one of the
*   dogs. Sammy Weaver, fourteen-years-old, returned fire, and was promptly
*   shot by a Marshal.
*
*   Sammy turned and fled, with his nearly severed arm flopping as he ran.
*
*   Sammy was promptly shot dead in the back.


An FBI sniper, Lon T. Horiuchi, testified he could hit a quarter at 200 yards.

*
*   An FBI psychological profile, prepared before the attack, called Vicki
*   Weaver the "dominant member" of the family, thus implying that if she
*   were "neutralized" everyone else might surrender.

Horiuchi shot Weaver's wife in the head while she held her baby.

Her head exploded.

Her dead body was laid out on the cabin floor, covered with a blanket:

*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*
*   During the next week, "the FBI used megaphones to taunt the family.
*   'Good Morning Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for breakfast. What did
*   you have?'" asked the FBI agents in at least one exchange.
*
*   Weaver's daughter, Sarah, 16, said the baby, Elisheba, was often
*   crying for her mother's milk when the FBI messages were heard.

The Justice Department's own report recommended criminal prosecution of
federal agents; the surviving Weavers won $3.1 million in civil damages
from U.S. taxpayers.

Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
Louis Freeh, Director of the FBI, took no serious action.

Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director.

*   "Documents Were Destroyed as FBI Resisted Siege Investigation, Report Says"
*   By David Johnston, July 16, 1995
*
*   Mr. Pott's former subordinate Michael Kahoe admitted he destroyed key
*   documents on the Ruby Ridge assault. The Justice department reports
*   documents were destroyed and missing. "We are troubled by the apparent
*   lack of a system to preserve such critical records."
*
*   The Justice Department, in a March 18, 1993 memo stated, "the FBI's
*   intransigence appears to EMANATE from Larry Potts level OR ABOVE."

Larry Potts was a buddy of Louis Freeh. Within the FBI, these special
people are called "FOL" - Friends of Louie. [NYT 5/11/97]

Janet Reno (who had veto power over the promotion) testified what happened
at Ruby Ridge wasn't enough to cause her to veto the promotion, foreshadowing
her actions at Waco.

After two months, controversy (as opposed to events) over Potts' role in
Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh to remove him from the position, to politically
cover his own tush.

Potts and four other top FBI officials have been suspended while a federal
criminal probe investigates the destruction of documents related to the
incident.

A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted.

The Federal government subsequently named after a U.S. Marshal who was
killed, but who also shot Randy Weaver's son dead in the back: a new
Marshals training center.

The Federal government's behavior in the incident can only be described as
sickening: targeting a citizen (a veteran, no less) who committed no crime
AND EVEN HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD (but had politically incorrect views) for
blackmail, then acting vengefully when he wouldn't act as their rat fink.

Shoot-to-kill. Sniper team.  Military fatigues.

A terrorizing organization: how else to explain the cruel cruel taunting.

A terrorist organization by virtue of shoot-to-kill orders.
