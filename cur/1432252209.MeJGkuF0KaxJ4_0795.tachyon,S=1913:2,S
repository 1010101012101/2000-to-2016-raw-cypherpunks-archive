An interesting countermeasure would be releasing the sources to the CDR/RW
drives' firmware, and possibly the related SDKs. This could stir the CD
drive market in an interesting way - "make your own firmware upgrade"
brings interesting options. (I'd surely want such drive.) Could have
interesting applications, including reading/writing of heavily damaged and
nonstandard media, and anything other that you can get by direct access
to the laser and the motors of the drive.

More later. Awfully busy now.
