in a collapse the only thing worth shit is food and water; you can can

guns and brute gangs as catalyst for fungible trade is left as an
exercise for the reader.  note that death is a perfectly acceptable
payment for either party :)

... in any case, i always preferred the bifurcated breakdown in Battle
Angel Alita for my vision of futuristic deconstruction ... *grin*
