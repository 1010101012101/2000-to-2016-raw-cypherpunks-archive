THE DIRECTOR 

 WAZIRI AHMED ESQ. 
AHMED & ASSOCIATES 
BOOK SHOP BUILDING, 
11TH FLOOR 23 BROAD STREET, 
LAGOS - NIGERIA 
fax 234 1 7596610 

SIR, 

I AM WAZIRI AHMED ESQ (SAN) SENIOR PARTNER OF 
AHMED & ASSOCIATES LAW CHAMBERS, A 
LAWYER/ATTORNEY TO HAMZA AL MUSTAPHA WHO 
WAS THE FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER TO THE 
MILITARY DICTATOR OF NIGERIA, GENERAL SANI 
ABACHA. THE LATE GENERAL SANI ABACHA DIED 
UNEXPECTEDLY ON THE 8TH OF JUNE 1998. HIS 
COLLEAGUES IN THE ARMY POISONED HIM IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VILLA (ASOROCK) BECAUSE HE RULED 
NIGERIA WITH AN IRON HAND AND HE DID NOT WANT 
DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY. 

WITH THE DEATH OF THE DICTATOR, ELECTIONS WERE 
HELD IN THE COUNTRY AND A CIVILIAN 
ADMINISTRATION WAS SWORN INTO POWER. WITH THE 
ADVENT OF THE NEW CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION, A 
DECISION WAS TAKEN BY THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA 
TO PROBE AND PROSECUTE ALL MILITARY OFFICERS 
THAT SERVED IN THE LAST MILITARY REGIME OF THE 
LATE GENERAL SANI ABACHA. MY CLIENT, MAJOR 
HAMZA AL MUSTAPHA WAS SINGLED OUT BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY AS AN ARMY OFFICER THAT 
MUST BE PUNISHED BECAUSE OF HIS CLOSENESS TO THE 
LATE DICTATOR AND GROSS HUMAN RIGHT ABUSES ON 
THE CITIZENS OF NIGERIA. MY CLIENT AND I WERE BEST 
OF FRIENDS AND HE SHARED HIS SECRETS WITH ME. 

THE FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER TO THE LATE 
HEAD OF STATE MAJOR HAMZA AL MUSTAPHA HAD 
PRIVATE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE WORTH 100 MILLION 
UNITED STATES DOLLARS AROUND THE WORLD. 
PRESENTLY HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY AND IS PRESENTLY IN 
PRISON WAITING TO BE TAKEN TO COURT ON CHARGES 
OF GROSS HUMAN RIGHT ABUSES ON THE CITIZENS OF 
NIGERIA. I WAS DIRECTLY INFORMED BY MY CONTACTS 
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA, THAT HE WILL BE 
CONVICTED BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION AS THE FORMER 
CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER TO THE LATE DICTATOR. 

SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT 
ARRESTED MY CLIENT, HE ENTRUSTED TO ME THE SUM 
OF TWENTY -SIX MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (us$26,400,000.00) FOR 
SAFEKEEPING. THIS AMOUNT WAS TO BE SENT TO HIS 
MISTRESS IN LEBANON TO LAUNDER FOR HIM. 

I HAVE SINCE HAD THIS AMOUNT WITH ME STASHED 
AWAY A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY IN NIGERIA. I 
CANNOT SEND THIS MONEY TO MY CLEINT'S MISTRESS 
ANY MORE BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION OF THINGS 
OVER HERE. AS A RESULT OF THIS I HAVE BEEN 
MANDATED BY MY CLIENT TO SOLICIT FOR A PARTNER 
ABROAD WHO IS WILLING AND READY TO ASSIST IN 
RECEIVING THE $26.4 MILLION. THEREFORE, I NEED YOUR 
ASSISTANCE IN MOVING AND SECURING THIS MONEY IN 
YOUR ACCOUNT ABROAD. YOU WILL BE ADEQUATELY 
COMPENSATED WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL SUM FOR YOUR 
ASSISTANCE AND CO-OPERATION WITH ME TO MOVE 
THIS FUNDS OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

I INTEND TO SAFEGUARD AND INVEST THIS AMOUNT OF 
MONEY ABROAD WITH A RELIABLE FOREIGN BUSINESS 
PARTNER SO THAT WE CAN INVEST THE FUNDS IN REAL 
ESTATE BUSINESS OR ANY VIABLE BUSINESS IN YOUR 
COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY I AM SOLICITING YOUR 
ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION AS REGARDS THIS 
BUSINESS. ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED 
WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE TO RECEIVE THE 
MONEY IN CASH DEPENDING ON WHERE IS CONVENIENT 
FOR YOU. 

PLEASE INDICATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST US. 

I AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU VERY SOON. 

BEST REGARDS, 
WAZIRI AHMED
