He's talking about how to *bootstrap into society* an artifact wit fax-effect
problems ---ie, which must be present at both ends to work -phones, faxes,
Navajo, 
protocols..

Theodore Hogg has done work on phase changes in topological (network)
systems --like
percolation in rocks, and other network effects.  At some level of
porosity, a body of rock becomes much more permeable, because
the pores often interconnect.  I can't help but think this relevent.

In any case, its clear you need a perceived benefit, probably expressable
in dollars (but maybe reputation), for early-adopters to 'seed' the
population.

But you can't seed if you don't have something to deploy, slow and
expensive though it may be at first.
