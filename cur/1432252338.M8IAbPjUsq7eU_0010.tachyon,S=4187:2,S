Encryption cores ramp for pervasive security

while looking at another article (as noted in Slashdot) in the same issue
about Rice Univ. undergrad Adam Stubblefield breaking WEP while interning
at AT&T Labs.

AES in the chips:
http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20010809S0046

couple of quotes:

With subtle distinctions, intellectual-property (IP) core vendors are
readying implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
security algorithm.
The vendors, established and startup, are banking on applications from
miniature wireless devices to massively parallel Web servers to support
the rapid and pervasive deployment of encryption-enabled devices and
systems.

The plethora of available AES solutions "is not particularly surprising,"
said Duncan Kitchin, product architect in the wireless LAN operation at
Intel Corp. (Hillsboro, Ore.). "After all, the whole point of choosing AES
was that it was pretty efficient in software, and easily implementable in
hardware," he said. "It's perfectly possible - it's just a matter of doing
it."
AES - which uses the Rijndael algorithm - was chosen by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to replace the highly popular
but less-efficient data encryption standard (DES). It's the efficiency of
AES and its stronger encryption overall that makes it attractive across a
wide swath of applications.
