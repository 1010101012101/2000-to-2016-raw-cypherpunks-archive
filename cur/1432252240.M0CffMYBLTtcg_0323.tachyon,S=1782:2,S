Incidentally, this is not true for SRV records.  In some ways, SRV is 
like MX, but it does a lot more.  One of the new features is that you 
can specify a port.  Unfortunately SRV is not widely used as yet.

This may have positive implications for privacy, and negative 
implications for firewalls that do egress filtering.
