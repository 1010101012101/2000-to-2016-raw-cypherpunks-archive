Camera in shower 'not indecent'
By Lee Glendinning
August 30 2002
A man who secretly set up a video camera in his bathroom and recorded his 
flatmate showering and using the toilet escaped conviction yesterday.
The decision, handed down in the Downing Centre Local Court, opens the way 
for people to disguise cameras and film others on their own property.
Richard Palmer, 47, a former company director, was charged with committing 
an act of indecency after he made a full confession.
The taping was discovered when his flatmate put a tape into the video 
recorder and saw herself naked in the shower and using the toilet.
According to a police statement of facts tendered to the court, nine other 
videos were confiscated from Mr Palmer's unit.
Between January 25 and March 25 this year, Mr Palmer secretly filmed his 
flatmate and other women in various states of undress, the court heard.
Prosecutor Sergeant Pat Huolohan said Mr Palmer's actions were an outrage 
against community standards and decency. "The victim had a right to know 
her own private actions were being recorded on video for the sexual 
gratification of the defendant."
In his judgement yesterday, magistrate Daniel Reiss found there was not 
enough evidence to suggest Mr Palmer committed the act of indecency 
"towards" his flatmate. Rather, it appeared the taping was for his own 
sexual gratification and as a challenge to see whether he could record 
someone without their consent.
The prosecution plans to appeal.
