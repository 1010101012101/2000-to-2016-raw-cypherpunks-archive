In the interest of helping organizations attending the ITSA Security Day
conference establish a best practices model of computer security policy,
e-TechServices.com will be sponsoring a PGP Key-signing party.

The PGP key-signing party held during the ITSA Security Day on Wednesday,
September 26th, 2001 from 12:15pm - 12:45pm at the e-TechServices.com
table at the Retiz Union in Gainesville, Florida.

Full details at:

http://www.e-techservices.com/events/key_signing_party.html

What's a key-signing party?

A key-signing party is a get-together with PGP users for the purpose of
meeting other PGP users and signing each other's keys. This helps to
extend the "web of trust" to a great degree. Also, it sometimes serves as
a forum to discuss strong cryptography, computer security, and related
issues.


Required Items?

1. Physical attendance
2. Positive picture ID
3. A printout of your PGP key's fingerprint information
4. A pen/pencil or whatever you'd like to write with


Why should I use PGP?

You should use PGP, in order to protect your business and personal emails
from being read by individuals or entities other than your intended
recipient(s). You should also use PGP in order to protect against the
forgery or alteration of official communications from your organization.
PGP, when used correctly, can provide message privacy, message integrity,
message authentication, and to some degree non-repudibility.


OK. What are some good applications of PGP?

Protection of email traffic of a sensitive nature, such as the
coordination of response to ongoing security incidents, requests for DNS
modifications, the exchange of passwords, requests for networking changes,
and exchange of sensitive personal information like SSNs. At the very
least, it would be useful to have all such messages signed, so the
recipients could be sure that the notes were not forged. PGP can also be
used to provide the same protection in the area of computer software
distribution. For example PGP can be used in software distribution where
security is critical, such as in the distribution of computer security
patches or other security related software updates.


Why should I participate in the ITSA Day keysigning party?

The formation of a robust web of trust with a deep level of
interconnectivity is the foundation for the security and utility of PGP.
Participating in the key signing event will allow you to become integrated
into the web of trust and thereby place your organization and yourself in
a position to enjoy the benefits of the PGP technology. Participation will
also help to promote the use of PGP and reinforce people currently using
PGP resulting in a more safe and secure computing environment for us all.
The more people who use PGP, the stronger PGP becomes.

Gainesville is available at:

Please, forward this note to anyone who may be interested in attending.
Also, please fee free to contact me for personal assistance with key
generation or additional information on participating.
