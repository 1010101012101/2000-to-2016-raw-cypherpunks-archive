My own differences with Tim aside, what proof do you have that Tim
drives past Nazi encampments?  Decry his "statistics abuse" while an
equally underhanded conjecture emerges from your addled backside?

Defending racism?  Please show where the defendants in the lawsuit
were shown to possess such an implement.  It wasn't mentioned in
this thread, nor do
http://www.oregonlive.com/news/99/01/st012717.html or other, similar
stories cover this little factoid.  I remember reading about this
lawsuit when the story first broke, this is the first I've heard that
a loaded, recently fired weapon was found in the Keenan vehicle.

Great Scott!!!  The loaded, recently fired weapon wasn't an SKS,
possibly resembling the one fired at the Keenan vehicle, was it?

I've heard academia could give them a good run for their money.
