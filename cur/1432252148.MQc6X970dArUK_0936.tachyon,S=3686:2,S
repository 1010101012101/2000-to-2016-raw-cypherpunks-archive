This is naive. Nobody here of any substance has argued "the market is
always right" or anything of the sort. Anyone remember the Edsel? The
dot com crash? It is, however, more likely to produce desirable
effects than state-provided goods and services are.

The reason cypherpunkish types are more concerned about government
abuses than perceived corporate abuses is that one can switch grocery
stores if you don't like their privacy policy, but you don't have that
choice when dealing with the U.S. government.
