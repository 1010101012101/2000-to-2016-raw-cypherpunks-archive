Please in-line your text.

Your message above appears as an attachment (only, not just a digital 
signature). Sometimes Eudora Pro, a common e-mail program, is able to 
open such messages, sometimes not. In your particular case, for 
whatever reasons, attempting to open your attachment crashes my 
program. I tried three times, then gave up.

Folks, this increase in MIME attachments is getting out of hand. 
People are reading this list on a variety of machines, from PDAs to 
Amigas to VT100s to Unix boxes to Windows.

I am filtering Corrain's stuff into my trash file until someone 
(else) tells me his stuff is no longer MIME-encrusted.
