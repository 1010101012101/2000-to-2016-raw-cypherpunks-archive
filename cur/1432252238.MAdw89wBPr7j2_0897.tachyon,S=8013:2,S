you've never sewed a stitch, you now can sew like a pro.
<P>
This cordless sewing machine can be used indoors or outside.  Handy Stitch
has the same power as larger, more expensive machines, at a low price that
anyone can afford.  It's great for quick repairs or jobs that conventional
desktop machines can't handle, like sewing curtains while on the rod, or
mending a torn pocket without having to remove your pants.
<P>
