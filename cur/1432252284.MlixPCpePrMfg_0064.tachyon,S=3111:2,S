There are two possible approaches to dealing with white (& black) 
listings:

(1) The repeater is a dumb one, and doesn't care, each node on the CDR is 
free to implement their own local rules and white/blacklists;

(2) Any one whitelist is agreed to be valid for all nodes: as you point 
out, there will need to be some way to recognize that.

Option 1 is simple to implement, but I don't know if it's consistent with 
the goals of sharing information freely amongst CDR subscribers. Option 2 
is, obviously, much harder to design.

OK: if we want to design redundancy in all possible dimensions (above the 
threat model I believe, but still a good practice to have no single point 
of failure... We have a repeater on each CDR which, again, is elected 
every time an Elected Master Repeater refuses/fails to keep up with a 
heartbeat timer?
