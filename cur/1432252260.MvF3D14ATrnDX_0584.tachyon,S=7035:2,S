They actually have routine anal probes somewhere?

On the whole iPhone thing, you already knew you were being tracked by your
cellphone right? There's been years-long logging of cell switching
information, maybe even connection strength for triangulating exact
positions. And now everyone's mad because Apple collected the info on a
unique ID basis. Wasn't Apples privacy policy a dragon? Don't get me wrong
here, I think mass-invading privacy by recklessly storing information is
horrible. I just don't get why it's a surprise to people. If you don't want
to get tracked by law enforcement and your service provider, don't get a
phone. If you don't want to be tracked by your phone vendor, pick a dumb
phone or a cool vendor. Else just pick who you'd rather give your info to.

Any detailed info about android phones? You could specify during activation
to sent 'anonymous' information to Google or not, wonder if it's honest.
