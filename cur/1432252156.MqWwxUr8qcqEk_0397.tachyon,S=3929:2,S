Is it so painful to do your own homework?

"Matthew Prince, Lee Holloway, and Michelle Zatlyn created CloudFlare in 2009.[1][2] They previously worked on Project Honey Pot." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudFlare

"[...] the project organizers also help various law enforcement agencies combat private and commercial unsolicited bulk mailing offenses and overall work to help reduce the amount of spam being sent [...]" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Honey_Pot

That's just for starters, you can dig more and find more. It is interesting that the history of the founders themselves is no longer exhibited in cloudflare.com website as it was years ago.


As an American company, there is nothing preventing Cloudflare from receiving NSLs and having to shut up about them. What use is a system that you can't trust like this?

You can say "oh, but they go after the bad guys, spammers". But that doesn't limit it to spammers neither do we know who are the so called bad guys, since that is decided by American secret laws, made by secret courts, that issue secret orders.

No trust to American companies, less even trust to American companies that promise any kind of data security. Better no security than a false sense of it.

Sorry.
