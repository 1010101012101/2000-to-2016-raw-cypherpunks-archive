This begs the question: _which_ "Feds"? While it may be harder for 
America's Feds to tap phones in Russia (but don't count on this being 
true for long), the successors to the KGB and GRU are very active. 
Russia even has draconian laws against crypto use which America was 
unable to pass.

In any case, it's absurd to think one would move to Russia to escape 
the problems of the U.S.

Ames and Hanssen were textbook cases in "old school" thinking. They 
literally used the old kind of dead drops: messages left in Coke cans 
left at the base of oak trees in parks, chalk marks on mailboxes. 
Jeesh.
