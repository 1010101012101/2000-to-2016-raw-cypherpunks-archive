Not at all. My initial point was that it had media coverage. It was simply
a inquisitive observation about the priority setting mechanisms of the
COMMERCIAL media and how even 'independent critical' press had economic
incentives as well. It further demonstrate the asymmetry in the results
with respect to what is 'important' enough to be 'news'.

As I've said before in this forum, not all 'cooperative' behaviour is
necessarily a 'conspiracy', if enough people act in concert the effect is
the same. In many cases it is the quantity and not the intent that is
important. Is the 'economic' theory of the 'guiding hand' not the same sort
of 'conspiracy' theory?

There's more in heaven and earth...
