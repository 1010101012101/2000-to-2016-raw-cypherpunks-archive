So an arab with a loaded gun on his person wants on your plane.  
He claims to have some documents and claims to have phone numbers where
others (also strangers to the pilot) will "vouch" for him.
He claims to work for King George.

Wisely, the pilot, who is actually responsible, lets him stew on the ground.

Why do the proles who end up whining about ethnic discrimination
*worship* shiny badges, paper and phones so much?  Why is
King George, who couldn't do squat to protect his NYC subjects, 
pissed that one of his bodyguards-for-life was a little late?

How do you spell relief? C-A-R-C-A-N-O
