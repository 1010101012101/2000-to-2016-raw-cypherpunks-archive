[CALL FOR PAPERS]

The First International Workshop on Dependable and Sustainable Peer-to-Peer
Systems (DAS-P2P 2006) is the first workshop which focuses on dependability
and sustainability of P2P systems, with respect to their designs,
operations,
applications and social impacts.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) can be a promising technology on which we can depend
lives
of ours and our children, upon which we can build sustainable societies.
Designs of P2P systems are characterized by their usage of overlay networks
such that there is symmetry in the roles among participants. This implies
distribution of authorities, not only preventing introduction of single
points
of failure, but also assuring a level of autonomy which allows many of
us to
spontaneously start, maintain, or recover from failures of, such systems.

Although difficulties exist, such as uncertainty in the trust among
participants, one needs to be aware that such difficulties are, in many
parts,
due to our own human nature; depending on P2P is, in fact and literally,
depending on ourselves and our friends, which seem to be the only ones
we can
trust anyway, when it comes to our own survival.

The goal of this workshop is to share experiences, insights and new
ideas, and
set forth research agendas and suggestive future directions by
collaborations
among researchers with different disciplines and with similar interests
toward
dependability and sustainability.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of relevant topics:

** Designs and operations of dependable and sustainable P2P systems
- Self-organization and emergence
- Attack-resistance
- Fault tolerance
- Sustainable operations
- Sustainable mutual trust
- Sustainable reciprocal relationships

** Applications and social impacts of dependable and sustainable P2P
systems
- Sustainable economy
- Sustainable governance
- Sustainable lifestyles
- Rescue activities
- Post-catastrophic recovery
- Tackling environmental problems

The program of the workshop will be a combination of invited talks, paper
presentations and discussions.

[SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS]

The workshop invites your contributions of previously unpublished
papers, which
will be selected based on their originality, technical merit and topical
relevance. Papers will also be selected by the likelihood that they will
lead
to interesting and fruitful discussions at the workshop.

Your contributions should be formatted acoording to the IEEE Computer
Society
Press Proceedings Author Guidelines: 10-point Times, single-spaced,

format (see http://www.tinmith.net/tabletop2006/IEEE/Format/instruct.htm
for
detail). Each of your contributions should not exceed 8 pages.

See the workshop web site (http://das-p2p.wide.ad.jp/) for the submission
procedure.

[PUBLICATION]

Proceedings of the workshop will be published by IEEE Computer Society
Press.
