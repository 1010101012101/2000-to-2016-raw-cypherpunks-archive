Mixminion is a little better, but needs more market penetration and 
still has no good client integration.  i2p is looking good, since out of 
the box it comes with proxy pop and smtp servers.  The downside is that 
they proxy to a single mail provider in the i2p cloud.  Also, 
communications outside the cloud isn't a high priority now.  But the 
framework is building.

However, both suffer from a J. 6pack problem, because to use either, you 
have to run a node.

Jack B Nymble is complex because as you know, bidirectional pseudonymity 
is complex.  It's the return channel implementation that causes the 
problems.
