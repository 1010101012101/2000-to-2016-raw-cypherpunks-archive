>
>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jimmy Walter has spent more than $3 million
>promoting a conspiracy theory the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United
>States were "an inside job" and he is offering more cash to anyone who
>proves him wrong.
>
>The millionaire activist is so convinced of a government cover-up he is
>offering a $100,000 reward to any engineering student who can prove the
>World Trade Center buildings crashed the way the government says.
>
>"Of course, we expect no winners," Walter, 57, heir to an $11 million
>fortune from his father's home building business, said in a telephone
>interview from California on Wednesday.
>
>He said a panel of expert engineers would judge submissions from the
>students.
>
>Next month, he also launches a nationwide contest seeking alternative
>theories from college and high school students about why New York's
>World Trade Center collapsed. The contest offers $10,000 to the best
>alternative theory, with 100 runner-up awards of $1,000. Winners will be
>chosen next June.
>
>The World Trade Center's twin towers were destroyed after hijackers
>slammed two commercial airliners into them. The attack in New York
>killed 2,749 people.
>
>Various official investigations give no credence to Walter's theory. A
>Sept. 11 commission spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.
>
>Walter insists there had to be explosives planted in the twin towers to
>cause them to fall as they did, and also rejects the official
>explanation for the damage done at the Pentagon.
>
>"We have all the proof," said Walter, citing videotapes and testimony
>from witnesses.
>
>"It wasn't 19 screw-ups from Saudi Arabia who couldn't pass flight
>school who defeated the United States with a set of box cutters," he
>said. He dismissed the official Sept. 11 commission report, saying, "I
>don't trust any of these 'facts."'
>
>Walter has spent millions of dollars to bolster support for his case,
>running full-page ads in The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
>The New Yorker and Newsweek, as well as alternative newspapers and
>30-second TV spots.
>
>He points to a Zogby poll he commissioned last summer that showed 66
>percent of New Yorkers wanted the 9/11 investigation reopened.
>
>Walter has spent about 30 percent of his net worth on his efforts.
