Dear Netrepreneur,

This is a consumer awareness message.

Are you aware that many business opportunities online are not legitimate?  That someone is trying 
to separate you from your hard-earned money?  And, that money and business opportunities are 
not what they sometimes appear to be?

Unfortunately, that makes it difficult for the legitimate e-biz to deal with other netrepreneurs online.

An article entitled "Twelve Tests For Evaluating a Network Marketing (MLM) Opportunity",by
Jon M. Taylor, Ph.D., Consumer Awareness Institute, points out the realities of the MLM 
opportunity you may be considering.  There are pyramid schemes, chain letters, and chain selling
that circumvents the state and federal laws.  Other successful MLM companies comply with existing
guidelines and compensate online business people in a fair and direct way.

The article provides a test to help you avoid the pitfalls in which you would be wasting your money.

If you would like a copy of this poignant and important article for determining your continuing 
involvement or enrolling anew in a network marketing venture then please hit reply to this e-mail
by putting "Twelve Tests" in the subject line and I will send you a copy and a list of other websites
helpful in your network marketing decisions.

Best of luck,
Gary Canada
