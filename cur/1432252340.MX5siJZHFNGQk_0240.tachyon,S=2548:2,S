I have wondered what happens when a 14-year-old kid is picked up for 
truancy at the shopping mall and then explains that he was kicked out 
of school.

As for putting more and more people in prison, this is what happens 
when prisons become corporate owned-and-operated profit centers and 
when the same folks who profit from the destruction of Iraq and then 
the lucrative rebuilding of Iraq are the ones launching the wars and 
ordering the rebuilding.


As one of the noted fascists said, "Fascism _is_ corporatism."
