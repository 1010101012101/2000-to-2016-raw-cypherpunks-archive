Argh. You misunderstood me. I don't want to find hash collisions, to 
create a false known hash - that is just too difficult. I want to make 
every file in the machine recognized as "unidentifiable".

The adversary has acoustic fingerprinting software. Even cheaper than 
the Indians.

The signature busting of MP3s has a disadvantage, though: makes their 
sharing back to the P2P pool more difficult, and a lot of programs relying 
on their hash (emule, Kazaa(?),...) instead of their file name will 
consider them a different file, which causes problems with multisource 
download (though the problem won't be on your side).

Or a small propane torch or a lighter (the kind that makes the hissing 
blue high-temperature flame), or even a sticker with magnesium shavings to 
burn through the chip when lit.

Didn't realize this. Seems I still overestimate Them the People.

Free ringtones. Good attractant these days. I tend to forget about them as 
I tend to shun fancy tones - telephones should have a distinctive ring but 
"distinctive" does not have to mean "orchestral". But apparently there are 
large sets of people who like it. Weird...
