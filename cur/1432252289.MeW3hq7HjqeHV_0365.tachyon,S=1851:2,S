What you can have is for the voter to be able to verify that his/her
vote was properly counted without being able to prove it to anybody
else.

In that case, an individual claim that a vote was improperly counted
wouldn't be convincing, but a wide enough outcry might trigger a
recount.

I think this would add unnecessary and undesired complexity to a
political election voting system, though.
