Great, an micro Wankel engine.

Did anyone else share my first thought, that this
would be just right as the power source for a laptop
version of Babbage's Analytical Engine? (My second
thought was that an itty-bitty steam engine would be
more appropriate).

I wonder what the limiting factor would be? I suspect
that the cube/squared law is involved - as the parts
get smaller they cool down too quickly to operate as
an engine.
