I'm sure Tor developers have considered the real possibility that some
or all of what different agencies release, about their capabilities &
successes (or lack of) against Tor - or anything else, is
misinformation, designed to make the Tor Project AND  users more
comfortable in continuing to use TBB.

Logically, if any agency or adversary divulged they can somewhat
successfully track users or "infiltrate the system," then most would
stop using it and a valuable method to gather information or catch
"criminals" would cease to exist.  Good poker players and gov'ts NEVER
reveal their hands.

I wouldn't take seriously anything that ANY gov't publicly reveals
about their technology or intelligence capability (or lack there or).
Over a long history, it's been repeatedly shown that advanced gov'ts
always know more & have more technology capability, than is revealed.
That is, often until decades later, when the real truth comes out.
It's no different now.
