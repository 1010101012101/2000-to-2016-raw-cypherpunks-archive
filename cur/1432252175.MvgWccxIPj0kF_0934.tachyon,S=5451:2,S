Norway Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman

June 21, 2002

This Public Announcement is being issued to alert Americans traveling and
resident in Norway of the potential for disruptions caused by demonstrations
planned to coincide with the World Bank Conference to be held in Oslo from
June 24-26, 2002.  This
Public Announcement will expire on June 30, 2002.

The World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics - Europe
(ABCDE-Europe) is scheduled to take place in Oslo, Norway from June 24-26,
2002.  Tight security will be in place in and around the venue for the
conference (Holmenkollen area of Oslo).  Previous summits in other capitals
have drawn "anti-globalization" and other activists from around the world,
and U.S. citizens should bear in mind that anti-globalization demonstrations
in other European cities have sometimes turned violent.

Demonstrations and protest marches are expected in downtown Oslo from June
22 through June 26.  Travelers are advised to follow news and traffic
reports, avoid crowds and demonstrations and to exercise caution.  Travelers
should be aware of heightened security and potential delays in entering
Norway during this period and should always carry proof of identity and
citizenship.

Police intend to temporarily close access to some downtown train stations in
connection with approved demonstrations and will forbid parking in the city
center throughout the summit period.  In addition, public transportation
schedules may be altered.  These temporary actions will be posted through
the local media.

The U.S. Embassy is located at Drammensveien 18, Oslo.  The Embassy may be
contacted 24 hours a day at telephone (47) 2244-8550 in connection with
emergencies such as arrest, serious injury or death of a U.S. citizen.  The
American Citizen Services Unit is open for routine, non-emergency matters
from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon, Monday through Friday.

For more information on travel to Norway, please consult the latest
Department of State Consular Information Sheet for Norway at
http:\\travel.state.gov.  Americans traveling and residing abroad should
monitor this web site closely, particularly the Department's Worldwide
Caution-Public Announcement of March 17, 2002.

This Public Announcement will expire on June 30, 2002.
