What's "pseudo-Brit" about that? I don't think I've called anyone  "Mr"
for about 25 years - it's you Americans who do that. And "Sir". Not part
of the language over here. Except for people in uniform. And I suppose
TV interviewers - but then they always sound pompous.

Anyway, when I was being a pompous arse at you a few years ago I think I
called you "Timmy" :-)
