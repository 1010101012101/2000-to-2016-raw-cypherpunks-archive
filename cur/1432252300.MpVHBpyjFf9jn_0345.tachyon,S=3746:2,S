Summary

DVDSynth is an open platform for developing various "virtual devices,"
particularly virtual CD/DVD-ROM drives and virtual discs to put in them.
One of the most
interesting things it can do is apply filters to physical devices in the
system. Filters can change the contents of a CD or DVD in arbitrary ways
on the fly. This early
release of DVDSynth contains only the filtering support together with
the following three filters:

     DVD subtitler: This filter effectively adds a new subtitle track to
a DVD, by inserting new data into the MPEG stream and updating the
various navigation
     pointers on the fly. Since it works at the device-driver level,
it's compatible with all software and hardware DVD players. It comes
with a fairly sophisticated
     subtitle rendering engine which supports asynchronous overlapping
subtitles in multiple fonts and colors, fade-in and fade-out, the full
Unicode character set,
     vertical Japanese "sidetitles," etc.

     Unrestrict DVD: This filter removes various usage restrictions from
a DVD, including region lockout, APS (Macrovision), and disabled
fast-forwarding,
     menu call, angle change, and so forth.

     SCSI protocol spy: This lets you monitor the SCSI commands and data
passing to and from your drive, in the tradition of such utilities as
FileMon, RegMon
     and Spy++. It's useful for debugging, and interesting to watch if
you're curious.
