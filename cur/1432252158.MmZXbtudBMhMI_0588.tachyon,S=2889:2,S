Yah, Judge Gwin appears pretty clueless here.

And don't forget how the PGP source code was exported: printed using
a special font, then carried to Europe, then scanned and OCR'd. An
awful lot of wasted effort, for no gain in the US's national security.

By the way, you got your aphorism wrong. It's "The law is a ass"; Mr.
Bumble in Charles Dickins' _Oliver Twist_. Mr. Bumble was pretty much
"a" ass himself, so I'm not sure that quoting him conveys quite the
message that is usually intended.
