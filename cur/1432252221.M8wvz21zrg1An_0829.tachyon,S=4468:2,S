There are reasons why alleged urban legends such as when CNN filmed 
the Palestinian candy celebration are believed.  It is in part due to 
an innate distrust of government and the fact that governments do 
engage in propaganda and disinformation campaigns.

Most of us should remember the mini-flap (Which should have been much 
larger) when it was revealed that the US Army's psychological 
operations units intern at CNN. Now "Ha'aretz Daily" reports that an 
Israel Defence Force (IDF) film crew was dispatched to film candy 
being handed out in East Jerusalem and the Palestinian newspaper 
"Jerusalem Times" reports that the candy shop owner was paid for the 
candy by the IDF.
