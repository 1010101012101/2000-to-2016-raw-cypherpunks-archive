Another effect will be companies that wish to take advantage of the
criminal sections of the DMCA will be more likely to cover their
tracks when dealing with the Feds. The next Adobe won't be so quick to
admit they contacted the FBI, for instance.

Or, pace Blacknet, the next company that wants to use DMCA against a
hacker will target the organizers of the protests and blackmail them
anonymously. :)
