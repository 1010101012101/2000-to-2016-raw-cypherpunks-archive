The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slightly, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
