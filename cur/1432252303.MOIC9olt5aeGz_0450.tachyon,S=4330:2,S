Remember, I was very careful in what I said. I didn't say there were 
no constraints/encumberments on renting, or selling, or adding on, 
whatever. I said, quite carefully, that "there is nothing I am 
required to have in my house."

To his credit, David Honig checked with a legalgrub acquaintance of 
his and confirmed what I said.

I have a house sitting empty in Aptos, over near the coast. I have 
not rented it out, nor have I ever planned to. The legal hassles are 
too great. Including, on another subject, renters deciding they won't 
pay rent and then having social welfare agencies paid for by tax 
dollars fighting "for the rights of the renter." (Legal Aid Society, 
for example.)

I know a woman here in Santa Cruz County who had some Mexicans 
renting from her. They trashed the house, didn't pay their rent, and 
it took her six months of court battles to have the Mexicans finally 
expelled. And of course she never saw a dime of the rent that was 
owed to her. The legal fees of her renters were paid for out from 
public funds.

And people wonder why some of us are in favor of rounding up these 
miscreants and their government associates, holding quick but fair 
trials, and then executing the whole lot. From what I have seen, 
several hundred thousand Americans and foreigners living in America 
need to be tried and then liquidated.
