                  Utah town requires all households to own gun

                  November 5, 2000
                  Web posted at: 11:22 AM EST (1622 GMT)

                  VIRGIN, Utah (AP) -- This tiny southern Utah town has enacted an ordinance
                  requiring a gun and ammunition in every home for residents' self-defense.

                  Most of Virgin's 350 residents already own firearms, so the initiative has lots of
                  support, Mayor Jay Lee said.

                  Residents had expressed fear that their Second Amendment right to bear arms
                  was under fire, so the town council modeled a similar measure passed by a
                  Georgia city about 12 years ago.

                  The mentally ill, convicted felons, conscientious objectors and people who
                  cannot afford to own a gun are exempt.


Thanks!
