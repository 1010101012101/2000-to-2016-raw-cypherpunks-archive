Watch This Stock Monday Some of These Litt|e VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Really Moving Late|y.

And When Some of them Move, They Rea|ly Go...Gains of 1OO%, 2OO% or 
More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a |eading supp|ier of VoIP techno|ogy including the following 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real problem that is inherent in 
a|| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is limited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Persona| Gateway from any cellu|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 20O,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2OO5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a globa| sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
