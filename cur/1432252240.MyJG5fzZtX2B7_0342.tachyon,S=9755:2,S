There is a good chance the documents are covertly marked as
you suggest, the ostentatious classification markings a ruse for
untutored yokels to fancy are genuine.

Covert markings have been in use for a long time, as well as
ostentatious markings. On paper as well as digital and other
forms of electronic.

And certainly packets carry unique markings in a variety of
overt and covert types.

Some of the techniques fall under the inadvertent emanations
rubric associated with Tempest -- which has blossomed well
beyond the FOIA releases from the late 1990s. TSCM is a
marvel of duplicity and ruse.
