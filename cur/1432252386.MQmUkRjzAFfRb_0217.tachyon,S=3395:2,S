message:    Hi, my name is Brigit and I am a 19 year old female from San Diego, California.  Ever since my 14th birthday, I have been really sexually active, but I am still a virgin.  Now I am 19 and away from home, attending school at San Diego State University and sharing a dorm with four of my girlfriends and are all VERY turned on to meet a guy and satisfy ALL of his pleasures.  To see our sexy pictures we took just last week and to meet some other couples, go to my website<br>< a href="http://www.joinfreee.com">http://www.joinfreee.com<br><br><br></a>
