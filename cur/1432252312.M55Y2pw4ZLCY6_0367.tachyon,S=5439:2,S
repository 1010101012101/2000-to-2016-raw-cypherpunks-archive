Speaking of dopey, your mouth is running over again, libel laws, you really 
are an idiot, see you on campus.  I wonder how many people are sick and 
tired of your smart ass postings... Stop or I'll call the feds..what makes 
you think they are not already involved...you pussy...oh that's right...you 
rather smoke a dick. Time is closing in.
Its pretty obvious on what you do day and night.  Once again come out of the 
basement and see the light, your one forum where you don't have to speak to 
people face to face and can talk all the trash you want....
See ya soon loser.......
