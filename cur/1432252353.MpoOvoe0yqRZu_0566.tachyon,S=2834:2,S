The Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) - whose motto is
"Keeping DOE Secure"
  - this week issued a bulletin warning privacy- conscious users that
the
  Internet-connected bug-reporting capabilities of Windows XP or Office
in combination
  with recent versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser could
disclose sensitive data
  to Microsoft.

  However, it described the vulnerability as a
  "medium/low" risk.

  The issue, CIAC wrote in its bulletin, is that
  the Windows Error Reporting feature takes
  a snapshot of data stored in memory at the
  time of an application failure - data that
  could include content from a document
  being edited at the time of a crash.
