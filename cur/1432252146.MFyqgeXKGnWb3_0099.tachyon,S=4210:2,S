"More photons than the surface of the sun" for HOW LONG?

A minute? A second? A millisecond? A microsecond?

You confuse fluence with flux, a classic mistake.

(A pulse "brighter than the sun" but lasting only milliseconds will 
have far less heating effect than other flux level pulses lasting 
longer. Calculations matter. And, yes, I used to do these 
calculations when I was refuting Kosta Tsipis' calculations of the 
late 70s. Fluence matters.)
