Charisma is needed to implement true change within our *existing*
government. Anarchy is an equally valid alternative path to true freedom,
but not one that am a proponent of.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig

I picked him as an example, since he's fairly well known, and has been
thrown around as a potential congressional candidate, or an employee of the
executive branch. He's someone with potential to change the legal landscape
in a significant way. Unfortunately he chose the route to change the
process rather than implement direct change (by becoming elected), which
has been a failure to date.

No, it's certainly not. This is where having good leadership helps. Much in
the way that coding is action in our community, becoming elected
(implementing law) is action in the political world, and nothing can be
done to change our government than to elect ~like minded individuals.

I have a much higher opinion of the American public. The problem isn't that
we have too much influence over our government, but not enough. The
ultimate fix is to somehow replace our legislative branch with true
democracy.
