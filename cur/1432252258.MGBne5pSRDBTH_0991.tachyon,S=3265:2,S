What a lame-ass complaint.

For some reason, certain polling areas got jammed up,
as in long lines. The court agreed to keep the polls
open longer so the people could vote. It didn't matter
who the people might vote for, despite the Democrats
asking for the extended hours.

The Republicans actually went into federal court to
try and block this, and failed.

Did you expect a Republican judge to say no since
the people who might be unable to vote by the normal
deadline were Democrats?

What's your objection to people voting? Try not to
mention a political party in your reply.

Tim the Troll, yet again.
