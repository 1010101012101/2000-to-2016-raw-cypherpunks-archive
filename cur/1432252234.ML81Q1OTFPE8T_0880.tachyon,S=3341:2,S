Bit Commitment Blues
by Mike Stay

You think I got zero knowledge, 
But I know you done me wrong.
Just commit to me baby, 
So's I can sing a happier song!
One bit of commitment, 
That's all I really need,
So send me your hashed answer 
And the random seed.

I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.

I ain't oblivious, darlin', 
And honey, I ain't blind.
Don't need sublim'nal channels 
To read your cheatin' mind.
I'll share a secret with you: 
I know you hand out a public key.
But why's it to the apartment 
That you're sharin' with me?

I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.

You say you love me, baby, 
But you flirt with other guys.
You say you want me, honey, 
But I see you wink your eye.
You say you need me, Alice, 
Now forgive me if I sob;
You know my name is Charlie, 
So quit hangin' out with Bob!

I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.
