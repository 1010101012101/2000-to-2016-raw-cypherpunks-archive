Declan,

	If you'll look closely at the addresses to which my complaint was
mailed, you will note that it was directed to "broadwing.net" which is the
luser's ISP, and uu.net, the upstream NSP for broadwing: unless you also
have broadwing as your upstream provider, it should have been pretty
obvious that my complaint - oops, I'm sorry, my *censorship* - was not
directed at you.

	Yes, I hit the forward button on the wrong email within the
thread, and for any confusion, I apologize, however, it was pretty obvious
to *everyone* but you who the complaint was directed against.  

	As for being "censorhappy": shouldn't a	*journalist* do a little
more homework before (a) making such a sweeping declaration, and (b) using
his media access in such a directed and vindictive manner?  Possibly an
email to ask just what the hell was going on might have been more
appropriate?

	Do your homework: you'll find that I am pretty middle of the road
WRT "Muzzling Spammers".  I make the occassional complaint about the truly
stupid (such as our friend below), but in general, my reputation is that
of an anti-spammer "thorn".  In my experience, the anti-spammers generate
several orders of magnitude more trash with their bitching than the
original spammer did with their spam run.  I personally recieve between
500 and 700 emails a day (between home and offices), of which roughly
2/3rds is spam (a great number of these coming from this very list) - and
you know what?  Hitting "Delete" is just not that big a deal (no matter
*what* Net-Nazis like Vixie have to say).

	Basically Declan, I'm disappointed in you.

Yours,

J.A. Terranson
sysadmin@mfn.org

Yours, 
J.A. Terranson

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
