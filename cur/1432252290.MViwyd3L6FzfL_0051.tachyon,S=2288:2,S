This makes no sense. Most of the traffic out there is garbage, and it is
ridiculously expensive to record all of it. It is not at all difficult to
analyze it, and extract useful info: all plain text information, which
endpoints use which crypto, VoIP streams, etc.

We *do* remember the Pakistan-UK email on wire intercept, don't we? How else
is this supposed to have happened by means other than a total tap?

You better believe they're doing it -- but they capture only traffic that
contains useful information.
