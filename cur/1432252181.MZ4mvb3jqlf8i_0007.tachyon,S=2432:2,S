We need a good mixmaster net.

working remailer:
  1. Average latency less than 5 min
  2. Operator probably trustworthy
  3. Less than 1 message dropped per 100,000 handled

Phase I:     10 working remailers
Phase II:   100 working remailers
Phase III: 1000 working remailers

It is permissible to redesign and reimplement to achieve these goals.

Comments welcome.
