A broader point can be made as well. The Lee-Hanssen-labtest ancedotes are 
just that. They may be important, but ancedotes do not by themselves 
provide evidence of a trend.

To really evaluate the FBI, we'd need data like # of prosecutions, # of 
prosecutions thrown out of court because of bad evidence, # of employees, # 
of spies caught, and even more detailed info that would be tricky to 
collect. TRAC does a reasonable job.

Right. They seem pretty much what they were a decade ago, when I first 
moved to DC. And even though they may still lack clue, they're nevertheless 
a lot smarter about computer "crimes" and what happens online. FLETC 
courses, training manuals, Defcon presentations, etc.
