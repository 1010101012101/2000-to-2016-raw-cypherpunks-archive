For IP if you wish...

A television program claims that the Dutch biometric passport has been
"read remotely and then the security cracked using flaws built into the
system, whereupon all of the biometric data could be read". The Delft
smartcard security specialist Riscure claims to be able to read
passport data, including date of birth, facial image and fingerprint,
from up to 10 meters away "in around two hours".
