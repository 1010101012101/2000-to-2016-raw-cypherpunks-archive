Thing is, having seen the possibilities, people actually *want*
this freedom from central control, in a bad way, and they're willing
to act to get it. They also realize that if they, and the entire
community, don't act together to maintain the decentralization they
have... then it's over. That's why ghash.io (the largest pool) just
announced that they will not exceed 40%. Down from 55% to 32% now...

And why BTC isn't exactly rushing to support regulation...

http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2b1jpl/dear_ben_lawsky_thank_you_for_the_totalitarian/

Further, again, since people want decentral, if some large entity
does manage a BTC takeover, no problem... all users ok with that
will stay with the now central coin, and the free decentral people
will just exchange their coin (or fork) into whatever is the current
decentral coin. Repeat as needed.

So far BTC has a good history of actively cooperating to avoiding
central. Excepting mining companies (ie: the 10% corps, who have
made similar self limiting statements), the VC money seems to stay
out of the coin itself and is being placed in surrounding service
ventures... exchanges, banking, processors, wallets, retail.

In the end years from now, maybe only three coin will remain...
- A World central
- A State central
- A World decentral/anon/etc

With all of them being roughly similar in acceptance, volatility, etc.

People spend more than a dollar to post mail, or drive to the store.
It will be a long time before the ASIC and electric cost to clear
a transaction (at whatever network transaction demand rate) exceeds
palatability, if ever. Pick a projected compute power, node count,
required tx rate (at 100% utilization) and then basically figure
gigawatt and gigahash dollars per tx.

A guesstimate with current state and data?

- Installing double current hashrate to take 50+% costs about $130M
  in retail hardware alone. Less for a real deployment.
- About $10k/hr to power it. More for cooling, support, bandwidth.
- About $0.40/tx-current spread over a year. Much less if running
  at 100% tx rate capacity. Up to twice more due to doubling current
  hashrate.

Right now that amount is being covered by coin mining profit.

The future taper of coin production vs then current market value
of coin vs tx fees will be interesting. And ASIC platforms have yet
to reach performance plateau. The base tx cost is cost of the coin
algorithm to support a given required tx rate. That seems quite
low. The race (difficulty) to claim the tx fee profit drives it up.
Yet the hardware market is open, yielding a level playing field.
So as long as the required tx rate can be met affordably within the
algorithm, this is unlikely to be an issue.

Cost of tx rates also naturally moderate the proportion of users
amongst each payment system. It remains to be seen, once all the
various BTC costs are fully optimized, if BTC can handle tx rates
approaching the credit cards. Even if not, that doesn't keep it
from utility at its own natural rate limit.

Some seriously big players don't seem to have any problem with BTC...

Well, since BTC is nothing but experimental scrap metal, please be
sure to send yours (and that of all your central fiat loving friends)
off for proper recycling to my recycle bin here...

Liked or learned something from the links, etc? Tips go here, I'll
buy a miner / tx processor, or do something generally useful...
