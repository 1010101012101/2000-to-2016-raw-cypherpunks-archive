SSID.  The router was in the access point mode.  I used wifi channel 1, 
which is in the ham bands.  No encryption was used and I did not connect my 
DSL internet into the WAN port.  This router had a removable antenna which 
I removed.  I then connected the router to a 27 db gain bi directional 
amplifier whose output was sent to an external antenna amout 25 feet up.  I 
used 25 feet of low loss microwave coax.  The external antenna was 
omnidirectional and had a 15 db gain.  I connected my 2 Android phones, 
that were configured to the Serval client mode, with the router.  Now I was 
able to make Serval Mesh calls and send SMS messages over a large coverage 
area.  This was all experimental, but it showed me that the Serval Mesh 
could cover a large area with only one wifi router. This trial was just to 
see how my wifi could be used on the ham bands and it had nothing to do 
with the HSMM MESH configuration.
