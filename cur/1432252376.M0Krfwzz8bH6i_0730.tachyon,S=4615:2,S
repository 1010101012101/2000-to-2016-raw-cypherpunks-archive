You're missing the parameter where the walls have to be kept at a
temperature T. This implies that your environment around the ball is
controlled. In a lab environment you'd wrap the cavity in some sort of
heater blanket.

To help you get a better grasp of the scale of the effect, consider the
odds of a single photon entering the cavity port from the outside. What is
the odds that that photon will be re-emitted? Almost nill. It effectively
absorbs radiation at all frequencies (hence the 'black' term). Now,
consider the inverse, what is the odd that a photon of a given wavelength
will be emitted? The odds that a perfect black body absorber would radiate
a photon from inside the cavity to the outside environment is also low.

So, to make a black body radiator into a beam weapon implies so much
energy keeping the cavity at the temperature required that it would be
simpler to use that energy directly instead of trying to create a high
energy photon stream from a very(!) inefficient emission process.
