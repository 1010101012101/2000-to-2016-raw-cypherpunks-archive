WOLFOWITZ, PAUL:
ODDS FOR ASSASSINATION BY 2003-11-15: 7:3
ODDS FOR NECKLACING OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS BY 2004-02-15: 12:2
ODDS THAT NEXT PENTAGON BLAST WILL TAKE HIM OUT BY 2003-10-05: 7:1

I guess now that the Pentagon is setting up a murder pool it can't be 
illegal for us to do it.


--Tim May, Corralitos, California
Quote of the Month: "It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; 
perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks." 
--Cathy Young, "Reason Magazine," both enemies of liberty.
