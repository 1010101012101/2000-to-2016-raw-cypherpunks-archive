C'punks,

I just wrote Phil about the Washington Post interview.  The following is his
response:

> The journalist slightly misinterpreted my remarks, and missed the
> shades of grey in some of what I said.  I did *not* say that I
> was overwhelmed with guilt over PGP.  I told her about my crying,
> just as everyone else I knew had cried over what had happened.  I
> also told her about the hate mail, and that I "felt bad" that the
> terrorists may have used PGP.  Indeed I do feel bad about that.
> But feeling bad about them using it is not the same as feeling
> that PGP was a mistake, or that I have changed my principles
> about human rights and crypto.  I thought I had also made it
> clear that I had no regrets about developing PGP.  She did not
> report any individual facts incorrectly in her article.  But I
> think she connected the dots in a slightly different way, and
> seemed to conclude that I was wallowing in guilt over PGP.  I'm
> sure she meant no harm.
>
> I am still very much aware that PGP was a good thing, and that
> strong crypto helps more than hurts.  I have been saying that to
> the press all week.  I just said it again in two more interviews
> I had before breakfast this morning, and will continue to say it.
>  It seems I have to say it more forcefully.
>
> I will prepare a statement on this later today.  In the meantime,
> feel free to let our colleagues know that I have not gone soft on
> civil liberties.
>
> Regards,
> Phil
