p.s. Since there are one or two attractive women out there I know who
might concievably chance upon my remarks yesterday, I want to hasten to
assure everyone that they were pure hyperbole, to make an, um, abstract
philosophical point. Yeah, that's it. I'd never dream of actually looking
at that gross, disgusting stuff. Why, it's demeaning to women. Those
hussies have nothing on a real woman, anyway.
