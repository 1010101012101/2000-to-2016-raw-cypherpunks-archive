Hey...I want to give you an update on a number of things:

1. WirelessDeveloper 2001 is 3 weeks away; 11 DevCons from AT&T Wireless, 
Ericsson, Compaq, Openwave, TruePosition, RIM, Arch Wireless, PacketVideo, 
Pinpoint, Stonestreet One and Cream by Netpost.  Aug 20-24, Silicon Valley, 
CA. See http://www.WirelessDeveloper2001.com.  I'll be there the entire week 
along with all of my staff and would be happy to meet with you!

2. Do you need venture capital? We have 42 VCs signed up to receive your bus 
plans and most are coming to the show to book one-on-one meetings. It's 
free. See http://www.wirelessdeveloper2001.com/developer/meetingvcs.htm

3. Who should be Developer of the Year? We're taking nominations for the 
first annual Developer Choice Awards. 10 awards presented at the show. See 
http://www.wirelessdeveloper2001.com/developer/choice.asp

4. New Magazine! Our partner, Penton Media, is launching a new print 
magazine aptly called "WirelessDeveloper" - if you want a free trial 
subscription, reply to this email with Magazine in the subject and include 
your full contact info. I'll get you on the list.

and now, Konny's take on the industry as a whole...

As the President of WirelessDeveloper.com, I have the opportunity to talk to 
lots of developers, content providers, and others struggling to make the 
Wireless Internet a reality. It's been a shakeout year to be sure. Two guys 
with a Powerpoint presentation and a plan to capture "eyeballs" is a thing 
of the past. (but it was fun while it lasted).

Now boring is beautiful. If you have a sustainable business model and cash 
flow you're golden. Don't think for a second that the VCs have fled the 
space, they're just more selective. They're looking for deals, but I'm 
hearing that that they're not swinging as hard and they don't want to go 
solo [translate that to $2m investments x 4 VCs instead of $8m investment 
from 1 VC]. But I'm not the expert...I've got experts coming to the 
WirelessDeveloper 2001 show that will give us the real scoop on how to play 
it.

More news. A significant number of content providers have tanked this past 
year. There's more room on the homedecks and there's a major industry-wide 
move to monetize browser-based apps. Lots of initiatives, lots of 
approaches, lots of people looking over their shoulders. But it will happen, 
and it will happen this next year. You'll be able to submit a fee-based 
application, have the carrier collect the revenues and then get a 
revenue-share on the back-end. I think NTT DoCoMo embarrassed us into it.

I hope you can make it to WirelessDeveloper 2001 this year. I'll have 
several guests on my TV Show (the Konny Zsigo show) and we'll explore all of 
these issues and more.

If you can't make it, at least update me on your contact information and 
tell me what you're up to!

Konny Zsigo, President

If you couldn't care less about the Wireless Internet or just plain don't 
want to hear from me again, just reply with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the 
subject and I'll take you off my list.
