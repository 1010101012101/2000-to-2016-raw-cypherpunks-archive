Hackers attacked Scientology with 220 Mbps DDoS

A group of hackers calling itself bAnonymousb has hit the Church of  
Scientologybs Web site with an online attack. The attack was launched  
Jan. 19 by Anonymous, which is seeking media attention to help bsave  
people from Scientology by reversing the brainwashing,b according to a  
Web page maintained by Anonymous (offline now). The attacks were  
spurred by the Churchbs efforts to remove video of movie star Tom  
Cruise professing his admiration for the religion, according to an  
Anonymous video manifesto posted to Youtube. bFor the good of your  
followers, for the good of mankind and for our own enjoyment, we shall  
proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle  
the Church of Scientology in its present form,b a creepy computerized  
voice states in the video. Anonymous followed up this dispatch with a  
second video blasting the media for failing to completely report the  
groupbs criticisms of the church. This video was taken down Friday by  
Youtube, citing a bterms of use violation.b

Anonymous has managed to generate a measurable attack against the  
Scientology.org Web site. Over the past few days, the site was hit  
with several DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, which  
flooded it with as much as 220 Mbps of traffic, according to Jose  
Nazario, a senior security engineer with Arbor Networks, whose company  
compiles data on Internet attacks. The Anonymous campaign shows some  
level of organization. b220 Mbps is probably about in the middle of  
attack sizes,b Nazario said. bItbs not just one or two guys hanging  
out in the university dorms doing this.b On average, the attacks  
lasted about 30 minutes and used up 168 Mbps of bandwidth. In the past  
year, Arbor has seen attacks on other sites hit 40 Gbps, or 200 times  
the strength of the Anonymous event.
