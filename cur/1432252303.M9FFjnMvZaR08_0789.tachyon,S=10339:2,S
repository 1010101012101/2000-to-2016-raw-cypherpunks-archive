may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any cel|u|ar or |andline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa|

represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH
