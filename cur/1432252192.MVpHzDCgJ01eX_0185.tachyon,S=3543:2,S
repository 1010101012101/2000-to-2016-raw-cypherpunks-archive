I'm not sure if you're referring to net neutrality (free market issue) or
NSA cable taps. The later is fixable to some degree by coding, the former
requires legislative access (money) to influence in the short term (in the
US).

The ACLU is unlikely to get into the Wikileaks business.

It's time to win the public brain trust war. Leaks, in the last year, have
done much to shift public opinion, and will likely continue to help
tremendously.  That will only get us so far (in the US). We (the larger
tech community) need to cash in that momentum and turn that into political
change, particularly at the legislative level. However, that path needs
charismatic leaders, i.e. Lawrence Lessig, to actually run for office.
