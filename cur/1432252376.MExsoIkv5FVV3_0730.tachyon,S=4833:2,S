The reason the company now prohibits all sorts of activities, and the 
reason the Personnel Commissar is inspecting offices, is because of 
_externalities_ like lawsuits, harassment charges, etc. In a free 
society, these externalities would vanish.

You seem to fundammentally misunderstand the situation. The reason 
the Personnel Commissar is ordering sensitivity training, workshops, 
and is requiring that posters of Brittny Spears be removed from 
office walls is because government and lawyers have made companies 
liable in various ways for "discriminatory" or "sexist" or suchlike 
behaviors.

One of my fellow engineers at Intel had a large poster of the famous 
early 80s porn star, "Seka," on his walls--she was, in this poster, 
clothed, albeit skimpily.  Some of the secretaries clucked, and 
retaliated by putting up Chippendales calendars, including full 
frontal nudity.

Would such things be tolerated today? Nope. And not because of the 
personal choices of a particluarl Personnel bimbo.

Nope, the fear is of lawsuits.

This was my point about a free society.

You're really missing the point, aren't you? Go back and think about 
the issues more deeply.
