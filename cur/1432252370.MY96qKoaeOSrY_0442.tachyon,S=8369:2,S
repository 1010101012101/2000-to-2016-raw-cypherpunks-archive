:: public request for help with janus wireless / open source project
at defcon 14 ::

if you will be at defcon 14 this august and have one or more of the
following and would be willing to help with an open source project
launch / test during the con please get in touch with me using
Off-The-Record or coordinate a meat space rendezvous via email -
coderman@gmail.

coderman42 on AIM :: OTR print A59CDCB3 46468A16 27D21678 270AF0B5 0B0477CF

my appreciation to anyone and everyone for their help; we will need it
(we are a very small group based in portland with limited resources
and time).

i will try to express my appreciation and reward your generosity in
some fashion.  please forward this to anyone with crypto clue who
might be interested and likely to participate.

desired and/or required:
-  VIA Nehemiah hardware and >128M of memory.  C5XL, C5P or C5J / C7  required.
-  slimline IDE or USB CDROM/DVDROM drives.

-  any x586/Pentium system with > 128M of ram and 8G or more free on
unformatted disk partition.

-  portable USB storage devices that can be formatted to XFS/iso image.

-  any system capable of burning single or dual layer DVD-R discs.

-  any wireless equipment that can support WPA/WPA2 EAP TLS w RADIUS
(enterprise mode)

-  any prism2, hermes, atheros, cisco, intel or other linux supported
wireless hardware in pcmcia/cardbus or mini-PCI/PCI formfactor. 
200mW+ especially useful.

-  802.11 or other HAM/FHSS/DSSS/OFDM amplifiers in the 900Mhz,
2.4Ghz, and 5.8Ghz bands (or other reasonable bands - HAM with
auth/no-privacy packet radio signalling?)

-  antennas / cables / filters / mounting systems / for any of the above bands.

-  audio/video recording and/or mastering equipment and knowledge.

-  home/work/edu internet bandwidth that can support and would be
available for the conference (or a subset) running a tor proxy and/or
bittorrent seeder.  traffic shaping and read-only boot/runtime is
supported if you use the live ISO cd for hosting a tor[rent] node. 
please consider the potential security risks of running a tor node
reachable from a private defcon wireless network before agreeing to
this.  middle/relay only nodes would still be helpful.

- well CPU and memory endowed systems that you would make available to
a private IPsec/OpenVPN network for distributed build and test
services.


all hardware you want to keep is encouraged to stay in your possession
and a few hours or more would be helpful when contributing time/skills
at the conference.  you will need to meet me in person before or the
day of the conference.  the earlier the better.

thanks again,
  i look forwarded to meeting any of you in person and discussing this
project and code.

me tarnish so,'

"It is not to tell you anything
But to live forever
That I write this.

...

This is the only code
I can write.
I am the only one
who has built it.
I didn't kill myself
When things went wrong
I didn't shirk difficult integrity,
  when the easy seduced me.
I learned to write
I learned to code
What might be named
On nights like this
By one like me.

-- out of date and high level description of what this project is all about:


0.  Overview

Warning: this software is in early experimental stages and should be
used accordingly.   The Janus Wireless distribution provides a secure
environment for private group networking.   Please read the rest of
this document for a description of digital identity and group
networking features implemented in this release.


1.  Identity Management

The cornerstone of any secure system is the concept of digital
identity used to establish authenticated sessions and manage
resources.   The Janus Wireless software defines your identity with a
combination of passphrase and a USB memory stick.   Both of these
methods must be used together to authenticate you and should be
protected like you would protect keys to other valuable personal items
like a residence or vehicle.  It is very important that you understand
the security of your communications and data is dependant on the
security of your passphrase and USB memory stick.   Store these safely
and never use them on a computer where your passphrase may be captured
(key logger or shoulder surfer) or the USB memory copied.

Physically hardened tamper resistant and/or evident hardware tokens
may be used where needed for stronger authentication security.


2.  Boot Options

There are four different options to choose from when booting into a
secure operating system instance.   Each has a distinct purpose and
you must reboot your system when changing from one domain to another. 
 This may seem a bit cumbersome at first but this step is required to
ensure the security of the operating system by initializing the
computer with a known configuration from the BIOS bootstrap upward.

       keys :  The first option presented is the secure key management
mode which handles creation, modification, and distribution of digital
identities and the cryptographic keys associated with them.  All
interaction with this domain occurs via the USB memory stick and other
storage devices to implement a logical "air gap" boundary between this
secure domain and others.  No network services or capabilities are
provided.

       live :  Live mode provides a client environment that can run
directly off of the disc used to boot the computer.  Network support
is provided for establishing virtual private network connections.

    install :  A permanent installation on encrypted hard disk can be
deployed with this mode.  Please note that full disk encryption across
all partitions is required.

        hdd :  Encrypted operating systems stored on disk can be
launched with this option.  Note that the USB key used to install the
encrypted OS is required to boot.  If you lose this key or it becomes
corrupted all data will on disk will be lost.


 3.  Getting Started

Reboot into the 'keys' mode with a USB memory stick inserted to begin
creating user and resource identities.  Any live or hdd configuration
options can be defined at this point as well.


 4.  Additional Information

Invoke the 'about' command and select the desired topic for additional
information on using this software and other common questions.

Press the <Ctrl> <Alt> <Delete> keys or invoke the 'reboot' command to
restart the system and enter a different bootstrap target.
