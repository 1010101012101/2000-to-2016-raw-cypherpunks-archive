Hey guys, just ordered a bunch of the Super Stunk and Big Buddha Bud after trying some at a friend's. 
Really great shit you guys have there! I was actually kinda surprised by the prices, they're a lot lower 
than the other stuff I've been getting. All the buds I got off that last bunch will keep me tided over until
I get this order, that shit was so strong. Thanks.

One of our customers said this, what are you gonna say when you smoke our legal bud?
