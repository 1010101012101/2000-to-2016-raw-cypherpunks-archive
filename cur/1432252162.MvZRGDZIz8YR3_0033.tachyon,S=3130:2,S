Interesting piece on CNET:

http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-201-6208902-0.html?tag=tp_pr

A telling highlight:

> Analysts said Microsoft views instant messaging--a key element of
> Windows Messenger--as glue for its new Internet services such as
> Passport and HailStorm. Such services promise to simplify Web surfing
> by giving people a single online identity and providing secure access
> to personal information such as credit card numbers with one click.

It's that "single online identity" part that chafes me.  A pretty clear 
anti-nymity bias, as MS forges ahead in tying ones online 
presence irrevocably to their meatspace identity.
