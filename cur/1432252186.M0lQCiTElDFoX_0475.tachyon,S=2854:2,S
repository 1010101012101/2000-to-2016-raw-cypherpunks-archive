Oy.  You confuse things by discussing an RV.  The law states that some
vehicles may have a 'residential' space even while driving, which space
is protected as a residence.  Your friends can be drinking ethanol in
that space while you drive; this is illegal in Calif. if they're in a car's
cabin
with you.  Similarly with loaded gun sans CCW permit.
