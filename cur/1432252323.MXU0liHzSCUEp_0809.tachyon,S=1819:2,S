Dear Friend

I'm pleased to send you the interesting places and the interesting stories about Thailand. Go ahead-sit back, put up your feet and enjoy the 
hapiness of slowly browsing through http://www.shoppingaa.com/interesting/allinteresting.html
A lot of topics are waiting for you.

Sincerely yours,
Peter Juliano
