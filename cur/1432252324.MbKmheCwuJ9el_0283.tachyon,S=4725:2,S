Niels Provos will be talking at Stanford on Wednesday,
just a few hours before the EFF BOF at the Linux shindig in Oakland.

Does anybody have a picture of a Peter Honeyman related shirt to
auction off on E-Bay with appropriate embedded content?  :-)

Topic:		Detecting Steganographic Content on the Internet

Speaker:	Niels Provos
		CITI, University of Michigan

About the talk:

Steganography is used to hide the occurrence of communication.
Recent suggestions in US newspapers indicate that terrorists use
steganography to communicate in secret with their accomplices. In
particular, images on the Internet were mentioned as the
communication medium. While the newspaper articles sounded very
dire, none substantiated these rumors.

To determine whether there is steganographic content on the
Internet, this talk presents a detection framework that includes
tools to retrieve images from the world wide web and
automatically detect whether they might contain steganographic
content. To ascertain that hidden messages exist in images, the
detection framework includes a distributed computing framework
for launching dictionary attacks hosted on a cluster of loosely
coupled workstations. We have analyzed two million images
downloaded from eBay auctions but have not been able to find a
single hidden message.
