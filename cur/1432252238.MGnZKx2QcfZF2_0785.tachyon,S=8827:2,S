"Also keep in mind that there are no confirmed on the record cases to
date of a Tor 'break/weakness' having been used to find a user. It
appears to be only user error."

One of the perdurable claims of comsec promoters is that comsec
breaks and weaknesses inevitably turn out to be user errors. Exactly
who the fictitious user is remains obscure but assuredly means
somebody other than the comsec promoter user who inevitably
offers a greatly improved product, trust them.

Tor is especially adept at blaming users, itself faultless except for lack
of volunteers to patch its innumerable holes (caused by clueless users),
so much so one might think that is a feature derived from the religion
of national security (actually that is its source and shows its heritage
of exculpability) which inevitably fails due to lack of funding, political
  will, public support, unwillingness of youngsters to die for officer
careers, that is customers must suffer for company profits.

Has there been a better account of inevitable exculpability for
inevitable comsec failure than that by NSA in 1998?

Cyber Security Market Forecast 2014-2024: Prospects For Leading 
Companies in Military, Government, Critical Infrastructure & Private 
Sector Protection

Defence report


Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good 
reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, 
there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created 
substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected 
pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict 
damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has 
never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and 
enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing 
networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased 
integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as 
force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive 
vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and 
the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As 
a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global 
Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.
