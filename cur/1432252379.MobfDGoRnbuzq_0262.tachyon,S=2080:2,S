Jessica Stern's new book, "Terror in the Name of God : Why
Religious Militants Kill," has about 8 pages on Jim Bell, in
a chapter called "Lone Wolf Avengers," which is shared with
the Pakistani Kansai, assassin of CIA employees.

Stern says that while Bell is not a religion-based terrorist
he is included in the book as an example of the solo individual
with a private agenda that smacks of religion. This appears to 
be a stretch, but Stern stretches her material to fit an agenda.

A Stern footnote says the Bell material is based on the
forthcoming publication, "James Dalton Bell." She says
she had numerous telephone interviews with him beginning
in 2000 after making a request in 1998 during Jim's first
imprisonment.

Her capsule version of Jim's "crimes" and punishment is
a bellweather of what may be in store for other miscreants
who are fodder for terrorism careerists.

To be sure, Jim may get a movie made about him, and I guess
that would be his finest hour.

Stern says Jim's leadership potential has so far led only to
inspiring Carl Johnson to get himself thrown into prison.
