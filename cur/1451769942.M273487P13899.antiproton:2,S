Stating the obvious:

When he was arrested, it is likely that a phone with stored login
credentials for his personal accounts was in hostile hands for at
least a few hours.

He most likely expressed his displeasure with and hostile
intentions toward the SFPD to agents of SFPD before or during his
incarceration.  Coming from a "rich white geek" whose status as
such could be determined in ten seconds via any search engine, any
threats of lawful reprisals he might have made should have brought
all the defensive resources at SFPD's disposal into play.
Nothing posted in his name after the time of his arrest should be
taken at face value.

My cursory search for information about California law indicates
that an autopsy is not required for "known suicides", whatever
/that/ means.  Apparently the County Coroner gets to make that call.

I believe it would be a Good Thing if word was passed hand to hand
in the direction of Ian's family, to the effect that Conspiracy
Nuts will never let them hear the end of this unless an autopsy is
performed.  (And maybe not even then.)

No matter how it happened, Ian's death was a tragic loss to the
community, and closure won't come easily.
