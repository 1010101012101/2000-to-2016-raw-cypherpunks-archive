	So the fire was big enough to poison the biological systems aboard
 the plane, but not big enough to cause any substantial damage to the
mechanical systems - I guess that's a possibility. 

	For what it's worth, I don't subscribe to any particular theory, and I'm
not inclined to believe in terrists either. (Well, except for the big
terrorist organizations known as 'governments')
