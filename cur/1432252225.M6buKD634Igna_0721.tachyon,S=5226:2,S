Sure, but to what end? It's hardly an irrelevant question...

Fine. So how much anonymity do you anticipate having after the feds squirt 
a little of some new "nonlethal" substance straight down the middle of the 
thing and your vinegar hankies just aren't up to it? Go ahead, rack 
yourselves up like billiard balls for them--I'm sure they'll appreciate how 
much easier it is cleaning up the sticky foam afterwards. Speaking of 
which, here's a great quote about "nonlethals" from an awesome (and 
frightening) book on urban operations, "The City's Many Faces" by Russell 
W. Glenn, quoting someone from LASD:

"When I was in Somalia we had issues with foams, particularly sticky foam. 
I recall a conversation with our staff Judge Advocate that went something 
like this:

"Gunner, what happens if you shoot someone in the face?"

I said, "Sir?"

He says, "Will it stick their lips shut?"

I replied "yes Sir, it'll stick their lips shut."

He says, "Well, they'll die."

I said "yes Sir, and that's why *we* dont call it nonlethal.""


So much for that. The other emerging crowd control technologies might make 
you reconsider, too. Worth a look!!

And think of what a person really needs to be fully prepared to go into a 
riot situation--you'd be outfitted and equipped just like a fed. That's a 
clue for you right there. Of course, I guess you could always spraypaint 
your class IV body armor, locking plates, aramid fiber helmets etc. etc. 
pink or something. Or green. Now *that* would be a turtle suit worth 
talking about. But since nobody thinks its worth explaining why the bloc 
noir is more than symbolic, I guess it's a moot point. 

And IMHO the best way to achieve anonymity in meatspace? A great place to 
start would be by not deliberately engaging in "possibly illegal operations 
on the street in an environment full of police". You're doomed before you 
ever get started. But I could be wrong. Don't say I didn't tell you so.

Something to think about...

~Faustine.
