NAVARRE, Fla. (AP) -- A high school student has been charged with
violating Florida's wiretapping law after tape recording a chemistry class
lecture.
   
Asher Zaslaw, 17, pleaded not guilty to the third-degree felony in
juvenile court Tuesday. She faces a variety of penalties, including
community service and probation.
   
Zaslaw said she recorded the October lecture at Navarre High School
because she was having difficulty in the class and wanted to maintain good
grades.
