Interesting cultural differences.  In some locales (eg New Hampshire)
wardriving
is legal, much like walking on land that isn't posted.  Driving while
naked is not,
AFAIK, an offense under the CA DMV laws, although driving the wrong
direction
is.  And in other locales (various US states) young girls (eg 14) having
sex with older men is
legal if they have a state license, and consensual filming and
publishing of that would be legal.

Only driving the wrong way harms others, ie is truly a crime, assuming
that sexual activities are consensual.
And of course mere *bits* don't hurt anyone.

In some locales (eg under islamic law) mere images of humans are
illegal.

BTW, isn't it a bit chilly in Ontario to be driving half-dressed?  Must
have had the heater on.
