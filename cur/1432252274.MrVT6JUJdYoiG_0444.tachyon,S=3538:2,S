First, people are less likely to respond to whimsical nyms, even a 
stainless steel rat.

Second, you comment on Declan's forwarding of a forwarding of a Herb Lin 
call for reviewers for some study his group is doing. Ho hum.

Third, the issue of online porn, the CDA, the Amateur Action case, etc. 
have been discussed many times here.

Fourth, Cypherpunks are probably more interested in making sure Big Bro 
can't block porn, via technical means, than in advising Herb Lin on yet 
another study.

Fifth, you expressed your view of Herb's study. Absent some point, what 
is there is to discuss?

Sixth, you're always welcome to post more. Some things generate 
interest, some don't. Don't sweat the posts that don't. I don't.
