	Are you saying that government, whose nature is to not be subjected to
'market discipline', government that is able to tax(steal) borrow(cheat)
and spend trillions, spends money carefully? 

	Your remark seems to go against basic economic theory - and practice.

	Meaning? It's basically impossible to defend against an enemy that
controls the physical infrastructure. The problem here is political, not
technological. Although this is an aside.

	Exactly. And one of objectives is to spend all the money they get, and
more, so that their budget keeps growing. Now we've established that
economic constraints don't mean much to them.

	It isn't? 

	Anyway, here's your original assertion 

	"the NSA does not currently break Tor on demand at the protocol level."

	How do you know that? You don't? On the other hand, to assume that they do
it, or can do it if they want to, is a sensible assumption.

	
	you added 

	"said another way, breaking Tor at protocol level is currently too
expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means."

	which to me reads as an attempt at an economic proof of sorts, but the
economics don't add up. 

	Why wouldn't the US governemnt NOT play the role of 'global passive
adversary'? <---- that's a rhetorical question...

	Also, the assumption that they can get exactly the same results by pwning
target computers doesn't seem correct to me. Yes, there may be cases  when
that is true. But is that always true?

	Not really. The more money they 'need' the more taxes you pay. So, they
get all the resources they want, and you pay. Neat deal huh?
