In Red Hook, Mesh Network Connects Sandy Survivors Still Without Power

Wondering what kind of articles we feature on Personal Democracy Plus, our
subscription offering? Subscribers support this kind of original in-depth
reporting b but because this piece is focused on Hurricane Sandy relief so
soon after the storm, and to offer non-subscribers a look, we're offering it
to everyone. Red Hook Initiative is still accepting offers of donations and
volunteers.

When the New York City Housing Authority turned off power, water, and heat to
residents of the Red Hook Houses shortly before Hurricane Sandy arrived,
residents said, most of the more than 5,000 residents who live in the complex
chose not to leave. With the electricity went the means residents of the
Houses, the largest residential complex in Brooklyn, used to communicate with
the outside world. As the days dragged on and outrage spread over living
conditions, camera crews made their way in to catch a glimpse of people
suffering in the dark. Resident Khadijah Jones, speaking to the Village
Voice, described her situation as "our Katrina."

As of Sunday, some people had power back, but no heat. Others have no power
or heat. No one has Internet to their homes, and cell service is still spotty
too. But thanks to an experimental wireless network launched in the
neighborhood last year, some of them were able to gain Internet access back
this weekend b even if they did not have power yet in their building. Through
a mesh network first launched in November 2011 through a local nonprofit,
residents after the storm were able to alert people to their needs over
social media and check up on relatives. Access is limited and the network
could, at the time, support only about 100-150 connections simultaneously.
But in the wake of a disaster that created a new camaraderie in Manhattan
around cellphone charging stations and free wifi, New Yorkers can appreciate
that when the neighborhood goes dark, even a scrap of a link to the outside
world is better than nothing.

Jones and I had kept in touch since I'd first interviewed her several months
ago about her work doing community outreach for the Red Hook Initiative, a
local nonprofit that focuses on training programs for kids and adults,
community outreach, and working with media. The first time Jones and I spoke
after the storm, she was camping out in Flatbush, Brooklyn, busy applying for
Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance on her friend's computer.
She'd fled the Red Hook Houses after enduring several days without heat,
light, or water, but came home two days later to check in on neighbors and
help friends and community members apply for FEMA assistance on available
computers at the Red Hook Initiative's offices on Hicks Street.

As the Red Hook Initiative became a de facto hub for Occupy Sandy volunteer
coordination, donation collections, and food distribution, it also became a
beacon of connectivity for volunteers and neighborhood residents without
power in their homes. Sandy's devastating flooding had rendered much local
telecommunication infrastructure useless, but perhaps because of RHI's
relative distance from the worst flooding at the piers lining the bay b or
just plain luck b the power was back up and running at RHI the morning after
the storm. Back in November, RHI placed two wifi "mesh nodes" on its roof,
the product of joint efforts of activist Jonathan Baldwin and RHI's media
programs coordinator, Tony Schloss. The nodes blanketed the surrounding block
with wifi connected to the global Internet through a Verizon FiOS connection.
When people came in to RHI to get warm, they also charged their phones,
called worried relatives, and checked their email.

Mesh networks are often used for "last mile" rural Internet access because
they enable wifi coverage to spread over a larger area than it would through
traditional, centralized, "hub-and-spoke" model networks. When a
hub-and-spoke network's hub goes down, the spokes all lose connectivity. Mesh
networks are all spokes. If one fails, traffic can find another route through
other nodes to get to the Internet b so long as the point or points in the
mesh that are also connecting to the Internet still have their connection b
or to continue communicating with one another. These networks come in
different configurations. Some are meticulously planned by communities and
span cities like Vienna, Athens and rural Catalonia in Europe, offering
alternatives to established Internet service providers. Others are set up in
the wake of disasters to provide temporary connections, as seen in
post-tsunami Indonesia. The newest crop of technical projects in the mesh
community aim to make setting up spontaneous networks easier. One such
project is the Open Technology Institute's Commotion software project, which
Baldwin currently uses to run the nodes at RHI.

On Friday night, Baldwin, who had by then taken a field analyst position at
the Open Technology Institute, called me with exciting news. Apparently a
FEMA guy named Frank was interested in expanding those mesh nodes into a
full-fledged network to bring Internet back to the community. He'd recruited
a team of hackers from D.C. to come up and work with the Information
Technology Disaster Resource Center, a disaster communications nonprofit, and
figure out how to feed into existing community efforts. For nine months, I'd
been documenting the evolution of Baldwin's own efforts to build a community
wifi network in Red Hook. This was an unexpected development.

Frank Sanborn is a newly minted innovation fellow at FEMA and the Department
of Health and Human Services, part of a cohort of people brought in from
outside government for intense short-term work in one of several areas. He
flew into New York on a red eye on Monday to help the agency's local
operations set up connectivity in disaster shelters around the boroughs. FEMA
has 175 iPads it provides to assist with sign language interpretation and
other special needs of those who want to apply for assistance from the
agency. FEMA coordinated with an independent nonprofit from Texas to set up
satellite communications that provide the connectivity for the iPads, which
travel with teams at local relief centers around hard-hit areas like the
Rockaways. This past weekend, the ITDRC's Mobile Recovery Technology center b
housed on a decked-out white school bus b sat parked in the IKEA lot as the
nonprofit's staffers busied themselves helping FEMA set up Internet inside of
the Red Hook IKEA store, which had invited FEMA to set up a local
headquarters in its cafe.

Sanborn wanted more of the kind of bandwidth allotted for these iPads to
provide Internet access for the community. He told me that usually when FEMA
comes in, they focus on taking care of bandwidth for their own needs rather
than the public's need for Internet access. But he wanted Red Hook to be
different.

"Community wifi seemed like a natural solution," he told me at the cafe early
Saturday morning, as he sat emailing the mayor's office and other
organizations working on disaster relief.

A member of Sanborn's FEMA innovations team had introduced him to hackers in
D.C working on ad-hoc networks, and New York-based technologist Sean
McIntyre, who'd been volunteering on the ITDRC bus, clued him in to
pre-existing community efforts to spread wifi connectivity in the Red Hook
community. ITDRC was ready to donate a satellite uplink from ViaSat for the
wifi network over at RHI. The makings of an unlikely coalition were born.

Over the weekend, this scrappy team of hackers, government officials, and
do-gooder nonprofit workers set to work augmenting the pre-existing network
in Red Hook. The D.C team usually works on mesh software tools they call
"Project Byzantium."

But the pre-existing RHI nodes run on different software called Commotion,
often referred to in the media by its alternate moniker, "Internet in a
Suitcase." The primary difference between the two is the mechanism through
which data in the network gets passed around, called a "routing protocol."
These routing protocols are at the heart of what makes pop-up networks
possible. Up until Tuesday, Byzantium ran on a routing algorithm called
Babel, while Commotion utilizes OLSR. The team sprinted over the course of a
few days to make their software compatible with Commotion.

On Sunday morning, two ITDRC volunteers brought a satellite dish and
installed it on the roof of RHI. The Byzantium team, with Baldwin, configured
a set of routers to run Commotion software. With backing from FEMA and a new
community imperative to do good in the post-Sandy world, a neighbor who'd
been reticent about offering roof access to serve as host for a node gladly
opened his doors. With two days of work, the network's coverage area doubled,
providing enough capacity for hundreds of residents to connect at any given
time. Where the network was previously only really good within a few hundred
meters of RHI, it now spread to Red Hook Houses' central courtyard and
several of its buildings.

"I've been trying to expand the network for the better part of the year, and
now all this happens in two days," Baldwin happily reflected Sunday as work
wrapped up for the night. Team Byzantium exchanged high fives and headed
headed back to D.C with new field experience under their belts.

Now the hard work begins: turning these temporary efforts into sustainable,
longer-term infrastructure. With four rooftop nodes as of Monday morning, the
mesh network is still nascent. Each large node supports about 50-150 users at
a time, and a fifth smaller one -- placed indoors at RHI -- is the type of
router you see in homes. It powers about 25 connections at a time. Baldwin
says they were maxed out for most of the week as residents accessed the
network, largely through their mobile phones. When it went down briefly on
Sunday, as they transferred from FiOS to the satellite link, a handful of
people came over within an hour to ask what had happened.

Sanborn told me multiple times over the course of the weekend that the key
goal of these FEMA efforts is sustainability b that his job is to facilitate
grass-roots community efforts, not come in with a heavy hand and start from
scratch.

"Feeding into pre-existing efforts in communities is key: it's clear that
that's the vision going forward," he said. "It wasn't clear a week ago. Now
it is."

I introduced Sanborn to Jones, of Red Hook Initiative, late Sunday night at
the RHI building, where the mesh team is huddled in the back to figure out
next steps for outreach and deployment. Khadijah told Frank about all of the
residents who've been applying for FEMA aid through the efforts of the Red
Hook Initiative over the last week, and who had relied on this community
organization as a lifeline. Frank was somber.

"I'm so honored to be able to do this," he said. "I shut down my company to
come out and do it. It's a humbling thing."
