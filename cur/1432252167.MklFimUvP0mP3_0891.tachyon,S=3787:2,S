Is that stream of emails public accessible somewhere?  If not, why?

It is packaged for Debian, available in untable (Sid) and testing  
(Wheezy).

Being rather new, also as upstream code, it certainly could use some  
actual crash-testing, though:  Please anyone interesting in shipping this 
in future FreedomBoxen strongly consider installing the Debian package 
yourself on your own machines, play with it, and file bugreports about any 
and all issues you run across with it.

I find it odd having you (or anyone - not personal) proxy in the first  
place.
