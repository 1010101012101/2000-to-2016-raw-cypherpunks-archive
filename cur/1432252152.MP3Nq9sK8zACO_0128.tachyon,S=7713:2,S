Strikes me as being a circular argument, since  which activities
are "sufficiently safe to be economically viable" depends on
the size of the awards.

Less misanthropic ones,  maybe.  We more misanthropic
critics are more likely to complain about being prevented from
engaging activities which we know damn well contain an
element of risk,  a risk we are willing to assume  because
in our judgement the benefits outweigh the risks.

I had to read this about a dozen times before it made sense to me,
here's why:  there's an implicit assumption here that the "damages"
awarded in liability lawsuits acurately reflects the actual damages
suffered by the plaintiff.  The impression I get is that awards tend to
be orders of magnitude larger than they should be.

I really don't think so.  I think we're at the point where around 10-50 
million dollars are spent per life saved,  and I don't think most 
people are worth anything near that.  I wouldn't even value my
own life that highly;  that is to say,  I probably wouldn't take certain 
death for 50 million, because I'm not sure what I'd spend the money 
on if I were dead, booze and hookers would do me no good,  but
I'd probably take a 10% chance of death for 5 million.

I suspect when you do the economical analysis,  if you
assume your damages awarded actually equal damages suffered,
with strict liability you end up with the same products on the
market and the same corporate profits as you would in a world 
where you assume no strict liability but that assume customers 
are able to correctly evaluate risks in their purchasing decisions,
the main difference being that with strict liability the costs are 
smeared over all consumers and without it the costs are 
born solely by the ones that suffer mishaps.
