Or a normal standard VPN. Either classical IPsec, or another
implementation, eg. <http://www.openvpn.org/> which works over UDP on port
5000 (default), but can be reconfigured to eg. the mentioned 53. (The
advantage of OpenVPN is also for the ISPs that demand additional charges
for using VPNs and block IPsec packets for residential-grade users.)

The adversary then can block 53 and demand use of their own resolvers.

Then the VPN can be rewritten to use TCP connection over port 80,
optionally with HTTPS proxy support.

There is always a solution, if there is an accomplice "outside".

When brains are outlawed, only outlaws will think. (Seems the future goes
in this direction.)
