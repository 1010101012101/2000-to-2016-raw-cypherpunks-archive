Juan,

To dumb me you appear utopist.

Please explain in simple words the IMPLEMENTATION of your New Order (in
case you have order).

In particular explain:

1. How do you distribute goods (food, shelter, shiny J-Pads, money? etc)
2. How do you deal with dishonest people and criminals?
3. How do you deal with people against your New Order?
4. How do you deal with current oligarchs in the New Order?
5. How do you prevent corruption?

IMHO a major problem is that sheeple are too buggy/easy to manipulate
and don't want freedom, they just want shiny J-Pads, facebook, etc.

there'd be peace."
