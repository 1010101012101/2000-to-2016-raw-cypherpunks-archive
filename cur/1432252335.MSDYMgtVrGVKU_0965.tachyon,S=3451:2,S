As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,
     I've got a little list--I've got a little list
Of society offenders who might well be underground,
     And who never would be missed--who never would be missed!
There's the pestilential nuisances who write for autographs--
All people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs--
All children who are up in dates, and floor you with 'em flat--
All persons who in shaking hands, shake hands with you like _that_--
And all third persons who on spoiling tete-a-tetes insist--
     They'd none of 'em be missed--they'd none of 'em be missed!

I'll take that as a badge of honor. Or something. Hey, any of you
posters here, ever noticed unusual scrutiny on flights, whether
domestic, or international?

I am a German tor operator too and the provider of my server got the
same BKA case. Because the provider closed my server, I asked the press
for help. The investigation of the press got the following results:

1: The BKA operation "MIKADO" was closed in the first week of January 2007.

2: Official letters declaring it was closed, were not send. If you asked
for official letter, you will get one.

3: May be, affected tor operators will be listed in a database. I do not
know more about the database, I got only a (unofficial) warning by the
investigating journalist: "There is a database and you are listed."

May be, the information about the closed BKA operation is interesting
for other operators too.
