A while ago, a friend and I bought a smoke detector and a webcam, hacked
them together, and built this:
http://www.inventgeek.com/Projects/AlphaRad/OverView.aspx

It actually works; when you view the webcam you can see the little
points of light where an alpha particle hits the sensor.

However, there wasn't really any software to support it as an RNG, so
it's just sitting around.

Is it possible to make an entropy source out of something like that? If
so, it was a really simple (less than two hours IIRC) build, and it cost
about $40.
