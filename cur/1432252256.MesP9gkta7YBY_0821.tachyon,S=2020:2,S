For years, the RIAA has claimed that having the IP address of a computer 
that has shared unauthorized files is the equivalent of having the evidence 
of who was actually sharing files. That, of course, is false. The IP 
address simply can help you know who paid for the Internet access, but not 
who was using what computer on a network. In fact, this even had some 
people suggesting that, if you want to win a lawsuit from the RIAA, you're 
best off <http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040518/1443220.shtml>opening 
up your WiFi network to neighbors. It seems like this strategy might 
actually be working.
