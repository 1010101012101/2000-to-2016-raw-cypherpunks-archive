Subject: Matt- seeking info on U.N. Summit on Guns

Matt:
I wonder if I could impose on you to post a request for info to your 
amazingly well-informed list members on the UN Global Firearms 
Summit.  Your previous posting of my request for help on the SWAT 
article for Playboy was immensely helpful.
Thanks!
Jim


XXXX
I am a journalist working on a magazine article on the United Nations 
Global Firearms Summit scheduled for July in New York.  A recent 
United Nations video, "Armed to the Teeth: The Worldwide Plague of 
Small Arms," declared, "Small arms are not fussy about the company 
they keep. They're constantly traveling from conflict to conflict, 
and they can murder indiscriminately."

Such statements have raised concerns about whether the summit could 
be a stepping stone towards an international agreement to restrict 
private gun ownership.

I am seeking information on the following:

1) Any details or other information on what will happen at the summit 
and the impact the summit might have on the rights of civilian gun 
ownership

2) Statements by the United Nations in the past regarding citizens' 
right to own firearms

3) Statements, positions, or actions on civilians' right to own guns 
by some of the key attendees or foreign governments involved in the 
summit

I would be much obliged for any hard facts or solid quotes anyone 
could provide.

Thanks,
Jim Bovard
