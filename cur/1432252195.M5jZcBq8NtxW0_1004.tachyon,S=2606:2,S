                In the most significant gun control measure of the year,

                Governor Davis approved legislation that requires
handgun
                owners to pass a written test and prove to a state
instructor that
                they know how to handle a gun safely. The laws, which go
into
                effect in 2003, also require new owners of handguns to
provide
                the Department of Justice with a thumbprint.
