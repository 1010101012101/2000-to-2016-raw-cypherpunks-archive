The moral disease of homosexuality is rooted in the godless metaphysics of 
evolutionism. Evolutionism is the theory, homosexuality is the practice.
Evolutionists fail to distinguish between the anus and the vagina because 
they both appear as a hole. It is the same ideology that refuses to 
distinguish between human bones and monkey bones because they both appear 
as bones. This is like failing to distinguish between a rocket launcher and 
a pipe because they both appear as a tube. However, nobody makes that 
mistake becuase everybody applies intellegent design theory, not 
evolutionism, to those things.
Many evolutionists take this ideology to its logical limit. Since their 
belief system predicts the anus and the vagina are both purposeless holes 
with no difference between them there is no reason not to engage in the 
using of either one--with the easier-to-obtain anusus winning out. This is 
where homosexuality comes from.
Well, what are the actual consequences of this behavior? Anus-stuffing 
evolutionists think they have deceived G-d because they have deceived 
themselves, but G-d is not mocked and he will have his vengence! Returning 
to our analogy, the vagina, like the pipe, is designed for bi-directional 
flow. The anus, like the rocket launcher, only launches one way! If you 
continue to stuff anuses, like stuffing a rocket launcher--an explosion 
will inevitably occur. This is what's happening in the world today.
Global warming is really caused by the wrath of G-d against the rampant 
anus-stuffing society known as the Netherlands. G-d intends to melt the 
polar ice caps in order to drown that most sinful lowland nation like he 
did to the world in the days of Noah--and this time, there will be no 
litttle Dutch boys to stick their fingers in the dyke-holes to stop it. 
That will only be the beginning, the day of reckoning for the continual 
stuffing anuses for ll of humanity will then be upon us! (partially 
described in Revelation)
Jesus loves you and so does Pinhead
