This is, I hate to say it, the one time I am glad that they can do
this.  I hope they can find out who is responsible for this.  I hope some
other brave souls were able to use their cell phones to provide clues to
find these bastards.

No, I'm still opposed to the NSA's invasion of our privacy.  But in a
twisted way, I hope they can track these fuckers down.
