Found this in HOPE 9 schedule:

https://ostel.me/

This service is a public testbed of the Open Secure Telephony Network  
(OSTN) project, with the goal of promoting the use of free, open  
protocols, standards and software, to power end-to-end secure voice  
communications on mobile devices, as well as with desktop computers. This 
service is in public beta. Calls placed throug the system are encrypted and 
authenticated between peers. It is continually being tested and improved to 
ensure the best possible security. Logging is minimal and work is being 
done to ensure no unecessary IP addresses are stored on disk.

Again: Is the source public? Have there been reviews/audits? Jake? :)
