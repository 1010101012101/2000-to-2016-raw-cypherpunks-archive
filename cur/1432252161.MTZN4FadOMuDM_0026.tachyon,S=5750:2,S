Well...we all gotta go sometime.Kill the head and the body will die.

Im a really loving guy but Ive got a job to do too.
Dubya is clearly not up to snuff,like a bison leading a herd to a terrible 
escarpment he should be shot.Operation soft drill,the real 'operation of 
the century'nominates the shrub."Id buy that for a dollar"
The secret service know where I live,fuck them.
Crimes against humanity need an effective system of international justice.
Assasination politics has as much claim for consideration as any other.
At least as long as there is something called freedom (of speech) FREEDOM 
numero uno,remember?
Afghanistan's where old empires go to die.
Eat your dirty heart out amerikkka.
Attack on america? HA! You aint seen nuthin yet.
FUCK America and all who sail in her.



Never forget 79,the entire east coast nearly became uninhabitable for 
250,000 years.(I was in the US then)
