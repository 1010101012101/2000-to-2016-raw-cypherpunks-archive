	Always a good reason if you can do it.

	Maybe we should all take to wearing a safety pin on our shirts, and 
when people ask about it say "It's not a safety pin, it's a Crypto 
Awareness Ribbon", and when "they" say "but there's no ribbon there", 
say "Yes, there is, it's just that you can't see it...".

	(For the more literal minded among you, this is a joke).

	4) Economy of scale. Software designed and written for 100000000 
people is usually much cheaper than software designed and written for 10.

	5) Cover traffic. If every stinking thing on the wire was encrypted 
(at least once), then an encrypted transmission garners no additional 
scrutiny. If only 1 out of 1 million transmissions are encrypted, then 
The Department Of They has a greater sususpion that you're saying 
something they want to hear.
