"Standard Operating Procedure 303", also known as the "National
Emergency Wireless Kill-Switch". Names of individuals within the
current chain-of-command to exercise SOP-303 are not requested, nor
necessary. Please only provide the roles/titles and position in
chain-of-command to exercise the SOP-303 National Emergency Wireless
Kill-Switch capability. In defense of a possible Glomar retort, please
recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer
(T-AG-193), for which the Glomar response is so named, was a purely
military operation, using custom-built military equipment, on an
exceptionally sensitive military mission to recover military

interest without exposure of sensitive information or operational
detail. Thank you!
