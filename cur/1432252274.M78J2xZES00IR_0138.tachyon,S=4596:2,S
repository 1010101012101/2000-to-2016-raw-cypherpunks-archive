  All laptop users need privacy and computer security. Rayservers now meets
  both needs with a simple out-of-the-box solution.

  Panama City, Panama (PRWEB) March 1, 2007 -- Today, Rayservers introduced
  the next advance in computer security, its Secure-Out-of-the-Box laptop
  computers. These laptops offer 100% encrypted hard drives and privacy
  protected internet access for safe communications.

  Companies face huge liabilities when they use insecure laptops

  Unlike ordinary laptops, Rayservers laptops offer unparalleled privacy and
  computer security. Rayservers' computers protect users from identity
  thieves, corporate spies, data vandals, extortionists and much, much worse.

  Who Needs Computer Security?

  Anyone can have their ordinary insecure laptop invaded from the Internet or
  physically stolen. The media is full of stories about high government
  officials and corporate executives who have lost their -- and OUR --
  personal data when their unencrypted laptops were stolen. Even the FBI lost
  160 laptops last year.

  Professionals, especially, need to take computer security seriously.
  Lawyers have to preserve privileged client communications. Human rights
  activists need to protect contacts living under repressive regimes.
  Journalists must protect their sources and work-product. Everyone has need
  for more privacy than ordinary laptops can provide.

  Secure-Out-of-the-Box laptops from Rayservers are the long-needed solution.

  "Companies face huge liabilities when they use insecure laptops," said
  Sandy Sandfort, CEO of Rayservers. "In the UK, the Nationwide Building
  Society was fined #980,000 because of a laptop that was stolen from an
  employee. At Rayservers we offer security consulting, migration training
  and support to help companies better comply with Sarbanes Oxley, privacy
  legislation such as HIPAA and the California Privacy Act."
