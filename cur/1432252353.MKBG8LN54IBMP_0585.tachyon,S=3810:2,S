Many places have 'mask laws' which criminalize the wearing of masks
in public. Some times there are exceptions for costume balls, etc, but
generally these laws are very selectively enforced. I seem to remember
there were some prosecutions in the US in relation to the WTO protests
and in London following the May Day protests.

Unless there is a specific loophole for Muslim women's veils, I suppose
they are technically in violation, but as I said, these laws are hardly
ever invoked. If say, there were a rash of terrorist attacks involving
veiled
persons occured, there'd be crackdown.
