the OIG report on mind-altering drugs used during interrogations is
indeed informative!

All seemed well until the morning of August 6, 2010, when the veteran,
needing to process his student visa, crossed back into the United
States. He handed over his passport at the border patrol office at the
Calais, Maine port of entry and, according to an FBI report, was
detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for “questioning in
an espionage matter.” That very day—timing too exact to be
coincidental—Detective Kniss filed a criminal complaint against DeHart
in Tennessee for the child porn investigation, nearly two whole years
after the alleged conduct. FBI agents took DeHart from the border
station to a windowless examination room. According to the veteran, he
was pushed into what looked like a dentist’s chair and administered a
forced IV that made him feel drugged—an interrogation technique
practiced at Guantanamo. About 20 minutes later, he was taken to a
conference area and interrogated by the FBI, his requests for a lawyer
denied. Using the new child porn filing as leverage—DeHart says an
agent told him the bureau knew he was not guilty in that matter—the
FBI extracted a forced confession that interpreted the embassy visits
as attempts to sell military secrets in an arrangement involving other
soldiers from the Indiana base. In DeHart’s telling, he was also
questioned about Anonymous and WikiLeaks. The agents ultimately
arrested him on the child porn charges and deposited him in a Bangor
jail, where he collapsed. An ambulance took him to Eastern Maine
Medical Center; there a medical report was made that called him
“paranoid and delusional with an idea of the FBI monitoring him and
accusing him of espionage.” The ER personnel released DeHart into the
FBI’s hands. Agents then interrogated him for two weeks without
counsel present, interviews the FBI acknowledges but the reports for
which remain classified. At one point, DeHart claims, he was hooded
and tasered. The bureau also acquired his “consent” to take over his
online aliases; the defendant would later warn through the National
Post that “They are becoming you on the Internet—specifically for the
purpose of going after Anonymous.” During one of his court appearances
in this time frame, Judge Margaret Kravchuk raised questions about the
case, calling it “odd,” but nevertheless ordered DeHart sent to
Nashville for pre-trial detention.
