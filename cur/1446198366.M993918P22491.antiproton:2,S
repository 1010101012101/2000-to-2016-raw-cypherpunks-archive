Subject: Amish man sues government to buy firearm without photo ID

If Mr. Hertzler wins his lawsuit against the U.S. federal government
it may set an interesting legal precedent for religious Australian's
who want to obtain a gun licence without photo ID.

I believe that any sane, reasonably minded human without a serious
criminal record has a natural law, common law and a human rights to
own and bear guns for recreation, self-defence and protection of their
life, liberty and property. You certainly cannot trust government or
the police to protect you and your loved ones 24/7 against armed
criminals.
