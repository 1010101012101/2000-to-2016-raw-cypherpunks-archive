      That's irrelevant -- the fedz, and even state courts, are already giving
the heaviest sentences to 
protesters of anytime in our history. And you obviousely have never taken part
in any street actions. 
They've got a good idea -- one of the tactics used by cops for quite awhile is
to have undercover 
agents in the crowd who spot the *real* troublemakers, leaders, etc. and then
often an "affinity 
squad" will target that individual. By making it very difficult to
differentiate any individuals, that 
whole cop tactic becomes useless. 
       The other part of the bloc is that by staying together in a tight group,
they can grab arrestees 
from the cops more easily. We used to have groups of two or three who worked
together this way, 
more is better.
