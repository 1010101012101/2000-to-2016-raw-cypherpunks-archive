You must not have looked very hard. :)

I would start by taking Apache, openssl, and the mod_ssl package.
For example, at
    http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_howto.html#ToC6
we see the question "How can I authenticate clients based on
certificates when I know all my clients?" and it's answer.
Similar questions are also answered.
