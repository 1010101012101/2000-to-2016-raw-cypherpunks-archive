TRUST SERVICES

DoveBid believes that transaction support services are an integral element of our total capabilities. In order to enhance the DoveBid customer experience, we have formed strategic alliances with several companies to offer buyers access to a wide range of transaction support services, including SquareTrade for dispute resolution and trust solutions.

Dispute Resolution
SquareTrade provides DoveBid users a neutral, efficient, and cost-effective process for resolving disputes resulting from online transactions. SquareTrade's proprietary web-based Dispute Resolution Service allows transacting parties to define, prioritize, and resolve issues as they occur. SquareTrade's international network of over 250 trained, professional mediators and arbitrators is available to both parties to help reach a mutually agreeable solution. 

Trust Seal Program 
The SquareTrade Seal Program provides online sellers the necessary tools for instilling buyer confidence, increasing liquidity and demonstrating commitment to customer service. When displayed on a company's Web site and within DoveBid listings, the Seal indicates a seller's pledge to providing a high level of customer service, and to using SquareTrade's online dispute resolution service should a dispute arise. To obtain the digitally watermarked Seal, sellers are individually screened through identity verification and reference checks. 

The SquareTrade Seal -- displayed proudly by members because of what it represents:  Trust.  Reliability.  Good business standards.  Superior service.  And for what it provides: Increased sales.  Buyer confidence. Customer retention.  Lower costs.  So where is your Seal?
