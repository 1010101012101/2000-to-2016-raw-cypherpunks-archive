Leather or wet clothes may shield most of the body. A wild 
guess to protect the eyes would be something that puts a 
transparent conductive material over them - mirror 
sunglasses, the mylar glasses used for eclipse observations 
(though you could not see anything else through them :-(), 
or the conductive, mostly transparent plastic material 
which is used to package static sensitive electronic components.
Another possibility is to make goggles out of metal flyscreen -
since the wavelength is 3mm, it's doubtful that they can penetrate.
Chain mail would also work for the body.
