Hi,

In light of the recent thread on journalism, I wanted to share this link
about Skype:


https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2012/dec/china-listening-skype-microsoft-assumes-you-approve

"With 250 million monthly connected users, Skype is one of the most
popular services for making phone calls as well as chatting over the
Internet. If you have friends, family or business contacts abroad,
chances are you are using Skype to keep in contact. Having said that,
you are probably not aware that all your phone calls and text chats can
be monitored by the censorship authorities in China. And if you are
aware, chances are that you do not consent to such surveillence.
Microsoft, however, assumes that you do consent, as expressed in their
Privacy Policy:

"Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating
your communication may provide personal data, communications content
and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or
government authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will
provide reasonable assistance and information to fulfill this request
and you hereby consent to such disclosure.

All the best,
Jacob
