    Not likely. Most people I know buy pot by the quarter or half oz. 
Some by the oz. Fifteen grams is pretty small amount, just growing one plant 
will give you a few ounces, even a pound. 
    OTOH, being able to walk around with 15 grams in your pocket and smoke it
openly, more or less, would be fantastic.
