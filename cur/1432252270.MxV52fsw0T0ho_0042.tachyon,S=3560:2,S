Ditto for me, though I haven't received any unusual visitors.

I installed a standard one-way viewer some years ago, and I usually 
check to see who is knocking before I answer. I haven't yet had reason 
to remain silent and not answer. (I installed the viewer after being 
foolishly served with a subpoena.)

I'm considering a major upgrade to a t.v. camera system. The wireless 
X10 cameras seem to be interesting. (The wireless doesn' t much bother 
me, as the views will be of outside.)

I'm not yet ready to install Claymore mines linked to motion sensors, 
for various reasons, but I think the war that is coming will often 
involve private citizens killing Nazi narcs.

It's really time we stop aiding those planning to take away our 
liberties in support of ZOG.
