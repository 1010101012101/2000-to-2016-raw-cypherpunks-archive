Are you suggesting the outage was caused by carbon filaments rocketed
across transmission lines? If that was done at several points in the grid it 
would account for the various finger-pointing to incidents which are claimed
to have started the usual-suspect "cascade" of the usual-suspect "antiquated" 
system that was "not supposed to fail but it did."

Perhaps a re-inventory of the USAF's storehouse of BLU-114s is needed to
double-check that story about lightning strike.
