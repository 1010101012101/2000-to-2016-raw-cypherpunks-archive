West Texas is where kids learn to fuck jackrabbits 
by slitting their guts to fashion a pokehole. The jacks' 
death kicking of the cojones is what leaves an urge in 
them as adults to spread the practice to the state, the 
nation, the world, any place to hunt gash.

You thought dove hunting is what drew visitors to the
state. Heh. Think of the joy of hurling inseminated rabbit 
guts at depleted confreres.
