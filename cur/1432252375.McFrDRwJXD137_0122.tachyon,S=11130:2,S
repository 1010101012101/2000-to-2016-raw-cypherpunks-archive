While I feel worry for the man who is being "wasted" by the system, what he is
really going to jail for is his failure to uphold the Law of the Land - the
Common Law. He is going to jail while the "law" that protects the fraudsters
from having to produce legal tender is "upheld". Those idiots who think they are
jurors are morons.

His complete ignorance of what is the /Law of the Land/ is what has got him in
jail and he has obviously failed in a lifetime to defend anyone in a common law
court of record. For being a "public defender", he is incompetent to defend himself.

See: http://www.rayservers.com/blog/what-is-freedom

and the entire http://1215.org/ site.

Those of you who believe the constitution is the law of the land, or worse, that
the Acts emitted by the Gang of 535 are "Law", believe in fairies.... no, that
is too kind: Idol worshippers, I'd say. This is not to say that the gangsters
who run the show, won't torture you to death for not worshipping their idols.

The entire tragedy is because the common people have forgotten the common law
and lawful money and trust their purchasing power to the criminals who run this
circus. See: http://www.rayservers.com/blog/fraudulent-finance-for-dummies

Capitalists are not those who work with imaginary, unlawful "money". Those
people are called communists or more accurately criminals, with some of them
being more equal than others. See http://www.rayservers.com/the-law

Want to put an end to the abomination? You are a capitalist with capital?
Actually have a Lawful source of funds?  http://gsf.li/

Cheers,
