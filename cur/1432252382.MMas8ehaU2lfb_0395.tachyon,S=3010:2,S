"An Assistant US Attorney in Seattle has threatened a CBS 
60 Minutes reporter who is investigating the prosecution 
of James Dalton Bell in Western Washington District Court, 
warning the reporter that a subpoena will be issued for his 
information if he continues to investigate the case and its 
broader ramifications. 

According to a confidential source, AUSA Robb London, 
the prosecutor of the Bell case, warned 60 Minutes reporter 
Adam Ciralsky that a subpoena would be issued to Ciralsky 
for information about persons he had spoken to about the 
case and what he had learned if Ciralsky continued with 
his investigation."
