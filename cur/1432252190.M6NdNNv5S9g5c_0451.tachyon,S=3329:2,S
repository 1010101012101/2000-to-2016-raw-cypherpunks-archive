There are many voices and styles of discourse, and to be sure
a variety of ways to moderate by intimidation and ridicule and
proclaiming the one true way to do it without seeming to. 

Different strokes, differing anarchies, and archies pretending 
otherwise. That is what makes this commons more interesting
than the closed salons. Which by no means precluded all the
vile behavior each of us foams about as if not a practitioner.

I miss the variety of serious and humorous discourse of Detweiler, 
Vulis, Toto, Perry, Gilmore, Sandy, Harry Hawk, Eric Hughes,
come to think of it, a whole collection of accused misfits here, 
or could it be the misfits are still here accusing. Doesn't matter 
in the long run. Even unwarranted accusations have a place in 
the foaming, could be that's what mouths were made for.

Tim is best funny, way out humor, borderline breached, thin
skinned reactionary. Western civ.
