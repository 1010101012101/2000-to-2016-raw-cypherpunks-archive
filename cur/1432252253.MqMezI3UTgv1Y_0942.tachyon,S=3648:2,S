Yeah but then you have to explain that you have an implant or
somesuch when you trigger the magnetometer.  

This 'dual activator system' ---the equivalent of a mechanical pin you must pull or push to arm the primary trigger--- is the solution to the mechanical
trigger problem.

If all you want to do is drop it, a perfume bottle with some
volitile nerve agent will work ---do pilots have separate air? 

Amusingly, a plane flew over rural NorCal, pilotless, after it escaped
while being worked on.  Presumably it crashed somewhere in the hills.
No talk of F15s because the un-pilot called the FAA.

And, a small plane (piloted by arabic-surnamed but nonhostile people, because
Allah has a twisted sense of humor) crashed a mile from San Onofre 
---communities around which may be offered KI, its also reported.

Curiouser and curiouser.
