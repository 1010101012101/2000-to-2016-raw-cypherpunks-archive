Bullshit, the ONLY objection that I have EVER had was proposals that
imposed policies or operating process on ALL operators OR(!!!) imposed
filtering on the backbone. Neither of these will I tolerate.

This neither effects the backbone nor is there somebody trying to tell me
what to do with my property (ie SSZ).

And I applaud your effort. This is exactly(!) why the backbone needs to
remain clean and unfiltered, so that INDIVIDUALS may decide what is in
their best interest versus some fucking kabala with its own agenda.

When you're up and ready to go let me know and I'll add you to my backbone
feed. Also, please post a reasonably detailed email with your policy,
suitable for framing of course, so that I can update the SSZ homepage. I'd
also post any details of your process (ie scripts) if you wish to share
them.
