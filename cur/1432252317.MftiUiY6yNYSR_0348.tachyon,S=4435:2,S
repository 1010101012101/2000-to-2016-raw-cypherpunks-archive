I may have killed my point in editing.

Laws are the result of people using their property to advance their agenda. 

When harassment laws were proposed, companies chose not to use their property 
to fight these laws.  Today when they give into these laws rather than fight 
them, they are again making a decision about how they use their property.

Companies tend to value their property more than they value the free expression 
of their employees.  Is this surprising?  Is it wrong?  Should companies 
be compelled to value the free expression of their employees higher?

I don't like the current situation with zero-tolerance policies and all 
that any more than you do, but it's not the result of living in an unfree 
society.  It's the result of living in a society with different values than 
our own.

In other words, to get the freedoms we want, we have to take away other 
freedoms.

I'll always miss the point of people complaining they don't live in a free 
society when they use reasoning that indicates they don't really want to 
live in a free society.

In a previous incarnation of this message, which appears to have gone into 
the darkness, I made a rushed point about free societies either being impossible 
or being a truth.  I'll skip that this time and just ask this: do you mean 
to be complaining about not living in a free society or are you really complaining 
about not living in a society with a higher value on personal freedoms?
