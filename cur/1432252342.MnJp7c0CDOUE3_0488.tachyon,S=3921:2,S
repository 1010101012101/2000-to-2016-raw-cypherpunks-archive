No there isn't, it's just that '...no law...' is onconvenient for people
who believe they are angels among men:

                                 Amendment I

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The problem is that courts believe they can interpret the constitution
instead of as actually worded, being limited to laws made 'under' the
constutition.

A major distinction.
