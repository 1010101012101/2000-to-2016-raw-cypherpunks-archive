  A website that urged visitors to lower prices for grocery items by 
substituting bar codes shut itself down after pressure from Wal-Mart.

The site's operators, a group of tech-savvy political activists, decided 
to close the site Wednesday after contacts between their lawyer and 
those of Wal-Mart <http://www.walmart.com>, the world's largest retailer.
