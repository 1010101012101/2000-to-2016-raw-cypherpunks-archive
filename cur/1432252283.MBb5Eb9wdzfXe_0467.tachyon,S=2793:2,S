Ya' knew that had to happen!

Funny but, reading it, it seems like it would be fairly easy to convince the 
Town board of 5 people that this is a good idea, and from an economic 
standpoint it just might be!. In much of New Hampshire any revenue at all 
from something like this is going to benefit the local township: The barrier 
to entry is very low.

Funny to think that Souter has "Live Free or Die" on his license plates.
