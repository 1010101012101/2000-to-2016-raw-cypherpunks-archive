"People aren't against you, they are for themselves." is a much greater 
truism then trying to find reason in foreign politics or actions of 
governments. And if these sensible "Russian" ideas proliferate wherever 
you're from, why do you live in a country that does not even have a 
unified military and has Generals that do however they please? Like 
fucking around in Ukraine?

I hope you don't have massive cognitive dissonance over that fact.
