Straw man alert.

MV's notion is that a person who thinks journalists should be a special
class of people who enjoy freedom of press (while, presumably, the rest
of us don't) needs killing.  That this person happens also to have spent
months in jail, &c, is unhappy coincidence.

I agree that her actions with regard to the Grand Jury situation are
commendable (especially in light of my belief that the entire Grand Jury
process is one of the most broken parts of our present legal system).
Nevertheless, calling for the creation of a (licensed?) journalist
"class" is stupidity so pure it's almost immoral.

Repeat after me: we are all journalists.
