PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
Worldwide Caution
September 12, 2001
The events of September 11 at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and
Somerset, Pennsylvania, serve as a cruel reminder of the continuing threat
from terrorists and extremist groups to Americans and American interests
worldwide. This situation remains fluid and American citizens should be
aware of the potential risks and to take these into consideration when
making travel plans. The Department will continue to develop information
about potential threats to Americans overseas and to share credible threat
information through its Consular Information Program documents available on
the Internet at http://www.travel.state.gov.
As the U.S. Government has reported in Public Announcements over the last
several months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at increased risk
of terrorist actions from extremist groups. Most recently, we advised that
we had unconfirmed information that terrorist actions may be taken against
U.S. military facilities and/or establishments frequented by U.S. military
personnel in Korea and Japan. In addition, we continue to be concerned about
information we received in May 2001 that American citizens may be the target
of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links to Usama Bin Ladin's
Al-Qaida organization. In the past, such individuals have not distinguished
between official and civilian targets. We take this information seriously.
In light of the above information, U.S. Government facilities worldwide
remain at a heightened state of alert.
U.S. citizens are urged to maintain a high level of vigilance and to
increase their security awareness. Americans should maintain a low profile,
vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens are also urged to
avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objects, and to report the
presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicles should not be left
unattended and should be kept locked at all times. U.S. Government personnel
overseas have been advised to take the same precautions.
U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the Department of
State's Public Announcements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets,
and regional travel brochures, all of which are available at the Consular
Affairs Internet website  <http://travel.state.gov>at
http://travel.state.gov. We will continue to provide updated information
should it become available. American citizens overseas may contact the
American Citizens Services unit of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate by
telephone or fax for up-to-date information on security conditions. American
citizens in need of emergency assistance should telephone the nearest U.S.
Embassy or Consulate before visiting there. U.S. Government facilities have
and will continue to temporarily close or suspend public services as
necessary to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy. In those
instances, U.S. Missions will make every effort to provide emergency
services to American citizens.

In addition to information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded
information by calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive information by
automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from their fax machine.
This Public Announcement supersedes the Public Announcement - Worldwide
Caution of September 7, 2001, to inform U.S. citizens of of our continued
concern about safety and security overseas in light of the events of
September 11. This Public Announcement expires on March 12, 2002.
