I can see the headlines now!

"TERRORISTS USING EDIBLE UNDERWEAR FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES!"

and the Cypherpunks headline:

"FBI getting their panties in a bunch over a bunch of panties"

Makes the "Crypto on a t-shirt" nonsense seem alot less absurd in comparison.

Interesting how the "common citizen" is starting to have to use the methods 
of spys and novels to keep information out of the hands of people that want 
to harm them.

My question is: "Do I get to be the white spy or the black spy?".  ]:>
