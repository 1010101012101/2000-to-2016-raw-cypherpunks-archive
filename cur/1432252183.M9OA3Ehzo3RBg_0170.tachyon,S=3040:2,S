What's the problem here? The Wikipedia guy sees lots of garbage coming out 
of IP address set {X} so he blocks said address set. Somewhat regrettable 
but no suprise, is it?

On the other hand, doesn't it seem a little -odd- that the Tor network is 
already being "used" in this way? Granted, even I the great Tyler Durden was 
able to get a Tor client up-and-running, but I find it suspicious that this 
early wave of Tor users also happen to have a high % of vandals...something 
stinks.

A very subtle attack, perhaps? If I were so-and-so, I consider it a real 
coup to stop the kinds of legitimate Wikipedia entries that might be made 
from Tor users. And if this is the case, you can bet that there are other 
"obvious" targets that have been hammered through Tor.

In other words, someone said, "Two can play at this game."
