These are good ideas to reduce the impact of a stolen key, and
possibly to detect if one has been stolen.

As a potential user of such a system, if anonymity were important to
me I would refuse to honor a request to reveal this linkage
information. I would accept that the coin was lost and pay with a
different one. Depending on the frequency of such spot checks, this
would constitute an effective transaction cost for the use of the
system.

One example is the Sander and Ta-Shma paper I mentioned earlier:

It will be interesting to see more details of how this works. Sander
and Ta-Shma also had the server publish information for every issued
coin, and then used zero knowledge techniques for the depositor to
show that the coin was on the list. This added great complexity to the
system.
