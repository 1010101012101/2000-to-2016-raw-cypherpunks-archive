Don't you think that endlessly posting every time Cari does that that's
trolling as well, it's tiresome, if you have something to say then say it
but for gods sake drop the bloody pretend Indian thing, people either know
and don't care or don't know and wouldn't care anyway, Christ for all anyone
knows everyone else on here is a fantasist sat at their computer in stained
white pants jacking off to my little pony and reading full-disclosure for
erotica, so does it really matter?
