Hello,

The major ISPs of Belgium were forced to block certain sites starting 
in 2009. The list of blocked websites is secret (except for the gambling 
sites blocked due to regulatory issues with the Belgian gaming 
commission). The blocked sites can be categorized as:

- websits containing child porn
- child porn whistleblowing sites (long story)
- Regulatory issues with the gaming commission (this list is public)
- Piracy related (The Pirate Bay amongst others)
- Webshops selling illegal medicine and other forbidden products

I've been trying to uncover this list here: 
http://www.randomstuff.be/your-government-is-lying-to-you-and-something-about-censorship/

Basically, DNS requests for those websites are redirected to a 
government controlled webserver.

What other techniques are there (besides checking every site on the 
internet) to try and uncover whether sites are blocked in Belgium?

-Laurens
