Classic Appropriate Technology Vision, May 25, 2000
This is one book that adds the perspective of the wider World (not just the 
technologically elite), when making decisions on engineering/business 
solutions (as well as other resource allocation decisions). When striving 
towards best solutions, some engineers & consultants may favour technology 
complexity and quality, when simplicity and fit-for-purpose are optimal. 
This book provides some inspiration and building blocks, to be coupled with 
the usual simulation toolkit including systems analysis, enabling 
development and implementation of appropriate solutions. Similarly, the 
book appeals to a much wider audience that can embrace such values in day 
to day life.
The inspirational well-written contents cover:
*Part I- The modern world- problem of production, peace and permanence, 
role of economics, Buddhist economics, and a question of size.
*Part II- resources- education, proper use of land, resources for industry, 
nuclear energy, and technology with a human face.
*Part III_ the third world- development, social and economic problems 
requiring intermediate technology, two million villages, and the problem of 
unemployment in India.
*Part IV- organisation and ownership- a machine to foretell the future, 
towards a theory of large-scale organisation, socialism, ownership and new 
patterns of ownership.
Improvements could include up-to-date case studies (perhaps including 
material from VSO) showing the benefits of the approach; and an update on 
where intermediate technology is today. Note- the book 'Flexible 
Specialisation' by Pedersen et al (ISBN 1853392170 publ.1994) provides some 
such case studies for Africa, Asia and Mexico.
Personally, this reviewer was inspired by the book to lead an undergraduate 
team project with Intermediate Technology (the company) and Sri Lankan men 
designing and implementing a self-build fretsaw for educational toys in 
1991. Overall a stimulating, worthwhile addition to any library.
Another review...
Economists are people who spend half of their time foretelling what will 
happen, and the other half explaining why what they foresaw didn't happen, 
right?
Well, not Fritz Shumacher. Today, in 2001, "Small Is Beautiful" is 25 years 
old, and almost every single prediction in the book, from the power, 
deshumanization, and cross-borders character of corporation, to the threat 
to the environment, to the ineffectiveness of liberalism in addressing the 
problems of the developing world, have become true.
Of special interest are the chapters that deal with adoption of technology, 
and the role of technology in development. In Schumacher's insights may lie 
the key to making development an inherent process of each society, instead 
of an external, massive, and rarely effective effort.
The last few chapters, about "socializing" large corporations, may be 
somewhat utopian in today's world, but still merit reflection.
Shumacher died soon after having published his book, so he didn't have the 
opportunity of spreading or developing his work. Still, this is a must read 
for anyone interested in sound, alternative views to the prevailing ones of 
"larger is better", or "if what we're doing doesn't work, we must do more 
of it".
