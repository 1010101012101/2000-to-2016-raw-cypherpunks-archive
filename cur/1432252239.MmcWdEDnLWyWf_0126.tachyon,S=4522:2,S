What I or Jim, believe is irrelevant in the
current context.  Jim, the courts and I all
agree that Anglo-American jurisprudence is
based on the common law, the Constitution
notwithstanding.  That's good enough for me.

Please re-read my sentence.

clarified the issue.

You're welcome, unfortunately, your analysis is still flawed.

Right.  You are confusing "statutes" and precedents.  Courts don't enact
laws, but they do create the "common law" through precedents.  Apples &
oranges, again.
