Thus spake Eric Cordian (emc@wolf359.net) [26/06/07 15:31]:
: 1. Why does the Department of State fail to disclose the real documentation
: requirements on the passport application?

Is it possible that the documentation requested is sufficient for most
purposes, but the government decided, in your friend's case, that more
documentation was needed?

(Is there a 'no-fly' list for passport applicants?)

: 2. Can the government refuse to issue a passport to a US citizen,
: effectively making them a political prisoner, unable to travel, by demanding
: unreasonable documentation, and then filing their passport application in
: limbo if they refuse to provide it or it doesn't exist?

Can they outright refuse?  I don't know.

Can they make demands, calling them 'requirements', that are nigh impossible
to fulfill, resulting in the effective refusal of a passport?  Sure can.

: 3. Is there a way to get a passport without being forced to give the
: government information that is none of their business?

I would be *extremely* surprised if this was possible.
