    cash, electronic purses, Internet or smartcard based electronic
    payment systems, and Internet banking -- is increasing the ability of
    individuals to rapidly transfer large sums of money, and could pose a
    challenge for FinCEN and other law enforcement agencies combating
    money laundering."
