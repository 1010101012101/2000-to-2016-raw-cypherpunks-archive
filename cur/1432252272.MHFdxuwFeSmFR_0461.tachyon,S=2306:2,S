First, many cats (e.g., mountain lions) do not form social groups beyond

the mother raising the cubs.  Female African lions reportedly do hang
out together.

Second, if you examine the context of the original post, the statement
was a metaphor about leaderless ("anarchic") assemblies such
as this list.  In particular, the Feds (dogs) haven't historically
understood
that this list is the equivalent of a grad lounge or spontaneous beach
party:
there are multiple conversations, no one is moderating or otherwise
choreographing
squat.  When cats encounter each other by chance, they may assert
dominance,
(linguistic pissing contests are not unheard of here :-)
but their lives are not structured around following, or smelling the
higher-up's ass.
