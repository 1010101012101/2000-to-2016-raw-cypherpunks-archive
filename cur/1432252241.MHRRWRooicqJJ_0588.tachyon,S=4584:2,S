We must not wait while dangers gather. They are either with us 
on computer security, or they are with the terrorists. We know 
they have these weapons for mass communications destruction and 
disruption and they have used them before. Preemptive actions 
are insufficient. Preventive actions are a right of self-
defense. Isn't that the current world view legitimized by the US 
government? We don't sit still when a would-be attacker moves 
toward the cockpit, and there is no need to sit still waiting 
for our BIOS to be overwritten with nulls. Taking away offensive 
capabilities when potential attackers enter the concourse or 
trespass upon the chattel of our computers seems only reasonable 
and fully supportive of national security and public policy. 
Since we can't know whether it is our friends and heroic 
protectors, or terrorists, who are trying to destroy our 
communications, kill all the dangerous, evil machines that 
connect and let God sort them out.
