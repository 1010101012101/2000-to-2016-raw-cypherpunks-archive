Two random late night thoughts: 

1. Since death in combat is far more heroic [1] to these folks than it
is to Americans, the torturers will have to be careful.  Three hours
is not much time to break a person, and cruder torture methods are fatal.

2. Cyanide pills were standard issue for folks dropped behind enemy
lines in WWII (see _Between Silk & Cyanide_).  

[1] Though one wonders whether psyops -mutilation of corpse and cliched pig
games-
would help.

One last random thought: since moslems don't drink, they may not handle their
pentothal too well.  [Na Pentothol is a fast acting barbituate; barbies act
very similarly to ethanol.]  However, those methods aren't too reliable
and again that 3 hours would be a real problem...
