He did post a redacted version.  Then JYA accused him of everything from 
faking the data to being a spy.

When we post about vulns on FD/ wherever, we follow the process of 
notifying and following up before posting publicly - which we only do when 
devs or corps refuse to acknowledge or outright deny.  Right?  That's 
exactly how he went about it, and then was attacked in a most nonsensical 
manner (we didn't even get a notorious JYA poetic diatribe!)

In addition, as previously mentioned, these datasets have been in the wild 
for > 1yr.  As someone who may have found my own data in the access logs, I 
still say he did the right thing.
