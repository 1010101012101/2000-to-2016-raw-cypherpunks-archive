No, I've written about "mattd" in the past, and, unless the Australian
news media is lying to us, he's a self-professed anarchist who got in
legal trouble for vandalizing a McDonalds on May Day, I recall. He's
also entertained himself -- and us -- by taunting cops around the
globe with AP-threats on indymedia sites. Now he's found the
cypherpunks list and is apparently here to stay. At least until his
sentencing...
