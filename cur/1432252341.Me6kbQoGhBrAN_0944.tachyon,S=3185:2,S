Bockwinkel, a former newspaper photojournalist and editor, captured
Arends' assault
of Coffey on film. (The clear and graphic pictures can be viewed on the
CLEAN Web
site at http://www.clean.org/photos/photo1.html ). In one photo, Arends
is choking the
petite Coffey in a parking lot; her body is rammed against a pick-up
truck. A federal
jury agreed with Coffey's complaint of excessive force by Arends, but
U.S. District
Court Judge Jack Tanner dismissed the suit and declined to award
damages.
