I think my answer is: you have to do your research before the cops show
up, or do some serious dumpster-diving afterwards, because the courts
won't help you find corroboration.

$ure, but this is irrelevent to what the courts will/won't do, or 
accept, as defense for purported harassment/slander/true slander.  

How *would* you (not meaning just you SS) defend such a case?  Or have
the journalists really sinned, in a libertarian ethic?  Is this an
'expectation of privacy' thing, where you can publish the nasal length or
inter-ocular
distances of folks but not the length of their dick, even if true?

And, what are the sexual behaviors of Kirkland police? :-)
