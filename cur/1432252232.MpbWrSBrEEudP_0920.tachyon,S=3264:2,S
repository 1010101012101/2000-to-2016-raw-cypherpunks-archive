Had they given the software away for free, or published code for the
crack, they might have actually done some damage to copyright holders.  
Instead, they charged enough money for it to raise the height of the bar
above casual and frivolous use.

Why this is viewed as an aggrevating circumstance by the DCMA, as opposed
to a mitigating one, is anyones guess.

Why don't people copy paperback books?  Because it is cheaper to buy them.
Not because the paperback book copyright police threaten you with life in
prison.
