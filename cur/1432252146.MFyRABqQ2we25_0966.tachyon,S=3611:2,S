I don't know if MTB had a lot of discretion - banks are subject to the
federal "know your customer" regulations. You can't get depositor
anonymity from a bank chartered in the US, at least not without at least
one level of corporate indirection (e.g., the bank "knows its customer"
who is a domestic or foreign closely-held corp, who does the bidding of
its unidentified-to-the-bank-and-FINCEN shareholders).

Sounds like the Texans knew too much about their customers - if they
operated a content-neutral service which had many, many customers,
one of whom happened to be a child-porn service, they'd be doing fine,
especially if they shut off the child porn people if/when notified by
law enforcement of the activity. Does the FBI shut down AOL and Earthlink
when their subscribers traffic in child porn?
