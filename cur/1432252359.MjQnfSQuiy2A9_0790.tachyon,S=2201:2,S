Being subject to the whims of Microsoft in exchange for not being
subject to some of the whims of the US Government is, IMO, a bad
tradeoff, and in fact makes some things worse. Microsoft has incentives
to censor certain types of speech as well. How long do you think
gnu.org, fsf.org, badvista.org, defectivebydesign.org, freebsd.org,
openbsd.org, netbsd.org, xiph.org, vorbis.com, speex.org, theora.org,
eff.org, et cetera (I'm sure the list goes on and on) would last on a
Microsoft-controlled Internet?

Assuming we even get that far, Microsoft should not be who we trust with
the new roots. They have already violated our trust many times over.
