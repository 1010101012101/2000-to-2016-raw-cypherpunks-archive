For the record: it's unreasonably difficult (for a pedestrian
sysadmin such as me) to set up StartTLS. Debian unstable ships
with postfix-tls (albeit not installed as default), but apt-get install
postfix-tls
doesn't take care of the self-signed cert generation, and setting up
/etc/postfix/main.cf for StartTLS support.

It would be a most cypherpunkly undertaking to get that package to do that.
(I have no idea how Debian packages work, unfortunately).
