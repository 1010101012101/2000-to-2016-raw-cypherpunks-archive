How very odd. If I stop a psychopath from gunning down an entire mall
full of people by shooting him a few times in the back, the government
would most likely have me arrested, hauled downtown for questioning,
and I would be demonized by the media. I might even be charged for
some bullshit "weapons violation." And HEAVEN FORBID that in the
process of stopping dozens of people from being killed one of my
bullets go through the gunman and hit a bystander, or that I simply
miss and hit a bystander. In that case, the USG and courts wouldn't
care how many lives I saved. They wouldn't say "shit happens" and let
me off the hook. There would be national outrage probably.

Yet the government can execute a predawn raid in a residential area
and shoot an 11-year-old (doubtless wielding an "assault pencil") with
a shotgun in the back? No questions asked, no national media coverage,
no national outrage? Disgusting.

Oh, I forgot. It was a drug raid, and it was executed by the USG.
That makes it all okay. Particularly that last part.
