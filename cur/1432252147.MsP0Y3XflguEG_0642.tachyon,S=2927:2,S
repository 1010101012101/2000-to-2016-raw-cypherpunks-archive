Applied Digital Solutions is pursuing the implantable chip after all.  
It's not the GPS-trackable unit yet, but more like the doggie chips.  
The L.A. Times story says it holds "up to 60 words" in one place, 
and "several sentences of information" in another.

Interesting that they plan to be to market in South America in 90 
days (because of fewer required regulatory permissions).  They say 
they expect FDA and FCC approval here by midyear.

Anyone want to get barcoded?
