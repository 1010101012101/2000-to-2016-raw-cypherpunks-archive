First of all, the problem of no state control and of taxation will soon be 
moot, I think. For the moment Bitcoin exists in a legal limbo, but as  
their value and importance continue to increase, states will start  
treating them as assets with a market value which must be declared - as  
some sort of digital gold.

When it comes to that, bitcoin transfers may still be anonymous and  
untraceable, but people will be legally required to declare the amount of 
Bitcoin they receive for services rendered, and they will be subject to 
taxation. I think this is quite inevitable, unless the use of Bitcoin is 
banned (which I also don't see coming).

This means that in the long run, Bitcoin can't be used to avoid taxes, on 
any financial transactions or anything else - at leat not legally so. The 
fact that it's easier to avoid taxes by using Bitcoin is beside the point - 
what matters is that it will be illegal and punishable by law. The current 
legal limbo of Bitcoin is only due to the fact that it's not only not 
officially acknowledged as legal tender, it's not even acknowledged as 
valuable assets.

So what will be left when it comes to that is a currency which is not  
controlled by any state, and which can be spent anonymously as if it were 
cash, but digitally. And that's still worth a lot. I'm sceptical, though: 
It's not possible to create fake Bitcoins, but since Bitcoin is build on 
free software, it wouldn't be too hard to build an alternative network 
based on the same protocol . In fact, thousands of such networks could be 
built, and that could end up undermining Bitcoin's uniqueness, thus causing 
a crash. I.e., I'm still suspicious that Bitcoin might end its days as a 
pump and dump scheme, which will be fortunate for those smart enough to 
sell their stock at the right time.

As monetary alternatives, I find the idea of local currencies like the  
Puma in Sevilla (https://monedasocialpuma.wordpress.com/, and hundreds of 
other LETS schemes) much more interesting, as they rely on building a real 
community of people geared towards helping each other. I see Bitcoin as 
something that's pulling more towards a Randian free-for-all.

best,
Carsten
