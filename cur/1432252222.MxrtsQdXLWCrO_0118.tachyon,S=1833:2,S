http://archives.abditum.com/cypherpunks/ gets the (filtered) LNE feed. 
It's automatically maintained on my box and I don't check it that 
often, so if it seems hosed just mail me.

I don't know of any archives of the unfiltered feed; the two I'd had 
bookmarked are dead. Jim Choate, do you archive SSZ?
