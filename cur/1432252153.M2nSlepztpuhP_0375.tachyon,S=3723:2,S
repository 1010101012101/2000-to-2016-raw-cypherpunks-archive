Interesting idea.

It may not be security via obscurity, but it does appear to ignore a
number of practical considerations.

For instance, what about the secret URL being passed on in referrer
headers to other pages? I think some browsers block it when you go from
a secure page to a non-secure page on another site (although I'm unsure
about that). The argument that users shouldn't put links to on a secured
page is more surprising than the things it is trying to avoid (to me
anyway).

OTOH, all browsers block HTTP authenticaion credentials from being
passed in the referrer header.
