I found it troubling that the tech was becoming commoditized, since this

disturbs the innovation that I find attractive.   OTOH cheap products
are nice.  And commoditization is the end-game for tech anyway.

Selling ringtones (static bits, not even a service) struck me as
oldschool as selling music, enforced in this case by proprietary
cellphone
"standards".

That "personalization" features were lucrative I found to be a comment
on human nature.  Or human-teens' nature.
Since I tend to have an engineer's aesthetic, which
I take to be fairly spartan/functional, as well as believing that
personalization should
be done by the person desiring it, I found mass-market faceplates
kind of silly.  But then I don't own any Nike baseball caps or Coke
t-shirts to express myself.  I am un-Amerikan, clearly.  There is
something
I clearly don't "get".  Herd mentality, perhaps.

Besides, the phones should be covered in conformal photocells to trickle
charge them.

I liked the Handspring's modularity, but don't know how they did in the
marketplace.  I do think that the cell makers have a decent enough
market
share to take over the PDA/camera/email etc. market, and they know
that and are working on it.  I read recently that in 5 years only pros
will
own digital cameras that do nothing else.  Similarly with GPS, PDAs, MP3

renderers & recorders, calculators, authentication tokens, smart cards,
etc.
How much extra does a hifi
audio ADC or DAC cost than an 8 Khz telecom one?   Why not let users see

their location, even if its only triangulated and not satellite based?
Non-volitile memory is only getting cheaper, smaller, with less power
requirements or awkward properties like page-based access.

Yes, but a nice Heinleinian corollary.

I was thinking there are too many models to keep the things in stock
on a little beachside storefront; and you could add custom textures
with a prototyping machine.  Its also possible I'm enamoured of 3D
printers
which have no place right now in making consumer products.

Aesthetics and convenience.  OTOH when your Everything Gizmo dies,
you are seriously out of luck.  Much like when your combo
fax/printer/copier/scanner
power supply dies, you have zero functionality, instead of the degraded
functionality
you'd have if each were a separate machine.  And sometimes the
integrated
gizmo does nothing very well, eg early cell-phone cameras.  But
integration
(done well, and reliably) does sell.

My $50 prepaid cell phone does voice recognition.
Its the 21st century, and I want my Dick Tracy watch now!
And it better run Java, or Python, damnit!

(I was impressed that the Zaurus PDA can be a web server, BTW.)
