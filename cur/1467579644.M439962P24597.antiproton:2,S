Juan, my dear, US already have lots of people making excuses for them and
being well paid for it.  Don't worry, I won't waste my time with it.  I
simply told you what I think about countries, governments and people.

The same way there are lots of awesome persons in all the countries, there
are lots of bad persons  ("scumbags"?)  in all the countries too.

(Sorry, I still don't know exactly what "scumbag" means, because there are
several bizarre definitions in Brazilian posts  ("gentalha"?  wtf?),  but
probably there are lots of scumbags in all the places, haha!!)

Well, I am sure Quinn thinks exactly the same thing all the times when I
say I like you in public, my dear Juan...  hihi...  ;)

I never said that I am tolerant and open-minded, Juan.  Sorry if you felt
offended with my words.  I don't support any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical
people are extremely boring.

several moments of my life too

Hmm...  Sorry, after talking about deaths, wars and rapes, I confess I was
thinking only in Portuguese.  Always is the most comfortable language for
me.

Pardon, reading now what wrote yesterday, there are more mistakes and I
didn't write some words when talking about the rapes.  Both made me feel
the same way, the same deep panic of death, the same smell of fear.  Sorry
for it.

"Eu n=C3=A3o acredito em todas as pesquisas" here doesn't mean necessarily =
that
I really do _not_ believe in _all_ researches.  If I really wouldn't
believe in all researches, in Portuguese, I would use 'double negative',
what doesn't exist in English, sorry.  I would say "Eu n=C3=A3o acredito em
nenhuma pesquisa", Juan.  I simply translated - literally - what I thought
in that moment and doesn't make sense in English, sorry.

I was trying to say that not necessarily I believe in all researches, that
I don't believe in some of them...  Does it sound better now or should I
try again?  :P
