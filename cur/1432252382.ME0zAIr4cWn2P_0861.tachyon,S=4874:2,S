I wonder if they knew that, though...

Strictly speaking, there's not a "south side" as far as I know;  the plane hit the
side between the Mall entrance and the south parking area, which IIRC faces roughly
southwest and parallel's Route 27.  That's what I gather from the news I've heard
anyway...

I'm not suggesting that he fessed up without intending to, just that the gag order
may have been extended, reinstated, or whatever.
