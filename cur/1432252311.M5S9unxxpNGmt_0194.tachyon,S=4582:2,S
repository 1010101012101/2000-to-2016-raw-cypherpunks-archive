But Declan, are you saying your word about checking
is to be believed? I didn't see your proof. How is your 
position not a hoax? Names and dates and documents
to back them or you're a fucking lying hoaxer.

Did you ask to see any of the RIAA messages, and if so,
did you see them. You didn't ask me what might be
in the ones I got, if there were others (there are), if 
this is a campaign run by RIAA to create sympathy,
or some other vile deed much worse than a trivial
hoax which seems to beguile overmuch. 

Why the rush to judgment to believe "people who allegedly
were there?" Where's your healthy skeptcism of these
people. None of the persons listed in the message are
trustworthy if you're not in their loop. Are you in their
loop, then you got a problem vouching for what they
told you. You slimey suckup, you boy with cute eyes.
you, you, Brad Pitt.

Were you so blinded by the desire to whack your competition
that you failed to see a genuine story -- which has yet to
researched and reported? Why the eagerness to wash your
hands, as with Tony Smith, to not follow the lead handed
to you. Why not do an truly original interesting story, you, 
you recycler.

Let me give you some pointers on getting why getting 
sucker punched works, compared to getting fat-headed
on inside dope. You need more punchdrunkenness to
offset your condescending pretentiousness. Grow half
a beard. Chop a finger. And stop grinning so much. 

Take the sucker punches for they give you a look at the 
enemy not available by a frank and earnest confab. Truth
comes out by hammer blows not by popping zits.

You have performed worse than The Register on this,
I opine from this pinnacle of Absolom. And you are now 
using delphic putdowns to beg the important issue -- 
which is why do reporters run from really brusing
challenges yet brag about the creampufferies of,
what else, free speech (spit). A hoax is not worth the 
time it takes to debunk it, they are every where. 
More interesting is what's behind the RIAA orchestrated 
deception kind. If guys like you, offal meisers, did a good 
job there would be no need for us purehearted bottom-feeders 
where the repugant action takes place and where you 
never know for sure who's out to plant false info -- you've 
done that with me more than once. You, you American.

This is the word of Jehovah Allah, so watch your fucking 
obscenity.
