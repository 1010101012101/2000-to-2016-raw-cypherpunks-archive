This Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks,
and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information [Hardcover]

Andy Greenberg

Publication Date: September 13, 2012

The barbarians aren't at the gates. They're inside. This is the first full
account of the cypherpunks who aim to free the world's information,
from the Forbes reporter whose work has traced their history and future.

What is the machine that kills secrets?

WikiLeaks brought to light a new form of whistleblowing, using
powerful cryptographic code to hide leakers' identities while
they spill the private data of government agencies and corporations.
But that technology has been evolving for decades in the hands of
hackers and radical activists, from the libertarian enclaves of
Northern California to Berlin to the Balkans. And the secret-killing
machine continues to evolve beyond WikiLeaks, as a movement
of hacktivists aims to obliterate the world's institutional secrecy.

This is the story of the code and the characters -- idealists,
anarchists, extremists -- who are transforming the next generation's
notion of what activism can be.

With unrivaled access to such major players as Julian Assange,
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, and WikiLeaks' shadowy engineer known
as the Architect, never before interviewed, reporter Andy Greenberg
unveils the world of politically-motivated hackers -- who they are
and how they operate.
