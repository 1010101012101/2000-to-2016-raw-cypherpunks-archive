Pretty good summary in NTK <http://www.ntk.net>

>         Lot of talk this week about Microsoft's new bluesky project:
>         In the softest of previews in Newsweek, Steven Levy banged
>         on about PALLADIUM, alluding to the sacred (but as it turns
>         out, a bit horse-blind) guardian of Troy. British readers
>         will know the term better as the fancy West End theatre that
>         spawned Beatlemania and now shows overpriced performances of
>         "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". Figures: either way, you're not
>         getting in, and we're not sure you'd want to. In a
>         (cryptographically hardened) nutshell: Microsoft's Palladium
>         will be an area of your future PC, fenced off and unreadable
>         except for trusted software. "Untrusted" apps won't have
>         have access. And how does code gain Palladium's trust? By
>         having you, the PC owner, sanction its entry? Oh no.
>         *You're* untrustworthy - you might sign in your dodgy CD and
>         DVD ripping programs. No, this area will only be for
>         software sanctioned by Microsoft and their paying friends -
>         Hollywood-approved media players, for instance. No backstage
>         pass for you at this Palladium, even though you own the damn
>         theatre. As Ross Anderson points out in his FAQ, "Palladium"
>         is just Microsoft's fancy name for the old "Trusted PC"
>         initiative. And the only reason why they need to trust the
>         PC is: they don't trust its owner. Remember that when the
>         hard sell begins: the only person Palladium protects your
>         computer from - is you.
