Carnival Booth, anyone?

Besides, it's matter of time until the checklists "leak" and the
"adversaries" adjust their behavior accordingly. (What would be the next
move then?).

The "anyone observing security methods" is the funniest part. I am not
certain how one can avoid it, given the amount of time to kill that's
usually present on the airports (is killing time a terrorist act?) -
sooner or later all the tiles on the floor and the panels on the ceiling
are counted, and what's left to watch is the guards and the cameras.
Wouldn't it be less prone to false positives if they would optimize the
airport operations so people won't have to stay there long enough to get
bored and start noticing the security holes?
