I should say, at this point in things, that I've never complained at
all about Brin's heralding some mechanical ubiquity of *observation*,
per se, any more than I complain about the market, celestial
mechanics, or the weather. You can't fight Moore's (or Metcalfe's, or
whoever's) Law, and all that.

I *do* think that observation done by people of their own property
(call it supervision, I guess), is much better than observation by
states of their own citizens (call that surveillance). In fact, I
would go far enough to say that the former is just plain common
sense, and the latter is the very definition of totalitarianism.

Apparently, as "Somebody" observed below, Brin likes to split the
difference fine enough between those two things to get considerable
intellectual mileage out of the issue. His finger in my eye about
lying, coupled with a long list of book-jacket blurbs, is probably
part of that act as well. Since he's going on about false
dichotomies, maybe I should trot out the philosophy department joke
from my Mizzou undergraduate days about there being two kinds of
people, those who think in dichotomies, and those who don't... :-).


Adolescent appeals to first-semester informal fallacies aside, I (as
most people behave, even if they don't explicitly believe it), really
do think that ethics, much less politics, comes after physics, and
not the other way around.

For me that means that Coase's theorem -- the internal cost of
transfer-pricing an asset on a firm's books versus the transaction
cost of buying and selling those assets in a market -- applied to the
coming "geodesic economy" of internet-based information and
professional opinion, or even physical force, in a world of
ubiquitous financial cryptography on geodesic networks, will
eventually determine "firm" size in those markets, monopoly,
oligopoly, or commodity markets or, more properly, monopoly (the USA
and other state force monopolies) versus monopolistic competition
(Burger King versus McDonald's, using "marketing", trademarks and
patents to differentiate themselves) versus perfect competition (a
grade-A soybean is a grade-A soybean, a bit is a bit is a bit, buy
the cheapest bit).

Put in less Proustian terms, the *market* for such things will
determine which side will prevail: Monopolistic surveillance with the
"consent" of the "governed", versus the supervision of private
property by a whole swarm of individual market actors. It will not be
decided, as some people seem to want, Dr. Brin among them,
apparently, by having two "monkeys" fight it out in an internet zoo
cage somewhere about who gets to control some pile of intellectual
bananas.


Just so people do know what I think about the actual outcome, of
economic progress, not the monkey-cage fight, it's this:  Someday
we'll have a race to the bottom. We'll have instantaneous,
auction-priced, cash-settled, yes, Virginia, pretty much anonymous,
markets for anything digitable -- anything that matters, in other
words -- and that branded monopolistic competition, much less
monopoly, even for force, will become increasingly less a fixture in
our daily lives. In that case, if someone uses their own camera to
observe us walking down the street, it wouldn't matter much, just
like it doesn't matter much now. Of course, being interested in the
effects of transaction cost on ownership structure, I'd go one
further and expect that they'd even charge us a whisker's bit of cash
to walk on their sidewalk as well, if it ever got cheap enough for
them to do so, but that's just me.


Toward that end, I suppose, Dr. Brin can, um, fling, all the names --
and all the appeals to authority -- he wants to at me, and I wish him
well in his further efforts to terrify the public. It's an ancient
and honorable way to make a living (see my .sig, below...),
especially in a world where the net, and crypto, and, quite frankly,
libertarian/anarcho-capitalism, which are the political-economic
results of the first two bits of physics, have blown all the old
space-opera scenarios out of the water, especially the "can't we all
just get along", command-economy, top-down, "liberal",
enlightened-erst-feudal, government-is-good-for-you, space-opera
scenarios. ;-).


Personally, I'm still much more interested in *doing* things --
finance using internet bearer financial cryptography, and even some
of the tools in Wayner's book -- than I am with *talking* about
things anymore. But, if the, ahem, market's any indication, :-), I
may not have a choice.  In which case I *will* probably be writing
more, and doing less. Coming soon, to a monkey-cage near you? Here's
hoping that finance will be, um, conserved, instead...

Cheers,
RAH

You're far from the only one who has aroused his ire,
Bob...In fact, it occurs to me that he may deliberately
write in the way he does (superficially fascist, with
a few bows to libertarians where needed as long as the
fascists get final trust/control and are trusted to let
the powerless watch them) in order to have an excuse to
whine and fulminate...
