Origami world.

Computer generates a random 3D object out of large polygons with fairly 
sharp angles of contact, subject to various limits on the way in which the 
object is generated.  Displays 2D image of 3D object.

Human infers 3D object from 2D image, infers unseen portions of the image 
from rules by which the 3D image is generated -- for example that the 
object must make sense mechanically -- that it should be stable resting on 
a plane.
