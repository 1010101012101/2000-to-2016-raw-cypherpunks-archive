Yes, the user must nest those himself.  If he doesn't like doing it by hand,
there are client programs that can do this automagically.

The only way to get security is for the originator to do the encryption -
otherwise, if ANY remailer in the chain is compromised,
the Bad Guys can read the message.  If the originator does the crypto,
then EVERY remailer in the chain has to be compromised to break it.

The remailer-stats pingers publish this information on web pages;
you can retrieve it and read it by hand, or use a client program to fetch it.
If you don't want to keep it, don't.
And some of the clients are web pages themselves (Javascript or whatever),
so you can just retrieve them.

And obviously the sender needs to be able to pick the remailers to use -
depending on the type of message, some messages need to be sent through
remailers in appropriately safe jurisdictions, other messages don't
need much security but need high reliability or high speed
(so you want to pick remailers with good stats.)
