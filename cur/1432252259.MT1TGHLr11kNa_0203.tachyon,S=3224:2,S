On the subject of trusted hardware: m-o-o-t does this, by booting and
running from a verified CD on an ordinary PC/Mac box. No expensive chips.
BTW, there was a M$ patent for Tsomewhere, can I claim prior?

We're getting close to anonymity (PA). Too. :)  Nah, that's not big enough.
SMILE!


Add that to the mix,


remembering that TYABBAYABBA won't work 100%, and some geeky people will be
able to redistribute *m*o*v*i*e*s* without being caught. Then their friends
will do so too (their friends),

and if it's anonymous.... (and I mean _really_ anonymous...)



I'm going to buy some more of this fine beer now. I'll probably wish I
hadn't posted this, at some time in the future.

ps no-one has commented on my one-way-functions post. Either you're all
