Me neither. Sometimes, though ...

True.

Well, that's what the website says. I have no way to verify that ;)

True.

Tor is open-source, and collaborative. Arguably, anyone with requisite
skills and resources can subvert it. But it is true that the Five Eyes
have the best resources for traffic analysis.

It's hard to say. Only idiots use tools with backdoors.

I don't believe that either Freenet or I2P are large enough to provide
strong anonymity. And both (along with most P2P systems) require that
nodes be discoverable. That complicates using them with VPNs and Tor.

It might be possible to run Freenet nodes as onion services. That works
well enough for Tahoe-LAFS. I've been meaning to test that. Also IPFS.

Well, adversaries can use malicious P2P nodes. It's true that Freenet is
about the same size as Tor (http://www.asksteved.com/stats/ vs
https://metrics.torproject.org/networksize.html). But with Tor, what's
relevant is the number of possible circuits. With ~1700 entry guards,
~1000 exit relays and ~2300 non-entry/non-exit relays, about four
billion distinct circuits are possible.

Yes, it does. But neither it nor I2P provide anonymous access to the
general Internet.
