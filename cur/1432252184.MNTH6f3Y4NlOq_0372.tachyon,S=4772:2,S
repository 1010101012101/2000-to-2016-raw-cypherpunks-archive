Tell that to the 7th kine.  In reality, subsistence (this word means
something) farmers were mostly chronically malnourished--even in the good
times--and died in droves whenever the sun didn't shine or the rain didn't
fall.  I don't consider that doing "alright."

Can you be more specific?  "Corporate welfare" such as making the rain fall
or what?

You tell me.  It would appear that either you are wrong about the economic
viability of their farms or they are somehow acting against their own best
interest.  Subsistence farmers are going to the cities because they
(correctly) understand that to do so increases their standard of living.

Even assuming, arguendo, that this is true (evidence, please), this is not a
failure of the market or the fault of the "sweat shop" operators.  In fact,
the "sweat shop" operators are the only heroes in this scenario.  They are
at least providing something better than the dislocated farmers would have
had otherwise.  Good for them.
