I saw a deliriously enthusiastic crowd of supporters for Nader's 
appearance last night on the Chris Matthews MSNBC show "Hardball." 
The hall was packed with his supporters, no doubt. Still, the 
enthusiasm was real, and stronger than what I've seen for Gush or 
Bore.

The audience was howling and cheering as Nader called for 
populist/communist measures like confiscating the wealth of the rich, 
muzzling the speech of businessmen, and regulating businesses at all 
levels.

"Does Bill Gates really deserve to have more total net worth than the 
combined assets of the bottom 40% of our country?!" Whoops and howls.

One wonders if Bill Gates will rethink the wisdom of helping to fund MSNBC!

Nader is getting a late start in the enthusiasm stakes, but it could 
be that he'll really surge. A lot of folks are mired deeply in what 
Nietzsche called "resentiment." They just don't like it when other 
people have done well by investing instead of by drinking beer for 
the past 20 years, and they want the successful people taken down a 
notch or two.

Should be exciting to see what happens. If Nader succeeds in taking 
enough votes from Gore for Bush to win, the Dems may move further to 
the left in the _next_ election.
