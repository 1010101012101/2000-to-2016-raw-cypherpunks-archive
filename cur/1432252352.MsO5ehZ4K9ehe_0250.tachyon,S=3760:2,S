Most of them come from well-to-do families rather than filthy 
rich families, that's true.  But few or none come from blue 
collar or really poor families.  Besides, my goal isn't having 
a one-percent chance of becoming a billionaire; the people you're 
pointing at rode the venture capital rocket, and for each of the 
one-generation people on that list, ninety-nine others went flat 
broke and deep into debt trying to do the same thing.  The multi-
generational plan I have in mind is building up by investment 
and hard work, not by riding the crash-prone venture capital 
rocket.

Where are all of the archives?  I have only found the ones on 
venona, and they are incomplete.
