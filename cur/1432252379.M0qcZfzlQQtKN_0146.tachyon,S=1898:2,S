Hey, we should *encourage* people to smoke, drink, fuck whatever moves,
eat whatever you're served, because we are *coerced* into paying for
their retirement.
If we weren't, we wouldn't care; but since we are, please, take up
whatever reduces your lifespan.

And of course, if someone tries to stop you from whatever
consensual-'harm' you wish,
waste the fuckers, who have claimed ownership of your bodies.  Or enjoy
your slavery.
