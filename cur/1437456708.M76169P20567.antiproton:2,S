	Are you saying the pentagon is good and useful?

	Do you have to ask?

	No. But granted, at least I haven't been directly harmed by
	them. Which is something not everyobdy can say.

	Marines and other 'military personnel' murder people when
	'ordered' to. They are the worst scumbags on earth. 

	Politicians are morally responsible. The military are morally
	and materially responsible.

	Sort of.

	Yes.

	Ask a retard called Nick Econopouly  if you want details.

	good enough of an 'authority'?

	There isn't any real alternative. And sure, floss is less
	bloated than other commercial crap, but still.

	Yes, you tried to dismiss something that doesn't line up with
	typical establishment bullshit as 'extremism' - I, of
	course, am hardly impressed...

	Sure. Your comments about google & the cloud are not propaganda.
	I'm selling a bridge. Interested?

	Are you talking about the US military?

	Should they? Looks like you don't know what government is.

	LOL. So, how much trolling should I let you get away with?

	Worthless murdering scumbags are 'respectable' people and not
	'fundamentally evil'. Sure. Maybe they are 'accidentally'
	evil? 

	How about they 'accidentally' beat you to a pulp and then feed
	you to the pigs? Just as an innocent mistake of course...

	Really? That's an interesting concept. How many lsd doses do
	you need in order to reach the parallel universe where that
	is reality? Because in this universe, it isn't.

	Sure. That's how jesus planned it all.
