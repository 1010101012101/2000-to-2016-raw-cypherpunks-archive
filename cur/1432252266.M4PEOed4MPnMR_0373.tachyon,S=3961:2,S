PROVEN Work at Home System that GENERATES FREE LEADS! 

Hi, My name is (PHILLIP HUGH). 

I am an ordinary man living in the UK who as learned how to make a living on the Internet 
working from home. I am willing to teach you to do the same, in simple easy to understand 
lessons so you can be successful to. I will work with you and teach you everything I know 
for FREE! This is an international business and everyone is welcome, it doesn't matter who 
you are or where you're from, anyone can do this.

You don't have to be a computer whiz or genius to learn to earn on the Internet. You just 
need a dream and be willing to give some time to learning and implementing the things I 
teach you. 

You won't GET RICH QUICK but you will be able to build a good solid income, an income 
that will depend solely on you and whether or not you are willing to learn. If you are willing to 
learn and want to get to know and work with a real person, then contact me. I am real and I 
promise to help you all that I can.

You are wondering why would I help you for Free? The company that I am affiliated with 
pay me commissions on what I do to promote their products/services. If I teach others to do 
the same they pay me commissions on how well you do at promoting their 
products/services also.

So my goal will be to teach you so well that you are making money and I am making money. 
I like it when the big boys pay me, and not the little guy like you and me. 

I you are interested in learning more please send a blank E-Mail with “Tell Me More” in the 
subject line and mail it to (ronald.hugh@ntlworld.com)

I look forward to hearing back from you soon and hopefully working closely with you in the 
near future.

Sincerely,

(PHILLIP RONALD HUGH)
