Come now, J.A., you know very well that we are all afraid that somebody 
will smuggle a chicken from Asia into a major metropolitan area of the 
U.S. -- it's not the bus we're trying to stop, but the chicken, from 
crossing the road: while infected with something nasty and contagious.

REAL ID is meant to stop the contagious-chicken smugglers. Are you one?
