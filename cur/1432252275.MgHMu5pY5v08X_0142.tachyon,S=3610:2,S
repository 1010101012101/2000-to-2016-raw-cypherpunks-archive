Isn't this how Windows XP and Office XP work?  They let you set up the
system and fill it with your data for a while -- then lock up and
won't let you access your locally stored data, until you put the
computer on the Internet and "register" it with Microsoft.  They
charge less than a million dollars to unhand your data, but otherwise
it looks to me like a very similar scheme.

There's a first-person report about how Office XP made the computers
donated for the 9/11 missing persons database useless after several
days of data entry -- so the data was abandoned, and re-entered into a
previous (non-DRM) Microsoft word processor.  The report came through
this very mailing list.  See:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@wasabisystems.com/msg02134.html

This scenario of word processor vendors denying people access to their
own documents until they do something to benefit the vendor is not
just "plausible" -- it's happening here and now.
