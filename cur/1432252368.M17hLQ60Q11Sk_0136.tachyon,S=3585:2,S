This "gep2" character is typical of people who don't understand that the 
First Amendment does not give any power to government to ban such 
books...or to "follow each and every person," or to get their identities.

Government agents who infringe the Constitution have earned killing.

The part of the article where the government official says such books 
"should be illegal" is especially telling.

I hope they try to illegalize such books. It will radicalize more 
people, and maybe hasten the day when festering holes like Washington, 
D.C. are annihilated.
