Report: Mossad hacked Syrian computer to uncover nuke site

By Ofer Aderet

Tags: Mossad Syria 

Israel's Mossad espionage agency used Trojan Horse programs to gather
intelligence about a nuclear facility in Syria the Israel Defense Forces
destroyed in 2007, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported Monday.

According to the magazine, Mossad agents in London planted the malware on the
computer of a Syrian official who was staying in the British capital; he was
at a hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Kensington at the time.

The program copied the details of Syria's illicit nuclear program and sent
them directly to the Mossad agents' computers, the report said.

Israel's September 6, 2007, raid on the al-Kabir site in Syria's eastern
desert is said to have knocked out the country's reportedly nearly-completed
reactor.

Israel has refused from the beginning to comment on, confirm or deny the
strike, but after a delay of several months Washington presented intelligence
purporting to show the target was a reactor being built with North Korean
help.

Der Spiegel further reported on Monday that prior to the strike, the IDF
Military Intelligence unit, 8200, listened in on conversations between
officials at the Syrian reactor and North Korean experts.
