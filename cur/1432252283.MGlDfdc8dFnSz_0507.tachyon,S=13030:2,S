as long as we have our tinfoil hats on, one data point to keep in mind here
is to remember that USGov, despite having many uniform policies, is also
shot through with warring fiefdoms and turfs.

Snowden and Michael Hayden both have the odd career path CIA - NSA. To say
that is unusual is to make an enormous understatement. we are usually told,
"once CIA, always CIA." you can't "quit." and there are hundreds of stories
over 50+ years of history to suggest this.

CIA and NSA have often been thought not to be on the same page, largely
because NSA is military and CIA is civilian (or whatever special/uber
designation it has at this point). CIA sees itself as entitled to operate
much *more* lawlessly than NSA.

it is not hard to imagine scenarios where CIA might want to weaken NSA
capabilities in part via public embarrassment. and one involved in the plot
could even go public with his statements about how damaging the leaks are.
convenient!

our noble leaker(s) would not even necessarily need to know how it was
possible to grab so much information without being stopped/noticed.
