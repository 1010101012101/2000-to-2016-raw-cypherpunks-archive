Bastille day Blitzkreig.

This time it is real. The great cyberwar has begun. I am sure of it. I
have decided to record whatever happens here because I am certain that
one of the many scenarios I have studied over the past decade is now taking
place. Two days ago the following message was posted anonymously and with
great craftiness on several commercial news sites:
CONT.

"It is often the case that one can most readily learn about society by 
watching its reactions, across the spectrum, to those who would challenge 
it."Revolution cannot be non-violent or pacifist. It is a political act of 
violence aimed against the ruling elite to overthrow them just as the 
revolutions of the past were, history reminds us. It is political ignorance 
to believe that you can have a revolution without the use of political 
violence.
