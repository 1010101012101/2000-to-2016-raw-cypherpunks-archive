In the UK at least railway stations tend to have been built in the ugly
parts of towns for good reason -- simply because land is a lot cheaper in
the low rent parts of town.

Also railways stations and the associated cheap hotels with a large
transient population tend to attract undesirables such as drug dealers,
muggers and hookers and the sort of thing which pushs the value of your
house down and nice middle class people don't want on their doorstep.

The people in richer areas tend to have more political clout and more
effectively oppose development of this sort.
