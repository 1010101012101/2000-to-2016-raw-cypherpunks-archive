OK, let's assume for the same of argument that it takes about 1 minute for 
Echelon/NSA-like resources to break a weakly encypted lotus notes message. 
And then let's assume that there's a whole LOT of these machines sitting 
somewhere.

And as the grumpy Tim May has suggested, perhaps only a small fraction of 
encrypted messages are (or can be) sent for decryption.

Then the expenditure of such resources is going to be a big statistical 
optimization problem, akin to that faced in the credit card industry (eg, in 
approving or declining a POS transaction).

The gub'mint or whatever doing such monitoring will therefore probably look 
for certain signs that will kick off decryption. For instance, the sporadic 
use of cryptography in cetain demogrpahic areas might cause a % of those to 
be sent over for routine check, particularly if there is no encryption used 
by that populace, and then all of a sudden there are bursts.

Also, changing the strength of encryption might be a kickoff, but again I 
reveal I am a newbie with this question: Is it possible to determine (at 
least approximately) the strength of encryption of an intercepted message?

Then, if someone from, say, the b'Arbes neighborhood of Paris moves suddenly 
from weak to strong encryption in his messaging, that would kick off a flag 
somewhere sending that message for cracking.

So if a bin Laden were smart, he should routinely use encryption for all of 
his messages, even the most trivial, because the change in pattern would be 
a tipoff to send his encrypted messages for hacking.

And the there are probably less obvious, large-scale statistical patterns 
indicating something's up, and causing a % of such messages to be hacked and 
then sent for routine check for key words.
