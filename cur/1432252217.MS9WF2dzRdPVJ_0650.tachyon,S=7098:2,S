A Yugoslav Journalist's Advice to U.S. Media 
Jasmina Teodosijevic-Ryan, TomPaine.com
November 7, 2001

How and when does journalism become propaganda? As a
writer, broadcaster and media analyst from the former
Yugoslavia, I have observed the process first-hand. It
starts slowly, then spreads like a stain. 


The transformation from objective journalism to
propaganda begins with the addition of adjectives when
referring to the other side. The "enemy" becomes
"merciless" or "hate-filled". Then comes the shaping,
cutting and editing reports to benefit one side. "Our"
victims have names, faces and grieving families; they
must be avenged. "Theirs" do not exist. When
journalists say "we" to refer to "their" side's
military force, they've crossed the decisive bright
line into nonprofessional territory. 


I analyzed both Serbian and Kosovo Albanian media for
the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting
during the months of high violence in Kosovo in
1998-1999. Most striking was the similarity of
language and models that the biased media of both
sides were using to demonize and dehumanize the
"others." "Murderers", "death squads", "terrorists"
and "zlocinci" (evildoers) were always on the other
side. 


One of those media was Radio-Television of Serbia,
which strongly supported the policy of former
president Milosevic, and helped him remain in power by
falsifying the news and manipulating public opinion.
Their studios were bombed during the NATO air-strikes
on Yugoslavia in 1999, and 16 young staffers died
there. International organizations protested NATO's
hitting this seemingly-civilian target. NATO's
officials responded that Radio-Television of Serbia
were a part of Milosevic's war propaganda machine, and
as thus, a legitimate military target. One wonders how
would NATO have reacted if Milosevic had the power to
rocket Fox News or CNN. 


We usually connect propaganda to totalitarian regimes
and undemocratic societies. But recently, when major
American broadcast networks decided to edit bin
Laden's statements in response to a government
request, I saw U.S. media abandoning the main
principles of journalism. Until then, I had explained
away the unprofessional mistakes I'd observed as
understandable outbursts of emotion in the aftermath
of September 11th. But then I read CBS president
Andrew Heyward's explanation about the decision to
censor bin Laden: "Given the historic events we are
enmeshed in, it's appropriate to explore new ways of
fulfilling our responsibilities to the public." 


Farewell to the media responsibility to fully and
impartially inform the public! Who really believes
that the government instruction to reduce coverage of
bin Laden was for the public benefit? I think the
government's main concern was not that bin Laden might
send "secret messages" through U.S. television, but
that his arguments were more complex that the
caricature they wished to sell to the public. 


In times of turbulence and war, when passions and
emotions prevail over reason, journalists are
pressured from all sides, even by their own emotions.
Slowly and imperceptibly, they can slide from
professionalism into political marketing. Aware of
that, I developed a set of simple reminders for
myself, that might be useful to other colleagues when
navigating in these choppy waters. 


-Always remain a third party. No war is "your" war. 


- Resist free advice from the government. Preserve
your skepticism. 


-Treat the victims on all sides with respect. All
human beings have faces and families. No one should be
dehumanized as "collateral damage." 


-And, finally, in whatever ways you can manage to,
observe propagandist media on the other side. Do you
look like them? Have you become a soldier of your own
propagandist army?
