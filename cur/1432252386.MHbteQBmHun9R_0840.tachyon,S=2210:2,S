The obvious problem with multiple levels of passwords and data is: When
does the guy with the rubber hose stop beating passwords out of you?
After he gets one?  Yeah, that's plausible, if he's convinced there's
only one.  But once he's seen a second hidden level, why will he ever
believe there's not a third, fourth, etc.?  The same calculation
applies to a judge or district attorney.  He *knows* (even if he's
wrong) that there's evidence of kiddie-porn, drug dealing, etc., in
there somewhere.  He knows you've given up two passwords.  Why is he
ever going to let you out of jail, or ever going to reduce the charges
down to something a normal human might live long enough to serve out
the time for?
