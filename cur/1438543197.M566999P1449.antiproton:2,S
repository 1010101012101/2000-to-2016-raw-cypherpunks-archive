This is probably true... on the other hand, looking at the flip side
of this (referring to software side... the textsecure / stuff based on
textsecure implemented in WhatsApp on massive scale) has worked for
people on a massive scale who don't give much of a damn but who do
care enough to use software with a privacy label and is easy to use.
And I think that works to the benefit of the public.

This makes me think that if the hardware is similarly easy to use (or
at least easier for the user) then it will be easier to present the
open source hardware as a benefit.

The fact is that the OSH/SC (open source hardware / software
communities) really have kind of sucked at marketing.  That should chang
e.

Agreed.

This makes a lot of sense, and I'm guessing that the smaller scale
projects we've seen so far are indicative that this can happen at
small to medium scale without problem for specific clients or
anticipated customer base. Here are some successful examples:

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Main_Page
(refer also to http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/Hardware/Phones
and http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/)

https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena
http://vr-zone.com/articles/novena-open-laptop-project-exceeds-280-perce
nt-crowd-funding-target/77905.html

TBD, but looks pretty good (same concept as Novena):
https://puri.sm/

And of course, see:
https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom

These are by no means the only examples of open source hardware being
marketed to a larger public, albeit at a limited production scale for
the time being.  It definitely is a market which is in need of attention
.
