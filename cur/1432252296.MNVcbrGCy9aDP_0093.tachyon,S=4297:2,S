BU bashing (which is not my intention), but:...]

When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. There are
other groups which can apply pressure than lawyers, courts and Men
with Guns.  Auditors and insurance companies come to mind. Schneier 
has noted how improvements in safe (as in a secure metal box)
technology was driven not by losses, not by customers, nor by lawsuits,
but rather by insurance requirements.
