*** A dog may be man's best friend, but a credit card may be a woman's best friend. While the nation's male population is growing at a slightly faster rate than the female population, nearly 76.1 million women have or use credit cards, compared with 68.2 million men.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** Americans are slipping up on their card payments at a rate not seen in more than twenty years. The deterioration in consumer credit quality is further evidence that we are, and have been, in a recession since late spring.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** Believe it or not, scamsters see a silver lining in the horror that took New York and Washington two weeks ago. As Americans open up their wallets to charity and pull out credit cards to donate, some scum artists are seizing the opportunity to gather information for fraudulent use.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** 5% Yield Amalgamated Bank of Chicago is offering its MasterCard customers a 5% interest rate on a saving account. The bank, which issues standard and gold MasterCards, requires cardholders to deposit a $2,500 minimum to get the special rate.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** Bankruptcy Reform  Bankruptcy reform legislation has taken the back burner to more pressing matters, due to the tragic events in New York and Washington last week.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** Interlink Revolt  The stink over new merchant fees for the Interlink debit card is spreading. This week Florida-based Publix Super Markets says it will no longer accept VISA's 'Interlink' point-of-sale debit cards effective October 13.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

*** Card Rates  For the first time in the industry's history, average credit card rates have plummeted below the 15.00% level. However average rates could have been hovering below 14.00% if the full impact of the Fed rate deductions had been passed on to cardholders.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>

***  Xmas 2001 This could be the weakest holiday spending season since the recession of 1990-91. This year, before the current recession was documented and before the terrorist attacks were launched, holiday sales were predicted to rise only 2.5%.  <a href="http://www.cardweb.com/cgi-bin/frame.pl?/cardtrak/news.html">CLICK  HERE  TO READ  MORE</a><p>
