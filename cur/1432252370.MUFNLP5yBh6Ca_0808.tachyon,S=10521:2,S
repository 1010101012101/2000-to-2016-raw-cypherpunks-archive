Dunno, I've seen both recently. Just trying to live up to my slave

I would summarize this paragraph, poorly written as it may be, as
follows :

1) Some people wish to remove their monies from the public schools and
make their own choices.

2) Here are some possible negative effects of that action.

3) I'm not against it but at least think about the implications before
acting.

Looks pretty simple to me. Doesn't really take a position other than
"fine, measure twice, cut once if you want my vote."

I'm no expert on the details either but it looks like a chant of
"deregulate" didn't work out so well.

Expect to hear more chants of "deregulate" and "privatize" when it comes
to things like power and water. I'm not sure which I prefer, a corporate
dictatorship or a police state.

I would say that I use the term knee-jerk and right-wing war chants as
labels for the idea that all public schools are somehow seriously
inferior to private schools or home schooling. Maybe the term knee-jerk
is as poor as the idea of lumping all public schools into a single
assessment.

Furthermore, I think if you read what I've said you would not find that
I flat out disagree with your attitudes about education but rather try
to point out that maybe things are a little more tricky than you
suggest.

I see no reason that I'm obligated to make up my mind until I choose to.

Ah, I apoligize, you missed the point.

If you knew me you would know that as far as I am concerned the the
rights of the individual should NEVER be forcefully compromised for the
good of the many. IOW, if I have the last freshwater spring on earth,
unless I'm feeling generous today, if I don't like you and don't need
you and can successfully fight you off, you're fucked brother.

The point you miss is that we don't live in isolation. It may very well
be that in order to optimize our quality of life as individuals we have
to ( preferably voluntarily ) make some ( preferably minimal )
sacrifices that improve the lot of others. I find it to be a very simple
and obvious concept. Yes it does sound like you have to pay protection
money to reduce the degree to which you must fight to keep what you have
but rather than beat your head against a wall and complain about how
unfair life is, optimize.

Mike
