It already hasnt ended well.  The USA is a virtual police state (no# 18 on 
human rights IIRC), and even worse, is the standard bearer for what other 
"democratic countries" wish to emulate.

I recently had a discussion with my kids: I was trying to apologize for my 
part in making the current worl what it has become today.  Having been at 
the beginning of microprocessing, crypto, etc., I (we?) all thought we 
were changing the world for the better - i.e., we would use these efforts 
to leave the world a better place than when we found it.  But that hasn't 
just been a false belief, it's been a self-inflicted lie.  I (we) have 
helped to create the technology that George Orwell could only fantasize 
about: we have destroyed our own societies with our attempts at 
improvement through thechnology.
