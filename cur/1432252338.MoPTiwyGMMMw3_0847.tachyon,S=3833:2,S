Of course.

I am not stating that there is any act of "evil" necessarily offensive to
all societies, past, present, and future. However, I am stating that there
*are* acts of "evil" that are not tolerated by any society currently in
existence. Such boundaries on what actions are permissible is necessary
for the existence of society.

This is not to imply a fixed condition.
