Tox developer team were not interested in implementing it in similar 
fashion. Using three computers was the main obstruction: A successor for 
Skype that makes the headlines is the one that you get everyone to use 
because it's easy to setup. It wouldn't get any attention nor media 
coverage if it wasn't free as in 'next, yes, next, next, install'.

I'd rather not meddle with Tox source: to quote the Norton's article you 
posted
"C is good for two things: being beautiful and creating catastrophic 
0days in memory management."

Tox is written in C, by people who seem to have limited understanding on 
computer security and programming. I do too, but a least I selected an 
approach that doesn't require 0-day free code, or OS.

TFC stands for Tinfoil Chat.
cs.helsinki.fi/u/oottela/tfc.pdf  // pages 9 and 10 explain how why 
there is no key exfiltration risk.
TCB is the Trusted Computing Base, the system responsible for 
cryptographic operations.

It depends on your threat model and how technically skilled your 
adversary is.
If adversarial government decides to buy malware from say, Hacking Team 
that automatically
replaces Tox IDs inside unencrypted emails to those owned by the state, 
it'll still get you killed unless you know what you're doing.

Just telling the user to meet the contact and exchange Tox ID in person 
is enough not to get MITM'd.
Just warning the user about not saying the most sensitive stuff on Tox 
might be enough to not to get killed.

If you're not in control of the laptop, you shouldn't be trusting your 
life on it; Tox does very little if there's a keylogger present, neither 
does TFC if you're not in control of the two TCB computers.

That part sounds like infomercial trying to overcomplicate a problem.

You need one device to store the (a)symmetric encryption keys (TCB 1)
You need another      to store the (a)symmetric decryption keys (TCB 2)
You need third one to transmit encrypted messages.
You need data diodes to enforce unidirectional communication between the 
devices. That's all.

The issue is global whether it's occupy movement fighting against 
economic segregation in the West,
or dissidents in 3rd world countries. The difference is the threat 
model. In west it's HSAs, in poor countries,
MSAs at top, unless it's the US doing surveillance against Afghans etc.

I get what you mean. You're trying to evaluate the skillset of 
developers in terms of
how things are implemented and programmed. I'm trying to say they've a 
bigger job
to do and so far they have failed at it.
