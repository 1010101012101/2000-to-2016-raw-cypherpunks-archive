     I think you are misunderstanding what he wrote -- and then you
further confuse the issue with this "defendants....shown to possess"
statement. The AN were the defendants, they clearly did have guns.
However, what I understood Phil to be saying is that the defendants
story about them thinking they were being fired upon, and then chasing
after the car, doesn't make a lot of sense. Would you chase after a car
carrying unkown number of enemy with unkown firepower who had just done
a driveby shooting with you as the target?
       Shoot back at them from behind a safe position, yes, and maybe
chase them if you had an APC, but you'd have to be pretty stupid to run
after them otherwise. And Phil isn't saying that the woman and her kid
had a gun at all, but just that the AN tried to BS everyone with that
story.
