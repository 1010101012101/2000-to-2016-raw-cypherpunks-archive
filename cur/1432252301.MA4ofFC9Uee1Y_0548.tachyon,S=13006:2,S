No Regrets About Shamelessly Exploiting National Tragedy For My Own
Personal Gain.

This Friday September 21st Washington Post carried an article by
Ariana Cha that I feel misrepresents my views on the role I
personally had in the September 11th terrorists attacks.  She
interviewed me on Monday September 17th, and we talked about how I
felt about the possibility that the event might be a perfect
opportunity for me to get some free press and get back some of the
attention I lost since I was effectively kicked out of Network
Associates and had to move to that cheesy webmail provider.  The
article states that as the inventor of PGP, I was "overwhelmed with
feelings of guilt".  I never implied that in the interview unless it
seemed like it would increase my chances of getting in print, and I
specifically went out of my way to try to pull other heart strings
too just to assure that it would all see the light of day and put my
name in lights again.  I even made her repeat all this back so she
would not get it wrong in the article.  After all I am The Phil
Zimmermann so I should have editorial control over these kinds of
things, don't you think?  This misrepresentation is serious.  I
expect the press to pull only those heart strings that will get me
sympathy and allow me to grandstand publicly atop the bodies of the
dead and dying in New York and elsewhere without attracting criticism
of a substantial nature.  The article implies that under the duress
of terrorism I have changed my principles on the importance of my own
vanity and ego and that I have pandered to the anti-crypto crowd in
my endless quest to rediscover my former glory.  You see, civil
liberties and cryptography used to be a good platform for my
self-promotion but with the acquisition of PGP and the closing of the
source code I am now relegated to the unenviable stature of a
"has-been" and a "one trick pony".  You can probably understand why I
jumped at the chance to indulge in a little self-promotion when those
tall boxy things collapsed in New York this month.

Because I am The Phil Zimmermann and my views are so important, Ms.
Cha read to me most of the article by phone before she went about
ignoring the express instructions of my PR agent not to print
anything about me crying more than once or twice.  It didn't seem
very manly, they said.  I miss Kelly Blough.  She used to keep me out
of trouble when I stuck my foot in my mouth in public.  The article
that appeared in the Post was significantly shorter than the
original.  I had so much important stuff to say that I cannot believe
they took out my discussions on foreign affairs, international
monetary policy, the national debt and Kevin Bacon's chances to
capture a senate seat in an off year.  I can only speculate that her
editors must have decided their paper was not a forum for my own
self-aggrandizement and taken some inappropriate liberties in
removing all the work I put into composing my public image for that
article.  What the hell?

In the interview six days after the attack, just after my PR rep
called me and said that I might get in the paper if I played my cards
right and this could be a huge boost for my career, we talked about
the fact that I had cried over the heartbreaking tragedy, as everyone
else did.  In fact the tears were not because of guilt, but a highly
concentrated formula of lemon juice that I applied to my eyelids
before going out in public.  When that stopped working I hit my thumb
with a hammer for good measure.  Let me tell you, nothing gets me
teary eyed like a good thumb-whacking.  I also told her about some
hate mail I received that blamed me for developing a technology that
could be used by terrorists.  I didn't tell her that this email came
from my PR rep.  I told her I felt bad about the possibility of
terrorists using PGP, but that I also felt that this was outweighed
by the fact that I now had a personal stake in the tragedy with which
to bootstrap my flagging ego and public image in a national
publication.  I also weaved some bullshit about human rights and
crap, the kind of stuff I used to believe when I actually coded stuff
rather than just babbling on about it like I mostly do now.  Ah, I
was so young and stupid.  It appears that this nuance was not lost on
the Washington Post since they made me look like the little sissy I
always feared people saw me as.  I imagine this was caused by my PR
staff being stretched to their limits in an effort to keep me out of
trouble and from saying the wrong thing at the wrong time to the
wrong people.  God, why do I always do that?

In these emotional times, we in the crypto community find ourselves
sidelined and ignored because our technology is so universal that no
one thinks we are anything novel anymore.  I do not want to give
ammunition to these efforts by allowing the controversial sides of
cryptography to be forgotten.  I think the article correctly showed
that I over-did things a bit with that crying in the shower quote,
but that was my Publicist's idea.  "Sex sells, Phil, baby", they said
"use it".  Did I re-examine my career path and my PR efforts in the
wake of this tragedy?  Of course I did.  But the outcome of this
re-examination was the same as it was during the years when people
actually thought I was actually doing something, namely that someone
better use cryptography in perpetrating a serious crime soon or the
debate might fade and with it my glory days and meal ticket.  Thank
god for Osama!  My career is back.  I will have to do something about
that PR firm and this article business, but in the meantime read my
lips:  I have no regrets about shamelessly invoking the name of the
dead for my own personal gain and some smartassed reporter who
refuses to be a platform for my personal promotion is just going to
get run over by the new Zimmermann propaganda engine.  I'm back baby.
 I'm back.  I'm looking out for number one.  Phil.  Phil is number
one.  I'm going to buy my self some new clothes, a manicure, a
facial, get back in shape, get a makeover, all of it.  Phil is
hitting the town.  I feel like Churchill when the Nazi's started to
finally make some damn noise.  Resurrected baby.
Res-urr-fucking-ected.

The question of whether strong cryptography should be restricted by
the government was debated all through the golden years for Phil
Zimmermann, the 1990's.  This debate had the participation of the
White House, the NSA, the FBI, the courts, the Congress, the computer
industry, civilian academia, and the press.  Of course at the center
of it all was me, Phil Zimmermann.  This debate made me and PGP, both
of which would have remained obscure and generally unheard of by
anyone but geeks otherwise.  This debate fully took into account the
question of terrorists using strong crypto, and in fact, we tried to
make that that one of the core issues of the debate.  Unfortunately,
no one used crypto in a major crime or act of terrorism so the debate
fizzled out and with it went my invitations to parties, hearings,
lectures and my talk circuit fees.  Export controls were lifted and
no domestic controls were imposed.  I was pretty much out of a job.
I should never have let PGP stay freeware.  Can you imagine what I
would be worth now?  Look at Jim Bidzos!  That was a terrible mistake
that will not only hurt my wallet, but also increase my vulnerability
to smartassed reporters like that Cha chick.

PGP users should rest assured that I still will not acquiesce to any
back doors in PGP.  Of course since I have almost nothing to do with
the development of the most widespread versions of PGP anymore no one
really needs my permission to monkey with the code, do they?  Still,
I'm going to keep saying that because it makes me sound like a
general figure of menace in the community.

It is noteworthy that I had only received a single piece of hate mail
on this subject, from my PR rep, and it was only really a sample of
what would be nice for me to get so as to be able to comment on it
for the article they had arranged an interview for.  It is also
noteworthy that this one piece of mail really generated a lot of
publicity for me once it was printed in that Cha chick's article.
Pretty soon I was dealing with so many press interviews that I did
not have time to even send the check to my PR people to composed a
carefully worded reply, which would of course have been published or
leaked out quickly.  Phil is busy again baby!  Now I receive hundreds
of supportive emails, flooding in at two or three per minute!  Of
course, some people saw through my thinly veiled PR effort, but I'm
not counting those emails.  This latest spin should put all that
stuff to rest.

Thanks to my PR group I have always enjoyed good relations with the
press over the past decade, well not counting the fact that I haven't
been IN the press much lately, but boy, some things are going to
change with those people and let me assure all my fans that I'm
cutting off the Post until they start to tow the line.
