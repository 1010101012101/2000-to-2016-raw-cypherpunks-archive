Jim, please do not email me privately unless you want to say something to 
me privately. It appears as though you sent the below message to the list 
and then to me in a different message; there is no need for this, and it 
violates netiquette.

In any case, I'm inclined to believe that the First Amendment should not 
grant special rights to people who call themselves bookstores and 
journalists. Rather, we should all enjoy those rights. Being an Official 
Approved Government-Certified Journalist -- and I am one -- writing an 
article should not mean I have special privileges that only I enjoy and 
someone from an unapproved newspaper, or a cypherpunk subscriber writing 
about the same topic, does not.

-Declan
