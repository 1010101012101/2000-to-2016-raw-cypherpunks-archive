	Yeah. Ask Ulbricht.  Or the guys from agora who made it quite
	clear that tor doesn't work. Or freedom hosting, or or or

	Also, what % of 'illegal' drugs are sold through tor? 0.01%?

	It is, but that's not the point. Although, you know, using the
	state's mail system to ship drugs is as stupid as using the
	pentagon's fake anonimity network for the online side of
	the business. 

	*Furthermore*, this being the cpunks mailing list, the standard
	should be a lot higher. Tor is not a realistic option at
	all for people who have a quarrell with the powers that be.

	If you are selling an 'anonimity' network for crypto-anarchism,
	then your anonimity network better work against the US
	gov't and assorted lapdogs.

	Yes. Many US agents and agents from vasal states. That's
	how tor serves western imperialism. Is that what you want?

	You mean the state agents no?

	Yeah well. Sounds nice. Too bad there's zero evidence for that
	claim. Actually the claim is pretty absurd. How can a project
	of the US military whose purpose is to serve the US military
	and the US state 'reduce state power'? 

	Are you on drugs? =)

	
> Is that not a good thing, juan?

	No, tor is not a good a thing.

	Dissapointing. Your argument boils down to "the mafia or
	the state can do good things, maybe, sometimes". 

	So you can look at some good stuff that can be attributed to
	tor, while ignoring all the bad stuff.

	That's like basic economics turned on its head...

	lol - so now it turns out that 'pedophiles' are the moral
	equivalent of the CIA or the murdering psychos at the pentagon?
