And there's the fact that laws against such things usually either explicitly
except government ("legitimate law-enforcement needs", <ptooey!>) actions,
or are basically ignored when a cop (term used generically) violates them.
Such laws lead to a false sense of security among the sheeple who aren't
aware that the biggest fox around has a gate-key.  It also deters
manufacturers of secure hardware and software because their target audience
is falsely placated.

Why, for example, do secure, encrypted telephones not yet exist in an EASILY
useable form?   ("Go to Radio Snack, buy the box, take it home, plug it
in.")  Technically, it's quite possible:  1 Gigaflop DSP's are available and
should be far more than necessary, 28K bidirectional modems are dirt-cheap,
etc.
