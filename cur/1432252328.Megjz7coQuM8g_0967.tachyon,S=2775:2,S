So, what's my reason to accept a "payment in cpu time"?  As best as I
can tell, a "payment in cpu time" means that someone *else* doesn't
get a payment in cpu time with their spam.  I still get the spam.

It seems analagous to a protocol that proves that someone burned a
dollar bill.

A scheme where I actually get something of value might have a bit more
traction..
