Very cool...  

I think it would be a profoundly and disturbingly interesting 
problem to try and do a security verification on the place, 
especially since miles and miles of cabling and fiber optic 
are being "inherited" -- do you know everything that stuff is 
hooked up to?  Have you checked every inch of it to make sure 
it's not hooked up to something else too?  Do you even know 
where all of it GOES?

Heh.  These astronomers may never know whether the NSA is reading 
all their astronomy long before they announce it.  Fortunately, 
there's not *too* much motive to keep astronomy secret.
