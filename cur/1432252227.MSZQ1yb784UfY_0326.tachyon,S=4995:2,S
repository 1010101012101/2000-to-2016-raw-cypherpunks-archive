What I don't see mentioned in this little article is that fact that WEP is 
largely useless in terms of security. So in a way the Chinese were 
attempting to jump into that hole.

Of course, Zhong Nan Hai will have a nice backdoor for themselves.

In In China things will play out like this if they successfully enact the 
standard:

t=0: Standard enacted
t= 6 months: Some concerns stated about the new standard's security. Jong 
Nan Hai issues statements in reply 'proving' that the concerns are 
unwarranted.
t=9 months: Standard is hacked wide open...a simple tool is posted on the 
Internet internationally, and by Chinese locally.
t=10 months: All links to the hack internationally are shut down, any locals 
still crowing about the security are arrested. Jong Nan Hai either ignores 
claims of a hack or else states that a simple patch has closed the hole, 
which was no big deal anyway.
t=14 months: WiFi routinely hacked in China. Jong Nan Hai continues to claim 
standard is secure, except for very rare cases. But states that anyone 
eavesdropping will be prosecuted and possibly executed.
t=18 months: Jong Nan hai claims standard is safe because of government 
control. Meanwhile, no Chinese use WiFi for anything critical.
