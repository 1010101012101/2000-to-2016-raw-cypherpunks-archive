No, no 'harm' occurs in that situation. Nothing that was 'yours' was
damaged or othewise manipulated without your consent. Those potential
customers decision to shop at your store or another isn't 'yours'.

Your desires and expectations weren't fulfilled by the expectations of
the market or your approach to using it. However, you have no reason to
expect those people to have an obligation to do business with you.

Typical logical schism in C-A-C-L thinking, the 'individual' is everything
and the 'group' is nothing. Not putting 2+2 that the 'group' is nothing
but the collective actions of the individual. This is not the sort of 
'individualism' that Hayek and other free market proponents are refering
too. In a very real sense it's mis-representation.
