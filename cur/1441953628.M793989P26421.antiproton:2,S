Hi,

I am german, so let's look at your question:

It does. Because there's no uniform ethnicity or whatever you might call
it, in a country, at least not in germany. Germans are: Saxons,
Bavarians, SaarlÃ¤nders, Turks, Roma, Blacks, Asians, Moslems,
Everything. There is a mix of people with different backgrounds,
different religions (or no religion), different ancestors. Their sum
forms what we know today as the "german culture", whatever that might
be.

Or course not.

All humans are refugees or descendants or refugees. Look at north
america. Coloured people came from africa (well, they didn't exactly
"came", they've been brought), caucasians came from europe, the natives
even came from siberia (50.000 years ago or something). Those migrations
happened all the time during the last 2 mio years over human history.

Therefore, to claim to have a right to live in a uniform culture,
undisturbed by newcomers, is arrogant and absurd. And even if such a
right might exist, the right to live trumps it anyway.

Wanna send back children into a war zone because Oktoberfest?



best,
