Well whatever you do, don't look for wise advice from this list. Merely
trying to get some helpful points of view may result in Declan giving you a
verbal body slam. I know, I'm in the same position that you are, and I
foolishly looked for OTHER people's opinions, as opposed to thinking that I
had it all figured out. The thing I may have learned, though, is that there
is strength in being completely pragmatic, and there is strength in
relentless dedication to your convictions, but being a wishy washy debating
idealist will get you run over. What I am attempting to do now is be SURE of
what I am going to do, so that I can vote with some confidence, because a
half-hearted fight for what I want isn't much of a fight at all.

ok,
Rush
