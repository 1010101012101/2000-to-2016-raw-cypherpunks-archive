Good Day,

We invite you to list your business in the all new "Directory of
Investigative Professionals," a global register of professional
investigators, expert services, security and equipment specialists,
associations, and publications.

During the next three months, we will personally invite more than 13,000
professional investigators to list their firms in this unique Internet
guide.  Take advantage of this timely opportunity to advertise your
company for free!  Great exposure to the people most likely to buy your
merchandise.

Your "listing" is no ordinary "listing."  You get an entire Web page to
present your company and list your product  lines.  A free Web page for
three months!  After that you pay just $10 per month.

Change your information on-line, anytime.  Add monthly specials, announce new products.
