JA, ya' gotta good point here. Or at least, this sheds a lot of doubt on 
things.

But then again, the purpose of GIG-BE may be precisely to move an optical 
copy (use a $100 splitter) back to processing centers where the traffic is 
stored. In this case, they won't even be trying to break it down to circuits 
prior to storage...they may instead dump the raw OC-Ns directly onto some 
kind of fast storage medium and then sift through it later.

The idea of duplicating all optical traffic seems a little farfetched, 
though, but I bet everything from the cable landings may soon get swallowed 
whole, if it isn't already. I'm still thinking they must do some kind of 
"grooming" prior to mass backhauls of traffic. There are just too many 
fibers and too many transmission systems out there for them to duplicate all 
of it. Perhaps at the routers they sniff, and then CALEA whatever circuit 
that conversation came out of.
