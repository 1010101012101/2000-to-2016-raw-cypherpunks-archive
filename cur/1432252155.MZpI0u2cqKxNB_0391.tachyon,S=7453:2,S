The following is a documentlist obtained from the danish
ministry of information technology and science concerning the
international law enforcement telecommunications seminar ILETS 97 held
january 1997 in Dublin.

I haven't been able to locate the documents listed and all FOIA-requests
concerning the documents have consequently been denied under exceptions
concerning national security and Denmarks relations to foreign
governments.

Anyhow, since only a few tidbits of information have surfaced from the ILETS
seminars over the years I thought that the documentlist still might be
interesting enough to be worth publishing.


Yours

Bo Elkjaer, Denmark
