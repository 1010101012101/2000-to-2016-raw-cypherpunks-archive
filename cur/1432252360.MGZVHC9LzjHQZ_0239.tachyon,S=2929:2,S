Extract...>>attempted suicide punishable by death. There are other examples 
of similar, but not as ludicrous, legal situations where the only person

AP."Making suicide pay since the ides of march 2001."

Choate,ex. >>...very few follow the CACL philosophy therefore it must not 
be 'true'). <<

Its worth staking to an antsnest and checking on occasionally.)
