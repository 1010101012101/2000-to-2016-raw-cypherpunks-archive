Muzaffar Wandawi's home page is at http://people.a2000.nl/mwandawi/ and
his email address is wandm@dds.nl.

Hmm. I might hire him as a web designer some day.

Anyone else think he's got a good shot at a libel suit against "Dr. Robert
W.  Koontz" for his "Conclusion #1"?

"1) Muzaffar Wandawi was involved in the attacks on the World Trade
centers, and it appears he uses his drawings and paintings to encode
orders to terrorists, including al Qaeda."
