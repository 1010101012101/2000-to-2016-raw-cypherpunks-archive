   from the joke's-on-you dept.
   Daedala writes "The debate over [1]contactless chips with biometric
   information in passports continues. Vendors have been chosen for
   testing in the [2]U.S. and [3]Australia. [4]Privacy advocates are
   still arguing about the measure, as are [5]security reporters and
   [6]bloggers. The [7]specs themselves are interesting, to say the
   least. The EETimes says that [8]in interoperability tests, the
   potential chips could be read from 30 feet away. However, both they
   and the New York Times have published [9]articles reporting vendors'
   low-cost solution: '[I]incorporate a layer of metal foil into the
   cover of the passport so it could be read only when opened.' Don't
   they know that the whole tinfoil hat thing is supposed to be a joke?"
