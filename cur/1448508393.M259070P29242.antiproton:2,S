The Shadows in the Cave

I had intended this week=E2=80=99s post to be the next episode in the Ret=
rotopia
narrative, chronicling Peter Carr=E2=80=99s meeting with the irrepressibl=
e Col.
Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance
County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another
week. No, I haven=E2=80=99t decided to comment instead on the recent spat=
e of
terror attacks in France.  As people in a variety of other corners of
the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third
World every few days.  The only reason this latest horror has gotten so
much air time is that it affected people in one of the world=E2=80=99s
privileged countries instead.

Nor am I going to be devoting this week=E2=80=99s post to the latest, ext=
remely
troubling round of news from the climate change front=E2=80=94though that=
=E2=80=99s
going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I=E2=80=99ve had =
time to
do a little more research. That=E2=80=99s a far bigger story than the ter=
ror
attacks in Paris, though of course it=E2=80=99s not getting anything like=
 as
much attention in the media.  From the beginning of serious salt water
infiltration into South Florida=E2=80=99s aquifers, through ominously bul=
ging
sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly
frightening data points from Greenland, it=E2=80=99s clear that we=E2=80=99=
ve passed the
threshold from =E2=80=9Csomething may happen someday=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9C=
something is happening
now=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94a transition that probably has quite a bit to do wit=
h the
increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now,
and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those
activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just
join hands and sing =E2=80=9CKum ba ya=E2=80=9D one more time.

No, this week=E2=80=99s post is going to explore a topic that=E2=80=99s f=
ar less
important in the overall scheme of things, though it=E2=80=99s not withou=
t its
relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I
fielded in response to last week=E2=80=99s post here on The Archdruid Rep=
ort,
which was an exploration of our culture=E2=80=99s taboo against choosing =
not to
use the latest technologies.

<http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-heresy-of-technologic=
al-choice.html>

I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and
it certainly did. What I didn=E2=80=99t expect was that it would receive =
more
comments than any other post in the history of The Archdruid Report, and
the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two
points of that post. The first of these points is that there=E2=80=99s a
significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or
another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles,
microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable
technologies. The second is that there=E2=80=99s an even larger number of=

Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make
such choices.

Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute
classics of the type. There was the couple who don=E2=80=99t enjoy televi=
sion
and so don=E2=80=99t own one, and had a relative ask them every single ye=
ar,
over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas.=20
They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and
bought them a television anyway because she just couldn=E2=80=99t stand t=
he
thought that they weren=E2=80=99t watching one. There was the coworker wh=
o
plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of
one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and
there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the
person who, offended by another reader=E2=80=99s lack of interest in tele=
vision,
finally shouted, =E2=80=9CYou must be living in a dream world!=E2=80=9D E=
r, which of
these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors
playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settin=
gs?

Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying.
Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people
because they didn=E2=80=99t happen to have, and weren=E2=80=99t intereste=
d in having,
microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently
fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not
in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that
you=E2=80=99re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever=

lifestyle you want.  According to a significant fraction of
Americans=E2=80=94and to judge from what my readers reported, that fracti=
on
isn=E2=80=99t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the
country=E2=80=94the only freedom you=E2=80=99re supposed to exercise, whe=
n it comes to
technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on
each item in the officially approved list of devices you=E2=80=99re expec=
ted to own.

The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today=E2=80=99s Ame=
rica is
a fascinating point, and one we=E2=80=99ll explore in a few moments, with=
 the
able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week=E2=80=99s post by=
 the
minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first
is the fact that so many people responded to last week=E2=80=99s post so
positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by
an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the
outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite
of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response
makes me suspect that something significant is going on here.

By that I don=E2=80=99t mean that there=E2=80=99s some sort of groundswel=
l of
renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same
spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves
for the good of their souls. That=E2=80=99s one of the common stereotypes=

directed at those of us who aren=E2=80=99t interested in the latest techn=
otrash,
and it completely misses what=E2=80=99s actually going on. I=E2=80=99ll u=
se myself as an
example here. I don=E2=80=99t own a television=E2=80=94I haven=E2=80=99t =
owned one in my adult
life=E2=80=94and it=E2=80=99s not because I have some moral or political =
objection to
televisions, or because I=E2=80=99m into self-denial, or what have you. I=
 don=E2=80=99t
own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as
eating a bowl of warm snot.

It=E2=80=99s not the programming, either=E2=80=94that=E2=80=99s another o=
f the standard
stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about
television is the programming, and it=E2=80=99s as inaccurate as the rest=
=2E  To
me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk
around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable,
no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes,
I grew up with a television in the house.  I experienced plenty of it
back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more,
because I don=E2=80=99t like it. It really is that simple. It=E2=80=99s t=
hat simple for
others as well: they don=E2=80=99t find this or that technology enjoyable=
,
useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they=E2=80=99ve chosen to=
 do
something else with their money and time. Shouldn=E2=80=99t so simple and=

personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else=E2=80=99s?

To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely
field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last
week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above
to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody
was airily announcing that he wasn=E2=80=99t interested in being friends =
with
somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the
other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are
good with that=E2=80=94somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback=
 for
their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn=E2=80=99t somebody we wan=
t as a
friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week=E2=80=
=99s
post, which belong in a category by themselves.

I=E2=80=99m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn=E2=80=99t show up=
 in the comment
queue for The Archdruid Report. It appeared instead on one of the many
other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among
several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television
obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their
teevees. You=E2=80=99ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that =
one=E2=80=99s
hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts=E2=80=94as in fact =
I do=E2=80=94I
must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to
eradicating the entire species. Not so;  Arachis hypogaea is welcome to
live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally
welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.  In
fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in
return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself.

The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many
other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don=E2=80=99=
t
enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels
particularly threatened by the fact that I don=E2=80=99t like something t=
hey do,
and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least,
that obviously wasn=E2=80=99t the case, and it=E2=80=99s worth reflecting=
 on the vast
personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction.
Still, that was one of a kind, so we=E2=80=99ll pass on to the others.

A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to
last week=E2=80=99s post was the insistence that if I don=E2=80=99t have =
a television, a
microwave, or a cell phone, I=E2=80=99m a hypocrite if I have an internet=

connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a
moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in
having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the
kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an
internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that
used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any
other perspective, it=E2=80=99s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in =
fact
allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies,
those that make them happiest=E2=80=94as the cheerleaders of the consumer=

economy delight to insist=E2=80=94what could possibly be wrong with choos=
ing
some old technologies and some newer ones, if that=E2=80=99s the mix you =
prefer?

Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older
time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those
days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the
technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last
week=E2=80=99s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to the=
ir
modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time,
but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again,
there=E2=80=99s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that wa=
s
invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the
various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those
evils happened, wouldn=E2=80=99t that also mean that the internet is just=
 as
indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to
be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What=E2=
=80=99s
sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...

Finally, there=E2=80=99s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, t=
he
insistence that anybody who doesn=E2=80=99t use the latest, hottest techn=
otrash
wants to go =E2=80=9Cback to the caves,=E2=80=9D or to even take all of h=
umanity to that
much-denounced destination. =E2=80=9CThe caves=E2=80=9D have a bizarre gr=
avitational
effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers.=20
Everything that=E2=80=99s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy
technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts
and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century
of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our
prehistoric ancestors.

When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the
neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going =E2=80=9Cback to the caves,=
=E2=80=9D
they=E2=80=99re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavem=
en and
Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and
central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention
factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering
much of the planet=E2=80=99s land surface, and a great deal more of the s=
ame
kind! That=E2=80=99s absurd, of course. It=E2=80=99s even more absurd to =
insist that
people who simply don=E2=80=99t enjoy using this or that technology, and =
so
don=E2=80=99t use it, are going back to =E2=80=9Cthe caves=E2=80=9D=E2=80=
=94but I can promise you, dear
reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of
interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you=E2=80=99ll have this=
 phrase
thrown at you.

That happens because =E2=80=9Cthe caves=E2=80=9D aren=E2=80=99t real. The=
y aren=E2=80=99t, for example,
the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen
thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of
Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves
of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by
their beauty and artistry. =E2=80=9CThe caves=E2=80=9D of contemporary rh=
etoric, rather,
are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have
been taught to use so they don=E2=80=99t ask inconvenient questions about=
 where
this thing called =E2=80=9Cprogress=E2=80=9D is taking us and whether any=
 sane person
would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex
richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled =E2=80=
=9Cthe
caves=E2=80=9D is one way to do that.  So is papering over the distinctly=
 ugly
future we=E2=80=99re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from =
a
Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re headed f=
or the stars!=E2=80=9D

It=E2=80=99s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the i=
mage of
the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that
long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a
very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was
courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more
than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname
Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his
works, usually called The Republic=E2=80=94a bad choice, as this word now=
adays
has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title Politeia
lacks=E2=80=94he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and =
reality
with an arresting image.

Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn
our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this
way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark
shapes are all we know.  They are our reality.

Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his
shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it.
He=E2=80=99s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is=
 a
bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the
objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality
is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects.

If the prisoner who=E2=80=99s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, h=
e might
just notice that the cave isn=E2=80=99t limited to the bonfire, the priso=
ners,
the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those
objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes
upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn=E2=80=99t seem t=
o come
from the fire at all. If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might
decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the
shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows
brighter and clearer.

Then, if he=E2=80=99s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the c=
ave and
into the sunlight. That=E2=80=99s not an easy thing, either, because the =
light
is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a
while, he can=E2=80=99t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to=
 find
his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the
way shadows moved on the cave wall won=E2=80=99t help him at all in this =
new,
blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows,
and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world.

Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the
sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things=E2=80=94colo=
r, for
example, and depth=E2=80=94which didn=E2=80=99t exist in the shadow-world=
 he thought he
inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can
even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world
actually comes from.

Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to
tell the remaining prisoners what he=E2=80=99s seen. To begin with, it=E2=
=80=99s going
to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant
daylight and so he=E2=80=99s going to trip and stumble on the way down. O=
nce he
gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed
as the most consummate rubbish:  what is this nonsense about color and
depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the
sky? What=E2=80=99s more, the people to whom he=E2=80=99s addressing his =
words are going
to misunderstand them, thinking that they=E2=80=99re about the shadow-wor=
ld in
front of their eyes=E2=80=94after all, that=E2=80=99s the only reality th=
ey know=E2=80=94and
they=E2=80=99re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing =
he says
has anything to do with the shadow-world.

Plato didn=E2=80=99t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying t=
o drag
the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his
shackles back on, though that=E2=80=99s generally the way such things wor=
k out
in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in
a way=E2=80=94if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with=
 the
bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and
simply said, =E2=80=9CImagine that we=E2=80=99re all watching television =
in a dark room.=E2=80=9D

Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and
developed it in directions that aren=E2=80=99t relevant to this week=E2=80=
=99s post. The
point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that
shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases,
such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it=E2=80=99s hard =
not to
see=E2=80=94unless, that is, you don=E2=80=99t want to see it.  In other =
cases, it=E2=80=99s
subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter
rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order
to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.

There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us
prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the
walls of the cave. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean that we=E2=80=99re going to =
drag those who
don=E2=80=99t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that =
we=E2=80=99re
going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that=E2=80=99s=
 being
waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does
mean=E2=80=94or so the response to last week=E2=80=99s post suggests=E2=80=
=94that a significant
number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering
up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean
cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them
into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they
expect.

******************
On an entirely personal note, I=E2=80=99m pleased to report that Founders=
