A reasonable workaround might be something like:
   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3056.txt
    ... to allow isolated IPv6 domains or
    hosts, attached to an IPv4 network which has no native IPv6 support,
    to communicate with other such IPv6 domains or hosts with minimal
    manual configuration, before they can obtain natuve IPv6
    connectivity.  It incidentally provides an interim globally unique
    IPv6 address prefix to any site with at least one globally unique
    IPv4 address, even if combined with an IPv4 Network Address
    Translator (NAT).
