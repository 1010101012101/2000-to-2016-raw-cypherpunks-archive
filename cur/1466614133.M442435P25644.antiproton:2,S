However, see 1943 Supreme Court case Wickard v. Filburn. =C2=A0Wikipedia: =
=C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn
In what had to have been the high-water mark for justification of Federal G=
overnment powers, from Wikipedia:
"An Ohio farmer,=C2=A0Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat for use to feed ani=
mals on his own farm. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat p=
roduction based on acreage owned by a farmer, in order to stabilize wheat p=
rices and supplies. In 1941 Filburn grew more than the limits permitted and=
 he was ordered to pay a penalty of $117.11. He claimed his wheat was not s=
old in interstate commerce and so the penalty could not apply to him. The S=
upreme Court stated "The intended disposition of the crop here involved has=
 not been expressly stated..." and later "Whether the subject of the regula=
tion in question was "production," "consumption," or "marketing" is, theref=
ore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power be=
fore us [...] [b]ut even if appellee's activity be local and though it may =
not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached =
by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commer=
ce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earli=
er time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'"[4]""The Supreme Court=
 interpreted the=C2=A0United States Constitution's=C2=A0Commerce Clause=C2=
=A0under Article 1 Section 8, which permits the=C2=A0United States Congress=
=C2=A0"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several Sta=
tes, and with the Indian Tribes." The Court decided that Filburn's wheat gr=
owing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed o=
n the open market, which is traded nationally (interstate), and is therefor=
e within the purview of the=C2=A0Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relati=
vely small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would no=
t affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of=
 other farmers just like Filburn would certainly become substantial. Theref=
ore, according to the court, Filburn's production could be regulated by the=
 federal government."
I consider the Supreme Court's 'reasoning' in this case to be insane. =C2=
