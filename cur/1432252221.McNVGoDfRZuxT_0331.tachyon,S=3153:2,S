The point is  that virtually anyone in an OECD country will qualify at some 
time or another as to (A) and (B) and to *someone* as to (C).  They are 
wealthy enough but they may not know they have a use for anonymity 
technologies ( though many use SSL daily without even knowing it).  The 
beauty of a networked world is that anyone no matter how bizarre can find 
others who accept you and potentially know enough about these useful 
technologies to share them with you.

Given the over-representation of libertarians in crypto, corporate execs 
are the least in need of such "connected" friends.
