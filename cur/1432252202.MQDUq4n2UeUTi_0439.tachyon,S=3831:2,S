Hmm. In the 1980s, I ran a BBS using GBBS on an Apple IIe and later an
Apple IIgs with first a Sider ][ 20 MB and then some SCSI 40 MB HDs.

GBBS just supported one user at a time, of course (I recall the
DiversiDial or somesuch software on the Apple II allowed as many users
as you had Super Serial cards or AppleCats), so I had the leech
problem. Another way around it was to limit access to the download
area to pre-approved users or folks who came with recommendations or
folks, as you say, who contributed something first. Some BBSs took
this to a bit of an extreme and asked pretty pointed questions, like
"what are your latest/best warez?" before assigning an account.
