You know, the more I read posts by Mr. Donald, the more I believe that
he is quite possibly the most apt troll I have ever encountered. It is
quite apparent from reading his responses that he is obviously an
exceptionally intelligent (academically anyway) individual. I find it
hard to believe that such intelligence could reside in a person with
such critically flawed core beliefs. 

I have a hunch that Mr. Donald is instead playing the role of an
elaborate "devil's advocate", furiously defending his stance against
retaliations by our fellow Cypherpunks. Tyler Durden mentioned this
hypothesis many emails ago, and I believe him to be accurate, especially
since Mr. Donald never responded to the charge.

None-the-less, this has been one of the more inteteresting (and
infuriating) threads in recent memory of Cypherpunks. I'm glad we're
going through it with such vigor.
