Transmitter is easy to find. Receiver is easy to jam with a micropower
jammer. Sometimes all you need could just be creatively tweaking the
ignition and antenna wiring to get "faulty shielding" in the right places;
it requires much more experience to make it look "accidental", though.

Another possible definition is the right to tell the truth and get away
with it.

But both definitions are rather about free speech than about privacy, but
then we'd get to a fight over definitions which is in this context better
to leave on the shoulders of people making encyclopedias.
