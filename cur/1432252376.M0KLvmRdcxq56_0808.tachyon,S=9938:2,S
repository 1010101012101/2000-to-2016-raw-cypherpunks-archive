On this day...1979 -- Native American political prisoner Leonard Peltier
escapes Lompoc federal penitentiary, California.

The first issue of Open Road, a kick-ass, and very well produced, anarchist 
news-journal came out of Vancouver in August of 1976, transforming radical 
politics in Canada. Many of the articles in that first issue - Leonard 
Peltier's impending extradition to the U.S., George Jackson Brigade 
actions, an interview with Martin Soastre, a Puerto Rican anarchist and 
former POW, coverage of Native and prisoners' struggles - would not look 
out of place in the PNS today. Open Road motivated the creation of a more 
action-orientated, militant politic in Vancouver such as the Anarchist 
Party of Canada (Groucho-Marxist) which carried out a series of "pieings" - 
literally throwing a pie in the face of a politician or celebrity, with 
Eldridge Cleaver being the most famous "hit" - in order to make a political 
point. As simple as this may sound, it brought about political and personal 
transformations from planning and carrying out the actions to dealing with 
the consequences - confrontations with reactionaries and authorities. The 
more serious people in the scene started to do support work for the 
prisoners in the old B.C. Pen whose struggles eventually resulted in its 
closure. From then on, prisons have been an essential part of the work 
taken on by our circles. Out of this came Direct Action, an armed group 
which in 1982 blew-up an electrical substation on Vancouver Island ($5 
million in damages) and a Litton Industries factory north of Toronto that 
built components for the Cruise Missile ($10 million in damages and several 
injuries). Some of the same people were also involved in the Wimmin's Fire 
Brigade firebombing of three video stories specializing in violent porn. 
They were arrested in January, 1983, immediately putting us into doing 
support work. In June of 1983 Bulldozer was raided and threatened with a 
charge of Seditious Libel (calling for the armed overthrow of the state) 
for the distribution of support-leaflets we were putting out. A mid-wife, 
living with us at the time, was arrested and charged with "performing an 
abortion" in an attempt to get information from her about our links to 
Direct Action. After several thousand dollars in legal fees, and a year of 
high-stress, all the serious charges were dropped in connection to the 
raid. After losing several legal challenges over the legality of evidence, 
the Vancouver Five, as they had come to be called, pled guilty to several 
charges related to the actions.
"The most important thing is for us to find Osama bin Laden. It is our 
number one priority and we will not rest until we find him!"
- George W. Bush, September 13, 2001

"I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and I really don't care. 
It's not that important. It's not our priority."
- George W. Bush, March 13, 2002
