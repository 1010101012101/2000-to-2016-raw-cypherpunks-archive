Yah, I know. You're right, though, it should be spelled out, not only
for the non-USians on the list but for the products of the modern
American educational system. (Of which I am one, but I'm trying to
overcome it.)

Legally, you're right. But since the Guard units are partially trained
and equipped with federal money and operate under federal strictures, I
don't generally distinguish between state and federal military forces.

And of course Gov Davis, like so many others, are "fighting the last
war". The organized terrorists won't be going after planes for the
second punch, though half-witted copycats will. And the copycats could
be stopped by allowing off-duty senior combat soldiers to carry guns on
planes, but of course that would lessen the need for centralized power
and will never be countenanced.


By the way, I like the sig you used on your message. A bit lengthy, but
worth the read.
