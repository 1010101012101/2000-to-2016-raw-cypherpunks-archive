That would be contingent upon whether or not anybody above a particular pay
grade has ever heard of it, understands it, or has someone tell them that
it could be a bad thing.  There isn't a unified front on Bitcoin in
government right now; probably a few geeks they have as contractors know of
it but they're not talking about it on site.

That said, cryptocurrency's been tried in the past, and it was the lack of
chargebacks (which banks make obscene amounts off of) rather than the
legality which killed it.
