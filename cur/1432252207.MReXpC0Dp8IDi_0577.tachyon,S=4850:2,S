Americans Split on Wiretapping Controversy


???


???
latest news and polls



(Angus Reid Global Scan) ??? Adults in the United States are divided
over their federal administration???s decision to monitor specific
conversations, according to a poll by Gallup released by CNN and USA
Today. 50 per cent of respondents believe the government was right to
wiretap telephone conversations between U.S. citizens and suspected
terrorists without getting a court order.

On Dec. 19, U.S. president George W. Bush defended a secret domestic
electronic surveillance program that includes the wiretapping of the
telephone calls and e-mails of Americans suspected of having
terrorist ties. The president???s remarks came in response to media
reports that, since 2002, Bush has authorized the National Security
Agency (NSA) to operate this program without any judicial oversight.

Bush said the program is a vital tool in the war on terror and added
that "the fact that we???re discussing this (???) is helping the
enemy." The president also referred to the disclosure of the
program???s existence to the media a "shameful act."

The Patriot Act???passed by Congress and signed into law by Bush in
October 2001???enables the federal government to gather information on
suspected terrorists through court-ordered wiretaps and searches. 63
per cent of respondents believe the Patriot Act should either keep
all of its provisions or go through some minor changes, while 31 per
cent suggest enacting a major overhaul or eliminating the legislation
completely.

Polling Data

As you may know, the Bush administration has been wiretapping
telephone conversations between U.S. citizens living in the United
States and suspected terrorists living in other countries without
getting a court order allowing it to do so. Do you think the Bush
administration was right or wrong in wiretapping these conversations
without obtaining a court order?



Right

50%

Wrong

46%

No opinion

4%

As you may know, shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001, a law called the Patriot Act was passed, which makes it easier
for the federal government to get information on suspected terrorists
through court-ordered wiretaps and searches. Based on what you have
heard or read about the Patriot Act, do you think all of its
provisions should be kept, that it needs minor changes, that it needs
major changes, or that it needs to be eliminated completely?



Keep all provisions

13%

Minor changes

50%

Major changes

24%

Eliminated completely

7%

No opinion
