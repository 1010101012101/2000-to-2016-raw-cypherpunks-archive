Announcements and News
======================

Brian Warner announced_ the 1.9 plan.  For a new feature to make into
1.9, it must have a ticket with a patch in the "Review-Needed" state by
24 July.  The developers will review and land said patches over the
following week, ending 31 July.

Bug fixes will work exactly the same as new features except the patch
and review needed deadline is 31 July and the developers' review ends 7
Aug.

The beta should be cut on 8 Aug with 3 weeks of testing to follow.  The
final release is scheduled for 31 Aug.

While MDMF will be the core of this release, Tahoe will not create them
by default.  Due to it being a compatibility impacting feature, the
development team plans to have the feature in a release or two before
enabling it by default.

In the interests of allowing the developers to work towards 1.9, we are
postponing the Interview with the Developers section until after the
release.

Open Source Project of the Week
===============================

The Open Source Project of the Week is `The Crypto Project`_.

"The Crypto Project is an organization designed to assist and encourage
anonymity and encryption research, development, and use.  As part of
this goal, we seek to revitalize the Cypherpunk movement and provide
better software, security, and anonymity to individuals worldwide."

The Crypto Project covers a variety of crypto projects including
Tahoe-LAFS.

>From the tahoe-dev Mailing List
===============================

Linus Lussing started a discussion on Tahoe-LAFS and `SSHFS latency`_
issues.

With 1.9 fast approaching, Zooko posted a `request for help`_ with
updating the documentation.  He already updated the FAQ_.

In response to last week's question on the differences between
Tahoe-LAFS and Freenet, Zooko provided a rather nice answer_.

Zooko suggested_ dropping support for all versions of Python with the
exception of 2.7 on Windows.

Zooko recommended_ ticket 68_ to Andre Stenvall if Tahoe-LAFS still
interested him for his master thesis work.  Ticket 68_ works to
implement distributed introduction, thereby eliminating the introducer
as a single point of failure.

Brandon Meskimen and Josh Wilcox discussed how to run a `Tahoe-LAFS
introducer`_.

Zooko and Samuel Neves discussed `hash based signatures`_ for
Tahoe-LAFS.

Patch Needing Review of the Week
================================

The Patch Needing Review of the Week is 393_.  This patch covers MDMF, a
key feature in 1.9.  You may recall MDMF from our `interview with Kevan`_.
When the review is completed, we are one step closer to 1.9
