First, let me say I too find Larry Ellison's comments extremely
displeasing. This is in no way intended to imply otherwise.

Tim, are you defending Adobe in that paragraph above? (I can't imagine
that you would be, so I'm interested to hear such an argument, if that's
the case.)

If I recall, boycottadobe.com happened two or three days after news of
Abobe's actions became public. The EFF's response came even later. I
wouldn't expect to see anything from the EFF about this the same day it
becomes news, especially on a weekend.

If we hear nothing from the EFF in the next week, that will certainly be
cause for criticism of the organization.
