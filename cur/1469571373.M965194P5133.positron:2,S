Depending on which phone you have and which ROM you flash onto it,
you can get an Android phone that is -mostly- independent of the
Google ecosystem - an independent app store (F-droid), firefox as
the browser, different mail clients (k-9, etc)…. different EVERYTHING,
basically, but the core system for managing the UI, and connecting
to networks/making calls/etc.  I mean, yes, you are still running google 
code at the core of the thing - but you can get some distance.

E.g. -

http://www.xda-developers.com/setting-up-android-marshmallow-without-google/
http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/using-android-without-google/


Over the years I’ve played with dozens of ROMs on a handful of
different android phones… its fun screwing around with them.

I’ve gotta keep an iPhone for work, and honestly the iPhone 5s looks
like a piece of fucking junk compared to my nexus 6.
