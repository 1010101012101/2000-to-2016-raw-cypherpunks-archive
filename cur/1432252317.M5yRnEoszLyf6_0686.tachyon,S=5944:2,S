Bill,
I apologize on behalf of my colleague. You are, of course, correct.

I didn't read the article before it was published (for reasons you can 
imagine), and in fact I didn't catch that error before I sent it out. I've 
forwarded your message internally.

To answer your question, no, editors don't do fact checking at daily or 
supra-daily news orgs. Generally only magazines have fact-checkers; 
everyone else relies on their reporters to do so.

-Declan
