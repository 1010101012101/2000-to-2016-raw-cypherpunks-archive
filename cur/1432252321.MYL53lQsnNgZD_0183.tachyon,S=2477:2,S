Actualy any time that can't be described using a polynomial (i.e. a0 +
a1x + a2x^2 + ...) is NP. For example something that executes in factorial
or exponential time is NP.

If it is found that all NP can be reduced to P then I'd expect to see
somebody be able to express a factorial (for example) as a polynomial.
I ain't holding my breath.

The 'nondeterministic' part simply means it's unknown if the problem can
be reduced to a polynomial representation.

As to 'guessing', some processes are polynomial and some aren't.
