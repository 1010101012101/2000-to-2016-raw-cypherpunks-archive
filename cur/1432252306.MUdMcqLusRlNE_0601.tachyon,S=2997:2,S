Automotive environments are known to be harsh, so electronics is protected
to some extent.  The assumption is that spark plug voltages can get into
sensors, so most data lines are protected as are the sensor lines.  If you
try to fry things with double the voltage of a standard spark plug it may
not work, if you use 10 times that it will, but the ESD protection will
obviously be blown too.  That begins to look suspicious (but I doubt
anyone could _prove_ you fried it on purpose).

The main question is how deep is the memory of these things.  If they only
remember the last catastrophic event then "privacy" isn't a problem.  The
actual routes taken are not stored.  If you are in an accident and the
cops ask you to take a breath test, you can take the test or not - and
deal with the consequences of the legal system based on your choice.  The
data taken from the recorder for the "event" is then corroboration, which
may help instead of hurt you.

If the box remembers everything you do, and the garage mechanic can use it
to blackmail you, then it becomes a "privacy" issue.  I think the issue is
when data is removed, and how much is actually stored.  Can anybody
explain the details?

Patience, persistence, truth,
