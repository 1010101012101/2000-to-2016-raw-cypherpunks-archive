weird, a couple thousand years of history disagree with you. until the
very recent past, pretty much everyone was sure that killing enemies,
unbelievers or other people isn't "evil". probably isn't even "murder".

ironically, you seem to agree somewhat that bombing a couple hectars of
an "evil nation" isn't murder, either...

I never disagreed on the pragmatic point. however, there's still a vast
difference between "I'm afraid X might kill me, too" and "X is evil".
two examples: you can be afraid of becoming victim of a natural
disaster, but I don't think you'd label that evil. OTOH I'm fairly sure
that someone can earn the "evil" label without killing a single being.

nice, but old trick of passing judgement on someone in such a form that
it also invalidates his (possibly different) judgement on you. but it's
just cheap dialectics, not "truth".

remember that many more non-germans died in WW2 than germans. we really
shouldn't use body-count as a measure of truth.

during the invasion of poland, the polish casualties were several orders
of magnitude higher than the german ones. according to your logic, these
people died because they believed erreneous that they should defend
themselves against german aggression. according to your logic, they were
fools and others should have learned from their errors. france
definitely shouldn't have defended itself, should it? but they were
fools, according to your argument, and died as a result of their error.
others should have learned and stopped opposing the germans.


you can't judge history while it's still in the making. unfortunately,
history is pretty much always unfinished. some ancient greek ideas that
were burried 2000 years ago were resurrected earlier this century.

there's no "right" and "wrong" in history, only events. we are the ones
who put signs unto the events, blinding ourselves to the fact that
anything a subject does is by definition subjective.

"evil regimes" aren't the only ones who try to control information as
much as possible. pretty much every corporation believes that it needs
an extensive PR machinery in order to control the flow of information
about itself.

"evil regimes" just couple this desire with the ability to actually
conduct an extensive control.

then again, I don't quite see your point here. you happily proceed to
define qualities of "evil", skipping by the very step of declaring
something evil that's the whole point of this discussion.

who decides what is wrong and right in moral beliefs? you ever had any
sex outside a marriage? not long ago, that was widely accepted as being
one of the worst sins imaginable.

there's no "right" or "wrong" in morals. there's just people who declare
certain things to be one or the other.

oh, and don't rest your points on anyone's predictions not having come
true. for every marx who made predictions that didn't happen, there's 10
non-marxs who did the same.

your point is? that the percentage of "friendly fire" defines what is
right and what is wrong?

sorry, I disagree heavily.

"1+1=3" is wrong, but neither evil nor murderous. then, there's a lot of
"sinful", "wrong" or "evil" things in every culture that have nothing to
do with murder. and there's even murder that is not regarded as wrong or
evil by lots of people, such as the death sentence.

these things may be related, but they're definitely not identical.

that's two broad categories and two broad predictions. you could just as
well write "that's just the way it is".


I'm tired of this, so let's cut it short: if "evil" is objective, there
ought to be a way to measure it. an objective test that says "evil" or
"not evil". name it.
