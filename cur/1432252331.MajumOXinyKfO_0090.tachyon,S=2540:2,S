Yes. Leahy would fall into that category, actually. Congress enacted
the "morphed" child porn ban in I recall 1996, and the Supreme Ct struck
it down 7-2 as unconstitutional around a year ago. Within days Leahy,
Hatch, and the other usual suspects reintroduced nearly-identical 
legislation:

We've seen the same silliness on campaign finance, on dial-a-porn
restrictions (something like three rounds before the Supremes), and 
on CDA->COPA.
