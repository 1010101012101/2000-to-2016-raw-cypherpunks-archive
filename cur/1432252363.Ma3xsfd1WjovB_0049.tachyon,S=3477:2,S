Subject: Tarzan code

Hi everybody,
So tonight I threw up a tarball of Tarzan's code, after finally updating
it against new releases of its dependencies. It's released under the GPL.
http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/tarzan/

Unlike tor, Tarzan is an IP-layer anonymizing system, so faces different
problems and different complexity. Roger suggested that I announce this
on or-dev.

Unfortunately, I don't plan on continuing developing Tarzan actively
anymore. If anybody else is interested, please drop a line.

Thanks!

would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.'' What empires lavish 
abroad, they cannot spend on good republican government at home: on 
hospitals or roads or schools. A distended military budget only aggravates 
America's continuing failure to keep its egalitarian promise to itself.
