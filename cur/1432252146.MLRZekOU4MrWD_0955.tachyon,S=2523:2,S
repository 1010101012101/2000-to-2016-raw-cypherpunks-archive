What that is is bullshit, plain and simple. The use of nukes to create
canals is just so much wishfull thinking. The impact of even small nukes
on the stability of underground structures is -not- a good effect in -any-
case. The radiation and storage of contaminated materials would far
outweigh any short term savings of cost.

There is one and only one place to use nukes, that is where people don't
or won't live; and that means not on terra. Use of nukes in
extra-terrestrial applications is another entire issue. Unfortunately we
have a technology curve to climb before we'll get there.

No War.

No Killing.

No Nuclear Weapons.
