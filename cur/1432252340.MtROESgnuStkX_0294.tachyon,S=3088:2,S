I may underestimate the cost to the originator but the cost to me for
filtering a dozen or so envelopes and paper flyers per day is nil. 

All your examples are costs to the originator and not to me. I pay for the
pickup of my trash which contains the physical spam. Trivial percentage.
The cost of cutting the tree down, delivery, etc. as detailed in your
examples are costs that are incurred by the sender through the fees they
pay to bring the product together and distribute it.

I'm all for making that expensive. However, charging for email means
everyone pays. Making it so that spammers may only send you one piece of
email makes the cost of doing business theirs and doesn't involve me the
recipient.
