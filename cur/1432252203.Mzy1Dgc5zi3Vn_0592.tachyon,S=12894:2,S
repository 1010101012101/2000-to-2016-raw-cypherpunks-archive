How do you think something like that could be managed?

Bitcoin is only deflationary because the number of people who use it is
growing faster than the number of coins in circulation. But how can you
measure the number of people who are using it, and how can you measure how
much they are using it? (IE are they speculating, are they actually using
it to hide money from their government, are they buying needs like
food+water?).

Any cryptocurrency hoping to 'appreciate by at most 5%' has to have some
reliable metric for measuring it's value in the real world. Otherwise coin
generation algorithms are just a shot in the dark, hoping to mimic the
expected growth of the coin or having some authority that can provide input
about it's real dollar value. And anything that tries to get insider
metrics will need some defence against liars and sybil attacks.
