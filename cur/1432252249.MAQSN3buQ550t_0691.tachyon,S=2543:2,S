http://policeabuse.org/how.html

The PCC uses state-of-the-art technology to investigate
and document acts of misconduct by law enforcement
personnel. For example, we use digital video and
miniature cameras to investigate and analyze incidents
of police misconduct around the country. Using several
PC's we are a capable of processing as many as five
hundred complaints per day. We maintain a video log
of police incidents captured on tape throughout the
country.
