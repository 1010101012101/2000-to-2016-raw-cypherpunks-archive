Hi all,

I've been trying to decide how to weigh in on this thread, I'm sure some of
you are surprised its taken me this long to jump in.

That said, I'll keep this brief, because I'm going to write up more
detailed thoughts on a blog post that I'll share with the list.

The first issue I see is related to this succinct comment from Michael:

That's only speculation on my part, of course. But if it's right, it

The number one issue I see here is the culture of what i call "geek rage"
"fear mongering" and "black and white response"

First let me say I think this is *getting better*. However, it stands that
there are *many* privacy/security tools with fairly significant flaws. I'm
writing a security curriculum at the moment for a new mobile reporting app
that SWN is creating. In the process I've begun to see bevy of flaws in
tools that I myself misunderstood previously.

A few of these tools are Truecrypt, TextSecure, OTR clients, and of course
Cryptocat.

I think there is a lack of clarity about "safety" and "security" as well as
numerous other semantic problems with the way security experts, trainers,
and researchers present tools.

Truecrypt's issue with journaling filesystems is a flaw that many of the
members of the list are no doubt aware of. I however was not aware of this
serious issue. The Protektor Services and FrontlineDefenders Digital
Privacy manuals do not cover this issue, yet TrueCrypt is now  considered a
standard tool by most organizations doing training. I recently assisted an
"internet freedom" training on TrueCrypt, yet I was unaware, which means
even if the issue was covered(I am fairly certain it was not) it wasn't
covered well enough that I, a relatively knowledgeable user, picked up on
it.

Cryptocat's web interface as has been clearly described is only as secure
as SSL/TLS and the lack of a keylogger. However, the implication of this
discussion is that a MITM  attack or having my IP address is enough to
identify me. I am sure most of you don't believe this, however that is the
implication of your talk.

The primary issue comes down to the semantics and lack of clarity in
communications.

I think this could be solved by recruiting more people with strong writing
skills and a focus on training methodology, and perhaps starting to host
roundtables and dinners with the technologists in the group. I would love
to have been at dinner with Nadim Jacob et al. I think this could be solved
by creating an open consortium of technology researchers, trainers, and
practitioners.

Last point, I agree we are helped by a diversity of manuals, but a lack of
clear standards is frustrating. Furthermore, I'm certainly not satisfied
with the guides that exist, which is why I am still working on crafting new
manuals, however the curriculum I'm currently producing is essentially an
effort to edit and collate the best elements of the existing manuals. I
hope this will result in a hybrid that still answers a lot of needs, but
does it in a more user-friendly fashion.

Brian
