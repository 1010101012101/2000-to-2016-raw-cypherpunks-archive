Drugs will never be legalized in the United States.  We've been 
focusing on legislators, but the problem is even more basic than 
that: The Mafiosi and the gangsters won't allow it. 

They can't make the kind of profit margins they're accustomed to 
when legal suppliers can produce coke for $6 an ounce or Marijuana 
for $1.50 a 40-pound bale.

So look for major contributions to the campaign funds of drug 
warriors if it ever looks like their cash cow is in danger.

Note:  This assumes that gangsters are not stupid - which is 
definitely *NOT* in evidence, so I could be wrong about this; 
but it is certainly true that life would suck for them if drugs 
were legalized.
