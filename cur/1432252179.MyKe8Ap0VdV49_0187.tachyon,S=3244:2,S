   from the will-u-be-my-friend-lol-j/k dept.
   Iphtashu Fitz writes "CNet News is reporting that the CIA has been
   [1]quietly investing in research programs to automatically monitor
   Internet chat rooms. In a two year agreement with the [2]National
   Science Foundation, CIA officials were involved with the selection of
   recipients for research grants to develop automated chat room
   monitors. Researchers at [3]Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute received
   $157,673 from the CIA and NSF for their proposal of 'a system to be
   deployed in the background of any chat room as a silent listener for
   eavesdropping ... The proposed system could aid the intelligence
   community to discover hidden communities and communication patterns in
   chat rooms without human intervention.' How soon until all IM
   conversations are monitored by [4]Big Brother? The [5]abstract of the
   proposal is available on the NFS website."
