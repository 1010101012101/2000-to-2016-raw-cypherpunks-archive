This important arrest shows how much the anti Osama Bin
Laden device built by US is getting more and more efficient and
almost near the final capture of the terrorist responsible for
attacks of two years ago against the USA embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.  Al-Zawahiri has been arrested in the United
Arab Emirates, which is one of few Arabic countries recognize
and support openly the afghan Talebani, the major supporters of
the terrorist sheik. Moreover, the American line to hit the Islamic
terrorism seems very dense and before to be captured in Dubai
Al-Zawahiri had tried to erase his traces between Pakistan,
Yemen (where the CIA had captured his women last
December), and the United Arab Emirates, instead, they have
been revealed fatal for his capture.
