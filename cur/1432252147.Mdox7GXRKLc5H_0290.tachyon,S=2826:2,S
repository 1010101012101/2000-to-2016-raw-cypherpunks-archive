   And how does this constitute socialism? I guess it depends on the
neighborhood, but there certainly doesn't seem to be any of that sort of thing
here. Most of the gardeners here are Hmong, and I'd imagine that if such started
occuring, people would start doing guard duty. 
   OTOH here, we've had kids torturing animals at the zoo and recently some
decided to hack down a lot of the young trees in the main park. At any rate,
vandalism and theft certainly isn't socialism, unless it's being done by the
government.

   They should come back every year, but they should also learn to inject a
little nicotine or other poison in a few of the veggies for those who steal. An
old farmer taught me a good trick when I had some firewood ripped off. He said
to take a few pieces of firewood and drill a big hole in them, put in a quarter
stick of dynamite with caps attached in each, then seal the hole with woodputty
and rub some dirt on it while still sticky to hide the hole. Leave on outside of
pile where theives will grab it first. Turns those cast iron stoves into
grenades. 8-)
