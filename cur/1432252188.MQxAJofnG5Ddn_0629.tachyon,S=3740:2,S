The nice thing is that you never see those false positives. But for this
list, you'd never seen my message.

Wow, wonder how you managed to attract that. I only get several
hundreds a day (malware is already filtered at MTA level), which
spamassassin catches quantitatively. I'm thinking about starting
blocking .gif/.jpeg/.png by MTA, which would catch the rest of
them. If I ever got fancy I could use greylisting and firewall
throttling of Windows hosts, or similiar shenanigans. But, blocking
by RBL, never.

I get the idea. You could just block the entire IP address space,
which would cut your spam rate down to zero. Ever tried that?

I would call it the "nuclear glass approach" to spam. If this works
for you, great, but I don't know too many people who'd subscribe to your
approach (to which RBL hardcore nazis look like teletubbies).
