The Judge has decided he will not actually start Bell's trial until Tuesday,
4/3 - everyone's testimony will be delayed 1 day - So you will need to be at
the Federal courthouse in Tacoma by Wed, 4/4 at 9:00am, and you should be
done no later than Thursday afternoon

If you want to be reimbursed for your expenses, you will need to make travel
arrangements through the US Attorney's office, Dru Mercer, (206) 553-7970

I asked Robb about the transcript - he says that per Rule 6 we can't give it
to you.  You would need to file a motion with the US District Court, and the
Judge would have to order them released to you.  Robb thinks that Judge
Pechman was the Judge responsible for your grand jury.  You can get more
court info at http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/

Jeff,

Thanks for the information.

Could you find out if I can buy a transcript of my grand jury 
testimony before the trial? Robb London has not answered 
my three inquiries. The court reporters office told me it
can be released only with Robb's approval.

John
