I don't recall the context, but I don't have any such friends or even 
acquaintances. Even those I know on the Far Right don't want to kill 
_all_ Jews, just the pesky freedom-stealing ones, and the millions who 
form the Zionist Occupation Government in the Zionist Entity of 
ZOG-Occupied Palestine.

I personally expect the non-Arabs who live in ZOG-Occupied Palestine to 
eventually be given the choice to escape by hanging off the landing 
skids of the U.S. choppers sent in to evacuate Americans or to be 
disposed of by the millions. No matter their U.S.-funded weaponry, heavy 
artillery and jets just aren't terribly useful in such close quarters 
and with the willingness by many Palestinians to sacrifice themselves. 
Add nerve gases and biological agents to the mix over the next several 
years.

And I won't shed a tear, as those who left New York and Oslo and Berlin 
and Phoenix to go to some tiny patch of land which they claim YHWH the 
Terrible granted to the sons of a desert minor potentate--this all 
revealed in a hash dream by an old man, allegedly--well, they were fools 
in 1948 to kick Arabs off of their farms and out of their homes. The 
Jews will suffer mightily. Which might be all they really want, oy vey!

And I know many people who support, as I do of course, the right of 
Aryan Nation(s) to do their thing without lawsuits from offended Jews 
and liberals. Last I heard, Aryan Nation(s) was not building any gas 
chambers. Shutting down the "organization" due to, for example, the 
murder of Allan Berg in Denver makes no more moral or legal sense than 
shutting down the Catholics because some Catholics have bombed abortion 
clinics.

Confusing the above sentiments with being a Nazi or Neo-Nazi is a common 
mistake, though.

I value the literature I have from "Jews for the Protection of Firearms 
Rights," so not _all_ Jews are necessarily leftist simp-wimps like 
Feinstein, Boxer, Lieberman, and all of the Hollywood Jews who rail 
about how anti-Semitic the Arabs are (yeah, right). Just most of them.

I attribute a lot of the cultural problems with Jews and their respect 
for libertarian values to be caused by millennia of their confinement in 
cramped Jewish ghettoes, their unwillingness to venture far from other 
Jews (thus meaning a minion cannot be formed), and their focus on that 
most highly-legalistic of all religious books, the Torah. Way too many 
good brains went into studying the minutiae of some dusty books written 
by some desert mystics.

The Jews lacked their equivalent of a Reformation, the Lutheran and 
Calvinist revolution in thinking which laid the groundwork for the 
modern age.  And instead of moving on, embracing the future, many of 
them retreated to a desert land they thought of as their historic 
homeland, never mind that more Polish blood flowed through the veins of 
Jews born in Krakow than blood from their ancestors who fled or 
otherwise left Palestine 1500 or more years ago.

By the way, there is much scholarship pointing to King David actually 
being a fairly minor princeling in the Jerusalem area. As the 
pseudonymous authors of the Pentateuch wrote that part of what 
Chrisitians call the Old Testament, much of the lineage was invented out 
of whole cloth and the whole mythology of the line of descendants of 
Abraham (who may or may not have existed, but certainly not in the way 
portrayed) was devised to make the subfaction tracing their lineage to 
"King David" look more important. The authors of the Pentateuch also 
apparently wove in a bunch of Babylonian creation myths they picked up 
during their years as slaves in Babylon. And yet many of them cling to 
the fairy tale that "YHWH  promised us this land. Hence the Arab must be 
driven into the sea.

I don't care too much if Arabs and Jews are killing each other, but I 
hate like hell to see taxpayer money and armaments shipped to 
ZOG-Occupied Palestine to help kill more Arabs and expand ZOG borders. 
And I am offended--but also amused--by the irony of European Jews 
recapitulating Hitler's "lebensraum" and "Endlosung" solutions so soon 
after WW II ended.

Thanks, even if you're a Jew-lover.
