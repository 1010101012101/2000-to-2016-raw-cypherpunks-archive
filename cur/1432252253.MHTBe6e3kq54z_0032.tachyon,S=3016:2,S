Eliminate them completely would be an even simpler solution. Too many
people give elections the proper respect that they deserve. You go and
plan your vacation at voting time too bad you made your choice. The only
ones that have any legitimate excuse for not being in the town that they
are registered to vote is those that are either on military deployment or
in the diplomatic corps. Polling stations can be set up on military bases
and US Embassies to accommodate the majority that fall into those
catagories.
