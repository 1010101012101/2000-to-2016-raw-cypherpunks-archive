Is it possible to set things up so that duplicate messages are 
filtered out based on a message digest rather than a message ID?
I'm dumb as a post and have no clue how message IDs are 
generated in the first place,  but it seems to this simpleton that
any hash function on the message body would be guarenteed to 
catch duplicate messages.
