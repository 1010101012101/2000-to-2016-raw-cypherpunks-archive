"Sorry that I pissed on your orthodoxy by doubting that everything was
inevitable in its strongest form."

Aside from inevitability there's the road taken...it may have been 
inevitable that the Nazi's would fall (aside from fighting a 2-front war),

crypto and other stuff saves the day, but is that before or after they get 
me and my family? (According to my shotgun the answer is 'after'...)
