  Jail For Passport Forgers

  Updated: 07:31, Saturday January 28, 2006

  Two Algerian-born men who ran a sophisticated forgery racket have been
  jailed for two-and-a-half years each.

  The pair churned out hundreds of fake passports, national insurance cards,
  driving licences, identity cards and utility bills for illegal immigrants
  and criminals.

  Noureddine Hadadj, 39, and Rezki Bensayah, 34, used a flat above a cafe in
  Brixton, south London, as the base for their hi-tech operation.


  Hadadj made the papers on computers while Bensayah, a drug addict, took
  orders from customers and sold the documents on.

  Police found 50 counterfeit passports - British, French, Belgian and
  Portuguese - in the flat, in Acre Lane.

  There were 55 French national insurance cards and 1,941 blank national
  insurance cards, Inner London Crown Court heard.

  Detectives discovered 66 UK driving licences and 57 driving licences from
  other European countries.


  The forgers' flat

  There were also more than 20,000 blank credit card-sized documents waiting
  to be made into forgeries.

  The hi-tech factory contained three laptops, two PCs, six printers, two
  scanners, a laminator, four card-printing machines and a card reader.

  There were further documents on computers including 450 UK driving
  licences, seven Spanish passports and parts of 22 other passports.

  Also on computer were two UN cards for use in Kosovo and an immigration and
  naturalisation department Home Office stamp.

  At Hadadj's Brixton flat police found #64,410 in cash in a suitcase.

  Both men admitted four counts of conspiracy to make false instruments.
