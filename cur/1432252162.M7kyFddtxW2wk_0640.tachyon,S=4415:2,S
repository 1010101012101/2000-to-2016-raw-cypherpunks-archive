Simple Access Acquires Intel's Network Systems Unit
By Michelle Tsai
11/12/2002
NEWTON, Mass. -- Simple Access, a developer of security appliances for
broadband access and server-based environments, said it has acquired
Toronto-based Intel Network Systems, a subsidiary of Intel and renamed
itself Shiva. The Network Systems unit was formerly known as Shiva until
its acquisition by Intel in 1999. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Intel Capital will hold an equity stake in the new Shiva. The new Shiva
will integrate the acquired VPN products with its existing broadband,
firewall, and secured socket layer business. Ten engineering and marketing
employees from Intel Network Systems will join the new Shiva in Toronto.
The new Shiva will have 44 employees in total.

The original Shiva, which was formed in 1985, developed remote access and
virtual private networking hardware for the small to medium enterprise
market.

Simple Access, which develops appliances to secure both Internet and
Intranet transactions and communications, formed in 2001 and was backed by
individual investors prior to this deal. David Powers, a spokesperson for
the new Shiva, said that although Simple Access and Intel Network Systems
were not direct competitors, Simple Access was beginning to add VPN
capabilities to some of its products.

The new Shiva is based in Montreal with U.S. headquarters in Newton,
Massachusetts, and sales offices in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.
