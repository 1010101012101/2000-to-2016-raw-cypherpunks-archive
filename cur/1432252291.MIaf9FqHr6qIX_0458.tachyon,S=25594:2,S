Beautiful sentiment, and much of it I'm not prepared to argue with.

First of all, I'm going to place my comments among your message.  This is 
not to present the appearance of a winning arguement, but only for ease of 
keeping track of the points.

News to me, I won't argue.  We've done it before, we're doing it now, we'll 
do it again.

If means of production means property, then consider the following 
concept.  I, joe farmer, have with my own two hands built a tractor.  This 
tractor is now the product of my production, but by it's very nature, it's 
also the means of production.  Who owns it?  Do I benefit by my own 
labor?  Or does society, for the greater good, "liberate" it from me as a 
means of production?  If it's to be "liberated", what's the point of me 
even bothering to go to the trouble of producing a tractor when the next 
ten people, who used thier time wisely to manufacture guns, decides they 
need it more than I do?

I, as joe farmer, have "reclaimed", (inaccurate, as the land was not 
previously claimed for this use, but the terminology seems current), a 
farm, on which I intend to grow grain.  I get the grain up to about knee 
height and just producing a harvestible crop, when Brett Rancher, decides 
to use this common land for graising.  Do I as the person who toiled on the 
land to make it produce get to keep the grain?  Or is it mutual property 
that is fair game to all?  If I'm not going to reap what I sow, what's the 
point of wasting a growing season carrying water, and weeding rows?

Now I'm Joe Farmer Jr.  My father built a tractor, scratched a farm out of 
the wilderness, and defended both against all comers because they were the 
product of his own two hands.  He, wanting to pass on the heritage, 
bequethes, (yes,  I know, the spelling isn't right), this produce to me.  I 
didn't produce it myself, rather I was expected to work it until I reached 
majority, and have over the last 20 years assumed more and more 
responsibility as my father has lost the capacity to continue to work the 
land.  I still went to him for guidance, but it was my own two hands that 
overhauled that old tractor, and without my labor, the farm would have 
reverted to wilderness.  Are these products of my labor, or means to 
production?  If means to production, what reason do I have to do more than 
absolutely necessary to keep the two running until my father passes 
away?  Since I'm going to lose control of both at that time.

Now I'm Joe Gentleman Farmer 3rd.  I have built on the work of my father 
and his father, and now find that to adequately work with what I have 
requires more than my two hands, or those of my children and wife, to 
work.  Using some of my surplus produce, I've taken on an additional pair 
of hands to facilitate the work.  He's not worked this land since 
birth.  He hasn't, nor have his ancestors, toiled to make the tractor or 
farm feed the family.  Does he deserve an equal share to the output?  I've 
invested 40 years of my life.  My father invested 60+ of his, and his 
father 60+ of his, all with the assumption that this produce would stay in 
the family.  This worker has yet to invest one hour.  Does this make me a 
capitolist?


>*- For a society to be anarchistic, would all people have to have political
>    power? YES.

If people have unfettered political power, what is to prevent the mob from 
turning on the most productive to cough up their hard-earned gains for the 
"less fortunate"?  Perhaps the less fortunate, who since all wages are 
equal anyway for all producers, since there is often no real way of guaging 
who did more, particulary when more than one stage of production exists, 
decided to underrepresent their talents so that they could get off lighter?
When the many lead the few, you have the makings for a tyranny.  When the 
few lead the many, you have the makings for a tyranny.  If there is any 
chance of one man being more diligent than another, then one man will 
become more prosperous than another in the first generation.  In the second 
generation, I'll grant you, the less prosperous man's son may be more 
diligent, but starting from a weaker position.

Except by taking that produced by anothers labor, but inadequately 
defended.  Granted, that happens anyway.  Only the methods of defense shift 
from most deadly and determined, to most litigous, (my apologies to the 
lawyers of this list, my spelling was never my strong suit,) and 
determined, both modified by resources at ones disposal to make good on 
threats.  (Ammunition, friendly laws.)

If natural law does not exist, why does my dog urinate on my tire?  Are you 
saying we are much evolved from beasts?  I'd like to think so, but I find 
my own natural impulses too closely mirror those of "animals".  Including 
the desires to breed, attract a good mate, (through demonstration of my 
ability to support her), keep others of my kind at arms reach, etc.

So, if I were a master craftsman of looms, but had about the textile 
manufacture talent of a rock, I would not be allowed to maintain my looms 
and live by their produce?  Are you suggesting price protection for 
labor?  Or that I be forced to sell my looms.  Doesn't sound like I'm very 
free if I'm forced to liquidate that that I produced.

Are you saying that in a non-propertarian society, that I could simply 
choose not to work and still benefit the same as everyone else?  Sounds 
good to me, sign me up.  Of course, if there are too many of us, how are 
you going to feed us all and yourself too?  If we're going to be forced to 
work, you're now talking about limiting freedom.  How are you to guage that 
I'm doing my fair share?  Perhaps I'm an economist, who's labors don't 
translate well on paper but still are key to the functioning of society as 
a whole.  OR, perhaps I'm a valued leader of men, who can organize to 
better effeciency the labor of others.  But, if I'm a manager, who can coax 
10% extra result from the same effort of those who follow me, does that 
mean that I should have that 10%, or a fixed share of it, as my 
contribution?  Sounds like a manager, or a boss, to me.

I won't argue that there are abuses.  Any system will have 
abuses.  Capitalism has the abuse that those who have inherited the produce 
of thier forefathers, but none of their drive, will still flourish.  While 
those who have not the gains of their ancestors, but the determination that 
the former lack, will not see all, or even most, of their value.

The problem is, in a socialist system, the man without any skills or the 
desire to gain, or use, them, can be just as abusive.  There are, in my 
opinion, far more lazy persons then there ever could be wealthy 
persons.  And far more lazy persons in general, than there could ever be 
lazy wealthy persons.

I seem to remember that "Utopia" literally meant "doesn't exist".

I'd say a capitalist is one who strives to gain more than he had, by 
trading in a market, and in the process produce more, and better methods of 
production, since with better methods of production, more can be produced 
with the same effort.

I'd hate to have to hoe a row by hand.  Tractors are much more efficient.

Can you honestly see any type of industrial revolution occuring from common 
labor?  If I gain status by developing steam power, then I've just been 
elevated to a new class.  If I gain profit from the licenses, same deal.

This really is unfair, since the original author isn't on the list to 
refute.  But I'm sure he, (or she), will find a worthy champion.

Good luck,
