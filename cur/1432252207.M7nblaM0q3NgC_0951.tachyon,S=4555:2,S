[Augusto] Well... how many people don't understand SSL and still use it for
home banking?

[Augusto] Code signing might be an option, but (a) who is going to sign the
code (governement, parties, independent organizations, all of them), and (b)
how is this code signature *securely* verified?

[Augusto] One can still maintain public sites for casting votes, using the
same "MyVote" system and identifying themselves with smartcards.

[Augusto] Same as above [SSL].

[Augusto] I would like to see this happening after the scientific/academic
community approves a secure protocol and its implementation architecture.
And I also understand that it will be quite hard to convince the general
voter of the security of e-voting.
