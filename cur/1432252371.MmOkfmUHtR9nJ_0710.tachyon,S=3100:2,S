So far he's avoided being treated like Mussolini.

While James has been wrong about 90% of this discussion (:-),
I have to agree with him here - while the US was clearly propagandizing
that they had him in their absolute control, they were also
initially treating him in a quasi-civilized manner.
The dude's been hiding in a hole in the ground,
so checking him for lice is reasonable treatment.
(I'm puzzled by the comment about the shave, though -
all the "fair and balanced" news coverage still shows him with the beard....)

On the other hand, various spokescritters keep saying
that they're going to stop treating him in a civilized manner,
and that while they're not quite going to torture him,
they're going to put him in a high-stress sleep-deprivation environment.
I'm not sure if they're going more for the Vietnamese tiger cage model,
or the Israeli army Palestinian Detainee model, or the
Soviet purged general model, but it's No More Mr. Civilized
until he confesses his crimes against the society.

In general, between the times the Nazi war criminals were captured
and the times they got tried and hanged or shot, the US mostly
treated most of them in a civilized manner, except during the active
parts of the war where sometimes they wanted operational information.
Apparently not the case here.
