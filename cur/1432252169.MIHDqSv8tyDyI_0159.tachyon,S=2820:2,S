If you look down a bit, you might notice he's pulling your leg. If
you're not *real* careful, he'll pull it clean off and beat you over
the head with it.

Besides, he's an architect, ferchrissakes. The only disassembly he
knows about is done with stuff like this:

Naw. That was his brother-in-law, or something. The one in Maryland,
someplace.

A venerated man in his profession, John's still an old lefty from way
back. If you squint real hard, maybe you can see him in the crowd
here: <http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/68-dead.html>.

;-)



He ain't no spook. His heart would stop, or something. There are lots
of people who hate the state from the left. John's one of 'em -- if
you can understand what he says. :-)

Cheers,
RAH
