FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AL Digital Acquires Second Nuclear Bunker
Doubles Space Available for Security of Computer Assets

London, UK (1 October 2001)  AL Digital (Telecommunications), Ltd.,
a leading provider of secure computer hosting and owner of The
Bunker, today announced the purchase of a second nuclear bunker from
the Ministry of Defence.  The terms were undisclosed.

This second bunker now known as The Other Bunker will effectively
double the space available for the secure storage and hosting of
Britain's digital economic assets.  Located northeast of London, The
Other Bunker will undergo retrofitting before being deployed as a
computer co-location facility.

The Bunker and The Other Bunker were designed and built during the
Cold War as physically secure communications centres. Both offer the
ultimate in protection from a myriad of attacks including; crackers,
terrorist attack, electro-magnetic pulse, HERF weapons, electronic
eavesdropping and solar flares.

The rate of firms moving into The Bunker has accelerated dramatically
in recent weeks, creating the need for additional secure computing
space in the UK.  

"Increased demand has caused us to move forward our timetable ," said
AL Digital Director Dominic Hawkin. "The Other Bunker needs to be
open for business sooner than we planned."

The Other Bunker is scheduled to have its first client servers
installed by mid-2002.  The storage capacity of the The Bunker will
be able to absorb the needs of the market until that time. ENDS
About The Bunker and The Other Bunker
The Bunker is redefining the market for secure hosting. The facility
provides the physically secure environment needed to protect
digitally secure data.  All the encryption in the world can't stop a
server from being stolen, sabotaged or destroyed: The Bunker does.
