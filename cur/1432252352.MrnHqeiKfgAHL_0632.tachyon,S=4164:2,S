It's a matter of context. In the chip world a tested netlist that can be
turned into Si is "IP" in the sense that it is something a company can
offer as a product.

AES is no different from USB, bluetooth, IEEE-1384, SCSI, 802.11b, MPEG,
PCI cores etc. 

Yes, actual work is involved in turning a public standard into Si.

Yes, people actually pay to include this sort of "IP" in their ASICs
along with CPUs, memory, I/O and whatever else they may need to fuel
their cash flow. 

Various licenses may or may not be part of each piece of "IP" used in an
ASIC. Each has to be addressed before the part is built or your lawyers
can fight it out later in court.

I'm more of a SW than a HW guy but this is pretty much the view I've
gotten of the business.
