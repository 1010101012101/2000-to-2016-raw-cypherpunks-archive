His entire IP block is connected to servers in the United States. I am
very skeptical of that claim. Furthermore, this is nonsense; the issue
isn't being protected against *one* country's subpoena, it's being
protected against *any* subpoena.

The closed-source nature of the software makes pushing
government-mandated backdoors incredibly easy and extremely difficult to
detect if done right. This is a tall claim not backed by evidence or the
possibility of review.

Our secure encryption keeps unauthorized people from understanding your transmissions. It keeps criminals, governments, business rivals, neighbors and identity thieves from stealing your data and from destroying your personal or corporate privacy. There are no back doors, nor will there ever be.

...unless they're served a court order, in which case Silent Circle will
either implement a backdoor or go to jail, thank you very much.

Skype, too, says that its code is available for audit, and then only
lets a single academic audit it via an auditing that they themselves
fund. This is likely PR; I will not be satisfied unless anyone can
audited the code, and the source code is kept updated with every new
release.

This is just really scary -- a piece of closed source, unaudited,
unverifiable software that costs money for corporations, but is free for
activists?
