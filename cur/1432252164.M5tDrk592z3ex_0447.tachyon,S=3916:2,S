Yes, I think all exploits need to be published.  I'm not sure how
soon is soon enough - a month from discovery to publication seems
ok to me.  but that's easy to argue with too.

Hmmm... anyone want to create a futures market for code exploits?

My experience with contracting rates is much better than paid salary.
the difference is that salary jobs are longer term, it's something
a company wants to do for a long time.  Contract jobs are short term.
I think it's true that exploits will always be there to find, and
it definitly in a security company's best interest to have people
continuously looking for problems.  Who they tell and when becomes
an interesting topic in and of itself, but I think it's important
that all security problems be published within a reasonable time.

Patience, persistence, truth,
