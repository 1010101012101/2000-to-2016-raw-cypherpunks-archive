Yep, I heard that he has a multimilllionaire position just in Cisco 
alone. As you said, good for him. (Frankly, anyone who was in the 
working force in the late 50s, early 60s, as Nader was, and who lived 
parsimoniously in a rooming house for all those years had BETTER be a 
multimillionaire!)

As for how he'll draw the line, I'm sure he'll do as other liberals 
do: support confiscatory income taxes. As the Kennedy clan does.

(Of course, the Kennedy clan was careful to have most of its 
bootlegging money from Old Joe placed in trusts and suchlike.)

Many extremely wealthy liberals are all too willing to support wealth 
confiscation. "I'm willing to have half of my $300 million taken for 
a good cause, so let's get going and build a communitarian fair 
society!"
