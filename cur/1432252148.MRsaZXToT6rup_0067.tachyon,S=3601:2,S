I've put together an experimental remailer/PGP interface to a weblog
hosting service.  Creating a blog and posting are entirely one-way 
processes via Mixmaster; there's no need for nyms or reply blocks.


The short version, for those familiar with PGP and mixmaster:

To create a blog, generate a new PGP key.  Set the Name field to 
'invisiblog' and optionally put a name or description in the Comment 
field.  Use mixmaster to send the ascii-exported public key to 
signup@invisiblog.com.  Each new blog will show up at 
http://invisiblog.com/<long_key_id> as soon as its key is received.

To post, clearsign a message and send it to post@invisiblog.com.  The 
fingerprint of the signing key is used to figure out which blog to post 
it to.  

There's no way to delete or modify posts.

If a first attempt at creating a blog or posting fails, resend - it'll 
ignore dupes.

Anonymous weblogs will be linked from here as they are created:
