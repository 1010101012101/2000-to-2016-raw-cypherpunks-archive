The (in)effectiveness of "chaff" has been discussed at length in the Tor 
community, and while it might not be useful to confuse end-to-end traffic 
analysis, what effects would it have on a correlation database like this ?

I'll bet good "chaff" (probably not as easy to generate as you might 
think) has a far higher than 1:10 ratio of expense to generate vs. expense 
to "process".

A windows virus that generates false transactional information, web 
trails, and death threats against the congressional seating chart ?
