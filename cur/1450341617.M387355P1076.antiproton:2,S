Eric Posner, the fourth most-cited law professor in the U.S., says the
government may need to jail you if you even visit an ISIS site after
enough warnings. He says, "Never before in our history have enemies
outside the United States been able to propagate genuinely dangerous
ideas on American territory in such an effective way—and by this I
mean ideas that lead directly to terrorist attacks that kill people.
The novelty of this threat calls for new thinking about limits on
freedom of speech.

The law would provide graduated penalties. After the first violation,
a person would receive a warning letter from the government;
subsequent violations would result in fines or prison sentences. The
idea would be to get out the word that looking at ISIS-related
websites, like looking at websites that display child pornography, is
strictly forbidden" There would be exemptions for Washington-blessed
journalists and others. Whew! Alas, this man isn't Donald Trump — he
is a widely respected University of Chicago faculty member writing in
Slate.

Of course crypto will be labeled a dangerous idea...
Can't publish it, can't have it, can't use it, can't read it, can't think it.
