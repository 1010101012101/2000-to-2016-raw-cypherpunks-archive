IIRC, dentistry in Canada is not socialized.  Not sure about
Britain...

In a recent WHO study, the U.S. was ranked (IIRC) 15th in the world
for healthcare (factoring in quality, availability, etc).  This was
behind many socialized healthcare countries, such as Canada.

It is true that (for a price) faster care is available in the U.S.
I'm not sure about better care, however.

This has to be weighed against the greater availability of care in Canada.

Very true.

I've realized by now that my viewpoint is at best found annoying, and
at worst hated.  It seems that people here view me the same way: at
best annoying, at worst despicable. ;-)

This assumes that wealth will be achieved by everyone.  This is simply
not true.  Look at America.  The rich are getting richer, and the poor
are getting poorer.
