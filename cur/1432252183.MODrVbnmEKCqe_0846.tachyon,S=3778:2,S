German police in Napster child porn probe
                 By: Linda Harrison in New York
                 Posted: 10/01/2001 at 21:14 GMT

                 German police have launched a probe into whether
                 Napster is being used to swap child porn on the Net.

                 The investigation will also delve into other online
                 file-swapping services such as Gnutella and MyNapster,
                 and hopes to determine whether users have stored
illegal
                 material on their computers.

                 "We are conducting inquiries in connection with that,"
a
                 Munich police representative told IDG.net today,
                 although no further details were revealed.

                 Napster, which lets surfers share music MP3 or WMA
                 files through its Web site, threatened to ban users
using
                 the service to trade pornographic images.

                 "Any exchange of image or film files would violate
                 Napster's terms of service," it said in a statement.

                 "Under Napster's terms of service, users are
responsible
                 for complying with all federal and state laws
applicable
                 to shared content. User accounts that violate those
terms
                 will be blocked from the service as soon as Napster
                 learns of such violations."

                 In related news, seven Brits pleaded guilty today to
                 taking part in one of the world's biggest Net porn
rings.
                 The men were among 107 people arrested by police in
                 12 countries suspected of belonging to an Internet
                 paedophile ring. .
