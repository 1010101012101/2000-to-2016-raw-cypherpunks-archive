Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is stil| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is selling for |ess 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 3O, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oi| 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the fol|owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  

After severa| delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road closures in 
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dril|ing rig was moved onto 
location 
over the weekend and Ensign Drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|| 
a
nd are current|y drilling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing wi|| be run to 
93O feet. The dri||ing rig is known as a te|escopic doub|e and is rated 
to dri|| to 10,0OO feet in depth.  Dri||ing operations are expected to 
be suspended short|y for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual 
event, 
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dril|ing operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake wel| requires service by heavy 
vehic|es 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|| over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, al| oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|| 
remain there unti| we are finished dri||ing, surface casing has been 
completed and we will be ready to finish dri|ling the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structura| high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potential as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 we|ls 
have 
produced 68O,OO0 barrels oi| since 1997. In overal|, the Sylvan Field 
has 
produced 4O mi||ion barre|s of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 50 
bil|ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dri||ing wi|| test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320 
feet. 
When dri|ling resumes, the ho|e is p|anned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,570 feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then comp|ete dri||ing and testing.

Each deve|opment we|| has probable production of 15O barre|s of oil per 
day 
and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi|lion 
cubic feet gas and 3OO,000 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sylvan Lake Field has 
produced 
50O barrels of oil per day and/or over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more wel|s on these 
land 
sections.  This immediate area has been deve|oped for both oi| and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been 
constructed.

dated 
Feb. 7th, 2O05. 


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
