WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE

This promises to be dangerous ground for us both, dear reader. See, I used=
=20
to bleed all over the page for a living - and those unfortunates=20
recognizing the byline will know I'm being nothing but literal in my=20
appropriation of that lame clich=E9. Let's just say there's a few hot goth=
=20
psycho-bitchs out there who know the taste of me through more than one=20
precious bodily fluid ...

As a weekly columnist for SCREW magazine and then a monthly rabble-rouser=20
at the SPECTATOR, I turned my life in New York City and San Francisco into=
=20
the gasoline for igniting reams of newsprint into endless bleats, rants and=
=20
manifestos. Scooping and snooping my way into the most interesting - and=20
educational - situations the sexual underworld has to offer earned me a=20
certain amount of notoriety. Many wild and grim parties later, I even=20
imagined myself owning the wisdom of Dante.

Then I moved to L.A., and learned, baby, learned (Porno Inferno).

Four years into this incredible voyage, this nerveless deathmarch, I have=20
overcome that all-too typical smug East Coast native's na=EFve superstition=
=20
that the city of Los Angeles is Soul Death; in all fundamental spiritual=20
matters, indeed Hell on Earth.

No, after 48 months of nothing but forced research into my immediate=20
environment, I have come to my own independent conclusion: Los Angeles is a=
=20
moral, intellectual, and creative black hole, sucking the very life force=20
from any man, plant or animal foolhardy enough to exist on its cursed soil.=
=20
And oh yeah, it's Hell on Earth, as well.

You might say I'm wallowing in the perspective of the blind man yanking on=
=20
the elephant's tail and pronouncing it a snake, what with immersing myself=
=20
in the Valley-based porn video industry. "Of course it stinks when you're=20
squatting in the outhouse, dummy," you might say. "You have to wipe your=20
ass and come out into the living room with the proper folks!"

I ain't buyin' it. Common wisdom out here is that the only difference=20
between the low standards of behavior over there in the "Big Town" (I love=
=20
it - one aspiring Robert Evans doing time peddling DVD mastering services=20
to the porn hoi polloi actually called it that in front of me) and the=20
tawdriness of the porn industry is this:

Where in Hollywood the Sharks That Be will gladly sell your mother, their=20
mother, anybody's mother to a drug-crazed cannibalistic white-slavery cult=
=20
for the sake of "earning" many hundred-thousands and even millions of=20
dollars, their counterparts in the porn industry will commit the same deed=
=20
for the sake of, oh, a hundred bucks. We're a heinous lot, people, and it=20
can't be whitewashed.

The PBS series "Frontline," in their latest breathless "expose" on the porn=
=20
industry, doggedly skimmed the surface of our distastefulness, preferring=20
the eye-rolling melodrama of the Spanky and Our Gang Play Manson Family=20
antics of one flash-in-the-pan company that specializes in cartoonishly=20
marketing childish shock antics to the less obvious but far more pressing=20
issues dealt with every day by performers, shooters, graphic artists,=20
warehouse workers, etc ... Hey, Frontline, how about a little=20
data-gathering on the Redwood Forest of bad paper that gets passed to=20
hard-working Jacks and Jills who are nearly always already working under=20
the radar of state and federal fair employment laws? Or the flagrant=20
subculture of bootlegging and "backdooring" that pops up like acne on a Max=
=20
Hardcore starlet's face?

Believe me, as a former daily newspaper reporter, I know the answer. Not=20
"sexy" enough. That's actually the trade lingo, you know, for determining a=
=20
topic's commercial news value. Kind of puts the hypocrisy of the corporate=
=20
information industry's stance on our little "Playpen of the Damned" in=20
proper perspective, doesn't it?

Of course, I'm still a long way from being a defender of this industry.=20
Having been exploited and humiliated by the same bottom feeders as many=20
other na=EFve wannabes, and then having been exploited at arm's length by=
 the=20
ostensibly respectable big boys of corporate porn (but hey, at least their=
=20
checks usually clear!), I find myself these days almost exactly where I=20
began during my early days shooting art-fetish porn in San Francisco -=20
doing it myself, the lowly smut equivalent of a struggling independent=20
filmmaker with Something to Say that frightens the horses, as well as the=20
limited imaginations of the Bean-Counting Porn Republicans.

Having made the transition from critic to director, I'm here to sell you=20
the manifesto of a New Wave in porn, akin to the quantum leap made by=20
Truffaut and Godard the day Jean Seberg went before their cameras in her=20
pixie-cut and striped boatneck, hawking American newspapers and a romantic=
=20
state of perpetual political, personal and sexual rebellion. This is the=20
female muse I seek to have stripped bare by her grooms, even. Not your=20
machine-made victim of a post-corporate sexuality, as defined my former San=
=20
Francisco roommate, artist Rev. Steven Johnson Leyba in his amazing new=20
book, COYOTE SATAN AMERIKA (Last Gasp Press):

"False advertising has abstracted sexuality into some distorted commodity=20
to sell commodities. The sex drive is one of the strongest instincts, but=20
the proprietors of government want us to be frustrated by the sex we can't=
=20
have. Sexual unattainability helps keep the world economic machine going as=
=20
we attempt to buy what we are told is a better way, life, style, etc. ...=20
Pornography is constantly monitored and policed, not out of moral concerns=
=20
but out of economic concerns ... All sexual images in the media are only=20
used for economic strategies ... Sex and its image are policed to maintain=
=20
an apolitical use. Any depiction outside of fucking seems to be a societal=
=20
threat."

Whether the honesty is casual or profound, the only difficult thing I=20
demand of my performers is the truth of their sexuality and the spirit=20
behind it, whether for documentary purposes or to portray a character=20
which, if I have my way, is usually scripted to reflect the performer=20
portraying it. I don't need a cadre of bored "professionals" in front of my=
=20
camera or at my back, milling about as part of an overpaid mercenary army=20
of crew serving mostly to bolster some faux auteur's notions that he is=20
indeed the General Domo of his own banana republic: there's no room for=20
journeymen, snake-oil salesmen or bored traffic cops on this adventure.

Hey, believe me. I made the half-hearted attempt to sell out, for the sake=
=20
of a comfortable niche, and a regular salary. In my last curtsey to=20
corporate porn, I offered around a project earlier this year that is=20
inarguably the best porn feature I've ever thought up. Which, considering I=
=20
wrote the screenplays for 2001's three most-nominated corporate porn=20
features, might make the na=EFve think I'd be knee-deep in Cuban cigars and=
=20
Tokyo whores right now, finally preparing to shoot something with a decent=
=20
amount of sheckels in the kitty.

But: Nah. This is the Porn game, fools, where anybody who thinks beyond the=
=20
self-imposed box is immediately considered a threat to Life As We Know It.=
=20
If they can't suck you in and housebreak you, they ostracize you - while=20
reassuring you to Keep In Touch, especially if you have any new ideas to=20
appropriate - ah, be pitched, that is ...

But that's okay. Revolutions are born out of disenfranchisement and=20
repression, and so comes Serious Mirror Productions, not a belching factory=
=20
of anonymously splattered revolving flesh, but a craftsman's workshop,=20
where porn can be addressed as the true funhouse reflection of our society=
=20
and souls that it is, whether in the sweat spots tumbling delicately off a=
=20
slut's ass to explode against the floor, or the hypnotic, throat-gulping=20
snake-dance of a deep-throat queen swallowing "sin"that tastes like life=20
and perhaps anchovy paste, and offering some otherwise unenlightened mook=20
back the blind, infinite joy of orgasm.

Funny, how when I first began shooting hardcore here in the valley, my=20
Fagin-esque mentor admonished me against decorating my set with so many=20
mirrors, since it slowed down the conveyor-belt pace of factory porn. I=20
think maybe he was also afraid to pass in front of one, and reveal to those=
=20
of us he was exploiting his own lack of any visible reflection.

Even funnier, when earlier this winter I discovered a novel by Ryu=20
Murakami, the Tokyo author and filmmaker whose film TOKYO DECADENCE first=20
convinced me a decade ago that the serious metaphysical issues ruling my=20
own life could be addressed in erotically engaging, sexually explicit art.=
=20
Visiting Suzi Suzuki, the first professional porn star I ever shot, and her=
=20
husband in San Francisco for New Year's, I discovered that another recent=20
movie that changed my life was based on a Murakami novel, AUDITION

(Directed not by Murakami but energetic pulp director Takashi Miike,=20
AUDITION is a delightfully droll, disturbingly hilarious black comedy I=20
recommend to anybody truly interested in the unsolveably brutal nature of=20
art, exploitation and desire; skirt-chasing directors suffering from=20
martyr's complexes are particularly advised to watch and learn.)

Suzi gifted me with an extra copy of the author's notorious-in-Japan first=
=20
novel, ALMOST TRANSPARENT BLUE. Riding a Greyhound back down into Porno=20
Inferno, I was so bemused and energized to read the narrator's grandest=20
vision while sitting in the back of Burger King on the rest stop that I was=
=20
almost stranded when I didn't hear the driver's all-aboard call:

"So I'd like to see a movie that cut out a little bit of the palace or the=
=20
city in my head, like cutting up a cow, I think it really could be done.

"I think it would be a movie like an enormous mirror, a huge mirror,=20
reflecting everyone who saw it, I'd really like to see that movie, if there=
=20
was a movie like that I'd see it for sure."

So then, the gravity of serendipity has offered a final stamp of approval=20
on this glorious pipedream. It's Serious Mirror time, ya'll. Don't look if=
=20
there's something in you that you can't stand to see. This is nothing less=
=20
than a true outlaw porn manifesto we're constructing, with the aide of=20
collaborators you'll meet in future dispatches. Our work - never "our=20
product" - is based neither on shock tactics and thoughtless brutality, nor=
=20
psuedo-sophisticated marketing techniques. There's no room left for that=20
sort of shit even in porn, now that as a race we have all actually entered=
=20
into what could be the final struggle against the multinational corporate=20
Illuminati (For real, chumps!).

In the chaos of sex and art the potential for revolution can never be=20
extinguished, try and repress it as censors will, try and ignore it as=20
greedy hacks might. The brutal, intimate truth of sex denies the lies we=20
build fascist societies on, renounces the hypocritical values of an=20
extinction-driven culture. It's the first peep of defiance and the last act=
=20
of individualism. It's our damnation and/or our salvation, depending on=20
which way we steer.
