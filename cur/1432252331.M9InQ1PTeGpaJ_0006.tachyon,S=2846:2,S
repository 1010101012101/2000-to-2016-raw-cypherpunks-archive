Not if New York City leaders get their way: high rents,
pestilence, repulsive jobs, diseased bodies, will continue
as intended for the Apple like other great cities of the 
world, with increased lies about their magnificence. 
Which they are for a few world class bloodsuckers 
who visit the scenes of their poisonous crimes now 
and then, bedhop ghouls at $30M pied a terres, spread 
their pox among the financial, legal and house help. 
Few of the titans rushing to rebuild New York live there 
full time, wise ones they are to remain missing.
