It's easy to look at history in this way, seeing some people as 
villians and other as victims.  But do remember that St Patrick 
wasn't Irish at all.  He was an English boy, stolen by Irish pirates
and sold into slavery in Ireland.  And for centuries English kings
used Irish mercenaries to subdue their unruly subjects.

But this is mostly just laziness.  When Patrick didn't do what he
was told, I'm sure that his masters made no effort to learn his
language.  They just shouted at him louder in Gaelic.
