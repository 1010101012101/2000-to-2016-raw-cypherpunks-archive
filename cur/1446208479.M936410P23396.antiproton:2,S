I have to agree with Juan, and this is a 'fundamental' for me -
Fabianism, Gradualism, Fascism etc, from Stalin to Pol Pot to Syria's
al-Abad - and plenty of us Westernites, so "schooled" in "the greater
good":

"coercion for the better is really not that bad" is just another way
to say "the ends justifies the means", or it's younger sibling "I was
just doing my job."

And this fundamental evil pervades most of the world today.

As Juan keeps reminding us over and over again.

"if we just coerce people a little, not too much now, for their own
interests, then things will get better"

"if we just kill enough bad people, we'll be left with mostly good
people, and the world will be a better place"

Whether a little, or a lot, coercion ends in the cult of the state
imposing death upon the people (that's us by the way). History shows
us this over and again. The recent blog post summary of the post-1944
escapades in Syria is a classic case in point.

Pol Pot revisited, "Nazi-style experiments" and all:

You can hear it:
" I know how to get to Utopia - just coerce a little, apply a little
force, restrain a few, torture but rarely, kill only when needed.  I
shall wield the force of coercion to get us there, to Utopia [I was
going to say "coercion in all its despotic forms" but all forms of
coercion -are- despotic so that would either be seen correctly as a
tautology, or incorrectly as a subset of the types of coercion].  Give
me the power to wield the force and I shall apply it to the
non-believers who would stop us from getting quickly to Utopia.  So,
quickly must we eradicate the forces opposing Utopia!  Do you believe?
 Only the superior believe.  Only the superior can make it to Utopia,
can be Utopia.  We must eradicate all the inferior.  Produce your
papers please! "

The road to hell IS paved with good intentions. The ends DO NOT
justify the means. Leave others, that is, everyone but yourself, leave
us the fuck alone!

Seems we are inexorably entering ... Juan's world.
