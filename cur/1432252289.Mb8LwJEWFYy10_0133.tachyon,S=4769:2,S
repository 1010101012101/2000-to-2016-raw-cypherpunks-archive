Tom Vogt pointed out in a follow-up email that 'CORE' should be 
replaced with 'InterNIC'.  CORE as the registrar actually still had
the name listed.

Nevertheless, what has happened here demonstrates a basic flaw at the
heart of the domain name system.  ICANN and many essential Internet
resources remain subject to US jurisdiction.  ICANN itself is just a
California corporation, so it is subject to the passing whims of the
California legislature as well as those of Congress, the executive
branches, and various and sundry US state and federal courts.  

Some argue that ICANN should itself have authority over all of the
Internet domain name system and the IP address space and in fact 
things are creeping in this direction.  Given the now-crucial role 
that the Internet plays in the global economy, ICANN's hegemony 
gives, for example, representatives of small towns in California sitting
on the right committee in Sacramento remarkable and truly unique power
over the rest of the planet.
