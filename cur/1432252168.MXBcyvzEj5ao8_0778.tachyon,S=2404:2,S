Clearly this can't be true or every health insurance company would be going
out of business.  Coverage has to be more expensive than care of they
wouldn't be in the business of providing coverage.
-- end quote --

You've missed the essential gamble of insurance: care given to an individual 
insured party is usually more expensive than the premiums paid by that 
individual.  The gamble is that the aggregate premium collected from all the 
insured in the pool will exceed the aggregate cost of care for those in the pool 
that collect benefits.  That the insurance business is profitable proves the 
gamble usually pays off.
