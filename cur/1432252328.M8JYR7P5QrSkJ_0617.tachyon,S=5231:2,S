I believe I mentioned geographic routing (which is actually switching, and
not routing) so your packets get delivered, as the crow flies. The
question of name services. How often do you actually use a domain name as
an end user? Not very often. People typically use a search engine. It
doesn't matter how the URI looks like, as long as it can be clicked on, or
is short enough to be cut and pasted, or written down on a piece of paper
and entered manually, in a pinch.

So you need (distributed) searching and document (not machine) address 
spaces, which current P2P suites create the architecture for.

> NAT solution - no way to address an interior node on the cloud from the

It depends on how large the network is. Wireless is potentially a much
bigger node cloud, so the current Internet could became a 'proprietary
niche' eventually.  However, there is no reason why the nodes wouldn't
have a second address, or the IPv6 address would double as a geographic
coordinate. At least during the migration.

Fear not.

You obviously understand under naming service something other than DNS.

Anything which relies on global routing tables and their refresh will 
always has an issue. Which is why geographical local-knowledge routing 
will dominate global networks.

It is a patch, not a solution. But wireless ad hoc meshes are really a 
first real reason to go IPv6.

The best solution would seem to leave the multilingual node the choice of
means of delivery. It would be completely transparent to the packet.
