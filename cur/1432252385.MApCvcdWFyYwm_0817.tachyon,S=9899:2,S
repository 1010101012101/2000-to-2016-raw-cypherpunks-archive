In this post at least the guy does not qualify what he means by 
"information". Indeed, his focus on P2P architectures would imply that he's 
largely unaware of May's Crypto Anarchy manifesto, wherein the term 
"Blacknet" was defined to include information (as this guy seems to 
understand it) as a mere subset. A blacknet allows for completely anonymous 
transactions of any form, including monetary.

This knucklehead seems to want to define "black" and "dark" in terms of some 
perceived scale of illegality, whereas even in Microsoft's case the term 
"darknet" was not developed for that purpose.* A "darknet" may include the 
possibility of no anomymity between pairs or groups of transactors, though 
the identities (as well as the transactions) are effecitvely "black" to the 
outside world. The term "darknet" is therefore often equated with P2P/F2F 
architectures, but those are obviously only one set of instantiations of a 
"darknet".

-TD

*: Am I wrong in assuming that Microsoft's own usage of the term "darknet" 
derives largely from the term "blacknet" which may had coined?
