hi,



suppose a cryptanalysis only has encrypted data-how is
going 2 know which is the encrytion algorithm used 2
encrypt the data ,so that he can effeciently
cryptanalyse if

1:>he has large amount of cipher text only
2:>has large amount of plain text and corresponding
cipher text.

There r so many encryption algorithms,how does he know
which algorithm was used?

Regards Data.
