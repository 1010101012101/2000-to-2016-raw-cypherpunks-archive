How boring. The DNA confirmation was reported on all of the puppet news 
organizations here.

The Germans and Eastern Europeans, being mostly opposed to the war, 
probably just buried the confirmation.

The Czech Republic supported the war, and sent troops, and now that 
Saddam has been captured, both of them will be returning home, with 
medals.
