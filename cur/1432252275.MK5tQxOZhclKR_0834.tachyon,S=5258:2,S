Fireworks in Vancouver.Someone died at one of these potlatch events once.A 
long time ago in a galaxy far,far away...The context of the current class 
war in British Columbia includes -
- An attempt by B.C. Government Employeees Union (B.C.G.E.U.) members to 
charge into a hotel on January 23rd, 2002, where Premier Gordon Campbell 
was set to speak.
- Illegal wildcat strikes in late January by the B.C. Teachers Federation 
(B.C.T.F.) and the B.C.G.E.U.
- A tent-city occupation by street youth and students on the front lawn of 
the provincial legislature building in Victoria in February which ended 
with it's dismantling by riot police
- The fire-bombing of Premier Gordon Campbell's office on the night of 
February 21st.
- A B.C Federation of Labour rally at the legislature in Victoria by more 
than 20,000 people, at which a group of about 10 anarchists intervened by 
attacking a security barrier and throwing rocks at the legislature building.
- An anti-poverty Snake March in Victoria on March 25th that went through a 
mall and several corporate stores, leaving splatters from paint-bombs and 
graffitti behind.
- An anti-poverty march to one of Premier Gordon Campbell's homes in 
Vancouver on April 1st.
- An all-womyn anti-poverty brigade's occupation of a "Member of the 
Legislative Assembly" office in Victoria on April 25th that was broken up 
by riot police who pepper-sprayed several demonstrators.
- A May Day demonstration in Vancouver against the 6-dollar training wage 
that included a half-hour blockade of a McDonalds restaurant (one of the 
businesses using the training wage, and a major contributor to the 
Liberal's election campaign.). After the end of the demonstration a masked 
group charged through a downtown mall and carried out small acts of 
vandalism and sabotage.
- A July 14th demonstration at the opening of a gallery show at the 
Vancouver Art Gallery at which the Premier was scheduled to speak at, but 
failed to show his face in public - because of "security concerns" caused 
by hundreds of angry demonstrators who attempted to dismantle a security 
fence, spat on police officers, and were then pepper-sprayed.
