hi,

http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm
For t = 0 to 79 do 
TEMP = (A)<<5 + f(B,C,D) + E + Wt + Kt; 
E = D; D = C; C = B<<30; B = A; A = TEMP; 

Thats what I meant by the compression function. I am
not trying to increase the input entropy.

I was looking for such a compression function such
that the chances of collision in the message digest
obtained by hashing these 2^80 messages is collision
free or very low probability of collision or in other
words I dont want the birthday attack to work on it.

If i hash 2^80 messages they should be equidistibuted
in such a manner that it does not affect the security
of the algorithm.

thank you.
