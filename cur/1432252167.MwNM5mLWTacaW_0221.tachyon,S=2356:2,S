You're missing the big picture: A light-skinned person with dark hair, a
camera, a white van and an oil refinery, all in Shrub's home state.

Viper!  Getteth thee back to the deserts of the middle east where you

The DHS has done a lot to make me ashamed of being an American.  I can't
believe how stupid my new guardians are.

It was probably some photo-journalist working on an expose of Shrub's
