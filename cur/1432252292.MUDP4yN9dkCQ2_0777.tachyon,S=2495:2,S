Our Maple Leafs' hockey team might look similarly if
it weren't for the lockout.  As it is, all of our
players are well-fed and well-rested (if a little
restless, ha ha ha).  I imagine they have no trouble
whatsoever convincing airport security of their
benignity when they flit about on their vactions.

We might as well face it.  Whether one is designated
as  resembling a terrorist or not, according to
security screeners, is really a matter of random
happenstance in many cases.  Did you purchase a 12ga
Remington Defender  sometime in the last twenty years?
 No?  Well then please step onboard.  Yes?  Oh, well
you're going to have to wait while we send your thong
to the lab for analysis, Mr. Alleged, just to check
for accelerant or explosives residue.

Net result?  Just one more obstacle on the highway of
life.  Ho hum.


Regards,

Steve
