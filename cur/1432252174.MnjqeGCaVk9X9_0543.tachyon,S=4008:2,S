If only there was some technology that would let you post, and say
whatever you wanted... something that cypherpunks might have invented...
something that would provide you a shield so that even unpopular speech
can be presented with little fear of retribution.

If only.  Well, maybe someday.

According to http://www.msnbc.com/news/602062.asp: "Between 1990 and
2000, the rate of Americans who were imprisoned skyrocketed -- from 1
in every 218 Americans to 1 in every 142. That translated to over 1,500
additional inmates each week. Over 3 percent of the U.S. population was
in the corrections system."  Most of these are black, so if you're white
you're not affected so much.

And who is the one posting under his own name?
