Oh, well if andy yauch knows that the only way to stop violence is to "ban
guns", well shit, what are we waiting for!
Because when guns are banned, only the government (and criminals) will have
guns, sounds like the kind of country I want to live in...no wait, thats the
kind of country stalin wants to live in, oops my bad.
