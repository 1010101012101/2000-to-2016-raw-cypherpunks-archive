     Cryptol is a domain specific language for the design,
     implementation and verification of cryptographic algorithms,
     developed over the past decade by Galois for the United States
     National Security Agency. It has been used successfully in a
     number of projects, and is also in use at Rockwell Collins, Inc.

     Domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow subject-matter experts to
     design solutions in using familiar concepts and
     constructs. Cryptol, as a DSL, allows domain experts in
     cryptography to design and implement cryptographic algorithms
     with a high degree of assurance in the correctness of their
     design, and at the same time, producing a high performance
     implementation of their algorithms.
