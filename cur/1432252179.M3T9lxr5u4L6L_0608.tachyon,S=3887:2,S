I never said there weren't rules. Anarchy means no central authority, no
'arch'. The distinction you gloss is that the rules and protocols are
TOTALLY VOLUNTARY. The decision to comply is left at the discretion of the
individual. Some do, some don't.

Just another example of 'freedom for me but not for thee'. You feel it's
ok to shun, but not ok to be shuned. What a hypocrite.

In ANY sort of anarchy the act of shunning must be for something more than
simply refusing to go along.
