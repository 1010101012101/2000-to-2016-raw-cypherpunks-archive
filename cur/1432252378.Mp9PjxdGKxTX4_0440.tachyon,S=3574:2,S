proof implies 100% security. eh? we all know that that's a unicorn.

fantastic. just 2 days ago i hacked an AMM together using pbp.
https://www.ctrlc.hu/~stef/amm.py - proper release coming soon. should be
hosted on an .onion address.

we are off-list in fruitful contact.

pbp is still kinda experimental. but the more users and the more feedback on
key-formats and related stuff gets us faster to stability.

nb: your pgp key is kinda huge due to the embedded jpg of yours, which is
kinda contra-productive, it does not allow visual recognition, but leaks
side-chan information that could be used against you.
