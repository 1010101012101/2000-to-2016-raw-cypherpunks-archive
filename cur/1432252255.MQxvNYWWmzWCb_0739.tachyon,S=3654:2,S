Nothing will prevent one in theory from manufacturing, trafficking, or
possessing unapproved electronic devices. Just as nothing is presently
preventing you from realizing fantastic margins by loading up your truck
with bags of cocaine before crossing the border. What will limit the
possession and distribution of non-MPAA approved consumer electronic
devices in the future to a threshold compatible with the MPAA's revenue
goals will be the mandatory 5-10 year minimum sentences those found in
possession of such devices will face. Are you willing to do that time?
Or would you rather pay the members of the MPAA some $20 or 30 per month
subscription fee that's being enforced by your approved device? No,
continuing to watch your old video tapes on your old VCR is not an
option after the upgrade and registration deadline for these
infringement devices has passed.
