Attention Business Editors:

Certicom Sells Licensing Rights to NSA
MISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 24 /CNW/ - Certicom Corp. (TSX: CIC), a leading
provider of wireless security solutions, today announced that the National
Security Agency (NSA) in Maryland has purchased extensive licensing rights to
Certicom's MQV-based Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) intellectual property.
ECC is becoming a crucial technology for protecting national security
information.
    This agreement will give the NSA a nonexclusive, worldwide license with
the right to grant sublicenses of MQV-based ECC covered by many of Certicom's
US patents and applications and corresponding foreign rights in a limited
field of use. The field of use is restricted to implementations of ECC that
are over GF(p), where p is a prime greater than 2(256). Outside the field of
use, Certicom will retain all rights to the technology for other industries
that require the same levels of security, including state and local government
agencies. Certicom will continue its policy of making its intellectual
property available to implementers of ECC under normal commercial terms on a
non discriminatory basis.
    Researchers have been studying ECC for almost 20 years as the next
generation of public-key technology. ECC is a computationally efficient form
of cryptography that offers equivalent security to other competing
technologies but with much smaller key sizes. This results in faster
computations, lower power consumption, as well as memory and bandwidth
savings.
    "Certicom is a pioneer in researching and developing ECC," says Scott
Vanstone, founder and executive vice-president, strategic technology at
Certicom. "Over 15 years ago, Certicom was founded to research and develop the
strongest security possible. This makes us ideally positioned to provide
manufacturers, that build government communications equipment and
applications, with the tools they need to deliver ECC-based security solutions
to the government market. Certicom is committed to work with the commercial
sector in making our intellectual property and technology available to the
security industry at large."
    In 1997, Certicom developed the industry's first toolkit to include ECC
which has since been adopted by over 300 organizations. Security Builder
Crypto, a cross-platform cryptographic toolkit, includes standards-based ECC
implementations that are optimized for size and performance on over 30
platforms.
    "Certicom is committed to providing technology that meets the U.S.
Government's highest standards to secure and protect its most sensitive
information," said Ian McKinnon, president and CEO of Certicom. "With NSA's
decision to purchase a license from Certicom for MQV-based ECC, Certicom is
well-positioned to drive the adoption of our technologies and intellectual
property in new markets that need strong security. This contract, valued at
US$25 million, has been facilitated through the CCC (Canadian Commercial
Corporation), Canada's export contracting agency."
    Companies and Government Departments or Agencies wishing to develop
security products implementing ECC to protect national security related
systems and/or information or other mission critical information related to
national security under this licensing agreement should submit the details of
their requirements to the Director, National Security Agency (Attn: IA
Directorate, V1). NSA will employ established development programs (e.g. NSA
sponsored developments, the Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP), or
User Partnership Programs) to develop and certify ECC for these requirements.
