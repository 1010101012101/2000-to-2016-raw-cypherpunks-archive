I think this is what it boils down to.  If I want a dongle for
an arbitrary suite of products I should be able to go to some
store and buy it.  There's no reason it has to be built into
the motherboard.  the Microsoft X-box can have a built in dongle
chip, it's purpose is to ensure that only MS certified games
run on the box.  I don't see any problem with that.  And I don't
see any problem with Hollywood (or Bollywood either) selling HDTV's
with their own dongles.

As an argument to congress we need to stress that TCP's are fine
as isolated devices for specific purposes.  There is *NO NEED* to
make general purpose computers TCP's.  Where there is a market for
TCP's, I'd expect companies to want the ability to put their own
keys into the dongle, not some outside manufacturer who they might
not trust.

TCP's and DRM is useful to some people, and those people should
be able to buy it.  But there's really no need to force it on
everyone, and that's the point we need to get congress to
understand.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
