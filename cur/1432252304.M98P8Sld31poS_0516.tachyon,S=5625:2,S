As with all firearms laws, things vary widely from state to state (so 
much for the Second Amendment applying uniformly...it's as if the First 
Amendment varied from state to state...this will happen in the  near 
future, I predict).

In Massachussetts, for example, stun guns are illegal (according to a 
Web site on MA gun laws I found by typing "firearms "stun guns" " into 
Google.

In California, they are legal, with some restrictions:

http://caag.state.ca.us/firearms/dwcl/12650.htm

"ARTICLE 7. STUN GUNS
12650. "Stun gun" as used in this chapter shall include any item, except 
a taser, used or intended to be used as either an offensive or defensive 
weapon capable of temporarily immobilizing a person by the infliction of 
an electrical charge.
12651. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person may 
purchase, possess, or use a stun gun, subject to the following 
requirements:
(a) No person convicted of a felony or any crime involving an assault 
under the laws of the United States, of the State of California, or any 
other state, government, or country or convicted of misuse of a stun gun 
under Section 244.5, shall purchase, possess, or use stun guns.
(b) No person who is addicted to any narcotic drug shall purchase, 
possess, or use a stun gun.
(c) No person shall sell or furnish any stun gun to a minor unless the 
minor is at least 16 years of age and has the written consent of his or 
her parent or legal guardian. Violation of this subdivision shall be a 
public offense punishable by a fifty dollar ($50) fine for the first 
offense. Any subsequent violation of this subdivision is a misdemeanor.
(d) No minor shall possess any stun gun unless the minor is at least 16 
years of age and has the written consent of his or her parent or legal 
guardian.
12652. Each stun gun sold shall contain both of the following:
(a) The name of the manufacturer stamped on the stun gun.
(b) The serial number applied by the manufacturer.
12653. Unless otherwise specified, any violation of this article is a 
misdemeanor.

12654. Each stun gun sold in this state shall be accompanied by an 
instruction booklet. Violation of this section shall be a public offense 
punishable by a fifty dollar ($50) fine for each weapon sold without the 
booklet.
"

I've heard anecdotes from people who were hassled by cops when they wore 
their stun guns on their belts. Similar to what often happens to people 
when they openly wear knives, even though open carry is ostensibly 
preferable in many places to concealment.

"Do not anger Happy Fun Court by openly exercising your rights!"

Besides varying from state to state, local satrapies often have their 
own special laws about what their sheeple may own, carry, or use.
