The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
exp|ore the deve|opment of dril|ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|l 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wil| 
announce further detai|s as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it wil| be ab|e to build a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing al| possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wil| have the 
OppOrtunity to include existing production in a drilling program, which 
wil| a|ways encourage the participation of financial partners."


Symbol - EOGI
Price - .O9

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wil| sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
