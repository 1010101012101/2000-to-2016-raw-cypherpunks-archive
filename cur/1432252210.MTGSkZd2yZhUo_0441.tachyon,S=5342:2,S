>>Someone stealing a television or PC has certainly earned killing.

Anyone who thinks this sounds too extreme really should read the newspaper
sometime for the many accounts of people being murdered in cold blood after
giving up property to their assailants without a fight. Last week in the UK
there was a story about a woman being murdered for her cell phone, of all
things. Who in their right mind would rely on scum criminals to play by the
same middle-class standards of behavior as they normally do? So if you don't
know if your robber will take your life for something as absolutely trivial as
your athletic shoes, surely defending yourself by killing them first when
they're trying to steal your PC or TV is warranted.

And if you're comfortable living in a booby-trapped house, more power to you,
but this probably isn't the best option for regular people with families, kids
and visitors.

Mainly it's going to make vengeance easier for people who lack a sufficient
level of commitment to the idea of taking responsibility for going all the way
themselves. I hate to break this to you, but people hire contract killers every
single day.

For example, any lard-assed schizophrenic coward parasitically sponging welfare
in a foreign country can push a few keys and put a four-dollar bounty on my
head online; but it would take someone of a far hardier breed to get organized
and lay out the $5000 bucks for a halfway decent hit man. (data point from
personal experience: I used to know a woman who dated one.)

Crypto-anarchy notwithstanding, I don't think any amount of crypto will ever be
able to keep the vast majority of lard-assed schizophrenic cowards from making
enough mistakes to get caught or iced first. And since the L-ASCs are likely to
make up a disproportionate percentage of the demand for such services, it's
probably not going to be as dire a situation as some people would like you to
think.

>>(Hint: This preceeded Jimbell by many years.)<<

Speak of the devil.


>>Fact is, many people have already earned killing. The only

>>vengeance.

Feds, Thugs, Overmen and L-ASCs alike: if you've given up on the idea of the
constitution and rule of law, the only thing in this world that could stop you
is your own personal sense of prudence.
