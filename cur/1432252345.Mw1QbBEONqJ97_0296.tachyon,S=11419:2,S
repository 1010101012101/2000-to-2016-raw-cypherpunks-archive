This is sooooo 1999...  I've seen port scans as soon as cable modems and
dsl lines started to be installed.  Of course soon as some dork didn't
have a firewall, you really had a "network neighborhood" to play with.

What pissed me off is that when I was using Concentric's DSL (XO
now) Windows boxes somehow did broadcasts that strangely enough made it
past the routers (not sure if they're multicasts or what) and advertised
themselves... 

At first I though these were the usual nmap/strobe attacks, but they
were just on port 139... so that got me curious enough to try and connect
to these boxes.  To my surprise they were full blown windows 9x and 2000
machines in homes where the owner had another machine and shared his/her
local drives with the world!  Anyone from anywhere on the planet could
mount their drives.  So I was nice enough to leave a note on their desktop
informing them of the consequences of their actions.

I doubt that I was the only one who noticed such open hosts, and I'd guess
a lot of these were "owned" pretty quickly...

Oy! Of course these days I refrain from even such cursive curiosities due
to the misinterpretation of these acts by our overzealous friends.
