that indeed is stupid and so no one have solved it yet... for social
network or basically any IM/chat/etc to be usable it must have majority of
people (eg. your friends) users there, otherwise without people they are
totally useless so currently we're stuck with no-so-great
applications/protocols only because everyone already are on them like
Facebook and Skype. On that mailing list there were discussion about a
polyglot protocol/application which could support all networks so users
wouldn't be forced to migrate which I think is essential because a lot of
people won't bother. There was mention to Sockethub
<http://sockethub.org/>which
seems quite cool, only for a bit different use case I would say.
Another thing I would like to mention is BitlBee <http://bitlbee.org> it is
a gateway between various IM/chat networks and IRC so you can chat with
friends on Facebook using your favorite IRC client, or post a tweet on your
Twitter and use various other protocols. It even supports OTR.
