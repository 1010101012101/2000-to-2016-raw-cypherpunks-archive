That is the best model, probably, but there are some intermediate
models between "bump in the cord" and "compile SpeakFreely and figure
out how to get it to work".  Starium is obviously the easiest to use.
Plug it in, press one button, you're done.  However, with a small
dedicated PC or a PDA, it should be possible to get closer to what
Starium promises.

Obviously it would be ideal to have Starium-type chips embedded in
every voice communications device in existence, but we're not there
yet.

Both probably could be tampered, but I guess a generic PC would be
easier.

Well, if I have enemies as powerful as the CIA or the DEA, I'm
probably in a lot of trouble no matter what I do, but... yes, chips
everywhere would be best.

But the lack of interest is mostly related to how difficult it has
been to use this stuff.  Example: RSA encryption was used by millions
of people for Lotus Notes, or ordinary web browsers, because it was
completely, invisibly integrated, but not many people (comparatively)
use PGP, because it's not invisibly integrated, even though the
technology is the same.  If we could get crypto easier to use for
voice, I'm sure most people would want to use it.

I hope to have time to take a crack at doing Starium-on-a-PDA.

That's cool.
