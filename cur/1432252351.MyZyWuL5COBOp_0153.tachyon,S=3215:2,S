A few good cypherpunks...Goodonya john Gilmore! Yoda man! As well as 
operating like the old south african pass laws,these "oral" directives seem 
to discriminate.Do corporate jet passengers suffer this insulting and 
demeaning assault?
Times like these sort the cypherpunk men from the overgrown boys.Waytogo 
Johnno!
