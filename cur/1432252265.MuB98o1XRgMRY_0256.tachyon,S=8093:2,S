Subject: CDR: Piracy is wrong
> This shouldn't have to be said, but apparently it is necessary.

Which is a correct statement, but an incorrect line of thinking. Piracy is
an illegitimate use of a designed in hole in the security, the ability to
copy. This right to copy for personal use is well founded, and there are
even supreme court cases to support it. DRM removes this right, without due
representation, and it is thinking like yours that leads down this poorly
chosen path. The other much more harsh reality involved is that DRM cannot
work, all it can do is inconvenience legitimate consumers. There is massive
evidence of this, and you are free to examine them in any way you choose.

These include the expectation that the artist will be paid according to
whatever deal they have signed with their label. Inherent in this deal is
the consumer's right to copy for personal use, and to resell their purchased
copy, as long as all copies that the consumer has made are destroyed. DRM
attempts to revoke this right to personal copying, and resale.

And if the artist cannot accept the fundamental rights specifically granted,
they should not produce art.

Last time I checked the giver is supposed to remove the pricetag from the
gift before giving it. By a similar argument, everyone should be happy that
the WTC flying occured, after all they were kind enough not to kill anyone
that's still alive. The logic simply doesn't hold.

In fact one of the specifically granted rights is the right to share the
music with friends and family, so this has nothing to do with being "a liar
and a cheat" it has to do with excercising not just rights, but rights that
have been specifically granted.

Because of that specifically granted right, that copies can be made for
friends and family, it is also a specifically granted right to accept those
copies. So it is merely excercising a specifically granted right. You
clearly have not read or understood the implications and complexities of
your statements, with regard to either logic or the law.

> This isn't complicated.

Apparently it is too complicated for you.

> It's just basic ethics.

It's just basic rights and excercising of those rights.

If the record companies were prepared to trust, why do they employ a
substantial army of lawyers? Why do they pursue every p2p network? Why are
they pushing for DRM? Trust is not a one-way street. The recording labels
have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted in any form, what delusion
makes you think they can be trusted now?

Exactly, I refuse to accept a DRM -limited environment which does not allow
me full ownership of something I purchased.

> they provide and refusing to do your part.  That's cheating.

No, that's a fundamental misunderstanding of everything involved, from law
to basic logic you have misunderstood it all.
