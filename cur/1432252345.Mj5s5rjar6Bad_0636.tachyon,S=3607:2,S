jamesd>>>While issue of a purely fiat digital currency without state 
backing would be an interesting experiment, such a currency could never 
gain value, never become useful as a medium of exchange. <<

If it started as one unit of barter value that was level with the dollar 
and floated with it,then its scalable and could and should overtake the 
dollar at some point.(phase transition or slow fade of D?) Any interference 
punishable by APster,certain death.Many details remain but you seem 
mistaken on this,if its hopeless,why bother?

 >>However the niche market where most people expect the introduction of 
digital cash is internet transactions, where breaking the defaulter's neck 
is not a viable option<<

You must have APster justice.You have all the horsemen loose so there must 
be a rein or the masses will support the corrupt,rancid state's 
crackdown.Not that the crackdown will succeed entirely,new attempts will 
surely follow.
Huge bombproof remailers,APster backup of contract law and e-cash based on 
what you know best.The value of your labor.

"Four hundred billionaires now possess wealth equal to that of the 3 
billion poorest people on the planet. This capitalist system is inherently 
violent, oppressive and exploitative. Capitalism cannot be reformed, and 
that's why we need to abolish it."
