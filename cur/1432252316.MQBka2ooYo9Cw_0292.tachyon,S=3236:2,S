Yes, David, truly, I expected (to paraphrase Sandfort) "the most members of
this audience" to be drawn in by Plato's Republic, so as to entertain the
nature of Sophist dialogue ...reflect on Wittgensteinian philosophy
...engage in concept analysis ...to sit and marvel on the colored numenons
of Raphael ...to meander down linguistic folkways.... Yea, to even come away
pondering The Allegory of the Cave....

Damn.
