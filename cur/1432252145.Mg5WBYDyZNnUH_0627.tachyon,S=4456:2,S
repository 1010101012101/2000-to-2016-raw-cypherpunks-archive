IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PENTAGON SEEKS IDEAS ON COMBATING TERRORISM

The Department of Defense announced today that the Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
and the Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office Technical
Support Working Group are jointly sponsoring a Broad Agency
Announcement (BAA) asking for help in fighting terrorism.
The BAA, issued Oct. 23 (No. 02-Q-4655), specifically seeks help
in combating terrorism, defeating difficult targets, conducting
protracted operations in remote areas, and developing
countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction.  Its objective
is to find concepts that can be developed and fielded within 12
to 18 months.

The BAA provides for a three-phase process in which interested
parties initially submit a one-page description of their
concept.  Initial responses are due by Dec. 23, 2001.  After a
review of a submission and if DoD is interested in further
information, the submitter will then be asked to provide a more
detailed description of up to 12 pages of the idea.  Submitters
of concepts that the department is not interested in pursuing
further will be so notified.

DoD will evaluate phase two submissions and ask those who have
offered the most promising ideas to submit full proposals in a
third phase that may form the basis for a contract.  Phase two
submitters who are not asked to submit full proposals will be so
notified.  Submitters of a full phase three proposal that is not
accepted by the department may request a formal debriefing.
Debriefings will not be provided to phase one and phase two
submitters whose concepts were not accepted.

Interested parties can obtain more information concerning this
BAA by visiting http://www.bids.tswg.gov .
