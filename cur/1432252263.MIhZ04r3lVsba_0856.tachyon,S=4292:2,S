Declan,

Jim Choate is actually correct in what he says above.

The laws of physics, the history of the United States and Europe, 
even mathematics...all are as he describes them. In his world. In 
"Choate Prime," the parallel universe which he lives in, the 
Constitution is as he describes it, electromagnetics work as he 
describes it, prime numbers have the properties he has told us about, 
and copyright law works in the way he describes.

As a reporter yourself, you should be appreciative of these reports 
from Choate Prime, that parallel world off-kilter from our own.
