Hear, hear.

This sort of crap is the inevitable outcome of an unmoderated list.  All the
loons come out to play because there are no real negative consequences for
being a loon.  And filtering does not do anything besides bury one's head in
the sand.

I have an solution... (no, it's not AP).  :'D

I promise, when I get my new business going and have the time/money to
devote to it, I will offer Cypherpunks a real solution.  (Anybody who has
time/money and wants to discuss it now, please contact me offline.)

We now return you to the freak show, already in progress.
