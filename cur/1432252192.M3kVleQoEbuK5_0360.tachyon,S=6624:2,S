Yes but my point was they didnt have to throw out the baby with the
bathwater; silent circles email I think was basically two products combined:

1. end2end secure, store-and-forward encryption between silent circle users;

2. server-side encryption of opportunistically SSL encrypted (potentially
unencrypted) incoming emails + presumably unencrypted outgoing emails.

Why not keep 1?  They obviously have the technology for it because they have
retained encrypted SMS-like functionality which is the same key management
and information flow.

Not forgetting there is a 3rd "product" which is the defacto which is normal
email:

3. opportunistically encrypted (SSL) email

(as well as SMIME (dont trust due to CA malfeasance) or self-managed PGP/GPG
which for some reason people find difficult).

and users who lose 1 & 2 due to the no-notice product end-of-life will
probably just switch to 3 as an alternative to stopping communicating.  

Even catching a flight with a USB drive apparently is risky via UK re the
curiously named David Miranda (Miranda rights eh) seems they demanded
decryption keys.  Seems like people who are couriering data ought to encrypt
it with the recipients public key before travel.
