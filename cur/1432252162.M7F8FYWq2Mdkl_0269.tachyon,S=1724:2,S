Who cares?  There is *no* obligation that you check back with Nullsoft
to re-read their terms.  They can whine about licenses all they want,
but no downloader has any need to check back, or change their behavior.

E.g., Realmedia may have pulled an early Free version their .ram 
generator, but its out there.

     I think people have not quite gotten their hands around the
speed at which information can be disseminated online.
