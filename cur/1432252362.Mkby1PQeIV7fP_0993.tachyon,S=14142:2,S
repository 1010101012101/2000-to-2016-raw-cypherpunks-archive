Spy Suspect May Have Revealed U.S. Bugging
                                              Espionage: Hanssen left
signs that he told Russia where
                                            top-secret overseas
eavesdropping devices are placed,
                                            officials say.

                                            By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times
Staff Writer

                                                 WASHINGTON--U.S.
intelligence officials said
                                            Tuesday that they fear
suspected spy Robert Philip
                                            Hanssen may have provided
Russia with top-secret
                                            information about how and
where the United States has
                                            planted its most
sophisticated overseas eavesdropping
                                            devices.
                                                 U.S. spy-catchers said
they are trying to determine
                                            whether the former FBI agent
compromised a highly
                                            sensitive "black-budget"
program run jointly by the
                                            Central Intelligence Agency
and the National Security
                                            Agency.
                                                 The elite program,
known innocuously as the Special
                                            Collection Service, plays a
critical role in U.S.
                                            intelligence operations by
conducting bugging operations
                                            in or near embassies,
communications centers and other
                                            facilities on foreign soil.
                                                 The program's mission
is so sensitive that intelligence
                                            officials never have
acknowledged its existence publicly.
                                            Its funding is hidden within
the federal budget and little is
                                            known about the technologies
and techniques it employs.
                                                 Hanssen was arrested on
Feb. 18 after FBI agents said
                                            they saw him leave a cache
of secret documents at a "dead
                                            drop" in a park near his
home in Vienna, Va. He is
                                            accused of having provided
classified material to the
                                            Russians since 1985 in
exchange for $1.4 million in cash
                                            and diamonds.
                                                 According to documents
filed in federal court
                                            Tuesday, the package of
material included an encrypted
                                            letter in which Hanssen said
that he feared the FBI
                                            suspected him and that he
needed to "seclude" himself.
                                                 "Something has aroused
the sleeping tiger," said a
                                            letter signed by "Ramon
Garcia," one of the aliases
                                            allegedly used by Hanssen.
The letter said that the FBI had
                                            promoted him to "a higher
do-nothing" job without
                                            regular access to
counterintelligence. "It is as if I am
                                            being isolated," the letter
said.
                                                 As U.S. officials try
to assess the damage caused by
                                            Hanssen's alleged spying,
the CIA-NSA bugging program
                                            "is going to be a focus,"
confirmed an intelligence official
                                            who asked not to be
identified. "That's certainly going to
                                            be looked at."
                                                 Hanssen is believed to
have shared office quarters for
                                            several years at the State
Department with NSA agents
                                            and may have obtained
information about the bugging
                                            program through this and
other means in his role as a
                                            Russian counterintelligence
specialist, U.S. officials said.
                                                 If Hanssen did breach
the security of the program, it
                                            could represent one of the
most damaging consequences
                                            of the data he allegedly
sold to the Russians and their
                                            Soviet predecessors over a
15-year period.
                                                 An affidavit outlining
the government's case against
                                            Hanssen asserts that he
"compromised an entire technical
                                            program of enormous value,
expense and importance to
                                            the United States." It
suggests obliquely that Hanssen
                                            gave the Russians
information about a "new technique"
                                            developed by the NSA and
described to them a "sensitive
                                            office" where an NSA
employee worked.
                                                 Although the affidavit
does not mention the Special
                                            Collection Service by name,
intelligence experts outside
                                            the government said that
these and other references point
                                            to the global eavesdropping
operation.
                                                 FBI officials already
have described some of the
                                            information they believe
Hanssen passed to the Russians
                                            over the years. He allegedly
confirmed for Moscow the
                                            identities of three Russian
double agents who were
                                            working for the United
States--leading to the execution of
                                            two of them. And in 1989, he
allegedly let the KGB know
                                            about a secret FBI
investigation into the activities of
                                            Felix Bloch, a high-ranking
U.S. diplomat suspected of
                                            spying for the Soviets. The
investigation was
                                            "compromised," U.S.
officials said, and Bloch was never
                                            charged.
                                                 But intelligence
officials said that Hanssen may have
                                            caused far more damage to
U.S. national security, and
                                            they are still trying to
assess the extent of that damage.
                                            FBI Director Louis J. Freeh,
along with Atty. Gen. John
                                            Ashcroft and CIA Director
George J. Tenet, will brief
                                            congressional officials
today in a closed session.
                                                 If the bugging program
was seriously compromised by
                                            Hanssen, "that's something
that would be extremely
                                            serious," said a former
intelligence official who requested
                                            anonymity. "You're talking
about very specific, very
                                            pointed information that's
usually the gold nuggets of the
                                            intelligence community."
                                                 Said James Bamford, an
author and expert on the
                                            NSA: "Once [the Russians]
find out how this
                                            eavesdropping is done and
where in essence the bugs are,
                                            they could quickly do one of
two things--take them apart,
                                            or worse yet, send
disinformation over them."
                                                 Intelligence officials
started the program in the late
                                            1970s in the midst of the
Cold War to devise and plant
                                            sophisticated eavesdropping
devices at overseas sites that
                                            have access to sensitive
data. The aim is to intercept
                                            sensitive information on
espionage, nuclear arms,
                                            terrorist networks, drug
trafficking and a range of other
                                            issues that U.S. officials
say are vital to national security.
                                                 The bugging program
"marries the CIA's covert people
                                            who know how to get into
places--by bribing the right
                                            person or whatever is
needed--with the NSA people who
                                            can design the right bug to
go in the right environment so
                                            the information can be
secreted across the border," said
                                            Bamford, who wrote a
landmark study of the NSA and
                                            will soon release a sequel
called "Body of Secrets."
                                                 The CIA and the NSA use
the program to bug not only
                                            obvious targets such as
embassies and government
                                            centers, but also computer
facilities, fiber-optic cable
                                            networks and communications
centers carrying sensitive
                                            data, Bamford said.
                                                 Bamford said that he
knows Hanssen well, both
                                            personally and
professionally. Hanssen, he said, was in an
                                            ideal position to penetrate
the bugging system because he
                                            was intimately familiar with
Russian counterintelligence,
