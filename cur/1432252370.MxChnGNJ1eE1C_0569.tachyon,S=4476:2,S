When the cost of acting as an informant is zero, no risk, more people act as 
informants.

I think restoring some risk to being a rat is a good thing."

There is of course the old argument about states such as Nazi Germany: what 
percentage of the population would have participated had they known that in 
wearing the Nazi uniform (even just on the streets of Berlin), there'd be a 
nonzero chance of them coming home alive?

The problem in the present situation of course is underlined by the fact 
that the mafia is a fairly coherent set of relational organizations, acting 
in conjunction with centrally identified aims, but actintg on those aims 
across a wide swath of territory/etc. A "restoration of risk" would require 
some form of large-scale activities along these lines. A "lone nut" or 
unabomber that does something like this can be ignored as insane. And 
indeed, his actions will probably end up being counter-productive. If it 
were commonly understood that lots of people (who may live next door) take 
offence at being narced, then (and only then) would things be a little 
different. How do you get there from here? Dunno, but the obvious paradigm 
these days is P2P.

PS: One possible thing missing from the "response" list. Anyway to make a 
virus that will install fake/random name lists?
