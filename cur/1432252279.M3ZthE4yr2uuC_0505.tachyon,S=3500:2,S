No, no, this is a copyright problem in Choate Prime - when people walk in 
front of heat sources, they make shadow animals on the walls (and on the 
thermal imagers), and that violates their copyright, unless the cops got 
prior permission to look at and record the shadow animals. (Well, really 
only if the people make a big (C) shadow animal first.)

Also, this is a First Amendment problem, because the cops have a right to 
free speech in court when they describe the shadow animals they saw with 
their thermal imagers.

Since it's possible to get statutory damages for copyright infringement, in 
Choate Prime the cops are entitled to court-appointed attorneys to protect 
their free speech rights. Unless they're mimes.
