A bit of wishful thinking here I think.

This is really not true at all. In fact it is far more likely (or 
maybe less unlikely)  that European countries would pass draconian 
anti-spam laws than it is in the US because they don't on the 
whole have the same attitude to free speech.

And so, maybe, do AOL.

The real problem with your whole argument of the last week or so 
is that your mail is not passing across Mallory's back yard, or 
through pipes beneath his house - you are  expecting him to carry 
it across and deliver it for you. And if he doesn't want to then 
he doesn't want to.

Solution?

Choose one of:

- get your friends to use a different ISP

- build your own network

- get your government to take over AOL on your behalf and run it 
as a public utility

- Get With The Program (TM) and fix your mail so it conforms with 
whatever arbitrary rules AOL have set up. After all SOME people 
manage to mail AOL customers. In their eyes you must be doing 
something wrong.  How dare you stand against the Corporate Might 
(TM) of what Made America Great(TM)!

- use letter post


Each of the above has a downside.
