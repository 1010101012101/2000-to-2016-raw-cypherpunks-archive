Geez.  I don't know how we ended up with that wording. Multiple key
would have made more sense.  The goal is to have a set of keys which
are held by different entities.  Thus, your data is encrypted such
that each of those entities needs to be involved to decrypt it.

By split key encryption, we mean: E_a(E_b(E_c(data))) where E is a
strong algorithm (3des, twofish, AES), and the keys (abc) are full
strength, properly generated and stored keys for the system.

Ok.

No key escrow.

No split keys in that (a,b) is used as the encryption key for a single 
encrypt, where Alice and Bob each have half the key.  Multiple key
systems, as I explained above.

Given that we're doing this for businesses that are collecting data
now, if you consider those parties 'trusted third parties,' then we're 
increasing the assurance that surrounds them.  We consider them
'merchants,' 'shipping companes' and other such businesses who today
get data from you.  They're not trusted third parties in the Clipper
chip sense, but they are parties who store information about you,
often in very insecure and unprivate ways, as MCI, CDnow, and others
have found out.

We can't either.

This isn't primarily a crypto solution, its an integrated set of
things, including an understanding of what data a company ought to
collect, what the advantages of minimization are, and then help
implementing it.

We are not selling any key escrow, leaf, GAK, clipper, capstone,
redcreek, or other such trust-me solution.

We see a huge market in companies which are discovering that policies
are not enough.  We see them hiring CPOs, and looking for assistance.
We're not abandoning Freedom--we think that controlling information
about yourself is still the best approach.  But we do get regular
requests from businesses for something else, and we're going to
provide it.  We fully intend to provide explanations of what we build
for each customer, a fair assessment of what we've built, and source
where we can.  We see those as essential for building trust in the
system.   We intend to build systems which we can be proud of.

| pernicious!--systems which "meet the legitimate needs of law

We are meeting the needs of law enforcement the same way we always
have.  By building systems that protect people's privacy.  By telling
the world what we've built.  And explaining, in great detail, why we
think that key escrow, et cetera ad nauseum, is a mistake, and that we 
don't build it, don't ship it, don't support it.

| Key escrow, in other words.
