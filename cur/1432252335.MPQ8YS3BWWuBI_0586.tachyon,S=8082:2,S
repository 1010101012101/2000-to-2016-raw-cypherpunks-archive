Because the former owner signed the 'coins' over to the public
key in question, confirmed all the way back to their first generation,
in a ledger back to the genesis. You were given (bought) the deed
of your house from someone, confirmed by many titles before
in recorders ledger, right?

Everyone who says, "well, my chain was at this height
before suspect 51% attack (or other) issue, let's compare."
Though that's an event you *really* want to avoid. Thus for
their own good people will move off ghash.io. Or will plain stop
transacting and starve the pools of trans fees and trans
to scam.

And how many dollars on hardware and power would an
'unknown' pool of say government or criminals need to
reach 51% on their own for disruption or profit? By now,
maybe an amount that might be hard to keep quiet.

There are verifiable and agreed upon checkpoints...

Agreed there is a lot of trust, crazy trust, and the adoption in actual business
using it (not simply user2user beer and pizza trade), is a bit amazing.
So far it's held up. Try to break it or game it, mathematically or
operationally, huge recognition for anyone who does.
Those with personal money (not mined) in their hoards are on their own risk
decision on that, at least until say the ten year mark and the laws prove out.
Others have mined or can mine, or invest, to recover/recoup their entry
which makes it free for them.
The rest seem to get in, buy a pizza, and get out (perhaps wisely).

Lots people should read, learn and evaluate, me too. Meanwhile, I
don't have a problem putting some disposable funds into holding,
trading, commerce, or related bitcoin business and seeing what happens.
Call me stupid, seems more fun, profitable and useable than blowing
lottery tickets would be. And if that's all it's ever good for you can have
my wallet after you break Bitcoin ;-)
