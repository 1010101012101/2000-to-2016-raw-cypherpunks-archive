Traceability has to exist because there is no money in circulation.

Basically everywhere that your attorney would never look ;).

The GSF documents are a start. There is more in the pipeline. You need to learn
Common Law, how to do a Claim of Right, etc.

FYI, such a /Claim of Right/ is far advanced.

Lessons on Common Law: http://1215.org/ - how it works is basically how a real
Court of Record works:

At a minimum read every essay here:
http://1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/foundation.htm

At a minimum listen to this:
http://1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/lectures/introduction/index.html

Then go back and read all the GSF documents and claim of right:
http://www.global-settlement.org/cms/node/5

This for bonus points (latest developments):
http://www.rayservers.com/blog/rod-class-15-issue-doc

Basic quiz after all that:
1. What is the difference between money and currency?
2. What is the difference between one of the People of America and a US Citizen?
3. Is the President (the current one, and, say, the last dozen) of the United
States an American?
4. What is a Court of Record?
5. What kind of court is a US Federal or State Court or UK equivalent?
6. What is on deposit at a US or UK retail bank?
7. Who /can claim/ to *represent* the people?
8. Define the territory of the United States.
9. What *is* the United States and/or the United Kingdom?
10. What is the /law of the land/ and who can claim to enforce it?

The GSF System allows for multiple, independent issuers. The idea is, to start
an economy, not a monopoly. See claim of right.

Best,
Ray.
