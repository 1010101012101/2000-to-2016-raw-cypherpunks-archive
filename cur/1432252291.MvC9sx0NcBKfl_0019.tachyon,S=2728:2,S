Indeed, why bother? How about a system that removes your right to vote 
if you haven't exercised it in the last 3 elections? That way you cut 
out all those who really don't care, and provide an incentive for those 
who might. Nothing grabs attention like threatening to remove 
/privileges/, even if they don't actually get used.

Make sure there's a handy "abstain" option for those who want to get the 
point across about lack of choice, and maybe a space to say why, too. 
Then stick the (anonymous) reasons up in a publicly-viewable space and 
eh, instant feedback.

Or something.
