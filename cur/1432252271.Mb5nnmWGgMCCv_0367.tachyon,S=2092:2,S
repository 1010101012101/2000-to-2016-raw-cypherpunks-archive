c.f. "Take back the night", et. cetera.  (And put it where?)

Anyhow, isn't insurrection illegal or something?  ISTR reading about the
natural right of the corrupt state to exist unconditionally, and it's
obligation to crush any question of change for any reason.

The structure of the state in fact defines its identity as a 'person'; and
since changeing the state structure could be viewed as the murder of the
state's personality, the state has the right, nay, obligation to preserve
its identity unchanged.  (Isn't this pretty much polysci 101 material?)


Regards,

Steve
