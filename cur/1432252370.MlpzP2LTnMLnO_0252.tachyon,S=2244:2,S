Does anyone have pointers to crypto related weblogs?  Bruce Schneier
recently announced that Crypto-Gram would be coming out incrementally
in blog form at http://www.schneier.com/blog/.  I follow Ian Grigg's
Financial Cryptography blog, http://www.financialcryptography.com/.
Recently I learned about Adam Shostack's http://www.emergentchaos.com/,
although it seems to be more security than crypto.

Any other good ones?
