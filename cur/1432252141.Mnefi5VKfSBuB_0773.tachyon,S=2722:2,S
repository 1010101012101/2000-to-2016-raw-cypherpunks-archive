So, the e-gold phishers are at it again... received a very nice email 
this morning with an attachment.  The Received-From header showed this 
beauty: "from 195.56.214.184 
(dwwsaviej@cable-214-184.hszob.fibernet.bacs-net.hu [195.56.214.184] 
(may be forged))"

Indeed!

Don't know if it's a trojan, spyware, virus, or worm, and I couldn't 
care less since I don't use egold, but would be interesting (just for 
curiosity's sake) if someone were to disassemble it to see what it does. 
  It's probably a password grabber of some kind, so falls under spyware, 
but who knows what other evil payloads were in the attachment.

ROTFL!
