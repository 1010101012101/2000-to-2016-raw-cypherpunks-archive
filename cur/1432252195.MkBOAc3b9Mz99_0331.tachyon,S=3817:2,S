This would eliminate the public's ability to learn interesting and
important facts like those published here (also by Mr McCullagh):
http://speakout.com/activism/opinions/4377-1.html.  For example,
"According to government statistics, in 1998 police intercepted
2,313,210 conversations but the taps -- 71% were for drug-related
crimes -- resulted in only 911 convictions."  Was that a reasonable
trade-off between security and freedom?  And how else can we, the
people, make such judgments without having facts like these?
