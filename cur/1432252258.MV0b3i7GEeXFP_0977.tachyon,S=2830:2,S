I see you did not actually read 
"http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARTICLE5/april.html"

There are two versions of Glaspie's conversation.  One believable, 
one unbelievable.  One of which tells Saddam that the US is deeply 
concerned about Saddam invading, implicitly threatening him while 
explicitly denying any threat, one of which gives the green light for 
invasion.

One definitely gives the green light.  The other can be read as 
giving the green light, but would not be so read by anyone who wanted 
to stay alive.

Needless to say, one version comes from more credible sources than 
the other.
