Why would u guess this?  These problems have been around since almost the 
founding of the republic.

The Colonists had representatives too, its just that they were chosen by 
King George :)  The fact that 'my' representatives are not the ones I 
wanted nor any of the independent independent party voters wanted is 
paramount.  Representation is about interests and ideology.  If a 
significant segment of voters don't get anyone to represent these interests 
and ideologies bad things can happen (e.g., they can become 
radicalized).  Representation can be an important outlet for these 
disenfranchised voters.

The problem is that use of voting districts seems to have always resulted 
in gerrymandering in our political system.  A proportional system can 
eliminate these geopolitical distortions.
