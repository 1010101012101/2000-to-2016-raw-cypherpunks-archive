$39 + tax in Fry's.

I don't care. No one knows about it enough to set a trap in a random PC (and if
They do we're in deep shit anyway.) This is the reason for not releasing the
(trivial) program. Write your own and let it be your group key ... say, 40-bits
worth ?

Subverting PGP is far more likely. The only solution would be to have a CPU on
the keychain item ... just wait for PDAs to get smaller.

You destroy bits *every* time. The routine that reads bits overwrites them.
Messages are fixed size, index into OTP file is a part of the message, each
user gets starting offset assigned to avoid synching problems.

Yes, there are zillion DoS attacks, but we had none so far. This crypto works
only when a crypto programmer is a part of cooperative group, and frankly we
don't give a fuck for the rest of the world.

I's suggest a hi-fi video digitizer with analog input. CCDs have dirty
randomness.

Well, each of 8 bits of byte affect its parity. It's just the different initial
block size. But tastes vary.

Did you ever try to type 5 megabytes of text ? Check the size of the text part
of your outgoing mail archive.
