Subject: septillion operations per second

Hi,

In James Bamford's new book 'Body of Secrets' he claims the NSA is working on some FAST computers. 
http://www.randomhouse.com/features/bamford/book.html
---
The secret community is also home to the largest collection of hyper-powerful computers, advanced mathematicians and skilled language experts on the planet.
Within the city, time is measured in femtosecondsone million billionth of a second, and scientists work in secret to develop computers capable of performing more than one septillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) operations every second.
---

If they ever build such a computer (or 1.000.000 of them) what would that mean for today's key lengths ?
I am curious how long a computer capable of a septillion operations per second would take to crack one 128 bit or 256 bit key.
Or a RSA 1024 or 2048 bit key for that matter ...

Greetings,

Barry.
