How would this be any different than what the guardian (and
other phone SW projects) are developing, other than shipment
of a phone preloaded with your flavor of Android OS?
(And perhaps also offering IMEI/SIM cell service?)
As opposed to the user flashing Android-ROM-OS into any
compatible phone and choosing their service. Thus, save that
convenience, why?

This question shouldn't imply such products aren't needed.

Note some open phone HW projects are selling hardware
to which you apply your droid SW rom. Though we're likely
at least a handful of years away from seeing a genuinely
'open design' baseband HW layer in a phone, they are
talking about approaching it.
