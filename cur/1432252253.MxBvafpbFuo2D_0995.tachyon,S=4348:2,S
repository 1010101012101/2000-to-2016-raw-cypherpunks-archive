I don't think this goes far enough at all. They won't care if their
information is out there. Similar actions by Anonymous have shown
that. They use it as a base for even more propaganda to the people as
to why this type of pervasive survelliance is needed.

What we /need/, IMHO, is infiltration. Straight out infiltration. We
need to operate just like we would in any regular battle: we need good
people to find jobs within the various agencies that provide them
sufficiently high level access so that they can leak information to
the public. You want to scare them? Take away the security of them
trusting /anybody/. Let them vet people out the ass with their useless
polygraphs and psychological testing procedures. People dedicated to
exposing their evil will pass them, get jobs, and leak the hell out of
their information.
