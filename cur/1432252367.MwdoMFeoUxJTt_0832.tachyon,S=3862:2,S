I've run my primary browser with no trusted CAs, manually TOFUing
certificates for sites, for months on end.  It's slightly easier than
"view source" to use control-shift-K (in Firefox) and reload the page,
then watch for resource load errors in the console.  Some fairly small
adjustments to browser UIs would make this use case much easier.  The
biggest problem is that Firefox's SSL exception implementation only
allows a single certificate per hostname, so load-balanced hosts such as
p.twimg.com which toggle between multiple valid certificates are
annoying.

(I also VPN this browser through a fairly trusted datacenter, so I'm not
TOFUing over the local WLAN of course.)

It's fairly helpful to use SSL errors as a firewall to help me avoid
accidentally loading sites whose TOS I refuse to accept, such as G+ and
Facebook.

It also functions as a primitive adblock for some sites since you don't
have to accept the certificates for doubleclick.net et al.
