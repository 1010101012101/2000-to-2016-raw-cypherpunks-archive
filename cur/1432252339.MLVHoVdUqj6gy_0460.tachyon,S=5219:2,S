So, is this just a test or has at least one industry giant decided, as the 
software industry learned long ago, that the cost of copy protection often 
exceeds its value.

Time to short Macrovision (MVSN, NASDAQ NM)?  In the past year the stock 
has dropped from about $72 to about $14.  I wonder if their $1.00 drop in 
price on today's opening reflects this news?
