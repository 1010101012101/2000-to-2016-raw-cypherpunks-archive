Since Mein Fuhrer Bush is preparing to escalate to Iran in a few months,
you'd better get used to it.

No.  The problem is states like the US who should keep their fascist noses
out of other states business.  Let those states rise or fall on their own
merits or demerits, but allow nature to take it's course.  It's not our
place to be decisiding what is an appropriate government for others.
Hell, we can't even figure out what's appropriate *here*.

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
