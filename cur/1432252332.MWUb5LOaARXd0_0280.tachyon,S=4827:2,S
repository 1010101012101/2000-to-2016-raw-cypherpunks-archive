"A drive from the district to Washington Dulles International Airport in 
Virginia will reveal a region that is light-years away from what it was 30 
years ago. When Dulles opened in 1962, it was seen by many as nothing more 
than a white elephant-too far from Washington (26 miles) and too big to be 
of any real use. Dulles may still be a less con-venient alternative to the 
charming and ever-so-close Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, but 
it is one of the fastest-growing airports in the country. It has become so 
crowded, in fact, that the passengers rushing through Eero Saarinen's 
soaring terminal overwhelm the once funky but now pokey mobile lounges. The 
once empty Dulles Toll Road, which stretches from the airport to the 
gargantuan Tysons Corner office and shopping complex on the Beltway, has 
seen changes galore as well. Lined with tech companies of all sorts, the 
toll road now serves as Fairfax County's high-tech main street. AOL (now 
AOL Time Warner), which grew up here, now occupies a large and sprawling 
headquarters in neighboring Loudoun County, Va., on the west side of 
Dulles. Other companies with their headquarters here include Nextel 
Communications, Deltek Systems, KPMG Consulting, MicroStrategy, TruSecure, 
Software AG, and Convera. Oracle, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, Computer 
Associates International, and VeriSign have offices in Fairfax County. The 
city of McLean, Va.-now the residence of choice for republican bigwigs, as 
opposed to the democratic Bethesda, Md.-houses the massive and showy new 
headquarters for Gannett as well as a large broadband solution center run 
by KPMG Consulting."
