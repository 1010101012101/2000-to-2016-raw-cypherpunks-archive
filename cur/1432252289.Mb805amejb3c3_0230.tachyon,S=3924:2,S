No, if you use bits for coefficients you are still in GF(2^n).
What "odd characteristic" means is that you are in GF(p^m) with
p odd (say 3 or 5 or 9).  So you have a polynomial of the form
x^3 + 4x^2 + 3 mod 5 is GF(5^4).  5 is the characteristic of
the base field, and since it's odd it's a bad lfsr for crypto.

Patience, persistence, truth,
