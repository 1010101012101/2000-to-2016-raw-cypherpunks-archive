"Of course that's over a baseline of 50%...)"

That's still very sobering. Start plugging that kind of info into a SAS 
program and you might be able to pull out some probable suspects from a list 
of, say, known contributors to "Cypherpunks".

Which reminds me...

How often are solicitations for employment, software, and other nominally 
crypto-type stuff that appears on this list actually some sort of TLA 
info-harvesting tool?
