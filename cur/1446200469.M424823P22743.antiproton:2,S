German police raided a couple of poeple's homes who've purchased the
android RAT tool DroidJack. They justified the searches with the claim
Droidjack is an offense-only tool which has no dual use (which is
nonsense) and that by purchasing it the user is therefore already a
criminal (nonsense as well).

Beside this claim they didn't provide any further evidence, like if the
person has indeed used the software against someone. The searches are
therefore probably unlawful. However if the scheme persists before the
courts then it may be illegal to buy/own/use "hacker software" in
germany. And since judges usually don't have any clue, the prosecution
can tell them whatever they please and will be able to convict basically
everyone in the security industry at will.
