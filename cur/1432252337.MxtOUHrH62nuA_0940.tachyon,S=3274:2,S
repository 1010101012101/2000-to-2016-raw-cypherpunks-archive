It does work here, 

Here, there are a lot of guns in the 
population. In places "Here" where there
aren't any idiotic gun laws, the law
abiding peacable folks keep guns. In these
places there are remarkably low homicide and
armed crime rates.

There is a direct correlation between
the restrictive gun laws and crime, the
higher the crime, the tighter the restriction
on peacable citizens right to bear arms.
The tighter the restriction on peaceable
citizens right to bear arms, the 
higher the crime. 

Why this simple logic eludes the 
anti-gunners is a complete and total
mystery to me. It can only be
deleberate.
