The passengers who jumped him, however, were looking forwards

Suicide bombers seldom look, or act, like normal people.  You
might think a suicide bomber is the ultimate guided missile,
but the Palestinian experience is that they are more like
unguided missiles, or dumb bombs.  The handler accompanies the
suicide as close to the target as he dares, then activates the
suicide's control, hoping they do not explode on the spot.
