Who said anything about profit?  The point under discussion was cost/benefit
analysis.  Don't engage in Inchoate over-simplification.  Neither cost nor
benefit is limited to monetary profit or loss.

Here's a silly example.  Let us suppose the terrorists are Muslims.  It has
been reported that the body of one of the terrorist pilots has been
recovered.  Perhaps future Muslim terrorists might deem costs too high if
that body were fed to pigs and the resulting pig shit dropped on Kabul (or
maybe that would just increase the "benefit" of killing more innocents).  In
either case the cost and benefit have nothing to do with profit.
