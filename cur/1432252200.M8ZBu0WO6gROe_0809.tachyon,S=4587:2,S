agreed.  we've got some years to wait for a definitive full picture.
 http://cryptome.org/2013/11/snowden-tally.htm - 932 pages (~1.6%) of
reported 58,000. NSA head claims 200,000 (~.40% of that released)

bad: RSA
less-bad: Cisco
good/proactive: SilentCircle
etc,...   we could get into details of what makes a good vendor
