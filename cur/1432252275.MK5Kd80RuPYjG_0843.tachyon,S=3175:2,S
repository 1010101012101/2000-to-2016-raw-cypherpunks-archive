It would be easy for me to say that all of the operators connected with 
JAP should be killed, either necklaced and left to burn in their 
driveways, with perhaps their families (children, siblings, parents) 
also tortured to death, or at least that the offices of JAP should be 
firebombed, but I will not do this.

I don't know what pressures they were placed under to do this dastardly 
act.

However, it is for sure clear that:

* no one connected with JAP should be hired or used as a consultant in 
any way by anyone of our persuasion. If this means the JAPsters are 
unemployable except by Big Brother, so be it.

* we should look for other evidence of other crimes against liberty. If 
other crimes are found, then of course I retract my comment about their 
necklacing deaths not being justified.

But of course those who placed any faith in "trust us, we won't narc 
you out!" software are the real fools.

Now, you see, the joke here, of course, is on White America, which 
always felt superior to blacks, and showed that with their feet, moving 
out of urban areas. "White flight," they called it. Whites feared 
blacks. They feared if they raised their kids around blacks, the blacks 
would turn their daughters and prostitutes. And now, through the 
miracle of MTV, damned if it didn't work out that way! "
