ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.9.0

The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.9.0 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:

https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" b meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/trunk/docs/about.rst

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.8.3, which was
released September 13, 2011.

v1.9.0 offers a new mutable-file format (more efficient for
large files), a file-blacklisting feature, and a new
"drop-upload" feature. See the NEWS file [3] and
known_issues.rst [4] file for details.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [5].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [2].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.

This is the fifteenth release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the foreseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.


LICENCE

version 2 or, at your option, any later version. See the file
"COPYING.GPL" [4] for the terms of the GNU General Public

See the file "COPYING.TGPPL.rst" [5] for the terms of the
Transitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.

(You may choose to use this package under the terms of either

INSTALLATION

Tahoe-LAFS works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Solaris, *BSD,
and probably most other systems. Start with
"docs/quickstart.rst" [6].


HACKING AND COMMUNITY

Please join us on the mailing list [7]. Patches are gratefully
accepted -- the RoadMap page [8] shows the next improvements
that we plan to make and CREDITS [9] lists the names of people
who've contributed to the project. The Dev page [10] contains
resources for hackers.


SPONSORSHIP

Atlas Networks has contributed several hosted servers for
performance testing. Thank you to Atlas Networks [11] for
their generous and public-spirited support.

And a special thanks to Least Authority Enterprises [12],
which employs several Tahoe-LAFS developers, for their
continued support.

HACK TAHOE-LAFS!

If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that we feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirts with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [13].


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is the ninth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely
as a labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the
team of "hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS
possible.
