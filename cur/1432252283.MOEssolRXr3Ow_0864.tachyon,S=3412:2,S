This is not news. The DOS advisories for Guatemala have said essentially one
version or another of "Americans are in danger of being targeted for violent
attack in Guatemala" for literally years. US travelers and residents are
considered soft mugging targets; there's longstanding political hostility; and
there's been intense hostility in more recent years against Americans whom many
Guatemalans believe are exporting Guatemalan children and in some cases,
children's internal organs, in organized orphan-trafficking to foreign
countries. Not a new warning by any means.
