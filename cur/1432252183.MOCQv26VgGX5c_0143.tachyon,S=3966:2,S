Well, this simplifies things, as it should for an Encyclopedia entry, but it 
doesn't explain the "Peking" 'transliteration'. As I said before, there is 
no sound "king" in Mandarin. And indeed, "jing" means capital in Mandarin. 
So what this paragraph refers to as "Peking" was always pronounced by 
Chinese as "Beijing" to each other. The British, however, introduced the 
pronunciation "Peking" for some reason. (I may have the history in one of my 
books which I'll peruse tonight.)

(For the knowledgeable, it might be argued that the pronunciation 'Peking' 
has Manchurian roots, because the Mings were Manchus. But this is not the 
case. For one, by the 20th century, the Beijing Court had completely 
forgotton how to speak Manchu (only a few dozen people still speak it 
today). For two, Manchu is not a Chinese dialect, but derived by one of the 
trans-siberian groups. So it would not share the "Bei" sound indicating 
"northern".)
