STRASBOURG: A WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS Jul 26 2002
Bordercamp Grows Despite Ban on Protests

All actions and demonstrations relating to the bordercamp in Strasbourg 
were declared illegal on Wednesday, July 24. That day, a demonstration for 
freedom of movement was attacked with pepper spray, baton charges and tear 
gas, with more than ten arrests and multiple injured protestors. The ban of 
assembly was enforced on July 25 when media activists from the Publix 
Theatre Caravan and Indymedia were removed from the Strasbourg city center. 
Demonstrations have continued despite the ban, however, with prison 
solidarity actions and street theater.
This camp initiated by the NoBorder network, and organized by activists 
from across Europe. It opened on July 19, and has included demonstrations, 
workshops, and discussions around the central demand of 'Freedom of 
Movement and Settlement' for all persons. The camp's goal is to bring 
together activists, migrants and artists from across Europe in a laboratory 
of creative resistance and civil disobedience.
