Oh I know, I don't doubt it for a minute; I was just being difficult...
As I said in another post, for the vast majority of people, there's no getting
away from nature. Schopenhauer said it better than I could long ago in "World
as Will and Representation"-- here's a link to his essay "The Metaphysics of
the Love of the Sexes":
 
http://www.concentric.net/~Wkiernan/text/Schopenhauer_Love_of_the_sexes.html

Quite entertaining--lots to quarrel with but lots of good sense; one of the
most intellectually honest philosophers I've ever come across. Here are some
short general quotes to spur some interest...

"To marry is to halve your rights and double your duties."
 
"The greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of
happiness." 

"Faith and knowledge are related as the two scales of a balance; when the one
goes up, the other goes down."

"It is with trifles and when he is off guard that a man best reveals his
character." 

"Every nation ridicules other nations-- and all are right." 

"Buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the time to read them
in: but as a rule the purchase of books is mistaken for the appropriation of
their contents." 

"Intellect is invisible to the man who has none." 

"What people commonly call fate is mostly their own stupidity."
 
"He who does not enjoy solitude will not love freedom." 

"Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains
people as to how they shall think."
 
"Everyone takes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the world." 

"All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is
violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident." 

"The discovery of truth is prevented more effectively not by the false
appearance of things present and which mislead into error, not directly
by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by preconceived opinion, by
prejudice."

Well, I guess that's enough proselytizing for one post...

:)

Which reminds me, there were some really funny passages in that "Herman Kahn:
Supergenius" biography I put up a link to a few months ago--if someone who
really maxxed out all of the above qualifiers didn't have the slightest trouble
getting laid, there must be hope indeed! LOL
