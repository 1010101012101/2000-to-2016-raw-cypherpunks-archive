Were these arenas *not* subsidized by tax dollars, I'd agree.
However its distressingly common for cities to subsidize 'professional
sport' facilities these days.  I suppose I should have used the more
classic 'scare the horses' (on a public road) line...

The point is, its up to the parents to control their kids' inputs,
not the rest of the world.
