as one who enjoys a significant moderation delay on Full-Disclosure,
 i feel qualified to pontificate on this subject. [0]

per the monthly statistics summarized at
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/ one can easily see how the careful
pruning of noise on this channel has resulted in double digit density
goodness, e.g. Aug 2014 at 89 posts; a new record of brevity and
decorum!

i for one gladly await the day a more properly, more aggressively
moderated full-disclosure reaches single digits and utmost
conciseness. you can do it, Fyodor!

i for one agree with Full-Disclosure's policy that active
monkey-in-the-middle attacks are of zero interest. spectrum hi jinx?
how cross site...
 [ "The Internet Threat Model" finds your privacy not cost effective. sorry! ]

given such undeniable logic, i must fully support the ongoing total
moderation with infinite delay of coderman@gmail.com on the
full-disclosure list.  never again from coderman is too soon!



finally,

regarding other aspects of full-disclosure, i must disclose that i
have nothing further to say on the conspiracy in the information
security industry to assist various intelligence agencies, including
Attrition.org collaboration with NSA TAO [1] and Fyodor's relationship
with GCHQ's HACIENDA scanner [2].
