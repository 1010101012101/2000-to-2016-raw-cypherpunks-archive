To be perfectly clear, archive.org/nationalsecurityarchive is NOT the
national security archive from GWU. It is wholly separate, and omitted the
"internet" from National Security Internet Archive (NSIA) from the
identifier in the URL because of length and because NSIA is too few
letters.

The WWU NSArchive is great and has a lot of stuff mine doesn't, but there's
plenty in NSIA you won't find in the GWU NSArchive, too.

it is exceptionally difficult, short of ordering physical duplicates,

part of this is inherent abuse - any mirror gets serious algorithmic
beatings - akin to HackingTeam mirrors perhaps, not counting the
mindless cloud VM bot walkers, annoying enough.  even the hidden
service only mirrors got offensive proddings. remember, some of
cryptome-opponents are relying on obscurity - thwarted every time some
