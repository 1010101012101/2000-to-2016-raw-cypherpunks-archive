According to the Jim Bell court docket of January 11:

1. Innocent victim Jim (via attorney Robert Leen) has 
made motions:

1a. To suppress (unknown what).
1b. To dismiss the indictment.
1c. To continue the trial date.
1d. To change venue.
1e. To represent himself.

Though AUSA Robb has responded to these motions none
have been ruled on, as far as I can tell.

2. Judge Jack E. Tanner (who replaced J. Kelly
Arnold), has ordered a competency exam of Jim.

3. Jack has denied a Robb motion for Jim's handwriting 
sample until the competency report is submitted.

4. Jack has ordered that disovery materials not be shown
to Jim until further notice from Jack, because, according to 
Robb, Jim stated he intends to publish such materials on the 
Internet. The discovery materials, according to Robb,
contain "voluminous private information and personal 
addresses of various individuals."

There is no indication at that the trial date of January 22, 2001, 
set in December, has changed, though the competency
exam and other proceedings would appear to have 
affected that.
