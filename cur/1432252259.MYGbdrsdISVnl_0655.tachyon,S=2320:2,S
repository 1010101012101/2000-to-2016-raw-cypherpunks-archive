The good people at Wikipedia have started a cryptography subproject, "an
attempt to build a comprehensive and detailed guide to cryptography in
the Wikipedia." The project page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cryptography

features a list of open tasks and things that need cleanup or writing
about. For anyone who has a few minutes to spare, their contributions
would without a doubt be most appreciated.

Cheers,
Ivan
