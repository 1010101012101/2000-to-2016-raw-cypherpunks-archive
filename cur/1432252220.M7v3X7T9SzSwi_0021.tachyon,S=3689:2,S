              FBI bought nearby house to spy on Hanssen

              By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

              WASHINGTON — The FBI secretly bought a house
              near the suburban home of Robert Hanssen just nine
              days after investigators began surveillance of the veteran

              counterintelligence agent now charged with spying for
              Moscow, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The
              Vienna, Va., home, just down the block from Hanssen's,
              was purchased under the name of a single woman, Ann
              Manning, who paid $362,500 in cash, according to local
              property records and the realtor who represented the
              sellers. Attempts to reach Manning were unsuccessful.
              The transaction, first reported on "Dateline NBC," was
              made final on Dec. 21.
