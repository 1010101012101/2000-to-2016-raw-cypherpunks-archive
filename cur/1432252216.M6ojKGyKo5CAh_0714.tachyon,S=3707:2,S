    Bush Links Columbine Massacre to Internet Use
    posted by cicero on Wednesday October 11, @10:25PM
    from the sounds-a-lot-like-joseph-lieberman dept.

    George W. Bush may have bested Al Gore in tonight's presidential
    debate, but it sure wasn't because of the governor's tech-savviness.
    Warned the Texas Republican, in response to a gun-control question:
    "Columbine spoke to a larger issue, and it's really a matter of
    culture. It's a culture that somewhere along the line we begun to
    disrespect life, where a child can walk in and have their heart
    turn dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and
    decide to take somebody else's life." It was undeniably a good,
    mushy, appeal-to-the-softhearted line, but the sheer schmaltziness of
    it is in questionable taste. For instance: Was the Net really to
    blame? Shouldn't even a "compassionate conservative" want to hold
    miscreants responsible for their own actions? And would the guv have
    offered the same warning to millions of Americans if the Columbine
    killers had, say, been regulars at the public library?
