What is called terrorism is just warfare carried on in one of its many 
forms:

-- the terror bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, all designed to 
so terrify the population that they would sue for peace

-- the practice for millennia of "torching a village," usually with 
residents locked inside. Or of piling skulls, or of placing heads on 
pikes, or of "taking ears"

-- the mining of the harbor of Managua by U.S.G. forces, designed to 
terrify the local population into overthrowing the government they had 
mostly-democratically elected (much more democratic than, say, the 
government of Egypt or Pakistan, etc., none of whose harbors the U.S.G. 
mined)

And so on. Warfare carried on by other means.
