<p>COMPANY PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>Source: Unico, Inc. (OTCBB: UICO)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Unico, Inc. Launches New and Improved Web
Site for Independent News</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b>To be used as a model for improvements to TheLocalTimes</b></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pompton Lakes, NJ - June 18, 2000; Unico's President, Mr. Joe Nicastro, is
pleased to announce the launch of the new web site, <a href="http://www.indynews.com">www.indynews.com</a>,
for its wholly owned subsidiary Independent News. Independent News, a
freely
distributed newspaper in northern New Jersey serving more than 22
communities,
was acquired by Unico as of July 1, 2001. Independent News was established
14
years ago by Joe Nicastro, its current publisher and new President of
Unico,
Inc.</p>
<p>After its acquisition of Independent News, the newspaper has been further
developed and implemented with Unico's other subsidiary TheLocalTimes,
<a href="http://www.thelocaltimes.com">www.thelocaltimes.com</a>.
TheLocalTimes is a complete integrated web solution for the nation's
estimated
15,000 local newspapers, all potential customers of TheLocalTimes.</p>
<p>During the past months, the Independent News' web site has been completely
revamped both technically and with a new and updated design. The site now
has
many more features to enhance value not only for its readers but also for
every
customer of TheLocalTimes. It also benefits advertisers and readers as
Unico
first tests and improves its products in the Independent News' own home
market
before providing the new features to TheLocalTimes.</p>
<p>Unico's chief designer, Mr. Ted Pierson says, <i>&quot;Although the site is
completely new, and many more features are added, doesn't mean we are
satisfied.
It means that the new site is launched and can be used by the public.
Meanwhile,
by listening to our users and by participating in the technical evolution
we
continue to improve the quality and to add more features.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Unico's goal is to make TheLocalTimes the ultimate web solution for the
nation's small and medium-sized newspapers, as many have neither the
technical
resources to maintain a world class web site nor the financial incentive
to do
so.</p>
<p>Unico and TheLocalTimes are changing all that with one keystroke. From now
on, all a newspaper has to do is to sign up for TheLocalTimes service and
Unico
provides a turn-key solution, including an interactive web site
specifically
designed to the individual paper's needs; a complete set of technical
tools
designed by its highly qualified in-house technical staff and outsourced
technical specialists to serve as the ultimate technical solutions on the
web
for the nation's newspapers.</p>
<p><i>&quot;What is even more important,&quot;</i> says Mr. Nicastro <i>&quot;is
that our revenue sharing program is unique as it actually guarantees
increased
revenue for our client newspapers.&quot; Mr. Nicastro continues, &quot;We
have
worked hard to reach the stage where we are today, and the future has
never
looked brighter for Unico.&quot;</i></p>
