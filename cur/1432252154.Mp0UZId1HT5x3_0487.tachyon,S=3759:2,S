Still scary.

Like saying "Socialism is a beautiful idea, but it won't work."

Or, "We should sacrifice ourselves for the herd, but we're not moral 
enough to do the right thing."

These sentiments are perniciously evil.

(I won't launch into a rant on this. Others have said it better over 
the decades and centuries.)

You need to think very carefully about why it is you think that the 
socialist sentiments, and the blather about profits belonging to the 
laborers, are "beautiful" or "compelling." They are not. They are 
flawed for many reasons, and not at all 'beautiful."
