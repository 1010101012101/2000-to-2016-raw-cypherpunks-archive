As I recall, Norweb in the UK offered this service, or talked about
offering it, 3-4 years ago.  The idea was that already having wiring
into homes would give them a major advantage in the market.  Then 
they found that they were having serious problems with EM emissions
as they expanded the service -- I believe that transformers were 
radiating massive amounts of noise, breaking EU regulations -- and,
uhm, they weren't very good as an ISP.  Their accountants did some
calculations and the whole enterprise disappeared.
