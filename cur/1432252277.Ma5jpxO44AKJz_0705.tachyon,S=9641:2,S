I'm sick of people complaining about whois. There is *no* verification of
the authenticity of the whois information. You can lie. You can give
555-1212 as your phone number. You can give post office boxes as your
address. You can get your ISP to register the domain in their name.

If you're going to piss and moan about something, don't it something as
frivilous as whois. Let's look at health care plans, such as Cigna, that
require your SSN to be your member ID number, or something that's more
important than domain names.

Verisign runs .com, .net, and .org? Snort. Actually, each registrar runs
its own whois server. This article isn't even accurate.
