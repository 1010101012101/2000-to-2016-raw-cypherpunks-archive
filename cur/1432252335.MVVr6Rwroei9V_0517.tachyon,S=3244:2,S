Are you dense, or just ignorant?

Consider the broad class of two-way communications, whether for 
information buying and selling, extortion, espionage, arranging contract 
killings, etc. Are these sufficiently "nasty" for you?

Now consider that both the "corner phone booth" and "dropping a letter 
in a public mailbox" are untraceable only in _one_ direction. Two-way 
communication is not untraceable.

If you don't see this, despite years and years of this point being 
explained on this list and in books like those by Ludlow, Levy, Kelly, 
and others, there is no hope for you.

Agent Farr, this feeble attempt to entrap us into giving examples of 
"nasty" applications is puerile. It was all laid out a decade ago.
