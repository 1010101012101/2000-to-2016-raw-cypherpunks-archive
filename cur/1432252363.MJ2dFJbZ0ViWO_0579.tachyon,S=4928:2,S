DEAR FRIEND,
I AM A CITIZEN OF ZAIRE, SON OF THE  LATE FORMER
PRESIDENT OF ZAIRE, PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO. SINCE
THE DEATH OF MY LATE FATHER SOME YEARS AGO I HAVE BEEN
RESIDING IN NIGERIA ON TEMPORARY POLITICAL ASYLUM.  I
AND MY LATE FATHER’S PERSONAL ASSISTANT CAME INTO
NIGERIA WITH A DIPLOMATIC PACKAGED CONSIGNMENT
CONTAINING THE SUM OF $25.000,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
)WHICH I GOT FROM PART OF THE MONEY MY LATE FATHER
MADE THROUGH DIAMOND SALES WHEN HE WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF ZAIRE FOR ABOUT 32 YEARS. DUE TO ATTEMPTS TO GET ME
ELIMINATED BY MY FATHER’S SUCCESSOR, A FEW MONTHS
LATER, MY FATHER’S PERSONAL ASSISTANT MADE ATTEMPT TO RUN
WITH THE CONSIGNMENT THROUGH THE HELP OF A SECURITY
FIRM. BUT SINCE HE DOES NOT HAVE THE CODE AND SECRET
INFORMATION REQUIRED TO CLEAR THE FUNDS FROM THE
SECURITY COMPANY IN WHOSE CUSTODY THE FUNDS ARE KEPT,HIS PLAN WAS FUSTRATED.
DUE TO THAT, I HAD FEARS THAT IF I RELEASE THE
INFORMATION TO HIM, HE COULD ESCAPE TO AN UNKNOWN
PLACE WITH THE FUNDS, AND THE FACT THAT  I DO NOT WANT
TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ANY PART OF AFRICA DUE TO THE
CONSTANT POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN THE CONTINENT, I AM
SOLICITING FOR YOUR HONEST AND DEDICATED ASSISTANCE IN
HELPING ME GET THIS FUNDS CLAIMED. YOU WILL REPRESENT
ME AT THE SECURITY COMPANY AS MY PARTNER WITH AN
AUTHORITY LETTER AND SECRET INFORMATION WHICH I WILL
GIVE TO YOU. MY PLAN IS TO USE THIS MONEY TO INVEST IN
A PROFITABLE BUSINESS IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD APART
FROM AFRICA, ALSO TO PURCHASE A RESIDENTIAL
ACCOMMODATION. I WILL COME OVER AND SETTLE THERE WITH
MY FAMILY AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. PLEASE IF YOU
ARE WILLING TO ASSIST ME, DO SEND IN YOUR REPLY
IMMEDIATELY BY THE  ABOVE E-MAIL BASED ON THE
FOLLOWING;
1)WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THIS AMOUNT DO YOU INTEND TO CHARGE FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO EXPRESS YOUR MIND, 
2) INCLUDE YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS TO ENHANCE THE CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS. 
I SHALL INFORM YOU THE NEXT LINE OF ACTION AS SOON AS I
RECEIVE YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE. 10% OF THE TOTAL MONEY
WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ALL EXPENSES THAT WILL BE
INCURED IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION. YOUR URGENT
RESPONSE THROUGH MY E-MAIL SHALL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED
AS MY TELEPHONE LINE HAS REMAINED UNDER SERIOUS
MONITORING BY  GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. 

THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS,

FRANK MOBUTU.
