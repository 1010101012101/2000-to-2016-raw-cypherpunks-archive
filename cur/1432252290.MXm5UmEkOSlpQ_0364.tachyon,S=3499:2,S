Well, yeah...there's been a lot of good to come out of the Christian world, 
including the notion of "unalienable human rights".

But it's a worthwhile topic to troll about for a while. If you make a 
calculation of the number of humans made miserable by greater Christendom 
(to use a Kierkegaardian term), it probably dwarfs a similar calculation 
made for other religions, including Stalinism. On the other hand, the 
Christians learned how to make precise-bore gunpowder weapons earlier than 
anyone else, so maybe it's just an historic accident.

However, fundamentalist forms of Christianity seem to be at the heart of a 
lot of this Administration's shenannigans (see that Vanity Fair article on 
Orrin Hatch and you'll be pretty upset...)
