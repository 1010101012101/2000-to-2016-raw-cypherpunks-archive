Irrelevant, Jim has already conceded the point in his parenthetic aside.

Natural rights, at least that's what the framers of the Constitution
believed.

Other than the oddity of Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the like, there is no US
jurisdiction based on civil law, only the English common law.  One might as
well bring up the law of gravity as the civil law in this discussion.

Civil what?  The question makes no sense because it assumes facts not in
evidence.  Civil remedies are under the common law are created by courts not
legislatures.

a) Other than Louisiana, etc., there is no civil law jurisdictions in the
US.  Specifically, the federal courts are based on the common law system

b) The word Jim left out was "Congress" ("CONGRESS shall make no law..."
The common law is a creature of the courts, not legislatures.

The courts.

Not required.  Torts are not enacted by Congress.

Yeah, I think that's safe to say.  :-D
