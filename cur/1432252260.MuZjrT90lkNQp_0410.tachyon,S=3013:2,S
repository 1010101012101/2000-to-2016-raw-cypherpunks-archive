The vaccine has not been proven safe and effective, nor released for use
in the general population.  The military has to take it because they are
ordered to.

I believe it was mentioned that the anthrax currently being mailed is the
"Ames" strain, first discovered in Ames, Iowa, and of interest to
researchers because the vaccine is spectacularly ineffective against it.

It does, however, respond to antibiotics, providing you are diagnosed
before it is too late.

Diseases caused by bacilli are generally nasty.  Leprosy and TB being the
two other well-known examples.
