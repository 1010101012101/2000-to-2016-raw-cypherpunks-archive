No, it wasn't intended as a recommendation of a model to copy, but just as
an example of a distributed communication model that may have some ideas
that we could employ.
Encryption is another aspect again.
I'm a fan of microwave radio, myself, with a communication split into
different layers of the bandwidth, sent at different times, fully encoded.
That's how the South American drug cartels get away with it.
But I don't think that's an option in this scenario. Carrying the masts
around present a problem and make the action somewhat obvious.
