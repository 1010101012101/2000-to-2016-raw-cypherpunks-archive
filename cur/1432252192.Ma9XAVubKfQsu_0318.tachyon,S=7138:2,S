Doesn't seem to be in the Bend telephone directory, but that woulda been a
bit too obvious, huh?

This address is a house in a rather new subdivision in the northern portion
of Bend, Oregon.  Mapquest actually cannot find this address, and when I
look at the actual location (Found with a Pittmon map) the road in question
is not even shown yet.  Below is a URL which can be fed into Mapquest to
retrieve the appropriate (although, admittedly, incomplete) map, pointing to
the approximate, correct address of the house..

This is probably the previous address for the Mueller's.

Hypothetically, these may be the current owners of 20830 Dione,  Bend, but I
am not yet able to confirm this.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the
John Ashe and Mr. Mueller share an employer.

Which may be here.  This is actually in a place called "Sunriver", a rather
high-class community of (mostly?) 2nd homes.  Perhaps Ashe used to live
here:  Maybe he was transferred in from whereever, until Mueller moved,
leaving room at the Dione address for Ashe.  Just a thought.

I'm curious about who really owns these properties.
