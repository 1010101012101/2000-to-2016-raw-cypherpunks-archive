Manually, using WHOIS and traceroute. This can be done automatically
using GeoIP, but I wanted to be sure in the results (also visited some
hosting sites), and writing a proper program would deviate too much
from the initially intended bquick hackb design.

That's why I insist that everyone should be a relay by default, even
if there are some theoretical issues that weren't worked out yet [1].
Making everyone a relay also results in a healthier users community (I
think I2P is one), and more intrinsic network growth.

Quoting [2] (referenced by fakefake): bTor has been long suspected,
and later confirmed [11,12], to be vulnerable to an attacker who could
observe both the entry and exit point of a connection through an
anonymity network.b

Well, it of course depends on what one calls bunsophisticatedb. E.g.,
if one judges by IACIS email dump [3], then most investigators hardly
understand what they are doing when it comes to unfamiliar
technologies (like Tor). So maybe you need them to be bsophisticatedb,
after all, but my point was that you don't need something exceptional
like involving state security agencies b i.e., FBI + UK Police + DE
Police + a couple of other countries, coordinating via Interpol does
not sound impossible to me. I will also expand on that in a reply to
Roger.
