    Thursday]

EFF team -- here's a copy of the ACLU fact sheet, and advice from the
ACLU's Scott Henson.

Call or visit committee members to oppose this experiment in unproven
technology and privacy violation. Committee members' offices and phone
numbers are listed below.

"Worse, SB 945 would expand DPSs use of this information from drivers
license authentification to any purpose requiring identity
authentification. Other government agencies could do the same thing if
they entered into interagency agreements with DPS."

I'll submit this to Slashdot. Any other press attention would be useful.

Adina

Any and all groups or individuals who are interested in opposing SB 945
requiring DPS to collect biometric information about every Texas driver
should express their opposition not only at the hearing Thursday May 8 at 8
a.m., room E1.020, but if possible should also contact members before and
after the hearing to express their opposition.

Because we 'missed' opposing this bill in the Senate, we need to gin up as
much public opposition to this thing as possible, ASAP. Any media work or
other outside game stuff folks want to do is appropriate and would be
appreciated. So call out the troops on this one to the extent you can. Find
attached a fact sheet I'm turning into an ACLU action alert.

Here's the committee members in Defense Affairs:

 Corte, Frank (R) - CHAIR 4N.06, 463-0646
 Campbell, Scott (R) - VICE CHAIR E2.820, 463-0331
 Berman, Leo (R) - CBO E2.908, 463-0584
 Delisi, Dianne White (R) GW.16, 463-0630
 Seaman, Gene (R) E2.406, 463-0672
 Mabry, John (D) E2.416, 463-0135
 Merritt, Tommy (R) E1.302, 463-0750
 Moreno, Paul (D) 1W.09, 463-0638
 Noriega, Rick (D) E2.718, 463-0732


Thanks,
Scott
