The fourth failure turned out not to be a cable cut,
just some kind of equipment power problem.

Certainly once the third cut happened,
things look pretty suspicious even if they don't turn out deserve it.
And there are different kinds of terrorists out there -
the ones that wear government uniforms (or wear cheap suits
but work for governments) don't always take the credit themselves.

Satellites have very limited bandwidth compared to fiber.
They may be ok for countries that don't have useful infrastructure,
like Iraq, Afghanistan, and most of Africa,
but they don't begin to replace the internet or private network connectivity
that was on the fiber systems that were cut;
I don't know how big the fourth cable was.
