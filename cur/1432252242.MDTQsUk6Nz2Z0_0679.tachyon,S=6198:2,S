USA: PROTESTING THE BUSH REGIME Aug 24 2002
Dissent Flares Against Bush on the West Coast

'Commander-in-thief' George Bush's visit to the West Coast of the United 
States this week was met with protests at every stop. In Oregon, Bush's 
purpose was to spread lies about forest health [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ] and shake 
down local wealthy to raise money for Senator Gordon Smith. One hundred 
protesters met Bush in Medford, and briefly blocked a road 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ]. 
In Portland, forest activists kick-started the day of dissent by erecting a 
tree-sit in a downtown park. Hundreds of people gathered at a Pacific Green 
Party rally and then joined the main crowd at the tree-sit park for a march 
downtown, 3000 strong. Hundreds of police, including many in full riot 
gear, staked out a nine square block area around the Hilton Hotel where 
Bush was speaking. Protesters had free reign throughout the rest of 
downtown where they took the streets, blocked intersections, and made a 
joyful noise.
In the late afternoon, police declared a state of emergency, and threatened 
to arrest anyone who did not disperse, though these annoucements were heard 
by very few people. Police then turned violent, shooting people with rubber 
bullets and pepper-spraying many others [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 
]. Children were among the victims of chemical attacks, including a 10 
month old baby [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ]. When the sun set people danced in the 
street and continued to protest. The general feeling among participants was 
that it had been a great day that offered some lessons for future efforts. 
Corporate media accounts of the day betrayed an institutional bias against 
democratic action and in favor of police brutality [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 
| 7 | 8 ]. Friday morning, the chair of the Portland chapter of the 
National Lawyers Guild called for the police chief's resignation, and that 
afternoon protesters marched on City Hall to demand police accountability.

On Friday, Bush was given a California welcome with protests inside and 
outside his first campaign stop for political friends in Stockton [ photos 
| video ]. Medea Benjamin gained entry to the event and took off her jacket 
to reveal a "No War On Iraq" tee-shirt. She was hauled off by police 
immediately, but not before Bush's televised speech was disrupted [ 1 | 2 | 
3 ]. Further south that afternoon, 400 people protested Bush's arrival in 
Santa Ana, and another 250 demonstrated outside a fundraiser in Dana Point, 
Orange County. In Los Angeles on Saturday morning, 7:00 a.m. wasn't too 
early for hundreds to come out and express dissent [ 1 | 2 | 3 ], while 
hundreds of vehicles caravaned to Crawford, TX.
Other recent actions against the Bush regime in the U.S. include protests 
at a 7/11 Bush visit in Minneapolis [ 1 | 2 ], a 7/18 Bush visit near 
Detroit, a 7/25 Bush trip to Greensboro, NC, Cheney visits to San Francisco 
(8/7) [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 ] and Minneapolis (8/12) [ 1 ], and a 8/14 
Bush trip to Milwaukee [ 1 | 2 ].
