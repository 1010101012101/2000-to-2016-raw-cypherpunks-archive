Makes more sense when you realize that the UK and US governments are
essentially one and the same. When governments talk about sovereignty, they
don't mean independence from other governments or from international
bodies; what they really mean is independence from any competing
ideologies. There is no substantive difference between the ideologies of
the US and UK governments.
