Ammonium Nitrate found in Singapore.Shrub chokes on a Preztel.The US has 
about 6000 yankee snakes in Singapore,
Massive investments in the Police State.Shares Spy satellite traffic,nearly 
all that comes out of OZ.
A target rich environment.It would be much better to provide Al Qaida with 
APster tools than let them create east African type bloody outrage.When it 
comes out that the US rogue Terror state knew how to prevent terror bomb 
outrage's and did
nothing...Collapse of Govts will be the least of their worries.

. "Hirstory has also shown that in the ensuing chaos between the fall of 
the old and the start of the new order, there is a great danger of a cult 
leader taking control of the revolutionary spirit in order to set himself 
up as the new dictator. The few times this has not happened, there has been 
great international efforts made to crush the Revolution before it sets an 
example the rest of the world could follow. These are both dangers that 
need to be considered during the development of the revolution."
