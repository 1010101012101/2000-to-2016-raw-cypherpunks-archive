Spammers will start hijacking authenticated servers.

The solution is to automatically classify messages according to user
preference. Good software to do this is already in mainstream MUAs, and
even better software to do it is open source (google for "weka machine
learning" as an example). Someday (hopefully soon), MUAs will be able to
automatically classify messages into more than two categories. There is
already phenomenal software (reeltwo.com; commercial but based on Weka)
to do this very quickly and accurately.
