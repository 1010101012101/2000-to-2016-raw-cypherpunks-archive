  Subject: The Real ID Act: MIT Online Forum Has Begun - Please Register if
   You Have Not Already Done So

  This note is to inform you that the online forum will officially convene
  today at 3pm Eastern Time, September 19, 2005. The discussion
  facilitators are all scheduled to post their initial statements by that
  time. In the meantime, you are invited to join the emerging discussion at:

  http://civics.typepad.com/realid/

  Again, the main site for this initiative is http://ecitizen.mit.edu, and
  you can register at this address

  We encourage you to comment on as many topics associated with each
  discussion track as interest you. Please also consider commenting on the
  comments of others. The facilitator for each discussion track will, from
  time to time, jump in the dialog to keep it moving, answer questions (if
  appropriate) or throw out additional aspects of the topic for
  consideration. We have chosen to use a commercial web log provider as
  the host for this event, in part as a test of the tool as we evaluate a
  platform for future online discussions. Please feel free to use the
  built in blog features, such as tracking back to any blog entries you
  may have and syndication. To participate in the discussion, simply click
  the "comment" button associated with the topic you would like to join in
  with.

  The initial discussion tracks will be as follows:

  Facilitated Discussion Track: The Interest in Homeland Security

  This track is facilitated by Colleen Gilbert, Executive Director of the
  Coalition for a Secure Driver License. This discussion track of the MIT
  Real ID online forum is focused on the assertion that a secure driver
  license is needed for reasons of national security, especially as an
  anti-terrorism measure. In addition, the scope of this track includes
  assertions that the Real ID Act can help combat common frauds and crimes
  such as identity theft, by creating a more reliable state issued
  identity system that is easily linked at the national level.

  Facilitated Discussion Track: The Interest in Privacy and Civil Liberties

  This track is facilitated by Lee Tien, Senior Staff Attorney for the
  Electronic Frontier Foundation. This discussion track of the MIT Real ID
  online forum is focused on the assertion that the Real ID Act of 2005
  represents a National ID Card that will result in violation of the
  privacy rights and other civil liberties of Americans and others who are
  lawfully in the jurisdiction of the U.S. In addition, other
  constitutional issues related to this exercise of federal authority in
  an arena traditionally controlled by the states is in the scope of this
  discussion.

  Facilitated Discussion Track: Practical State Governmental and DMV Issues

  This track is jointly facilitated by David Lewis, Former CIO,
  Massachusetts and Chairman of American Association of Motor Vehicle
  Administrators Committee that implemented the National Commercial Driver
  License and by Barry Goleman. This discussion track of the MIT Real ID
  online forum is focused on the assertion that the Real ID Act of 2005
  has important, and perhaps unforeseen, implications at the practical
  level for state governments who are required to comply with the
  provisions of this statute. How would the cards and underlying data
  systems and business practices be implemented in a way that is
  effective, efficient, compliant with federal deadlines and other
  requirements and within the available budget and other resource
  constraints of the states? Within the scope of this discussion are other
  potential models to look at as examples, such as the existing national
  system for commercial driver licenses, implemented at the state level.
  How the physical and online systems will be architected and built,
  whether or how they will interoperate, the access rights and other
  safeguards and protections that will be present or absent will all be
  factors in the over all discussion of the ramifications of this new
  federal statute.

  Facilitated Discussion Track: Convergence of Physical and Digital
  Identity Related to Real ID

  This track is facilitated by Dan Combs, President of Global Identity
  Solution. This discussion track of the MIT Real ID online forum is
  focused on the assertion that the Real ID Act of 2005, once widely
  implemented, will be an important foundation for the convergence of
  physical identity and digital identity systems. This assertion is based
  on the fact that the Real ID statute requires that each compliant driver
  license be encoded with a particular data model of information and that
  the information be "machine readable". As discussed elsewhere on this
  online discussion, the machine readable aspect of the new nationally
  standard driver license will create a strong market to use these cards
  as part of signing on to all manner of web sites, e-commerce and
  e-government applications. Given that the Real ID card will have linked
  information that will serve as a physical token of identity (like
  current driver licenses and other physical identity cards like an
  employee badge or a passport) as well as a source of digital identity
  for the Internet and other software systems and applications, it can
  represent a widely used "killer app" for converging digital and physical
  identity for access controls, authorization and many other purposes.

  Facilitated Discussion Track: Balancing Interests Going Forward

  This track is facilitated by Professor Michael Froomkin, of the
  University of Miami School of Law. This discussion track of the MIT Real
  ID online forum is focused on ideas, proposals and dialog around how to
  best balance the competing and apparently conflicting interests
  triggered by the Real ID Act of 2005. Professor Froomkin will use as a
  starting point, his recent article entitled "The Uneasy Case for a
  National ID". Within the scope of this discussion are practical,
  business, technical, legal and policy aspects of the Real ID Act that
  will need to be harmonized acceptably once the provisions of this new
  law go into effect. It is expected that this track will begin mid-week.

  If you log in before 3pm today, it is likely that not all the initial
  statements for each discussion track will yet be posted. Feel free to
  comment on any track that is available when you log in, and please check
  back later today and through the rest of this week to see how the
  conversation develops. As new topics are added or other important
  changes are made, we'll try to send a reminder to you from time to time
  this week to let you know.

  Finally, if you have comments on the software itself, we'd be interested
  to hear them. This is a test of the blog platform provided by typepad,
  which we are evaluating for possible future use. We think it is pretty
  nifty, but your feedback and suggestions will be invaluable as we make
  our final selections.

  Again, thank you for your interest in this important and timely event.
  We look forward to your participation.

  Best regards,
