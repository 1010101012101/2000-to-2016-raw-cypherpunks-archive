I did not intend to advocate use of the service, rather I wanted to
share the news that PayPal had lifted the freeze.  This story caught my
attention because it reminded me of another time when PayPal
mysteriously found itself engaging in economic warfare.

And while I do encourage support for this project---which is distinct
from use, and perhaps for no other reason than PayPal's unintentional
endorsement---my intent was to point out the means to avoid direct
subjection to the written and unwritten policies of the existing corrupt
global financial institutions.

With that said, the critical eyeballs which cypherpunks bring to bear on
projects is invaluable.  However, the reflexive rejection of closed
source projects and the reflexive acceptance of open source projects is
a bit too Manichean for my world view.  There is merit to both
approaches in different contexts.  It's helpful to remember that
information propagates through a channel in non-quantum entangled
systems, so even if it emerges from closed source software or hardware
it can be observed.  Heartbleed established a helpful corollary to Eric
Raymond's belief that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow": you
will never get enough eyeballs because people are lazy and assume that
someone else is doing the work.  Therefore, take as given that all code
sucks, both closed and open source.  Then at least you will not be
surprised when you find out it's almost always true, and you can enjoy
the amplified pleasure of genuine surprise when you encounter projects
that really are solid.

I think it's beautiful to see and support the proliferation of work
occurring to address the new normal of no privacy, both closed and open
source.  The slumbering cypherpunk spirit has awakened.
