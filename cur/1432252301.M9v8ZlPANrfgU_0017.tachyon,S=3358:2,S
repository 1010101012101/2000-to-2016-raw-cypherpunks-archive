There is a web site at http://www.sexyfun.net which gives some 
information on this virus.  Apparently the domain name sexyfun.net 
was registered after the virus spread in an attempt to help people.  
The owner of the domain appears to be located in North Carolina.

Once the virus inflects a system it sends out messages to everyone 
in the address book.  This virus manages to remove all indication of 
the sender except the IP address being used by the sender.  At this 
point the sender is a victim and abusing them is of little value other 
then they were so foolish to actually run the application when they 
received it.

An easy way to check if you are infected is to drop to a MS-DOS 
prompt and check for files with an extension of "vbs" in the windows 
and windows/system directories.  The www.sexyfun.net web site 
has lots of information and links to all the major anti-virus maker's 
web sites.
