think I 'get it.'  I stopped working for DoD contractors about
15 years ago, when the last of the jobs in my field that did not
contribute directly to mass murder went away.  Poverty sucks, but
not as much as the alternative.

He's a favorite of mine, since way before 'Conspiracy Theory'
propaganda shops made him a major, recurrent theme in their
bullshit mythology.  The suppression of Broadcast Power is a cool
story, but:  How come the same people who believe that cell phones
and WiFi routers cause cancer, demand the right to walk around
24/7 inside an RF field dense enough to run heavy machinery?  And
where do they think the /huge/ amount of energy to run such an
inherently inefficient, waste-friendly distribution system will
come from?  Alas, the True Believers' passion is real and
justified, but they have grossly misplaced their trust...

When I say that the failure of State and Corporate institutions as
we know them is inherent in the design of State and Corporate
institutions, it all sounds neat and pretty:  Just a worked-out
maths problem.  But I am well aware that this means a human
population crash and all the ugliness that goes with it is on the
way.  As far as I can tell no power in Heaven or Earth can prevent
it.  Mitigating the damage to present and future generations
appears to be the only game left in town.
