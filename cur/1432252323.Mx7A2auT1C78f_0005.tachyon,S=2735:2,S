Unless you run a remailer yourself. 

The fact that I use anonymous remailers would be hard to deny, if am a
remailer operator. However, if I make my own remailer first in the chain,
an attacker sitting at the second remailer will not be able to tell when I
am using my remailer myself vs. when it is being used by others vs. dummy
cover traffic.
