All over the (info) shop,a hellishly long thread re anarchist federation.

"...Up to now, all anarchist strategies have failed if we are determining 
their success as achieving an anarchist social revolution that completely 
wipes out the state and capitalism forever across the globe..."

Target American interests and extort, kidnap and murder American 
citizens,please.
