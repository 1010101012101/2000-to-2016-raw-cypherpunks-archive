I spent a little bit of time studying this approach.  I know Rivest is
dismissing it, but from a computational perspective it's more efficient in
terms of clock cycles than trying to factor a number using
multiplication/division (at least using the Pentium chip.)  Here is a link
detailing pentium clock cycles for various instructions:
http://orakel.tihlde.org/kurs/3d/download/PENTIUM.TXT
You'll see that the instructions for loading 8-bit values and performing an
XOR, shift and compare is pretty low (<25 clock cycles on paper anyway).
The clock cycles for an average multiplication is in the tens-to-hundreds of
clock cycles.  It's a bit more difficult to calculate the clock cycles for
larger values, but in principle this should engage much fewer clock cycles
than traditional factoring techniques. If this isn't a true crack as Rivest
claims, it's at least a (computationally) faster factoring technique.
Perhaps this is the way to more quickly win the next DES-cracking challenge.
Is my analysis off-base?? I've contacted the amateur mathematician to see if
we can obtain more info.

Yep.  Slashdot has a quote from Ron Rivest on why it is not a break or a
big deal.  (The method works, but it is *slower* than factoring.)
