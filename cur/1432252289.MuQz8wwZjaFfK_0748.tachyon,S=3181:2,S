Argghhhh. Anyone claiming that something "can't be fractal," as 
Choate apparently does in the section you quote, just doesn't 
understand the meaning of fractal.

Or, in Choateworld, "Since all physical things have three spatial 
dimensions, there are no non-integer dimensions, and hence fractals 
cannot exist."

Like Choatian physics, Choatian economics, Choatian law, and Choatian 
history, such crankish ideas are neither useful nor interesting.
