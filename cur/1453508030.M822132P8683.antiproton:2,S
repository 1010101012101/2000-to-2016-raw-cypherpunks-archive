Just a note for those who weren't keeping track back in 'the day' and
think a project's funding source itself affects project outcomes. Abbie
Hoffman got the funding for the Cooper Square Free Store, where
Yippie!'s plans to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National Convention were
hatched, from a YMCA grant for "Youth Services".

If you're a 'revolutionary', you're a dead man on furlough anyway and
the more people use tor, the more cost-prohibitive it becomes for 'da
feds' to stalk them. I consider anti-tor sentiments to intrinsically
play into the hands of [insert evil gubmint name here] intel agencies.

Tor Project raises over $200,000 in attempt to =E2=80=9Cdiversify=E2=80=9D=
 its funding

/Activist group took in about $2.5M in 2014, mostly from US government
sources./

As a result of its recent crowdfunding campaign, the Tor Project
announced
<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/transparency-openness-and-our-2014-fina=
ncials>
Thursday that it had raised over $200,000 from more than 5,000
individuals over nearly two months.

The organization also released its 2014 Form 990
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2696858-2014-TorProject-Combined=
-Form990-PC-Audit-Results.html>,
the financial document that all nonprofits must file with the IRS.

As of 2014, the organization took in about $2.5 million
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2696858-2014-TorProject-Combined=
-Form990-PC-Audit-Results.html#document/p17/a272897> annually,
roughly 75 percent of that coming from grants from
US government institutions such as Radio Free Asia and the State Departme=
nt.

Shari Steele, the new head of the Tor Project, told Ars recently
<http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/01/going-forward-the-tor-project-wa=
nts-to-be-less-reliant-on-us-govt-funding/>
that the organization wants to diversify its funding and, over time,
become less reliant on government sources of income.
