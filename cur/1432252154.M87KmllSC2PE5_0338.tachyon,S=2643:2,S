   macinrack writes to mention a story about a New Hampshire man who was
   [1]arrested for videotaping police on his doorstep, using a fairly
   standard security camera system. He was officially charged with 'two
   felony counts of violating state eavesdropping and wiretap law by
   using an electronic device.' From the article: "The security cameras
   record sound and audio directly to a videocassette recorder inside the
   house, and the Gannons posted warnings about the system, Janet Gannon
   said. On Tuesday night, Michael Gannon brought a videocassette to the
   police department, and asked to speak with someone in 'public
   relations,' his wife said and police reported. Gannon wanted to lodge
   a complaint against Karlis, who had come to the family's house while
   investigating their sons, Janet Gannon said. She said Karlis showed up
   late at night, was rude, and refused to leave when they asked him."
