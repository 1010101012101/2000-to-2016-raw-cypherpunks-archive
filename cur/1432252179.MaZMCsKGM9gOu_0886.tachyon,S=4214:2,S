Yep. The decrepit "community garden" that I can see from my window is
next to a shady area with park benches and picnic tables. That corner
would be pleasant except for the constant homeless presence. In the
spring and the fall, there are guaranteed to be homeless people
sleeping on the benches.  For whatever reason, in the summer they seem
to sleep about 50' downslope toward Rock Creek Park, and in the winter
they must find a warmer downtown grate to sleep on; I don't know.
This despite the fact that the park is supposed to be closed at 10-11
pm or so.

There's also a basketball court in the park, which during the summer
time is a magnet for the youth from the less-gentrified area a few
blocks away. The sound of a basketball bouncing and the assorted
whooping and yelling carries pretty far on a quiet summer night at 2
am. Again, so much for posted closing time.

There's also a soccer field, which because it's raining hard right now
is a muddy swamp that will take a week to drain. Thanks to modern
municipal efficiency, the grass has never been replanted and so it's
mostly dirt, unfit for a real soccer game. And this is just at the
beginning of the summer sports season too, so it'll just get worse.

In the mornings, the park is used as an offleash dog run by local
militant dog owners, with the predictable watch-where-you-step
results. This despite supposedly strict rules against having dogs off
leash in the city. The park is a convenient short cut from people
living on Rep. Gary Condit's old street and walking to the Metro to go
to work in the morning -- which overlaps with Dog Exercise Time. So
dogs inevitably run after and bark at the people trying to get to
work, which normally isn't a big deal, but you have some people who
are really afraid of dogs or you have a small person and a really big
dog, with the inevitable shouting matches and hard feelings arising
between pedestrians and dog owners who can't or won't control their
pets.

I've only seen the police drive by the park once during DET, which
prompted the dog owners to quickly leash their pets and then unleash
them about 10 minutes after the drive by was complete.

Anyway, I suspect these problems are hardly unique to this bit of our
nation's capital. To go back to the community garden discussion point,
yes, who would want to raise veggies in your "plot" when the area is
already spoken for by dogs looking for a place to take a dump, soccer
players stomping through your plants trying to find their ball, and
homeless men looking for a midnight snack?
