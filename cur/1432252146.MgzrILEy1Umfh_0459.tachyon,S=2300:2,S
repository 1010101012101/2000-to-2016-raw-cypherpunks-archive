   drDugan writes "The Washington Post is reporting the next phase of
   American progress authorizing intelligence agencies to spy on
   law-abiding citizens without oversight. Primarily, new legislation
   allows an '[1]intelligence exception' to the [2]privacy act 'allowing
   the FBI and others to share information gathered about U.S. citizens
   with the Pentagon, CIA and other intelligence agencies, as long as the
   data is deemed to be related to foreign intelligence. Backers say the
   measure is needed to strengthen investigations into terrorism or
   weapons of mass destruction.'"
