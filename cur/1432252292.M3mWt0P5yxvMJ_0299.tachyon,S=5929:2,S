It's peculiar enough to warrant further investigation, which according 
to the CDC bulletin is being done. I'd imagine they'd be analyzing soil 
samples from the garden and surrounding neighborhood, tracking down 
where fertilizer, potting soil, mulch, etc. came from, suspicious 
activity in the area, and so on, as well as even more vigilance checking 
pulmonary diseases. In addition to retracing people's movements as 
stated in the MSNBC article.

Coincidences *do* happen, though.
