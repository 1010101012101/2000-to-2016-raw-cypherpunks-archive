REIMBURSEMENT FOR PURCHASE OF SPECTACLES FOR COMPUTER USE
Following discussions over 2000 and 2001 new guidelines have come into 
operation for eyesight screening and optical correction for members who use 
screen-based equipment ("SBE"). Under the new guidelines any member who:
operates SBE for an aggregate of two hours or more, inclusive of rest 
breaks, in any day or shift on a regular basis (more than 3 days per week); 
and / or
has experienced or is experiencing visual discomfort as a result of using 
SBE; and / or
works in critical areas; and / or
may be required to use SBE intensively but not every day
has the option of eyesight screening tests by a qualified Optometrist.
If members want their eyes tested they should advise the Victoria Police 
Force ("the Force") first. They may take the tests:
when they commence in the position which requires the use of SBE; and
every two years thereafter; or
where physical symptoms identified by the employee may indicate that a 
problem may exist.
The Force will reimburse the cost of eyesight screening tests to a maximum 
or $23.40 and reimburse the cost of a full eye examination to a maximum of 
$46.55 if the screening test reveals a problem related to SBE use.
Where the eyesight tests have revealed that an employee has suffered an eye 
problem specifically related to the use of SBE, and the member needs 
corrective eyewear the Force will reimburse members a maximum of $125 for 
the purchase of glasses.
Reimbursement costs are to be reviewed annually.
