Maybe not. But one must tirelessly question inconsistencies. The
amount of harm to Backpage is very indirect, it was a letter to credit
card companies. The EFF however is okay with a letter to a printer -
the web host - to discontinue service. Comparatively, the harm to
wikileaks was far greater than that to Backpage, but the EFF was more
willing to support Backpage with a brief, than to volunteer support to
Wikileaks.

I have no doubt that Glenn Greenwald will never mention this,
afterall, he himself is selective in questioning other public figures.
He'd never question public figures in a meaningful way. And apparently
neither will the EFF.

With ineffective dissidents like these, who needs oppression?
