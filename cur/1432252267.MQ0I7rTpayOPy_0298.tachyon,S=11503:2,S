The Dene Suline of Cold Lake: Reasserting aboriginal title and opposing the 
NATO war machine
On December 12, 2001, the Dene Suline people of Cold Lake, "Alberta, 
kanada", are supposed to vote on an offer from the government to give money 
and land in exchange for Dene territory on which the Primrose Lake Air 
Weapons Range is located. Primrose Lake is a favored NATO playground, where 
they have tested out numerous missiles, bombs, weapons and aircraft that 
are currently being used in the War against Terrorism. The Dene Suline 
have established a camp at the main entrance of the weapons range and are 
opposing the theft of their land to feed the war machine and the oil 
industry. Since their earliest memories, the Dene Suline have lived 
peacefully on the land that is now the Primrose Lake Air Weapons Range. 
Through hunting, fishing, trapping, and food gathering, the Dene Suline 
have sustained themselves as a people in the face of genocide from the 
kanadian government and NATO. The Dene people live from northern kanada, in 
"Alberta, Saskatchwan, Manitoba, and Northwest Territories," down to Black 
Mesa in "Arizona." The U$ and kanadian governments and corporations have 
stolen their land, killed their people and forced the Dene onto 
reservations. Like the Dineh (Navajo) people at Big Mountain, the Dene 
Suline of Cold Lake have faced forced relocation. The first Europeans on 
Dene Suline territory were Hudson Bay Company fur traders and by 1867 a 
treaty, known at Treaty #6, was forced onto the Dene Suline. In 1952, the 
kanadian government, under the pretense of protecting the freedom and 
safety of kanada, stole the land encompassing Primrose Lake Air Weapons, 
land that was garunteed to them in their treaty. When this happened, the 
Dene Suline had a 7 day sit-in at Suckerville, on the shores of Primrose 
Lake, refusing to move until their land was returned. After heavy coercion 
from the government, a deal was made; a 20 year lease of 4,490 sq. miles 
for military use only and after 20 years, it was to be returned or a new 
lease renegotiated with the Dene Suline. Before 1952, a large deposit of 
oil was discovered on their territory and by the early 970s the technology 
had been developed to extract that oil. Since that time, the oil companies, 
primarily Alberta Energy Corporation, have been raping the earth in Dene 
Suline territory, taking billions of dollars worth of oil yearly and 
destroying the environment in the process. The voices of opposition from 
the Dene Suline have been ignored by the government and, not surprisingly, 
after 20 years was up, the government still maintained control over 
Primrose Lake and did not renegotiate the lease. The territory of the Dene 
Suline is being bombed and decimated everyday. Burial grounds, traplines, 
hunting and fishing grounds are destroyed by the greed of the oil industry 
and the bombs of the NATO war machine. Through alcohol, residential 
schools, poverty, and forced assimilation, the government has tried to 
break the culture and strength of the people.
NATO, the War Machine and Native Territory Many other indigenous Nations on 
Turtle Island have seen the effects of the war machine testing on their 
territories. The Western Shoshone people in Newe Segobia, (Nevada), have 
suffered from massive nuclear testing on their territory. Many people have 
contracted cancer and other illnesses and died from nuclear radiation and 
the subsequent destruction of the land and the sustenance it provides for 
their people. Low level flight trainings have shattered the lives of many 
Innu people in North Eastern kanada. Thousands of low level planes fly over 
their territory every year, negatively affecting the environment, the food 
sources and culture of the Innu. For 6 weeks every year at the Primrose 
Lake Air Weapons Range, more than 18 NATO countries use the range for 
"Operation Maple Flag" in which they test new laser and ballistic missiles, 
and depleted uranium bombs. In the 50 years since the Department of 
National Defense stole this land, Primrose Lake has become the second 
largest airforce base in kanada. The Tomahawk Cruise Missile was first 
tested at Primrose Lake, and then used in Iraq, Yugoslavia and now 
Afghanistan. The formation of the U$ and kanada was based upon the 
terrorizing and genocide of Native people. Christian fanatics conquered new 
lands through war, biological warfare (including the the intentional spread 
of small pox), land theft, forced assimilation, deceit, torture, rape, and 
destruction of villages, long houses, gravesites, carvings, totem poles 
etc. The West perfected colonization here on Turtle Island and now 
"Globalization" is its latest offspring with "Operation Enduring Freedom" 
(the War Against Terrorism) as its military arm. The War against Terrorism 
is colonization in the 21st century, as more areas and countries are turned 
into U$/Western military occupied zones and the people are forced to give 
their oil to the hungry western market and assimilate their culture and 
economy into the world capitalist market place. What NATO and kanada has 
done to the Dene Suline and their territory is what they want to do to the 
world. People have been lead to believe the war against terrorism is a war 
for freedom and democracy, to liberate Afghanis and other muslims from 
repressive governments and radical fundamentalists. But the Talibans 
treatment and oppression of women and non-Muslims is no different than the 
kanadian treatment of the Dene Suline and other indigenous people on Turtle 
Island. As "Operation Enduring Freedom" continues, there is only going to 
be more genocide committed against Native people of Turtle Island in the 
name of military testing.
Dene Suline Resistance For the past 6 months the Dene Suline have been 
asserting their aboriginal title and opposing the NATO war machine by 
reoccuppying their traditional territory at Primrose Lake Air Weapons 
Range. On June 3rd, 2001, the Dene Suline blocked the AEC (Alberta Energy 
Corporation) access road and the Weapons Range and established a camp 
there. They are re-asserting their title to their homelands by physically 
being and living on them, and by doing so, implementing the 1997 Delgamuukw 
supreme court decision, which affirms the inherent rights of Native people 
in kanada. The Dene Suline are now faced with a new attempt by the 
government and the Department of National Defense to steal their territory. 
The government has offered $25.5 million and a measly 5,000 acres of land 
in exchange for 4,500 square miles of their territory which encompasses the 
whole weapons range. This works out to a measly $35 an acre. The government 
has been working with the Chief and Council (state sponsored Band Council 
government) in an attempt to fast track this deal past the people. They 
hastily organized only 2 information meetings, one in Cold Lake and one in 
Edmonton, but in both places they were met with heavy opposition from the 
people. The government and the Chief and Council have been trying to 
cover-up this deal and silence media attention. The Chief and Council have 
enacted Indian Act voting regulations to make the voting age 21 (it9s 
normally 18), so as to exclude opposition from the youth. The Dene Suline 
are not giving up or backing down because of this latest tactic by the 
government. 20-30 people are still at the camp regularly (despite bitter 
winter colds) and they recently finished building their first permanent 
cabin and are in the process of building more. The Dene Suline will not let 
this deal through and are trying to stop it even before it comes to vote. 
Dene Suline Warriors are promising direct action against Primrose Lake, the 
government, Alberta Energy Corporation and anyone else in support of this 
deal. The Dene people have survived this long in the face of genocide and 
they will continue to fight to defend their territory against kanada and 
the NATO war machine. "WE need the world to look close at this act of 
aggression. We need human rights and environmental groups as well as the 
peace / anti-war movements to act on their resolutions and defend the 
territories," said Dene Warrior Brian X.
