It runs software that is in Debian, the GNU/Linux operating system. I
know, I've written some of it (eg: tlsdate). They do a good job of
locking things down but it is basically just another distribution of Linux.

This is hilarious.

I would *never* use a laptop that lacks a way to protect all your
traffic (eg: VPN/Tor/SSH tunnel/etc) in a place with serious
surveillance as an at risk person. Not only because the remote systems
will have your exact geographic location and because a lack of anonymity
allows for targeted attacks, but also because the local network is well
known to be seriously hostile!

A persistent backdoor on your Chromebook is not actually impossible. I
have a few ideas for how to make it happen and I've discuss
security/development issues with the ChromeOS team on a nearly daily basis.

Actually, I think you can compare it - one major advantage is that you
can protect your network traffic and compartmentalize your risk with any
Secure Boot enabled Linux distro. You can also do it without secure boot
and it isn't terribly hard as long as you draw arbitrary lines like "the
EFI firmware blobs and hardware are out of scope" which is what happens
with Secure Boot systems anyway.

All the best,
Jake
