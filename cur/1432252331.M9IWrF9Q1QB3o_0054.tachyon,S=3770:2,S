Mexico does not allow _any_ noncitizen to work!

Except for folks of either a) substantial resources, b) connected with a 
U.S. employer. But try visiting a Mexican city and applying for a job at 
a restaurant, bookstore, whatever. This was a plot element in "The 
Treasure of the Sierra Madre," more than 50 years ago, and it remains 
true today. It is also difficult for non-citizens to work in many 
European nations.

It's always hilarious for me to watch Mexicans screaming "Dat be 
racist! " (whoops, wrong language, but same idea) about how the tens of 
millions of illegal Mexicans who were given permanent residency under 
Simpson-Mozzoli were not enough, that the _new_ flood of Mexicans and 
Salvadorans and Guatemalans and..... should be given "amnesty."

Meanwhile, like I said, see how long you live as an illegal alien in 
Mexico or Nicaragua, and see if they will issue a work permit.


The U.S. is fucked up, to be sure, but talking about other countries 
making it easier for foreigners to work is mostly nonsense.
