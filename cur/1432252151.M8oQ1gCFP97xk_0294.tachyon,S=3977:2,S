Interesting.  I didn't know that newsreaders did that.  None of my
newsreaders do, but then I use rn or trn and not the newsreaders built into
browsers, which I assume is what you mean by "most people's".

Yes, if you always download all of a.a.m then there's no way to do
traffic analysis unless your opponent can control your news feed and
selectively delete or modify messages in the newspool, and that's a lot
more work than looking at the download logs.

Not completely- it wouldn't work for people with newsreaders like trn which
don't always grab everything from the subscribed newsfroups.
Simple to fix, but something to be aware of.
