They still have to purchase their bandwidth from the major players, 
especially if the government subsidizes or otherwise rewards those ISPs who 
use the public peering points

FidoNet died because it's slow, cumbersome, and technically inferior - and 
most traffic still flows through the Internet, anyway, particularly for 
things like email. 

> - Purchase and offer 802.11 public access points

Which does absolutely nothing to help the situation. Traffic from access 
point to access point is still through landlines, still controlled by ISPs, 
and still subject to monitoring. The source might be obfuscated, but that's 
not security or privacy - that's just making LEA's work a little harder and 
spend a little more money which they'll take from us, anyway.

Um, what consequences? If they don't cooperate, they get shut down. If they 
do cooperate, they probably get subsidies ("reimbursement"), preference for 
government contracts, etc. The majority of the people on the internet are, 
sadly, no longer mainly geeks; they're sheeple who do as they're told as long 
as they can still watch "Friends" and "Survivor". 

If you want to fix the problem, spread the word on encryption. Hushmail won't 
do it, Mr. Soze; it's a central location and a profit-making business, and if 
you think they won't cooperate with court orders you're dreaming. How would 
you know if it was secure or not? You don't, you have to rely on what they 
tell you.

Use PGP or, better yet, GPG. Teach other people how to do the same. Get 
enough people doing it that it becomes an inconvenience to NOT use 
encryption, then let inertia take over. 

Join a militia, work to keep the militia from being marginalized or turned 
into a "fringe" group. Work the militia in your community by forming legal 
neighborhood watches, taking on the responsibilities of volunteer fire 
departments in rural areas, form search and rescue teams for emergencies. Be 
the first on the scene for every sandbagging effort in flood areas. You're 
doing your job right if the national guard is never needed in your area - 
replace them, co-opt their members if you can. March in parades with clean 
uniforms, happy smiles and big American flags. Do everything you can to keep 
recruitment up and complaints low. Find the local, state, and federal 
politicians you like the most or hate the least and work to help them 
campaign in your area - it never hurts to have official friends. Keep 
educating the people, bless their dear little hearts, on what it means to be 
free - and use local examples. Don't just say "the government might take away 
your right to send encrypted email" - they don't care. Say "you know, the 
government wants to take us away from you. They want to label us the same as 
they labelled those idiots in Waco and Montana. Who would protect you then?" 
It's all about PR.
