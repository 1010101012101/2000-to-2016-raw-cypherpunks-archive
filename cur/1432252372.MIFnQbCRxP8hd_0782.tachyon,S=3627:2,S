See Isreal...some guy got within 2 hours of an El Al(?) flight
except he blew himself up...All those big tanks and machine guns
doesn't seem to slow those bombers down....keep wishing on that star.

Think it through Peter, if you can.

These people aren't afraid to die. If they knew everyone on the plane was
armed they'd get in various place, throw smoke grenades, and then fire a
couple of rounds and duck, all the trigger happy cowboys would blow each
other away in the confusion.
