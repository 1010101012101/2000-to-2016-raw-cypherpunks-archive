Featured artist: "Coppertree"
http://url.intevo.com/U1-3001-1-1-10-528151-A60480

Coppertree has been steadily gaining fans and accolades all over 
New England with their debut release "Change". Now with their 
new release "Left of Somewhere", the radio-friendly anthem 
makers are being touted as the next big thing to emerge from the 
hotbed known as the Merrimack Valley. Since their 1997 debut, 
Coppertree has carved a niche for themselves as not only one of 
the catchiest bands in the Boston scene, but also as one of the 
most dynamic, as anybody who's caught one of their explosive 
performances can attest. Check out Coppertree's hot single 
"Image Makers" in the Crescendo 5 showcase!
