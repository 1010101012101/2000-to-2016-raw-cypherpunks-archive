Thuraya Profits From Satphone Stampede

This year's war on terrorism has proved to be a good thing for the Thuraya 
satphone, with everyone from journalists to warlords buying the phones in 
Afghanistan. Savanna International Telecommunication, which is selling the 
phones and service, says it isn't asking any questions; rather, it is just 
taking in the money. During the past five days, the carrier says it has 
sold more than 120 sets, and people continue to stand in line for the $700 
handsets. Savanna says its phones can't be monitored, but others are 
skeptical of this claim. Reported by The Gulf News.
