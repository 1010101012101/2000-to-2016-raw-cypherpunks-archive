	As a lawyer (and I strongly suspect based on your writing here over the years that you're not this kind of lawyer) if someone came to you wanting to sue the NYPD over whatever the legalese is for "false imprisonment" and had documents to prove that they'd been arrested for wearing purple oxfords on blue flue tuesday, would you buy a new BMW or a Mercedes?

	I was trying to stay away from "terms of art" where possible, since while I know what the english words "reasonable suspicion" mean, I know they are also used in a lot of cop and lawyer shows, as well as by cops and lawyers, therefore they are overloaded terms and not always in scope.

	I am seriously thinking about Law School, and several times during this "conversation" I have made it clear that (1) I am not a lawyer. (2) I am not speaking from a position of educated authority. I am speaking from *my* reading of the Constitution and discussions with lawyers and Cops, as well as other stuff I've read and thought about over the years. I've made it evident that I do not believe this is the way things *are*, but rather what *I* believe would work better.

	In any interaction between the long arm of the law and the citizenry, there is the how, and the why. You are talking about how the police interact with the citizenry, which is mostly 4th (search, seizure, cause for warrants etc), 5th (due process, double jeopardy), 6th (speedy public trial etc). These all come into effect (usually) after there is suspicion that a crime has been committed (absent "fishing expeditions").

	We were talking about the why of the interaction, whether LEOs should decide for themselves what laws were constitutional and should be enforced.

	Within the constraints of the discussion, yes. 

	There are constitutional questions in law enforcement about the  4th, 5th, and 6th, but these are procedural issues, and procedural laws. 

	I see many laws that are questionable under the 1st and 2nd (via the 14th) but I see few laws that can be violated outside the court system that are questionable under the 4th, 5th, and 6th. 

	To my limited knowledge there has been very few cases (I've heard of one, but I admit to not having done the research) dealing with the 3rd, the 7th deals with Civil courts (although the 20 dollar limit is probably a little low these days), the 8th is only in effect after you've been arrested.

	The 9th and 10th do not enumerate specific rights, only state that there are rights not listed, and that those belong to the states and the people. 

	State constitutions are another matter, and I'll admit that until I wrote this sentence I hadn't even been thinking about them. 

	So yeah, in the context of whether LEOs should decide for themselves which laws are constitutional, and hence enforceable, it's really only the 1st and 2nd that cause most of the questions.

	Really? You mean *that's* why I couldn't find a gun store in Chicago the whole 7 years I lived there? 

	And it was the early 80s during the Byrne administration that new firearms registrations were halted (although rumor had it that if you knew the right people, or had a good enough reason you could still get one registered. Of course, that is normal for Chicago). Registration started in 1968, the law stoping registration apparently came into effect in 1982. http://user.mc.net/~chevelle/handgunbans.htm
