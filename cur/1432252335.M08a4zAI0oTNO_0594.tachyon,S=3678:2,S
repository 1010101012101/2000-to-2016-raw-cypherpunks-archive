Those terrorists origins that have been reported so far come
from parts of the arab world that are very far away from
Israel -- and also far away from the oil.

No the US government did not, though it surely would have had
he showed any concern about Afghanistan earlier.  Bin Laden
was entirely untroubled by godless communists conquering,
ruling, and terrorizing a muslim country.   Bin Laden and the
Taliban showed their faces long after the real holy warriors,
people who do not make holy war on women and children, had
sent the commies packing.

Bin Laden hates freedom, the freedom which leads to the US
culturally dominating the middle east.  He does not worry
much about foreign military domination.  The Soviet Union was
a mere military threat, which did not endanger the souls of
muslims, only their freedom and property.
