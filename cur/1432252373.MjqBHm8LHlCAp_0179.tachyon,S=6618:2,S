Excellent question.

It is conceivable that a state can legitimately define some terms of
commerce
so as to prevent *fraud*.  (Congress may do so for interstate trade.)
Eg, plant and chemical names, weights and measures, etc.

If some physical object has proved side nonobvious effects, its
conceivable that the state
can compel that speech.   Note that these are physical objects, not
bits, and
its to prevent fraud in commerce that enables state action.

When the state wants to insert speech into other's *conversations*,
someone
needs to read the BoR.

And note:

In a free nation, folks would be able to decide who
endorses products, including foods and drugs.   If the kosher council
required some kind of warning ("Do not smoke this product with diary
products")
then you would have to follow their rules if you wanted to use their
logo.

Any federal rating or private Consumer Reports organization
would simply be a competitor in the field of reputations.
