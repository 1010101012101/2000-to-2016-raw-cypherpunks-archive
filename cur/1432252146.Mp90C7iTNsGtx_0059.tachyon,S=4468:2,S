TERRORISTS are using online war games like Call of Duty to plot attacks, The
Sun can reveal.

Islamic extremists know cops monitor phone calls, emails and online messages.

So they are turning to PlayStation and Xbox games to keep their deadly plans
secret.

Gamers can log on in groups to play against each other and b crucially b to
chat in private.

Once signed in to a "lobby" using a password, plotters put on Bluetooth
headsets and speak securely to conspirators on the same site.

Other shoot-'em-up games suspected of being targeted by terrorists are
thought to be Medal of Honour and the Halo series.

Realistic ... war games

Last night, a source said: "It's a terrifying reality. These people waste no
time finding a secure method of chatting.

"They are logging into group games over the internet and discussing terror
plots. Security people know about it.

"For millions who love these games this will be a huge shock.

"To think fanatics use them for their own ends is a real worry." Sources say
plotters choose realistic conflict games so they can mask their deadly
discussions as harmless web chat.

Call Of Duty

Online craze ... 40 million people play Call Of Duty on the net

There has even been evidence would-be jihadists treat war games as training
tools, a bit like a pilot might use a flight simulator.

News of the growing threat comes five years after the CIA first warned of the
menace.

But with the soaring popularity of the games, there are now fears they are
being used by increasing numbers of criminals and terrorists.

Last night government sources said police and spy chiefs were already
responding to the threat.

A security expert revealed: "Those who fight crime and terrorism keep up to
date with technological changes."

Call Of Duty MW3

Best-seller ... Call Of Duty MW3 made B#250m in 24 hours

The terrorists choose incredibly realistic "first person games" where the
controller works through a complex simulation of war scenarios, carrying out
missions and battling enemy fighters.

Gamers choose different styles of play and missions b from planting bombs to
fighting one-on-one.

Then they enter the lobby and invite their friends to join in.

Call of Duty addicts can even join "clans" b groups who regularly play
together.

The games use a password-protected log-on to keep users' identities secret.
The system was designed so players anywhere on the globe can get together for
harmless fantasy battles.

But security chiefs now fear plotters are set to turn those fantasies into
reality.
