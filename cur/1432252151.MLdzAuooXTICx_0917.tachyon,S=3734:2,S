The application of the principal domestically does not inherently oblige us
to force the acceptance of our views on others.  Rather, it provides a
framework where others who share this view can come here.  If we are
"correct" in our worldview, we will pick up allies.  If we are not, we will
die.  

Unfortunately, the US does not even *pretend* to follow it's own ethics, so
the whole subject is pure theory on a national level :-(
