Didn't know .gov dudes _openly_ post here.

For a discussion, let me make some conjectures about *us.gov.

Conjecture 1. USA is a pyramid, AKA Ponzi scheme
Conjecture 2. USA will die in its present form in at most 5
years (possibly causing troubles to other nations too).
Conjecture 3. USA will be bought by the People's Republic 
of China (PRC) in at most 5 years (possibly with other
investors). [This already happened to some USA corporations].

Best of luck,
