However, this means that IF you have due process, then a person CAN be
compelled to be a witness against himself, and be deprived of life,
liberty and property.  Hence using truth drugs or torture would be
perfectly constitutional if due process is used, according to the Fifth
Amendment.  As a supporter of the Constitution you are now obligated to
defend to the death those who would torture prisoners, as long as they
first get a judge's approval.
