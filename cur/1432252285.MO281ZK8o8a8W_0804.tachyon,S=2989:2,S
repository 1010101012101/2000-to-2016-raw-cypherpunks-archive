Fat old hogs moseyin' up to the trough : a bid for more corporate
welfare. Tax credits! Let them pay their own way by selling goods and
services. Internet connectivity is not a necessity, it is a luxury and
as such should be financed the old-fashioned way. Woops! scratch that!
The old-fashioned way is raising taxes or deficit spending! 

However good it may sound to get the country wired and give the economy
a boost this seems like a bad way to do it. Want a tax break - do it
across the board.
