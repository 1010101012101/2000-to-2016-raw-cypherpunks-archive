I think this is a great question. I talked to a gentleman from South Africa
last year at Where 2 who claimed to be a GSM expert. He said that GSM can
locate you within something like 3 meters with no GPS support just using
the towers, and that this was built into the GSM spec. He spoke of a case
in South Africa where they located some sort of criminal using the GSM
records.

He said that CDMA on the other hand, cannot locate so precisely.

So, to me, A-GPS was designed to make CDMA users locatable to the same
degree as GSM.

As an aside, does anyone know which type of cell phones are more lethal?

At the risk of asking (another) obvious question, I continue my naove streak
on this listserv



Ive heard very different reports of how accurate cellphone tracking isthe
FAA mandates something like 50% of calls must be traceable to within a range
of 30m but Ive heard some mobile pros say theyve heard of it getting as
good as several feet. Obviously this varies depending on geography (urban,
rural, topography), but does anybody have any idea how the US wireless
carriers stack up? And how does this compare to phones with GPS?
