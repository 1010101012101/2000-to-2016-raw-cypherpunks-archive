Dear Hershel,

New Year is the time to get Omega watch, and the only place to get top notch watches that look and perform exactly like the originals is

We are offering wholesaler prices on all watches during the month of January 2009.

Our Omega watches have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Jacobsen
