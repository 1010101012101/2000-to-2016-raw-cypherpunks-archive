Lemme drag out my soap box...

I have a three point plan for safe nuclear power:

1)  Repeal the industry's blanket immunity from prosecution for
civil liabilities.  If it's so safe, why do the owners need to be
above the law?

2)  Remove the industry's public funding, which presently includes
massive subsidies on many fronts.  If it's such a freakin'
technology miracle, it can pay for itself.

3)  Open source every detail of design, construction, operation,
QA and safety inspection, and decommissioning of nuclear power
plants and their inputs/ouputs (fuel, waste), with publication as
near to realtime as materially possible.  Near-miss and slow-leak
containment breaches due to noncompliance with inspection
schedules need to just go away.

In the United States, compliance with part 1 would end all
investment in, and operation of, nuclear power plants:  No
investor or insurance provider will underwrite a nuclear power
plant's exposure under equally applied tort law.

Compliance with part 2 would disentangle the nuclear power
industry from the nuclear warhead and military reactor industry,
its de facto sponsor and sugar daddy - as well as removing tax
incentives and "free money" awarded by Utilities Commissions.  No
free ride on the public's nickel means no nuclear power industry,
balance-sheet wise.

Part 3, which invokes "many eyeballs" to assure maybe just barely
safe enough for optimists safety, would unleash a massive
shitstorm/clusterfuck of commercial and military secrecy issues,
and require extraordinary budgets for QA compliance and reporting.
 Oops, that too should be enough by itself to shut the industry down
.

Me no rikey nuclear electric power plants.  The Obama
Administration's firmly committed support of the nuclear power
industry reflects an ideological and political-economy mandate to
reduce global carbon emissions while /preserving/ centralized
ownership, control and income from power generation.
Decentralized solutions are non-starters because high-density
power generation means high-density capitalization and income
streams.
