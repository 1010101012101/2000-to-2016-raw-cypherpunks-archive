That's the trouble with all you suburbanites. A three hour drive to the
shop & then all you can get is Metallica & Puff Daddy. Over here in
London there are maybe ten shops in a short lunchbreak's stroll of my
desk where I would be able to buy vast quantities of
non-English-language music. I bet the same is true of New York or Paris.
You guys just need to get back to the big city :-)
