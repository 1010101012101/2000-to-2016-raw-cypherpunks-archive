Actually it makes perfect sense, if you understand how a farm works. The
farmers are competing against the environment, their own limited knowledge
and resources, and time.

Do you seriously want to propose that a chicken craps a combine? That the
seeds for the various crop rotations simply drop from the sky like manna?
That it'll always rain just enough, and therefore there won't be a need
for irridation ditches down to the local crick? And what about all that
animal feed? And the wood for the fence posts and the wire for the wire? Now, 
how many people does that one person farm now need to hire in order to get
all the infrastructure and support services running, before we even get
around to feeding ourselves?

A self-sufficient farm is either a very low-tech endeavour (which reduces
your needs) or else it grows according to economy of scales.
