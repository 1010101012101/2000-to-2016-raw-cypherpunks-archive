"The biggest problem before the country's planners under the leadership of 
King Fahd was to strike a balance in the employment of the Internet. KACST 
executives were aware of its need not only in business, finance, education 
and communications, but also culturally. Critics in the past had raised 
questions about the delay in the launching of the Internet, and then the 
close monitoring of websites. What they failed to understand was that a new 
technology could not be just imposed on people before the proper groundwork 
had been done. The users were to be educated on the pros and cons of the 
new technology and a mechanism was to be involved to keep the society away 
from the negative sides of the Internet. Many Western and other developed 
countries are now following what Saudi Arabia understood at the beginning. 
The aim was to strike a balance between technological advancement, culture 
and religion and today none of the three components undermine any of the 
others.
During a symposium on the Internet in Dammam, Eastern Province Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry Chairman Khaled Al-Zamil said: "We spare no effort to 
enter the IT world without fear and hesitation, because we have established 
a scientific base which qualifies us to enter such world and gain its 
benefits but at the same time distance ourselves from what causes harm to 
our religion and ourselves."
