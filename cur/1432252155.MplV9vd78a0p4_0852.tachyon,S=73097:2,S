 The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal sua sponte "for the reason =
that no substantial constitutional question exists =0Aherein."  It did not =
file an opinion or explain its conclusions.  Appeal was taken to this Court=
, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 393 U. S. 94 (196).  We reverse.=0ATh=

understood that were =0Aderogatory of Negroes and, in one instance, of Jews=
. [Footnote 1]  Another scene on the same film showed the appellant, in Kla=
n regalia, making a speech.  The speech, in full, was as follows:=0A"This i=
s an organizers' meeting.  We have had quite a few members =0Ahere today wh=
ich are -- we have hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State of Oh=
io.  I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the =0AColumbus, Ohio, Disp=

al Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919.  From 1917 to 1920, identical o=
r quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and =0Atwo territories.  E. =
Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism =0ALegislation in the United Stat=
es 21 (1939).  In 1927, this Court =0Asustained the constitutionality of Ca=
lifornia's Criminal Syndicalism =0AAct, Cal.Penal Code =A7=A7 11400-11402, =
the text of which is quite similar =0Ato that of the laws of Ohio. Whitney =
v. California, 274 U. S. 357 (1927).  The Court upheld the statute on the g=
round that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political an=
d economic change =0Ainvolves such danger to the security of the State that=
 the State may =0Aoutlaw it. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380 (1927).  Bu=
t Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v.=
 United States, 341 U. S. 494, at 341 U. S. 507 (1951).  These later decisi=
ons have fashioned the principle that the =0Aconstitutional guarantees of f=
ree speech and free press do not permit a =0AState to forbid or proscribe a=
dvocacy of the use of force or of law =0Aviolation except where such advoca=
cy is directed to inciting or =0Aproducing imminent lawless action and is l=
ikely to incite or produce =0Asuch action. [Footnote 2]  As we =0APage 395 =
U. S. 448=0Asaid in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 367 U. S. 297-298=
 (1961),=0A"the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral propriety or even=
 =0Amoral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as =
=0Apreparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action."=0A=

 Floyd, 385 U. S. 116, 385 U. S. 134 (1966).  A statute which fails to draw=
 this distinction impermissibly =0Aintrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by=
 the First and Fourteenth =0AAmendments.  It sweeps within its condemnation=
 speech which our =0AConstitution has immunized from governmental control. =
Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U=
. S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931). See also Un=

60 (1964).=0AMeasured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot =
be =0Asustained.  The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty,=
 =0Anecessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing =0Ain=
dustrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display =0Aan=
y book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the =0Acommissio=
n of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the proprie=
ty of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who =0A"voluntarily assemb=
le" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the =0Adoctrines of criminal =
syndicalism."  Neither the indictment nor the =0Atrial judge's instructions=
 to the jury in any way refined the statute's =0Abald definition of the cri=
me =0APage 395 U. S. 449=0Ain terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from=
 incitement to imminent lawless action. [Footnote 3]=0AAccordingly, we are =
here confronted with a statute which, by its own =0Awords and as applied, p=
urports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishme=
nt, assembly with others merely to advocate =0Athe described type of action=
. [Footnote 4]  Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First a=
nd Fourteenth Amendments.  The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, =
supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.=0ARev=
ersed.=0A[Footnote 1]=0AThe significant portions that could be understood w=
ere:=0A"How far is the nigger going to -- yeah."=0A"This is what we are goi=

ote 2]=0AIt was on the theory that the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 670, 18 U.S.C. =
=A7 =0A35, embodied such a principle and that it had been applied only in =
=0Aconformity with it that this Court sustained the Act's =0Aconstitutional=
ity. Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 (1951).  That this was the basi=
s for Dennis was emphasized in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 354 U=
. S. 320-324 (1957), in which the Court overturned convictions for advocacy=
 of the =0Aforcible overthrow of the Government under the Smith Act, becaus=
e the =0Atrial judge's instructions had allowed conviction for mere advocac=
y, =0Aunrelated to its tendency to produce forcible action.=0A[Footnote 3]=
=0AThe first count of the indictment charged that appellant=0A"did unlawful=
ly by word of mouth advocate the necessity, or propriety of crime, violence=
, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of =0Aaccomplishing political=
 reform. . . ."=0AThe second count charged that appellant "did unlawfully v=
oluntarily =0Aassemble with a group or assemblage of persons formed to advo=
cate the =0Adoctrines of criminal syndicalism. . . ."  The trial judge's ch=
arge =0Amerely followed the language of the indictment.  No construction of=
 the =0Astatute by the Ohio courts has brought it within constitutionally =
=0Apermissible limits.  The Ohio Supreme Court has considered the statute =
=0Ain only one previous case, State v. Kassay, 126 Ohio St. 177, 184 N.E. 5=
21 (1932), where the constitutionality of the statute was sustained.=0A[Foo=
tnote 4]=0AStatutes affecting the right of assembly, like those touching on=
 =0Afreedom of speech, must observe the established distinctions between =
=0Amere advocacy and incitement to imminent lawless action, for, as Chief =
=0AJustice Hughes wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, supra, at 299 U. S. 364:  "T=
he right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech a=
nd free press, and is equally fundamental." See also United States v. Cruik=

e I join the opinion of the Court, I desire to enter a caveat.=0AThe "clear=
 and present danger" test was adumbrated by Mr. Justice =0AHolmes in a case=
 arising during World War I -- a war "declared" by the =0ACongress, not by =
the Chief Executive.  The case was Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, =
249 U. S. 52, where the defendant was charged with attempts to cause insubo=
rdination =0Ain the military and obstruction of enlistment.  The pamphlets =
that were =0Adistributed urged resistance to the draft, denounced conscript=
ion, and =0Aimpugned the motives of those backing the war effort.  The Firs=
t =0AAmendment was tendered as a defense.  Mr. Justice Holmes, in rejecting=
 =0Athat defense, said:=0A"The question in every case is whether the words =
used are used in =0Asuch circumstances and are of such a nature as to creat=
e a clear and =0Apresent danger that they will bring about the substantive =
evils that =0ACongress has a right to prevent.  It is a question of proximi=
ty and =0Adegree."=0AFrohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, also authore=
d by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and =0Apunishment for publica=
tion of articles very critical of the war effort =0Ain World War I. Schenck=
 was referred to as a conviction for obstructing security "by words of pers=
uasion." Id. at 249 U. S. 206.  And the conviction in Frohwerk was sustaine=
d because "the circulation of the paper was =0APage 395 U. S. 451=0Ain quar=
ters where a little breath would be enough to kindle a flame." Id. at 249 U=
. S. 209.=0ADebs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211, was the third of the tril=
ogy of the 1918 Term.  Debs was convicted of =0Aspeaking in opposition to t=
he war where his "opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended=
 effect would be to obstruct recruiting." Id. at 249 U. S. 215.=0A"If that =
was intended, and if, in all the circumstances, that would =0Abe its probab=
le effect, it would not be protected by reason of its being part of a gener=
al program and expressions of a general and =0Aconscientious belief."=0AIbi=
d.=0AIn the 1919 Term, the Court applied the Schenck doctrine to affirm the=
 convictions of other dissidents in World War I. Abrams v. United States, 2=
50 U. S. 616, was one instance.  Mr. Justice Holmes, with whom Mr. Justice =
Brandeis concurred, dissented.  While adhering to Schenck, he did not think=
 that, on the facts, a case for overriding the First Amendment had been mad=
e out:=0A"It is only the present danger of immediate evil or an intent to =
=0Abring it about that warrants Congress in setting a limit to the =0Aexpre=
ssion of opinion where private rights are not concerned.  Congress =0Acerta=
inly cannot forbid all effort to change the mind of the country."=0AId. at =
250 U. S. 628.=0AAnother instance was Schaefer v. United States, 251 U. S. =
466, in which Mr. Justice Brandeis, joined by Mr. Justice Holmes, dissented=
.  A third was Pierce v. United States, 252 U. S. 239, in which, again, Mr.=
 Justice Brandeis, joined by Mr. Justice Holmes, dissented.=0AThose, then, =
were the World War I cases that put the gloss of "clear =0Aand present dang=
er" on the First Amendment.  Whether the war power -- =0Athe greatest level=
er of them all -- is adequate to sustain that doctrine is debatable. =0APag=
e 395 U. S. 452=0AThe dissents in Abrams, Schaefer, and Pierce show how eas=
ily "clear and present danger" is manipulated to crush what Brandeis called=
 "[t]he fundamental right of free men to strive for =0Abetter conditions th=
rough new legislation and new institutions" by =0Aargument and discourse (P=
ierce v. United States, supra, at 252 U. S. 273) even in time of war.  Thou=
gh I doubt if the "clear and present danger" =0Atest is congenial to the Fi=

e with the First Amendment in days of =0Apeace.=0AThe Court quite properly =
overrules Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, which involved advocacy of =
ideas which the majority of the Court deemed unsound and dangerous.=0AMr. J=
ustice Holmes, though never formally abandoning the "clear and =0Apresent d=
anger" test, moved closer to the First Amendment ideal when he =0Asaid in d=
issent in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 268 U. S. 673:=0A"Every idea i=

3=0AThe Court, in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, overturned a conviction =
for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lac=
k of evidence of incitement. Id. at 301 U. S. 259-261. And see Hartzel v. U=
nited States, 322 U. S. 680.  In Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 314 =
U. S. 261-263, we approved the "clear and present danger" test in an elabor=
ate dictum =0Athat tightened it and confined it to a narrow category.  But =
in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, we opened wide the door, distort=
ing the "clear and present danger" test beyond recognition. [Footnote 2/1]=
=0AIn that case, the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the =0AMarxis=
t creed a "conspiracy."  The case was submitted to a jury on a =0Acharge th=
at the jury could not convict unless it found that the =0Adefendants "inten=
ded to overthrow the Government as speedily as =0Acircumstances would permi=
t.'" Id. at 341 U. S. 509-511.  The Court sustained convictions under that =
charge, construing it to mean a determination of=0A""whether the gravity of=
 the evil,' discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of fre=

1 U. S. 510, quoting from United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 212.=0AOut=
 of the "clear and present danger" test came other offspring.  =0AAdvocacy =
and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle i=
s immune from prosecution. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 354 U. S.=
 318.  But an "active" member, who has a guilty knowledge and intent of the=
 aim to overthrow the Government =0APage 395 U. S. 454=0Aby violence, Noto =
v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, may be prosecuted. Scales v. United States=
, 367 U. S. 203, 367 U. S. 228. And the power to investigate, backed by the=
 powerful sanction of =0Acontempt, includes the power to determine which of=
 the two categories =0Afits the particular witness. Barenblatt v. United St=
ates, 360 U. S. 109, 360 U. S. 130. And so the investigator roams at will t=
hrough all of the beliefs of =0Athe witness, ransacking his conscience and =
his innermost thoughts.=0AJudge Learned Hand, who wrote for the Court of Ap=
peals in affirming the judgment in Dennis, coined the "not improbable" test=
, 183 F.2d 201, 214, which this Court =0Aadopted and which Judge Hand prefe=
rred over the "clear and present =0Adanger" test.  Indeed, in his book, The=
 Bill of Rights 59 (1958), in =0Areferring to Holmes' creation of the "clea=
r and present danger" test, he said, "I cannot help thinking that, for once=
, Homer nodded."=0AMy own view is quite different.  I see no place in the r=
egime of the =0AFirst Amendment for any "clear and present danger" test, wh=
ether strict =0Aand tight, as some would make it, or free-wheeling, as the =
Court in Dennis rephrased it.=0AWhen one reads the opinions closely and see=
s when and how the "clear =0Aand present danger" test has been applied, gre=
at misgivings are aroused. First, the threats were often loud, but always p=
uny, and made serious =0Aonly by judges so wedded to the status quo that cr=
itical analysis made them nervous.  Second, the test was so twisted and per=
verted in Dennis as to make the trial of those teachers of Marxism an all-o=
ut political =0Atrial which was part and parcel of the cold war that has er=
oded =0Asubstantial parts of the First Amendment.=0AAction is often a metho=
d of expression, and within the protection of the First Amendment.=0ASuppos=

t held in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 391 U. S. 382, that a re=
gistrant under Selective Service who burned his draft card in =0Aprotest of=
 the war in Vietnam could be prosecuted.  The First Amendment =0Awas tender=
ed as a defense and rejected, the Court saying:=0A"The issuance of certific=
ates indicating the registration and =0Aeligibility classification of indiv=
iduals is a legitimate and =0Asubstantial administrative aid in the functio=
ning of this system.  And =0Alegislation to insure the continuing availabil=
ity of issued certificates serves a legitimate and substantial purpose in t=

ien was not prosecuted for not having his draft card =0Aavailable when aske=
d for by a federal agent.  He was indicted, tried, =0Aand convicted for bur=
ning the card.  And this Court's affirmance of that conviction was not, wit=
h all respect, consistent with the First =0AAmendment.=0AThe act of praying=
 often involves body posture and movement, as well =0Aas utterances.  It is=
 nonetheless protected by the Free Exercise Clause. Picketing, as we have s=
aid on numerous occasions, is "free speech =0Aplus." See Bakery Drivers Loc=
al v. Wohl, 315 U. S. 769, 315 U. S. 775 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring); Giboney=
 v. Empire Storage Co., 336 U. S. 490, 336 U. S. 501; Hughes v. Superior Co=

 BLACK, J.); Food Employees v. Logan Plaza, 391 U. S. 308, 391 U. S. 326 (D=
OUGLAS, J., concurring).  That means that it can be regulated when it comes=
 to the "plus" or "action" side of the protest.  It can be =0Aregulated as =
to =0APage 395 U. S. 456=0Athe number of pickets and the place and hours (s=
ee Cox v. Louisiana, supra), because traffic and other community problems w=
ould otherwise suffer.=0ABut none of these considerations is implicated in =
the symbolic protest of the Vietnam war in the burning of a draft card.=0AO=
ne's beliefs have long been thought to be sanctuaries which government coul=
d not invade. Barenblatt is one example of the ease with which that sanctua=
ry can be violated.  =0AThe lines drawn by the Court between the criminal a=
ct of being an =0A"active" Communist and the innocent act of being a nomina=
l or inactive =0ACommunist mark the difference only between deep and abidin=
g belief and =0Acasual or uncertain belief.  But I think that all matters o=
f belief are =0Abeyond the reach of subpoenas or the probings of investigat=
ors.  That is why the invasions of privacy made by investigating committees=
 were =0Anotoriously unconstitutional.  That is the deep-seated fault in th=
e =0Ainfamous loyalty security hearings which, since 1947, when President =
=0ATruman launched them, have processed 20,000,000 men and women.  Those =
=0Ahearings were primarily concerned with one's thoughts, ideas, beliefs, =
=0Aand convictions.  They were the most blatant violations of the First =0A=
Amendment we have ever known.=0AThe line between what is permissible and no=
t subject to control and =0Awhat may be made impermissible and subject to r=
egulation is the line =0Abetween ideas and overt acts.=0AThe example usuall=
y given by those who would punish speech is the case of one who falsely sho=
uts fire in a crowded theatre.=0AThis is, however, a classic case where spe=
ech is brigaded with action. See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 357 U. =
S. 536-537 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).  They are indeed inseparable, and a p=
rosecution can be launched for the overt =0APage 395 U. S. 457=0Aacts actua=
lly caused.  Apart from rare instances of that kind, speech =0Ais, I think,=
 immune from prosecution.  Certainly there is no =0Aconstitutional line bet=
ween advocacy of abstract ideas, as in Yates, and advocacy of political act=
ion, as in Scales. The quality of advocacy turns on the depth of the convic=
