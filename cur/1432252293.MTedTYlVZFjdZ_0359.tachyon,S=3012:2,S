I would tell your reporter friend (?) not to bother wasting his cycles on a
lunatic.  Whether or not he's still spewing his shit (like you I [attempt]
to filter all his crap) is really irrelevent, since he's [by definition] not
capable of spewing an actual "position".  

Do reporters write articles about street people who scream at walls?  So why
write one about a nutcase that somehow stumbled across cypherpunks?  He's
merely found an outlet where the word "kill" doesn't get much of a reaction,
and he likely feels extra-manly using it, so...

How could they *not* be?  The fact that they haven't even bothered to arrest
him says it all - even *they* realize that mattd is just a blathering
psych patient in search of a rubber room.
