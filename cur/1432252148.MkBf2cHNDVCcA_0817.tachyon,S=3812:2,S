As is common in math, they define what they mean in the first paragraph.
To paraphrase, they're considering ways to arrange a large number of
sets of <thing>s so that a minimum number of "blocks" is used to enclose
all of the sets.

I'm not a mathematician but that looks like set theory to me.  It's the
kind of fundamental mathematical research that frequently arises when
considering some more applied problem space.  Such fundamental
approaches frequently have applications in wide-ranging fields; to
compare to a more well-documented example, the "4-color problem" first
solved in the 70s generated techniques which ended up being critical to
optimizing C compiler designs for RISC processors in the 90s.

I doubt that much can be concluded about the activities at the research
site based on their publishing one database in such a rarefied field.
