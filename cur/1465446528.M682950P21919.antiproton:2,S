yeah. and in the meantime, we will treat Appelbaum as if he IS ALREADY
convicted.... as if he IS ALREADY a serial rapist -> and throw him from his
position = reject him from our community, this way showing everybody our
"neutrality/objectivity" (not talking about showing Appelbaum himself, a
respectful member, some kind of "support", before proven otherwise!)

Yeap, lets show one more time that a man can work all his life to build his
reputation and to help the world in so many ways... and some f*ckers can
ruin it in one week, by creating an amateur smear campaign with anonymous
and saaad stories.

Well done, puppets.
