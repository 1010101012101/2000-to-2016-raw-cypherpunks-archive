Not wrong exactly, just completely biased, wrong headed, 
snuffling at the ass of anti-gun Hollywood so it would be 
hailed in the "film" world as a great work. 

Moore says guns are bad. So fucking what. What could Moore
say that would be a suprise? The film is a blow-job for the anti-gun 
crowd. Nothing more. 

Moore makes me laugh, because he does have his moments. I really enjoyed
Rodger and me. He got a little mean sometimes, but so what? But
BfC was a worthless piece of garbage all in all. I'm not a big
fan of The Omega Man either. But that crap Moore pulled at
Hestons house was inexcuseble. He should have had the shit beat 
out of him for that.
