But gold is, at least for this sort of discussion, illiquid. How many gold
coins do you have in your pocket right now? I'll wager asymptotic to nill.

Actually the payment for the fee for the assayist and the mint aren't
likely to come out of the metal they are processing today. Now if we were
talking of a 'frontier' sort of situation then you wouldn't have those
fees going back into circulation, at least not immediately. In that case
the 'cut' would be collected over some suitable period of time and then
sold. Or the assayist could simply take their cut on the upstream broker
payment (this assumes of course they have sufficient liquid capital in
hand).

But these examples, at least from the perspective of the money changer are
dealing with effectively 'unlimited' cash pools to draw from.

Your objections to Adams points don't hold.
