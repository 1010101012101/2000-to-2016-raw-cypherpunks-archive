FindLaw doesn't show anything for 'computer logs'.

Other than destroying them because they are evidence of a crime I am not
aware of anything that might require anyone to keep them. There certainly
wasn't any sort of requirement for folks like myself at the time of the CJ
trial to keep records for any length of time.

The flip side is that if you go around destroying all your logs as they
are made the security of your system comes into question.
