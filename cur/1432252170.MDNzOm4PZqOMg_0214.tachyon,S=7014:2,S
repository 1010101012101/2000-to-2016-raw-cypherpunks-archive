The anti-globalization protests are a good example of something 
misunderstood by Libertarian old-farts. On some levels, these protests have 
a libertarian character...anti-globalization is not really about eliminating 
free trade per se, but eliminating "free trade", which is really just the 
selective and forceful application of free-trade ideas by the US and its 
cronies, in support of the "American Century" or, in other words, the "Iraq 
is better off now then under Saddam" approach to international relations.

The current political clime is slowly being pushed in the vague direction of 
lefitst statism-lite, but only because of a philosophical vaccum and because 
the US has successfully portrayed itself as the embodiment of free-market, 
Lassaiz Faire capitalism.

However, I don't see the strong support for Soviet or Maoist-style state 
control these days...these are vaguely romantic notions once in a while, but 
they don't have any deep ideological support like they might have in the 
60s.
