I don't know, how about traffic analysis? Exploiting (publicly) undisclosed
holes in the remailer software? Exploiting (publicly) undisclosed holes in PGP?
That certainly seems like a fruitful place to dump research money.

Good old-fashioned deception isn't exactly rocket science, either. How about
suckering people into routing traffic through an ever-increasing number of
corrupt nodes, either by: 1) running them covertly 2) buying off "trusted
pillars of the crypto community" and trading on their reputation capital? A
sobering thought.

Or how about this one: enticing people interested in developing cryptography
into an closed system based in Canada (international, so using full-blown 
Echelon technology against it isn't a problem) offering "secure" messaging, file
storage, sharing and transmission etc. while promising them the moon about
being a no-compromise information-haven phuck-the-state all-your-eggs-in-one
- -basket crypto system?

Oh wait, it's called CryptoHeaven. Nevermind. 

Not that I'm claiming the first thing about them--it's just that if I were
trying to come up with a way to gather information on people interested in
developing privacy and cryptography technology, setting up a compromised
CryptoHeaven-like system on behalf of the United States Government would be
IDEAL. Or at the very least,inserting some bad actors into the system to root
up the vulnerabilities couldn't hurt. Not to mention cultivating "trusted
insider" informants.  

At any rate, any company that lays on the "trust us!!" razzamatazz that thick
makes me nervous. The fact that you it gives you zero opportunity for
compartmentalization ought to be a red flag. Bad OPSEC makes for shitty
tradecraft.    

I just can't say this enough: one of the drawbacks of viewing all feds as 
donut-chomping incompetents is that it fosters a false sense of complacency.
Underestimating your adversary never did anyone a bit of good. Something to
think about, anyway.
