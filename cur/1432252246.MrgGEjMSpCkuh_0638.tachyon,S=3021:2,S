Are you sure this is a thesis in philosophy? It seems to talk about the
rather practical concerns of non-repudiation and its converse, plausible
deniability. The paper reminds me of something I was wondering about: are
there any email security programs that offer plausible deniability as an
option? Sometimes you want to MAC a message with an authenticated
symmetric key instead of signing it in order to preserve plausible
deniability, but PGP for example doesn't seem to offer this.
