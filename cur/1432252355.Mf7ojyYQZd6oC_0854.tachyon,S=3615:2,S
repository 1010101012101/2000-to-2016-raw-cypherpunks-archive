I have heard about the existence of this mailing list for years ... yet never found it with search engines.

I never did a positive effort to find it too, let's be honest. It was kind of "one day I may meet that crowd by chance".

One day a few months ago I found a guy that posted in another list I was subscribed and also here. Lo and behold, that's the famed mailing list that cannot be found anywhere where reasonable people would search.

You guys are hidden in the deepwebz, Google doesn't index it, you are the bad bad turrists, lol.
