California passed the Medical Marijuana Initiative (more than once, 
as I recall, as the Fedgov found "technicalities" to strike it down 
the first time it passed).

No "interstate commerce" is involved (*), for most home-grown pot, 
and yet the Fedgov has asserted the claim that federal dietary laws 
take precedence over local dietary laws.

(* As we know, the interstate commerce clause was oriented toward 
making sure that only the Federal government could imposes tariffs on 
goods moving between the states. This was to head off a flurry of 
opportunisitc tariffs imposed by the states. It had _nothing_ to do 
with the notion that if a book publisher, for example, ships books 
across state lines that the Federal government then has some means to 
regulate the content. This seems to be commonly misunderstood; not by 
Cypherpunks, but I'm repeating this just to make sure.)

If these United States were functioning as intended, this and similar 
cases would go to the Supreme Court and the Court would find that the 
states cannot be told what to by the Fedgov in matters like this.

But we have not been functioning as intended for most of the past century.
