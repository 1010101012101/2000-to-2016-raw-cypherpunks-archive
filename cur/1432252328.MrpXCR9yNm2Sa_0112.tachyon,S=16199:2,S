*** NEW AND NOTEWORTHY ***
----------------------------------------
SEC Warns on 'Pre - IPO' Fraud
Federal regulators have detected an increase in fraudulent securities
offerings online and are warning investors to be careful of online
securities sales. Regulators are also warning investors to be wary
of ``pre-IPO'' stock offerings - i.e. opportunities for investors
to get a "jump" on the market before the firms go public. The SEC
has recently charged several offending companies with fraud.
On Thursday, the SEC said it had reached a settlement with Austin,
Texas-based 1stBuy.com Inc., a company that operates an Internet
retail site. Roger D. Pringle, the company's founder and chief
financial officer, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in
agreeing to the settlement of the SEC's allegations, but agreed to
pay a $25,000 fine. Regulators say 1stBuy.com raised $3.8 million
from 1,200 investors nationwide by making false and misleading
statements about an IPO, and by referring to the offering as a
``pre-IPO.''
According to the Associate Press, it was the fourth such action
by the SEC recently. Since March, the SEC has alleged that three
Internet companies, New World Web Vision.com, Y2K Highway Inc. and
Stadtt Media LLC, committed securities fraud by making false claims
about IPOs. All three cases are pending in federal court.

----------------------------------------
*** QUESTION OF THE WEEK***
----------------------------------------

QUESTION: What is a Schedule 13D?

ANSWER:  Schedule 13D is an SEC document that must be filed by any
person or entity acquiring direct or beneficial ownership of at least
5% of any class of a company's outstanding shares. The purchaser must
file Schedule 13D within 10 days of reaching the 5% ownership
threshold, and all subsequent trades must be stated promptly on an
"amended" 13D. The purchaser must also indicate their intention of
ownership - i.e. passive investment or takeover attempt. The
purchaser must also file a 13D with the company itself, and with the
stock exchange on which the shares are listed.

***ON THE INSIDE***
----------------------------------------

TCF Financial Insiders are Sellers

Regional banks have defied a broader rally this year in the financial
services sector. While the financial services sector is ahead 7.7%
through July, according to Standard & Poor's, the average regional
bank stock was down 3.3%.

Not so shares of TCF Financial Corp (TCB). They are up 57% this year,
not including dividends paid in February, May and August. The holding
company for TCF National Bank and TCF National Bank Colorado, which
operates in five upper Midwest states, likewise hiked its quarterly
payout during the period to 21.3 cents a share, from 18.8 cents.

Insiders have shown prescience in the past, selling into strength in
their company's stock just ahead of sometimes-steep declines. Lately,
they've been selling again. In the last two months, five of them have
filed Form 144s with the SEC that indicate the sale of more than
200,000 shares, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Most
recently William A. Cooper, chief executive, reported on Aug. 23
selling 90,000 shares for $32 apiece, or nearly $2.9 million
http://www.edgar-online.com/auth/doctrans/default.asp?doc=B-117264

TCF has prospered in part because it has managed to boost deposits
significantly. In general, says James F. Catudal, manager of Fidelity
Select Financial Services Fund, (FIDSX): "Regional banks are right
now funding loan growth with purchased money. They're not able to
attract low-cost deposits from customers anymore."

That's exactly what TCF has managed to do, however. On Sept. 9, it
announced that its network of branches in supermarkets had topped
$1 billion in deposits, or nearly 10% of the bank's total. TCF is
the fourth-largest operator of bank branches in supermarkets, with
212 of them. In the Chicago area, TCF claims to have the second-highest
number of non-interest bearing retail checking accounts.

Thomson's Paul Elliott says Cooper "last sold shares in November of
last year, ahead of a 35% decline" in the company's stock.

Another prominent seller has been Timothy P. Bailey, president of
the company's Wisconsin operations. He filed Form 144 on July 26
http://www.edgar-online.com/auth/doctrans/default.asp?doc=B-113165
reporting the sale of 4,000 shares for $29.88 per share, or about
$119,500.

A spokeswoman for TFC said, "We do not comment on insider selling
transactions."
