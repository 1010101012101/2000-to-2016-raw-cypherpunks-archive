Is this a fundamental weakness of AP?

Descent into hell for anyone with intense motivation to change the
existing system for the better - just one example being "no journalist
safe from a vengeful William/ Bill Browder" for example:

I agree. I am starting to see absolutely no guarantees of an outcome of
"better".

Sounds correct. Is it possible to remove the emotional "revenge"
element, and surely the extremely wealthy would be most able to act in
accordance with any "emotional revenge" element that they personally
experience, or that they can manipulate the public into experiencing by
the oligarch's control of the media consumed by the masses...

Looks pretty bleak on the face of it..

Also, it "feels" 'unenlightened' - "surely there's a better way" etc

I do not share your optimism on this one.
