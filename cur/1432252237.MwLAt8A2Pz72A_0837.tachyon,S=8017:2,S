Of course there's a frigging distinction. I said that the first time around. 
My problem with your statement is not that you said there was a distinction, 
it was your definition.

Capitalism is not philosophy for the same reason that a dog is not cheese. 
Capitalism is a economic system, a form of commerce, and nothing more. 
Philosophy is a method of looking at the world around you and attempting to 
apply a system of rules to it. You can have a philosophy that includes 
capitalism - either positivly or negatively - but you cannot have capitalism 
*as* a philosophy. That is quite literally like saying having a nice car is 
happiness. It's not. Having a nice car might make you happy, but it is not 
itself happiness. Please go back to third grade and relearn the concept of 
symbolism.

No. "Capitalism" is an economic system. "Democracy" is a form of government, 
one of the classic forms as a matter of fact. "Communism" is both, but it is 
not the same thing - Communist government is essentially a form of pure 
democracy, in that all members of the commune have an equal say in the 
distribution of the resources of the commune, exactly as a pure democracy 
does. Communism as an economic system is a model which posits the 
distribution of resources (output) based purely on need, and the distribution 
of work (input) purely on ability, with relationship defined between input 
and output.

No. I already defined capitalism. You weren't paying attention. Five demerits.

What you have defined is a philosophy, a belief system which incorporates 
capitalism. The important difference is that your philosophy, in an infantile 
way, ascribes motives and emotions to the workings of capitalism. This is 
incorrect.

You mean:

"When all you have is a hammer, all problems start to look like nails."

Your first definition is doublespeak. You just stated that commerce is an 
"economic" exchange of goods and services. Economics are of course a major 
portion of commerce - in fact, if you include in "economics" emotional 
exchanges, it can be said to be equal to commerce. So your statement is 
semantically true, but valueless, since anything is of course equal to 
itself. 

Your second is a limited definition - change "individuals" to "any entity" 
and you have exactly the same definition I gave when I joined the thread, in 
contradiction to your own statement about the definition of commerce and 
capitalism.

You can speak axiomatically, or algorithmically, but you can't do both. 
Axiomatic is philisophical, algorithmic is mathematical. The two are not 
synonymous.

Which is an interesting (if pointless) question, but it's not the original 
question. The original question is whether or not you were giving the correct 
definitions of commerce and capitalism, and of course you were not. 

Raise your hand if you're shocked.
