Weird. I can think of many current adversaries with very simple
motivations I can do very little to nothing about. This assymmetry
will only grow further in future, since the concentration of smarter,
more vulnerable hardware will only get larger, and the delta
between my and their capabilities will only grow wider.

My only protection is that I'm not doing anything which could
draw their (not meaning flatfeet or gumshoes here) attention.
