CCV Exalts in Latest Victory Over Porn

The Citizens for Community Values has put out the following press release: 
Newport, KY - Comfort Suites Hotel, located at 420 Riverboat Row in 
Newport, Campbell County Kentucky, has stopped making adult pay-per-view 
movies available to its guests. The policy change was announced in an 
August 9 letter from Tom Hillman, Director of Operations for 
Louisville-based Musselman Hotels, parent of the Newport Comfort Suites, to 
Justin Verst, Campbell County Attorney. Earlier that month Verst had 
advised the hotel that their hardcore, pornographic movies may be in 
violation of Kentucky's obscenity law.

The news came on the heels of a similar announcement by another 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky hotel, the Cincinnati Marriott Northeast, to 
pull the plug on its adult pay-per-view offerings. The Marriott had been 
advised by Warren County Prosecutor Tim Oliver that pandering hardcore 
pornographic movies may be a violation of Ohio's obscenity law.

CCV President Phil Burress praised Verst for his willingness to enforce 
Kentucky's obscenity law. "Newport has worked hard to erase its former 'sin 
city' image and to raise community standards," Burress said, "and Justin 
Verst has been a large part of that effort. With Comfort Suites out of the 
adult pay-per-view business, Campbell County is now free of businesses 
pandering hardcore pornography."

Kentucky and Ohio are among 45 states with laws prohibiting the pandering 
of hardcore pornography. In addition, a federal law prohibits interstate 
transportation of hardcore pornography, including the Internet.

"No doubt some people will label this action a violation of privacy," said 
Burress. "It's not a matter of violating privacy or of imposing values. It 
is a matter of law. In Stanley vs. Georgia (1969) the U.S. Supreme Court 
made it clear that the First Amendment protects the private use of obscene 
pornography. But in Miller vs. California (1973) the same court also made 
it clear that the sale and distribution of obscene pornography is not 
protected by the First Amendment." Burress continued, "This is not about 
what someone views in the privacy of their home or hotel room. This is 
about selling and distributing obscenity. There are state and federal laws 
against that. And major hotels are not above the law."
Gene sez: My question is when did Kentucky become annexed to Cincinnati and 
why is that state allowing the CCV to dictate policy?
