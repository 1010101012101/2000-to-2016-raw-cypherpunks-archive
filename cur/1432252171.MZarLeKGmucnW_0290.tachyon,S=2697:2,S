But isn't obligatory for all world class cpunks to have
several nyms they post under, and to bad mouth
and obsequy those fictions with exactly the same 
identifiable writing style, shifting one register to the
left then to the right? I have here a list of names
and perfectly intercoggal nyms.

The evidence shows that some of these gearheads 
have been arguing and agreeing with themselves for 
years online and off.

One though, a master of disguise, hides in front of
a true name and never argues, never agrees, only
pristines flawless prose.  A clue: chews ghat, doesn't spit.
