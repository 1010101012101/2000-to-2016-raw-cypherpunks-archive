More on the Isreal spy ring in the USA.

NEWSMAX REPORTS:

The discovery of a major spy ring inside the United States is straining the 
already tense relations with Israel. Although, Israel denied any involvement 
with the penetration of the U.S. wiretap system, the CIA and FBI are 
investigating the direct government ties to the former Israeli military and 
intelligence officials now being held by the Justice Department.

One major drug bust operation planned by the Los Angeles police was foiled 
by what now appear to be reverse wiretaps placed on law enforcement phones 
by the criminal spy ring.
