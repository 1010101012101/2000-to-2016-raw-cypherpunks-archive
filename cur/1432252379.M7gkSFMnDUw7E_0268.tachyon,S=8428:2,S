Here's what Wendy from California had to say about this remarkable pain rel=
ieving product:=20
<P>
<font face=3D"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b><i>
"My mom bought Super Blue Stuff and loves it. I have also used it and it is=
 pretty amazing. We have been in several car accidents and I have a slightl=
y crushed vertebrae in my neck and it the super blue stuff does work after =
about five minutes. It gets kind of warm, has a nice smell, and is very smo=
othing, nothing like over the counter creams. We have given it to several f=
riends and they use it regularly too. I would recommend it to anyone!"
