For IP if you wish.

Libraries have long sought to protect circulation records out of
concern for both privacy and freedom to read.
Libraries and the American Library Association have been openly
fighting government orders for their records.
See http://www.komotv.com/news/story.asp?ID=33363  ("Small Town
Library Takes On The Feds") and
http://www.ctlibrarians.org/news/patriotact.html (discussing
Connecticut library NSL case)

Indeed, some libraries have instituted records purging policies to
protect against government subpoenas.
http://www.infoshop.org/alibrarians/public_html/article.php?
story=03/08/01/5059833
http://www.fhsu.edu/forsyth_lib/copyright/PatriotActFAQs.shtml
("While there are some service benefits to keeping detailed records,
the risks of compromising your privacy outweigh these benefits.
Therefore, we are planning to purge all patron records with your
personally identifiable information on them once the materials are
returned and the fines are paid.")

What about search engines?

The data retention issue is only getting worse from a privacy
standpoint; the EU is moving toward mandatory telecom traffic data
retention. http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/02/ap/world/
