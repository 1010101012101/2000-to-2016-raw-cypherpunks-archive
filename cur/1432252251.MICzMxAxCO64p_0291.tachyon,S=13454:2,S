Increasing the documentation is something that we are critically aware
that we need to do, and we are working on this, but our available
resources are limited. We would certainly welcome any assistance that
people may be inclined to provide on this.  For example, it would be
great for people to choose a particular aspect of the Serval
technology, e.g., DNA, and begin documenting it by examining the code,
asking lots of questions and grabbing material from the wiki (which we
apologise is being reinstalled this week).

So the Huawei IDEOS U8150/U8180 phones do have an accelerometer as I
recall, and are certainly cheap, being as cheap as AUD$60.

That just leaves the antenna gain, or more precisely, the maximum
range between devices as the issue.

Increasing the gain will only work to a limited extent, as that gain
comes at the expense of omnidirectionality, and given that volcanoes
are not generally flat (I forget which type of cone your volcano has),
will present some difficulties to very directional links.  My estimate
is that you need about 9db gain if using ordinary wifi gear.

As I recall, you are looking for ~500m range between nodes.  WiFi
typically does ~200m fine, but it can certainly do 500m in ideal
conditions, such as when the Fresnel zones are clear, which can be
achieved by mounting antennas on ~8m poles.  Of course that is a
problem if the antenna is in the phone and also is supposed to be
measuring ground movement... So no immediate solution there using off
the shelf equipment.

It may be worth trying a few different models of phones to see if any
have better wifi antennas than others.

Otherwise, I guess you will have no choice but to make custom hardware
of some sort, whether phone based, Arduino based or otherwise.

Paul.
