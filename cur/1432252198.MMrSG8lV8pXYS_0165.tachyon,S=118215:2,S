--- overview ---

the application of [crypto] appears to occupy a dual realm, spanning both
the need for /secrecy/ and the need for /security/, which it is assumed may
require different approaches in how in its design and functioning, and the
'systems' may operate within different parameters- say a secure facility
with employee IDs that involves managing secrets, versus an SSL exchange
using a web browser to search google.

It would seem to an outsider, unknowing actual parameters involved, that
some technology functions more as a secure mode and others as a secret or
hidden mode, and that this may be different in that data may be readily
accessible or known at endpoints or throughout an infrastructure whereas in
another this could be so tightly controlled as to involve almost personal
secret-keeping between those who access purposefully hidden 'information'
that must be kept contained, out of existing channels, or activated in a
different realm or zone of operation, say peer to peer with another who
also shares the secret yet not communicating about what it is, yet in
having access to the knowledge it recontexualizes shared observation and in
some sense could function as if a shared key has been passed and a secret
corridor or psychic tunnel or 'secret network' exists as a result of those
who know what is /unknown/ versus those who remaining unknowing what this
could be in the infinity of potential particular views of any given event
or idea or truth.

whereas accessing a webpage with some anonymity in the data transmission
may involve a largely known exchange, excepting for those on the outside of
the shared infrastructural connection; and so it is more a data security
approach versus centered or focused on /secrets/.

thus for different observers, the question of the Crypto State could tend
more towards the maintenance and ethics and implementation of an approach
to manage protect and exploit [secrets], which could be government and spy
agency focused on its internal and peer state connections, whereas for
another population, the citizenry, the issue of crypto could function most
in a context of [security], as if a realm delineating a lawful boundary or
property line that is potentially protected by law, and possibly is most
focused in the business, legal, and institutional realm. this is a basic
hypothesis so those who actually know this situation could model it in a
more accurate framework, whatever it may be, between security and secrecy.

i do not believe that an issue like state surveillance can be disconnected
from its actual deeper purpose, which few more know of or by NDA be unable
to communicate to others and thus an issue of faith in its mission can be
evaluated either in aligning with a patriotic ideology, which is incredibly
dangerous if checks and balances are gone from government accountability,
or in an accurate modeling of the truth of the situation and the framework
events are occurring within- that is, context.

everyone knows that lawlessness exists in the realm of corporate use of
private data to make money, either through data mining or private
surveillance, just look at the aggressive panhandling via advertisements on
every webpage, as if billboards have their own AI agenda as spore lifeforms
and are trying to secure their future against competing words and ideas
that they seek to distract from and cover or automatically play video or
audio and use up network data streams as constant 'junk data' and yet it is
citizens who are paying for this malfeasance, businesses and unscrupulous
money makers exploiting the common realm to extract as much profit as
possible at the loss of even readability in a majority of scenarios. and
there is no *legal issue* with this kind of deterioration of what could in
some sense be a public space in some sense that has been overtaken by a
private negligence, selfishness, and greed that defaces and devalues it.
perhaps this is a shared business model and yet it is also rotten, and so
like driving through a wasteland of a ruined environment, the webpages and
internet is like seeing broken buildings using a broken vehicle, driving on
broken roads and thoroughfares, with collapsed and dilapidated structures
and a giant signs HUMANS ARE THE ENEMY everywhere you look and turn,
mocking people with the brazen disregard for sensibility, honesty,
everything in your face and hateful, tending towards the worst content and
worst innuendo, and this is normalized as the shared realm of public and
private exchange, online.

and in that context people and mass media and states are communicating
about what presidents say, about wars and war making and terrorism, and
about poverty and illness and disease and the inability of society to meet
its needs while others sit at the top of this giant heap of societal dung
and count their money earned by selling the broken society to begin with.

so the first observation is that the state is fucked. completely utterly
and irreversibly fucked. its core code is rotten and the effects of this
are everywhere, including in peoples mindsets and decision-making that is
born of this ideology, reinforcing the binary perspective from previous
generations that has become an an error-reliant inaccurate biased POV that
is allowing this exploitation to continue under the shield of "legalese",
yet which itself is ungrounded and turns the signage of language into truth
and thus internalizes the world within a private communication about it
where this communication becomes the truth, via language that can control
and overpower another perspective, not via honest evaluation of truth. thus
language games in place of actual justice, and this normalized, 'codified'.

businesses themselves hiding behind this code, lawyers by their side, to
allow any kind of extractive process of data or money to occur, no
liability yet allowing swindles cheating and corporate and institutional
theft to be legalized, without public benefit even, and citizens data and
material existence then become natural resources to be exploited, further
extracting every last available bit for someone else to profit from, while
they see nothing in return except choices of skinnerian behaviorism, lives
becoming mouse mazes, the less money you start with the sooner trapped and
the whole society about siphoning off goods and resources, winnowing the
few who proceed upward, stopping the rest in the lower middle class, and
then breaking down people and pushing them further and further until at the
bottom of society in unrecoverable circumstances, the societal trap door of
poverty enforced as part of an ideological agenda, religious belief needing
the failures to be the immoral castigated many who justify the superiority
of everyone above- yet it is the result of gaming the state and its
collapse in a pyramid scheme that enslaves the many to prop up the false
perspective benefiting the very few who actually believe all the B.S.
because it most benefits them, as if some kind of twisted utopia for
psychos who are unconcerned about others beyond their private boundaries.

if you consider [crypto] in this economic, political, social context,
actually the broken cryptographic systems actually massively benefit this
exploitative scheme entirely at every level, both as secrets and security.
it provides an impenetrable wall of ideology that, alongside the Binary
Crypto Regime, allows a type of reinforced inevitability of the solution,
*if only you could do the math you would realize how great all this is*.

and so double/triple schemes this may be so, never underestimate humanity,
yet for those uninitiated it is hellishly terrifying, especially the closer
you are to the bottom where these dynamics grind down the lowest layers and
push people prematurely into caskets or have no ethics in discriminating
against those unlike, who have no protection against exploitation and even
violence against them, yet viewed seemingly as the greatest threat because
they are using resources that belong to others, as if only takers en total.

what is also most evident is the role of neurolinguistic programming (NLP)
in federal, state, corporate, educational and institutional contexts to use
'brute force language' to engineer a particular kind of next iteration, as
if this one-way language manipulation has replaced shared reasoning, due to
the loss of empirical truth and its accounting, and an unrestricted triumph
of relativism and its authoritarian agenda of administering the next wave
of the self-same ideology, yet with their own people, no more charade with
mr. and mrs. nice anymore. its just their people now, The State, Inc.-
whether it is business, government, education, health care, community.

how do things get this fucked up unless that is what you're aiming for? and
this in this way it is truly MASTERFUL. brilliant. the art of the state.

so in this context there is an issue like /taxes/ that when the state began
had to be figured out from a condition of injustice and revolt which led to
a new independent society and democratic form of governance. feedback-based
in principle. and then over centuries this short-circuited due to limits in
the code and its interpretations, say equal rights for women, then citizens
and various other fracturings from a once shared POV of private men that
were assumed to be 'the public', that is, within western european history,
and over time these conditions changed and yet the underlying code did not
that led to contradictions and even INVERSIONS that could force breakdowns
of the same society via exploits and hacks that challenged the processing
and upon Supreme Court or other legal review, flip bits somewhere and the
larger situation was transformed for everyone, changed by smaller events
elsewhere. and the state has both continued its development towards human
improvement while similarly deteriorating at the same time, its faulty code
and programming the source of its own self-destruction and annihilation,
such that /truth/ has been replaced by unrestricted and unregulated and
essentially 'unchecked' /power/ via this biased, relativistic framework in
which - oh, i don't know - the world's largest military machine and global
spy network operate under, in an inaccurate and biased private viewpoint
for mass surveillance and the hunt for terrorists- which can thus be skewed
an distorted to focus on citizens instead who may question these dynamics,
which then turns public consciousness into the enemy of this secrets-based
and heavily secure tyranny, indistinguishable from a dictatorship yet not
accounted for this way, as the dictator is hidden, out of sight, etc. and
so the false perspective reigns and rules over 'what can be reasoned' and
if anyone crosses that line, the private police enforcers and spies are at
your doors and suddenly all your e-commerce goods are being shipped broken.

and thus taxes are supporting this lawless takeover of the government and
yet it is also inevitable due to the way the state is configured and the
code it is running on and for lack of a better alternative, until that can
be presented- this is the situation. so, some sympathy for the dictator.
though if the options are destroyed by tyrannical actions then you got real
problems because then the leader is insane and functioning against the
shared state, in that the agenda becomes antihuman, aligned with machines
and the continuation and development of the automated machinery of state,
which in terms of the ideology are godless, yet involves a priesthood of
technocrats - including programmers and technologists and business people,
for whom this system is operating under their guidance and parameters and
towards their goals, which have become detached from the citizenry itself.
so there is the aspect of enslavement, disenfranchisement of populations
based on discrimination and sliding-scale rulesets preferring some over
others and also rewarding violence against citizens in its ecosystem. and
the entire population is wired to automatically support this via taxes yet
the /feedback/ is not occurring to improve their own basic situations as
the erosive aspects of cultural decline outweigh everything else and in
this constant pressure, break down and dissolve connections and structures
required for survival, including loss of meaningful work, family units,
education related to the world that exits versus citizens trained as if
robots, and 'media' that devolves everything into an animalistic context,
nearly pre-literate, not in the McLuhan sense of higher understanding of
oral or other cultures, and instead- inculcating ignorance, bias, hatred,
factionalism, racism, and this via false-perspectives as if 'shared POV'.
no one required to align or attest or be held accountable for truth,
instead ENRONOMICS rules, you can game the system and win at every level,
and thus it involves the takeover by these same forces of the environment
and state itself- its bureaucracy falling hostage to such an ideology, and
citizens no longer having a government which represents the public's needs.

this is relativistic private government taken to its extreme: tyranny, yet
not only that- CRYPTO dictatorship. and yet it started out as a public and
private government with human ideals and orientated to life, and instead
has become antihuman and polluted, ideologically, environmentally and in
minds and bodies, and focused on death and money as if the highest good.

and so it is a question- where is /truth/ within this government- does it
even exist? and it would seem that for the ideologically invested, the
truth is the surface event, the signage and ideological actions that as
imagery reinforce a particular viewpoint conducive to true belief-- that
money is the most important, and that these people believing themselves
superior really are in control, and that they justify this enslavement
based on their private agenda and goals. and thus the *secrets and
security* of the crypto state could align with this binary belief system
and seemingly be its support structure, including for keeping tabs on all
the exploited, as if in an excel spreadsheet, to determine futures via
routing to the appropriate cattle chutes, whether death panels or poor
schools or blacklists. everyone surveilled for their profit.

whereas another truth could coexist beyond or along-side of this and yet
remain hidden from the binary ideological which is bounded by its
self-validation, pattern matching via limited and controlled observation
and thus observer bias the threshold for 'shared reality' and shared goals.

instead of relying on the corrupted and error-ridden code of pseudo-truth
and its role in 'development' of business, education, healthcare, etc via
lies, distortion, self-serving exploitative agendas- instead another actual
[truth] could exist that is shared, that involves a different context for
issues of /security/ and /secrets/, and cryptographic systems and their
applications also would span into this realm of activity, by default of its
service to the soul of the state, to ensure long-term functional integrity
and this can be assumed based on indications such a parallel agenda exists.

it would seem most [crypto] in the profane model would be functioning in a
different set of parameters than in the more sacred and militarist model,
whereby enforced ignorance and outright corruption is not the rule or law.
and thus the cosmic setup and making preparations for this to be resolved.

--- rebooting the state ---

it concerns me to be called before a judge because i do not believe the
state is a legal entity and believe i can readily prove this to be the
case, and therefore not recognizing the legality of the state to decide in
matters of law would be contempt of court, from my previous understanding.
and in this way, to be imprisoned for not recognizing its authority to
determine what is just or to be able to enforce the right principles within
law as it exists due to a failed constitutional context.

i run it over in my head, the argument of having private man define what is
a human predicament, and thus 'mankind' and 'his' and history stand in for
humans and women as an ideological bias which, while once public, became
private upon equal rights, including for those other other ethnicities yet
this privileged hierarchic onsesided perspective has been
institutionalized  as if representing the total public via the shared
private views of men, and in the attempts to equalize it, has further
privatized other views of women and ethnicities, into a many privates
worlds situation without a coherent shared framework to call or reason as
'the public' of us all.

'the human' is missing. the human state is non-existent, and the private
state of various wo|men and their private rights rule over humanity, the
subset governing as if superset, yet without higher ideals, instead lower.

the constitutional code is corrupt. and yet in its description it has the
rules to deal with this: call a Constitutional Convention and start again.
yet in a society run by relativism there is no ability to 'reason' beyond
the privatized ideological "theoretical" discourse whereby power politics
determines what is true (pT=>0) and then rubber-stamps via institutions
under its guidance to manufacture consent and thus: represent 'the people'
whereby only some truth is allowed that only benefits some people at the
expense of everyone else. unbalanced, biased, onesided most times, really.

so-- dealing with MASS ILLITERACY here, since the education system fell to
relativistic ideology and binary bias as a teaching and indoctrination
method, the rote exercises and standardized tests indication that no actual
thought it allowed, no thesis - antithesis -> synthesis in western culture
anymore, unless of an ungrounded politically correct version based within
*language* and about the [signs] or appearance of shared views, yet without
the truth shared or grounded in this false perspective. thus, foundations
of belief are built on weak and corrupt 'ideas' and 'concepts' which have
also become the mainstream discourse -and- POLICY BASIS for the state--
that is, skew distortion warping and bias as the reasoning for shared
decision making and governance. whose that benefiting when *celebrities*
are the best at taking on such an acting role of serial killer fiction.

so someone calls a constitutional convention and no one is capable of
*reasoning* about what is happening in the shared situation because many
are essentially BELIEVING THEIR OWN BULLSHIT on ego-reliant frameworks
based on ideological bias and error, into a too simple assessment of truth
that is pre-enlightenment at this stage, pre-western culture even, devolved
to a realm of selfish idiocy and stupidity that only self-indulgence can
really offer to the existing degree. thus, everyone is a celebrity in their
own private facebook and twitter worlds and speaking their own languages
from their own perspectives and talking the talk, in so far as it profits
and is allowed in models of pseudo-truth-- not the nails hard empirical
realm where errors in thinking are not allowed or acceptable for shared
frameworks-- this is beyond or before scientific method which similarly
fails via privatized empiricism (also perspective limited via 'history' and
thus privatized, allowing aggressions against humans in that framework by
way of distortions, errors- exploited, targeting enemy populations, etc).

yet a lot of people can 'program' yet it is stuck in bias and ideological
frameworks and therefore very smart "binary thinking" gets nowhere in the
real world of paradox, to deal with problems and situations as they exist
rather than as they are perceived to- which is a tremendous difference and
requires actual difficult and painful and humbling considerations and it is
quickly realized how little a person knows- versus to presume to know all
by sharing a viewpoint beyond external correction or acknowledging that
there is bias or distortion or even unknowing involved- theorized POVs
rule, the ego of private identities as if public, as if shared views, yet
without the rigor or political suffering that involves beyond 'the drama'.
and thus soap operas of initiatives, everyone wearing their private causes
and yet outside an actual PUBLIC CONTEXT and language and social relations
and importantly -- identity -- that would allow the issues to be dealt with
beyond adolescent playpen antics and excitements and temper tantrums. here
or there someone probably assassinated for actually doing something wrong,
though who knows, maybe that too is drama and they are in deep state now.

and logic is crucial, yet absent as an accounting of 'reasoning' which
instead like NLP becomes programming via onesided binarisms competing up on
the various electronic stumps, trunks, and platforms.  3-value and N-value
logic, the basis for /human/ reasoning in a neutral evaluation as observer
are not taught in schools. everything is 'rationalized' yet in pseudo-truth
and thus an infinite many viewpoints that do not add up to more because
they rely on the errors and distortions as structural scaffolding, on the
bias and ideology to uphold views, as is necessary of private language-
women as bad as men, ethnicities exploiting this as much as others, that is
the game it involves and everything and everyone devolves as a result.

The State needs to be rebooted under new constitutional code, at the very
least modified from a context of public and private man, mankind, and
history to that of public humanity and private wo|men, involving a shared
his|her-story or human story. corporations embodied as 'individuals' as
'private men' have allowed extreme competition with citizens to the point
that the state is representing corporate democracy via 'the public' vote,
the citizens are Microsoft, Google, Time-Warner, CBS, Halliburton, etc.
those not part of the structures are serfs, indentured class, castes.
whereas in a human context, the state would need to serve not exploit human
goals and values as part of a shared community, not gain profit based on
exploiting and brainwashing or cheating people in retrograde schemes or
outright criminality via selling broken equipment to normalize thievery.
the human context for law would likewise not be able to ignore such truth
as it would be allowed and not censored as a viewpoint via relativism. and
likewise /security/ and /secrecy/ would likewise change to serve humanity
and differentiate and focus on those seeking to abuse and exploit instead.
it is this last statement that is assumed the underlying hidden, secret
aspect of existing crypto systems of the state, a standing reserve that is
waiting in the wings, surveying the situation so it can be accounted for.

as of my recollection at this point, it is unknown if i am the only person
who could make this case for the illegality of the state in its existing
functioning, yet anyone who were to deny the court its legality would
potentially be able to make this case, if willing to go to prison and get
the process underway, though the argument would need to be allowed else you
may never get out of prison, which is why it seems a worst case scenario,
unless that situation would be the first opportunity to make the case. and
this in a context of what is proposed to be *ungrounded legal frameworks*
due to ideological language relied on for 'shared relativistic reasoning'
which functions as /programming/ again, as if shared though of unshared
society, continually set at odds with itself, functioning against itself,
increasingly nonsensical and illiterate-- schizophrenic even, as the views
do not add up to a coherent whole, the parts make their sum impossible, as
it tends towards shared nothingness- not towards life or greater being. in
this way, ignorance is progressively institutionalize, made into rules and
increases suffering, making it more and more difficult to 'reason' within
the broken world and relate to others in their privatized biased views.
statisticians become the new community organizers for the disenfranchised
and lost, tallying peoples identities with others moreso than communities
themselves or organizations, the alienating and isolation near complete,
such that the internet and WWW as stage set appear as if by divine right to
allow each actor their fantasy to portray, without restriction to reality,
obligation or duty to another, as if life only a game, frivolity behold. no
sense of the pending doom awaiting, the trap door beneath the spotlight.

the word as a mirror then, and the networked playground for narcissists
that on a psychological level reveals the deep and hidden contempt and
shallowness of the economic, social, and political ideology of self-bias.

you need at least two people to call a constitutional convention, yet what
if it is flash mobbed and a million relativists show up with bullhorns?
here: "use our code! use our code!" they start screaming in unison. that is
it in its entirety, all that binary relativistic reasoning needs to keep
things as they are and further extent the situation towards shared falsity.

that is why there are guns i am guessing. make a perimeter. only logical
reasoning allowed, and at every instance the binary will be defeated in its
simplism and will no longer be enshrined as law nor ideology nor allow for
the corrupt rule of the many by the few who do not realize how crazy they
actually are, nor how completely hollow and sold-out as human beings.

my wager is i can prove the state in its current form is unconstitutional
and provide the logical framework for making that case, and offer a set of
corrective actions that would neutralize the existing bias, recontextualize
its constitutional framework via what are essentially structural "edits"
based on logic, to remove known ideology, and this could allow a framework
for establishing or reconsidering the constitution via a convention once
"ideas" themselves are back on the table, versus extending programmatic
language according to biased rulesets held in pseudo-empirical books that
skew this way or that depending on the forces at work, depending on words
and signs versus on truth and logical reasoning as the basis for judgement
and decision-making, in that ideas must be mediated at the level of 1/0.
anything else is an ungrounded concept, a fiction, a theory by comparison,
an assumption based on previous assumptions, which is what ideology is:
basing reasoning on previous answered questions versus asking them anew.
really asking questions versus skipping the truth and relying on the
structure as if 'wholly true' and not involving skew, say of history as
this may influence perspective and limit certain 'shared observations' by
promoting a private framework for evaluation. and the consequences of this.

i do not want to go to prison to get the conversation started, mainly
because i would probably never get out, as 'logical reasoning' has no place
within these state systems and instead they are mediating relations based
on power and shared private ideology at that. perhaps high-minded Supreme
Court is the actual and best platform to evaluate these state code errors
accurately and authorize the necessary edits to reframe and recontextualize
the state in a new human framework where citizens have a responsibility to
the state, both public and private, and that in return the state will serve
humanity, including by reconceptualizing the monetary system, business
relations and obligations to environment and the state development,
education, health and in general- the shared awareness and well-being of
those of shared destiny.

if the code of the Constitution is in error, it must be error-corrected--
this is not Microsoft Windows-- or, actually, it is The State as Windows,
broken windows everywhere, made to break, made to be exploited, for profit.
that is, the corruption is a downward spiral as private business model, and
perhaps this is part of the crypto gambit itself, providing instruments to
enable and sustain the deterioration, as the codebase moves towards babel.

fragile error-ridden code that needs to be enforced by power politics and
bullying as if "reasoning" via violence and intimidation based on shared
bias of binary ideology, versus robust thinking based on shared empirical
truth in a gray-area of consideration and evaluation, paradoxical, real,
wanting to debate the hypothesis and even have observations show wrong or
faulty to learn and improve upon frameworks, win/win interactions within
debate versus stand-offs with true believers who ignore truth instead, and
pick and choose their private reality and believe their bubble state will
always exist the way it is, versus be popped and fall to another worldview.

the requirement is strong relations between individuals and groups based on
logical reasoning-- that existed as the empirical basis for development of
the U.S. Constitution and would be required as a prerequisite again to be
able to fairly and accurate model issues of the state beyond a partial
too-limited biased viewpoint of the shared citizenry. It may be the first
real 'public' state in that it would be the first human state in existence,
seemingly, in terms of the specific requirements for the appropriate kernel
of truth by which to align all other actions and interrelated activities
within its structural arrangement. it may actually allow 'America' to be
the potential envisioned, beyond the limits of history, and truly finally
offer options that have existed as potentials yet have not be allowed
within the limited frameworks due to unshared language, logic, and
observation that could not be reconciled by ever-narrowing private POVs.

this is to assume that shared value of the state is [truth] at its core,
and that logical reasoning must be error-corrected at this level for ideas
to be given their value, and not to assume this or allow it for the
pseudo-truths that rely on false frameworks and errors if not outright lies
that have become protected by the ideology of law instead, in service to
shared falsity that endlessly exploits the citizenry to serve the powerful
few.

perhaps the most important issue underlying this transformation would be a
new currency that could function in a realm of data exchange and allow for
fidelity with transactions and relations as they exist, as infrastructure
of interconnected relations that feed this motivational current throughout
the state, yet which has no data dimension today in terms of its fractional
values, such that .001 may be a useful measure for online contexts, or that
taxation could be automated into the currency itself, so that it is not an
issue of people relying on third-party accountants to balance their books
and instead it is part of the feedback process inherent in the currency
itself, taking the bureaucracy out of bureaucracy and allowing money to be
friction free in terms of exchange, and allow various interactions that are
instead limited by broken and biased models of accountability that punish
those without money the most, making it impossible to function in society
as if they are cheating because the system itself is broken, when instead
the very tax forms do not have the basic information to allow the literate
to do their own taxes, even in the most expected scenarios of Social
Security payments-- both at state and federal levels, instead obfuscation
and then the setup, the threat of holding individuals accountable for the
errors, as is the social services game, working against the poor, rigging
the system for failure, using pressure and oppressive subversive actions to
try to indict criminality based on broken systems used to frame citizens
who dare try to live beyond the limits, and escape conveyer belt to the
awaiting cardboard coffin, paid for by web advertising tattooed on skull.

...

"the very interaction in a context of verifiable truth is the weakness of
liars who need to sustain the shared lie in order to function" - /tells/
would be automatic as circuitry grounds to falsehood versus truth.

(so you're talking about an inversion, huh?)

enforced illiteracy versus freedom of ideas, based on securing of truth
within the state, making it foundational and defining reasoning based on
logic and accounting within accurate models, concepts, and hypotheses,
using the human observer as the basis for shared empirical viewpoint.


--- why cryptography matters ---

programming consciousness, building peer relations, feedback based tools,
'know and develop your circuitry', self as circuit, ideas as circuits,
models and concepts as circuits. fundamental knowledge and exchange based
on shared value (T) built from the ground up, literally, electromagnetic.

tools for thinking, tools for literacy, for grounded empiricism, education
in hardware/software models, logical reasoning as the basis, to allow for
it and develop it, share the techniques, guidelines/guidance, for debate of
ideas, litmus, standards, crack the ideological code.

the code potential.

issue of pattern matching to the wrong model: binary [crypt.1] / paradoxic
[crypt.2] -- it is in the unknown, or the known unknown -of its capacity-
that the cryptographic could establish a model for programmatic LITERACY
that someday may be the basis for shared awareness outside the realm of
secrets and secrecy and instead between citizens within new parameters of
relation and exchange, whereby the existing model is transformed...

antihuman [observer.1] <---> human [observer.2]

wherein all exchange is biased to the following dynamic:

antihuman [observer.1] <---- human [observer.2]

antihuman [observer.1] <---> antihuman [observer.2]

Instead, this could be transformed by logical accounting for truth in
biased and ungrounded 'theoretical' models reliant upon shared and
sustained falsity, thereby invalidating the 'shared perspective' and
requiring actual [truth] as the measure for shared human observation...

human [observer.1] <---> human [observer.2]

the antihuman viewpoint relies on shared bias as the basis for shared
awareness, 'shared ideological belief' essentially, and would be replaced
by shared empirical models of truth based on *logical reasoning* (not
shared binary bias) via 3-value and N-value evaluations.

in each instance the /crypto/ would be different, in particular the second
example whereby exploited or compromised crypto could be feeding a false
perspective, leading to example three where a surveillance state could be
internally believed serving this private ideological constituency yet also
be backdoored elsewhere, beyond the limit of their models of awareness.

the fourth, last example being the future or other hidden crypto systems
that a future state may develop in terms of a line of demarcation between
the human and antihuman interactions, in that security and secrets occur in
that realm of conflict in terms of unshared identity, goals, values, etc.

and thus likewise, 'money' or 'currency' in these differing scenarios,
taxes or politics or social services, etc. what is true is true. and then
there are also black swan events that challenge the model, its assumptions.

either/or, both/and, neithor/nor, switches and electronic circuits as they
relate to relations of observers, set theory dynamics as daily encounters.
war and peace in a realm of language and bureaucracy, hidden within logic,
its lack of accounting. security through obscurity or the deep strategy.

nothing like communicating like a barking animal, rawr rawwr rawrrrr!!!!
rowwf! ROF! WROFF! wwwWWRRRAAOAOOFFFFFFFFF!@!@@^...

--- more on crypto model ---

there is truth, there is logic, and logical reasoning in turn which
mediates 'ideas' - evaluating patterns and constructing hypotheses via
concepts and models.

   T <-> logic <-> reasoning <-> [ideas]

so if you have /binary/ logic, you get binary reasoning and binary models
and thinking, whereby if a pattern is matched, it is by default 'true'.

   T <- binary reasoning <- [pattern match]

thus is the structural bias that if pseudo-truth is the value [pT] then
false absolutism inherently includes error in this 'accounting for truth'
as if it is purely true versus reliant on skew, distortion, error, etc. in
this way the image or sign=sign is an ungrounded validation of the ideas if
they are only 'partially true' yet not recognized as such, thus ungrounded
in the total idea said to be represented. normalization and reliance upon
false positives to prove sustain extend the false perspective modeling.

this is the ideological approach of binary programming as 'philosophy'. it
is the Binary Crypto Regime belief system, as if 1/0 is guru accessible via
choosing beliefs in private frameworks of relativistic observations, often
based on power and privileged perspectives, whether biz or tech celebrity,
popular professor or self-righteous activist. the skew is the twl

and thus the pT<->T gap is the security and secrecy exploit, a structure
made to be exploited, yet it may not be recognized in the mindset itself in
terms of lack of accurate self-reflection, thus a psychological flaw in the
observer that tends towards psychopathy, narcissism, and anti-human agendas
or so life experience offers that as an evaluative framework to consider,
perhaps only validated when the have their extermination camps up & running
or the existing ones are revealed: poisoning environment, food, minds, etc.

what was realized upon sharing the model of crypto in relation to language
was that programming functions as a form of reasoning, and so considering
that there are limits to binary programming versus paradoxical, in terms of
the code possibilities of linear versus nonlinear evaluations, this also
holds true for 'ideas' and conceptualizations of what exists as it exists
and what must be held outside the frameworks because they cannot account
for anomalies-- the binary ideology is reliant on censoring and throwing
out data that does not conform, whereas the paradoxical 3-value and N-value
models retain this 'fine detail' of various intricacies of interstructural
dynamics as a basis to discern more accurate (shared, empirical)
frameworks  and in this way *trash is treasure*, or the relation between
archaeology and architecture, past and future meeting in the present with a
question.


  1 <-> logical reasoning <-> [ideas]

if you get the ideas right, grounded in truth, the concepts and models,
then the code 'as language' is going to accurately mediate this relation
between /signs/ and the things they represent, or ground to, in/as truth.

  1 <-- [code] <-- programming

in this way, if the 'ideas of code' are accurately modeled and grounded,
their implementation would be validated by truth and its error-correction
of the faulty code would be vital to securing truth within the model

  0 <-- [pT.code] <-- 'binary reasoning' *

whereas a worldview and model based on an unfalsifiable approach that is
removed of error correction may have 'some truth' though its further and
further reliance on error-reliant frameworks would continuously move this
'shared view' closer and closer to zero, instead of 1, via the increasing
dissolution of truth within a larger ever expanding framework of falsity.

in a complex multiple-use model involving deception, such unaccountable
code could not only be used as an exploit, the programmatic assumption
could itself be exploited via social engineering of the ideological mindset
and thus the very viewpoint is as insecure as the codebase is made to be:

 1/N/0 <-- pT/T.code <-- 'binary/paradoxial-reasoning'

There could be a massive deception hidden within this context, not only of
the binarists who exploit broken crypto to surveil and steal from others,
including the state itself, though have no indication of anomaly allowing
their mirror-looking to see the other side of the one-way view, thus other
encryption alongside yet invisible, additional 'truth' inside or outside
binary models of 'pseudo-truth' yet unable to be reasoned, pattern matched
and instead thrown out as errors, ignored. superposition of truth, its
contingence on observation and how logic effects what can be reasoned to
exist. and this is where /programming/ essentially is a form of reasoning
and yet 'the debate' is not occurring at the level of language in words and
viewpoints of people- in that this level of [code] is needed to
communicate  and model ideas within society, to align with conceptual
structures like programmers must to attain functionality of developed
intermechanisms and yet at the level of individual and group discourse this
system of relation and communication is broken within institutions,
schools, and society, such that only a binary viewpoint is allowed and
proceeds and is rewarded yet at a cost to civilization and life itself, due
to the servitude to enforced stupidity.

instead, the ability to comprehend this situation of communication as
[code] is needed firstly to be able to think and evaluate accurately, to
use language and mathematics in a meaningful grounded way, and not
arbitrary or mindlessly reproducing copies of copies of ideas that are now
ideologies, adding more and more noise and losing the original truth or
signal that instead is no longer accurate because the context is changed
and it needs to be reevaluated as model, yet everyone appears ILLITERATE
else unwilling and unable to do this, because they have more important
things to do like wax their egos or manicure their stellar lifestyles.

in other words, in some fundamental sense: programming is logical reasoning
and tools could be made to develop these skills via the distributed net of
mobile platforms that would help people learn how to think, how to evaluate
situations in empirical frameworks, help understand probability, looping
hypotheses, binary limits and issues of absolutism that are unreal in the
ordinary sense (too simple, thus dumb and inculcating ignorance via
viewpoint), and provide platforms to link thoughts and ideas and concepts
in structural frameworks as a new foundation for the next internet as a
shared POV and organization of data that is meaningful and has purpose
beyond private views and agendas, and limits of copyright for truth, etc.

so the relation of "logical reasoning" with [language] and [mathematics] in
terms of concepts, ideas, algorithms, models, yet also "programming" of
this CODE that may remain or be sustained by cryptographic means and
methods in terms of deep culture and the sustaining of literacy beyond the
ordinary mainstream boundaries, its metaphysical dimensions and source.

in this, the role of cryptography perhaps at the unifying juncture of the
two cultures as they are reunited in [code] and establish LITERACY across
the total domain, moving from esoteric to revealed knowledge and awareness.
the philosophical dimension, context, and goals of programming and role of
debate and protection and extension of freedom of ideas and language within
the era of computer development lost to social engineering via technology,
its tools and platforms to promote this ignorance, falsehood, functioning
against truth and shared awareness, against ideas, feedback, democracy. the
ideology too small for the ideas, the ideas to large for the logic, and in
turn the corruption replacing insight with ego, as the basis for exchange
in a shallow hollow realm of exchange and relation fundamentally antihuman.

*key is whether the observer is aware of their own observation, their own
code, and can correct and account for errors or relies upon them for
observation. can the observer observe themselves or do they realize their
observations are observed by others, which is a basis for objective views
in that many views of the same event can help error correct for distortion
or unknowns yet if all assume the same views, these are reinforced instead.

--- ye ol crypto system ---

to the tangible future of a human managed society and state based on shared
truth-- it would be possible to transform the issues of today into a new
context and capture the /truth/ that exists buried within the complexity
overlapping agendas, human and inhuman, and align the activities of the
public and private state in accordance with human needs and goals. such as
with a new digital monetary system and taxes, and education that teaches
citizens how to think via logical reasoning, to raise consciousness and
capacity through learning and developing skills, towards optimal and
highest functioning - and to realign goals of bureaucracy to serve the
citizens instead of function against them, such as regularity agencies that
establish a framework to reclaim a healthy non-toxic environment and return
areas of wilderness to their natural state, such as removal of vast areas
of sprawl and reimagine city planning and transportation systems and other
approaches to human development in a more efficient, effective, humane and
livable approach.

the issue of these marketing firms and advertisers collecting vast data for
sale on any citizens is in parallel to state surveillance issues and could
be legally abolished as a practice, with limits to what can be collected
and requiring a citizen to allow such tracking for market research and
nothing beyond this. that would be legally enforced and corrupt systems
that surveil as business models would be taken down, go out of business due
to the illegality of a massive private surveillance regime due to code
exploits of constitutional errors, allowing private businesses to profit on
public extortion, expropriation, devaluing of name and identity, stealing
of information, and various other forms of theft, fraud, schemes for the
blacklisting and framing or intimidation of others via such practices,
especially and particularly in a political and ideological context, where
your local business is tallying your presence here and there and gaining
profit off such data as a business model, reinforcing the tyranny. there
is  no place for this lawlessness, this bullying and intimation within a
'free' society unless it is no longer beholden to its constitutional
framework and there is nothing to protect citizens from the exploitation of
their data.

it is not an issue of regulating it-- it needs to be abolished.

in contrast, state surveillance is potentially somewhat a windfall for a
future society where electronic health records, dental, taxes, billing,
taxes, income, work history, education documents, and other dossiers could
become a repository for citizen data that they should be legally allowed to
access -- based on transparency and within limits of security models in
terms of actual secrecy and security issues it may involve. such that you
probably would not have access to FBI or CIA assessments though should
rightfully have everything else, and it should be *accurate* data and not
full of lies, distortions, false perspectives-- and this needs to be the
right of every citizen to have accurate data profiles (A=A) and not full of
documents that distort information to onesided views based on corrupted and
self-serving authority or political agendas.

so here's the idea- and the critical role of cryptography in this...

basically these federal and state databases can become future 'electronic
records' for citizens, so that all dada is stored in a shared accessible
model and can be accessed from anywhere via the network, such that schools
can send data to those files and logins can allow shared access for those
whose files they are. then, for instance, if the government has a issue
such as social security, all the data is in one place and the reference
information is available from multiple locations, not duplication or
triplication or quadrupling of efforts or reliance on postal mail, paper
and stamps and delivery networks to get snail mail validation. ZONING would
be the primary structural issue, what are the perspectives for the combined
total database, say federal and state, though also health education work
taxes and onward, though an entire life could be stored in the model, from
childhood to old age. and yet these could be more than documents, it could
also involve a concept of a citizen, a model or 'individual circuit' that
they develop for their goals in life and their circumstance, issue and
skills unique them, and through this empirical context and grounding,
everyone including teachers and family and doctors and the state could
access this data model as it relates to the individual conceptualization,
their direction of development, and map lives into and onto and through
this data modeling as a model of education, health, career, citizenry.

to do this would require shared keys, and an infrastructure reliant on both
security and secrecy in varying scenarios, depending on the exchange, and
to what degree the data is made accessible. for instance a doctor visit
could have the medical records opened for a one-week window for updates via
key exchange, or an educational institution may hold keys for each student
that updates their coursework yearly or by semester yet otherwise is closed
down and secured in the state model, under watchful eye, protected. this
too could occur with monetary exchange accessed through a substructure so
employers payroll is automatically figured, and micro-taxation that could
be automatic to currency could be tabulated and tallied and recorded in
this central location and instead of taking money out and then returning it
later, avoiding this lunacy for a just-in-time model where money accounts
for its own existence and has identity yet does not create friction that
prevents monetary relations or exchange, allowing money its fluidic power.

the individual citizen then could be given a crypto key that is somehow
attached to an object, equivalent in some way to a social security card
with specific ID number, yet with an authentication scheme based on a
single unique entanglement (assuming classical quantum infrastructure is
out in the open) and thus the key has unique physical bits that ensure
specific entanglements with other paired bits elsewhere, that could be
connected to this central database of state. and from that, entangled
further into a physically-based model of crypto, additional crypto keys
that coexist in that domain within infinity-models, that generate the
everyday keys for accessing bank or school records or circuit diagrams of
the self as a life plan, the society actively involved and supporting
development of itself in a shared framework of relations and exchange,
ideas and intention, purpose and possibility for human civilization.

in other words, a person would carry a device that would be a keychain and
have many active keys that are validated by an underlying state key that
generates these others via physical hardware entanglement, perhaps a
qbit-blackbox or something on a smartcard, yet its detachment from the
person also could invalidate the key as it is a unique one-time correlation
and thus to forge it would collapse the entanglement, and other monitoring
would track occurrences to prevent outside manipulations via biometric or
other verification of identity. speculative, most entirely unknown though
seemingly feasible in the abstract, where the physical key of door/lock is
updated into a future realm of entangled crypto keys as citizen ID, that
then is a validation/verification system for establishing remote trust for
other subsystem crypto exchange via related or embedded key systems that
could be added to the keychain. perhaps the quantum key resides within a
home and only activates the other keys yet need not be carried around once
activating them, and thus provides a physical security barrier or air gap
that could bound any attack into the larger network or database system by
whatever local key is accessed illegally, thus establishing perimeter
defenses or other protocols to diagnose or act on the anomalous events.

it is questionable if such a keychain or crypto key system would involve
tracking by default, if not just in a data model given that the state may
have access to this information if needed, and thus in an emergency it may
change 'zone' settings, open up the cell network, track a person down and
ring their phone to let them know of a connected event via automated call,
or other such functionality, though otherwise data could be anonymized and
sensor networks and others would only focus on actual threats versus
dragnet the entire citizenry under hypersurveillence atmosphere where the
entire society is criminalized and made passive via fear of state violence
and retaliation for speaking differently or going against political party
line, which is the daily situation in its economic, social, political
context as engineered by the binary ideologists to exploit as is.

in this way, crypto keys could differentiate zones of public from private
and there could be state secured databases protected by law, whereby like a
safe deposit box, information could be stored or this could be linked
within the home as well, decentralized, though in some sense 'security' and
'secrecy' of a private nature could be protected via these lawful resources
that would only under extraordinary measures be accessible by the state,
under oversight, and monitored to ensure they are protected by government.
for instance, someone may want photos of their granddaughter to be passed
on to her after the grandparents pass, and she has children, and such
documents could be stored in such a place, as data files. maybe that is not
the idea of others, though it is in contrast to the 'fear the state' model
if it were to exist in a context of human values, where these rights and
principles and ideas are protected, then the database could be citadel, a
protected zone that will continue even if the house burns down or a parent
dies and that data can be accessed and it is part of the process of life
within a context of electronic information and data resources like these.

the larger aspect is that such a tiered crypto system then could involve
house keys, vehicle keys (for eventual antigravity landspeeders i hope),
'money keys' (access to currency, currency as information), state database
keys (subset: health, education, career, psychology, etc). etc.

the crypto infrastructure would be vital to establishing, sustaining, and
securing and protecting the state and its citizenry, in addition to its
role in secret communication which may take on other parameters in such a
'shared identity' context, whereas other realms could involve unshared
identity and involve tactical, strategic, operational crypto for other
environments and situations or tied into this as an infrastructure layer.
say, if you're dealing with hostile robots who steal children or swap out
citizens and they need to be hunted down and eliminated, and so on.

parallel to this, hopefully the end of wi-fi will appear, the pollution of
the environment via electromagnetic radiation and interference with the
senses and nature, and regain what has been lost by toxic invisible skies
continuing that terrible tradition of the first industrial revolutions,
once citizens become literate that the technology is harming citizenry by
unregulated design and this relates to cancer and other issues, including
nefarious agendas to engineer illness, obesity, to devolve the society.

those codes can be broken, dismantled, revealed for the abuses of power
they involve and the antihuman agenda that the unconstitutional state is
allowing to exist, terrorizing citizens as its basis for legitimacy. the
true terror today is the unlawful illegal unconstitutional state today. its
code is error-ridden, its ideology is completely unsound, and it is time it
is accounted for and error-corrected at the scale required to change its
circuitry and given humanity the chance it deserves to succeed in this
life. if ever there has been a reason to fight, this is it.

 and annihilation, such that /truth/ has been replaced by unrestricted and =
unregulated and essentially &#39;unchecked&#39; /power/ via this biased, re=
lativistic framework in which - oh, i don&#39;t know - the world&#39;s larg=
est military machine and global spy network operate under, in an inaccurate=
 and biased private viewpoint for mass surveillance and the hunt for terror=

o may question these dynamics, which then turns public consciousness into t=
he enemy of this secrets-based and heavily secure tyranny, indistinguishabl=
e from a dictatorship yet not accounted for this way, as the dictator is hi=
dden, out of sight, etc. and so the false perspective reigns and rules over=
 &#39;what can be reasoned&#39; and if anyone crosses that line, the privat=
e police enforcers and spies are at your doors and suddenly all your e-comm=

<br>and thus taxes are supporting this lawless takeover of the government a=

 code it is running on and for lack of a better alternative, until that can=
 be presented- this is the situation. so, some sympathy for the dictator. t=

 this system is operating under their guidance and parameters and towards t=

is the aspect of enslavement, disenfranchisement of populations based on di=

ureaucracy falling hostage to such an ideology, and citizens no longer havi=

<br>this is relativistic private government taken to its extreme: tyranny, =
yet not only that- CRYPTO dictatorship. and yet it started out as a public =
and private government with human ideals and orientated to life, and instea=
d has become antihuman and polluted, ideologically, environmentally and in =
minds and bodies, and focused on death and money as if the highest good.<br=

<br>and so it is a question- where is /truth/ within this government- does =
it even exist? and it would seem that for the ideologically invested, the t=
ruth is the surface event, the signage and ideological actions that as imag=
ery reinforce a particular viewpoint conducive to true belief-- that money =
is the most important, and that these people believing themselves superior =
really are in control, and that they justify this enslavement based on thei=
r private agenda and goals. and thus the *secrets and security* of the cryp=
to state could align with this binary belief system and seemingly be its su=
pport structure, including for keeping tabs on all the exploited, as if in =
an excel spreadsheet, to determine futures via routing to the appropriate c=

surveilled for their profit.<br>
<br>whereas another truth could coexist beyond or along-side of this and ye=

<br>instead of relying on the corrupted and error-ridden code of pseudo-tru=

her actual [truth] could exist that is shared, that involves a different co=

 their applications also would span into this realm of activity, by default=

<br>it would seem most [crypto] in the profane model would be functioning i=

<br>i run it over in my head, the argument of having private man define wha=

history stand in for humans and women as an ideological bias which, while o=

<br>the constitutional code is corrupt. and yet in its description it has t=

<br>yet a lot of people can &#39;program&#39; yet it is stuck in bias and i=

<br>The State needs to be rebooted under new constitutional code, at the ve=

it is this last statement that is assumed the underlying hidden, secret asp=

<br>as of my recollection at this point, it is unknown if i am the only per=

<br>in other words, in some fundamental sense: programming is logical reaso=

<br>--- ye ol crypto system ---<br><br>to the tangible future of a human ma=
naged society and state based on shared truth-- it would be possible to tra=
nsform the issues of today into a new context and capture the /truth/ that =
exists buried within the complexity overlapping agendas, human and inhuman,=
 and align the activities of the public and private state in accordance wit=
h human needs and goals. such as with a new digital monetary system and tax=
es, and education that teaches citizens how to think via logical reasoning,=
 to raise consciousness and capacity through learning and developing skills=
, towards optimal and highest functioning - and to realign goals of bureauc=
racy to serve the citizens instead of function against them, such as regula=
rity agencies that establish a framework to reclaim a healthy non-toxic env=
ironment and return areas of wilderness to their natural state, such as rem=
oval of vast areas of sprawl and reimagine city planning and transportation=
 systems and other approaches to human development in a more efficient, eff=
ective, humane and livable approach. <br>
<br>the issue of these marketing firms and advertisers collecting vast data=
 for sale on any citizens is in parallel to state surveillance issues and c=
ould be legally abolished as a practice, with limits to what can be collect=
ed and requiring a citizen to allow such tracking for market research and n=
othing beyond this. that would be legally enforced and corrupt systems that=
 surveil as business models would be taken down, go out of business due to =
the illegality of a massive private surveillance regime due to code exploit=
s of constitutional errors, allowing private businesses to profit on public=
 extortion, expropriation, devaluing of name and identity, stealing of info=
rmation, and various other forms of theft, fraud, schemes for the blacklist=
ing and framing or intimidation of others via such practices, especially an=
d particularly in a political and ideological context, where your local bus=
iness is tallying your presence here and there and gaining profit off such =
data as a business model, reinforcing the tyranny. there is=C2=A0 no place =
for this lawlessness, this bullying and intimation within a &#39;free&#39; =
society unless it is no longer beholden to its constitutional framework and=
 there is nothing to protect citizens from the exploitation of their data. =
<br>
<br>it is not an issue of regulating it-- it needs to be abolished.<br><br>=
in contrast, state surveillance is potentially somewhat a windfall for a fu=
ture society where electronic health records, dental, taxes, billing, taxes=
, income, work history, education documents, and other dossiers could becom=
e a repository for citizen data that they should be legally allowed to acce=
ss -- based on transparency and within limits of security models in terms o=
f actual secrecy and security issues it may involve. such that you probably=
 would not have access to FBI or CIA assessments though should rightfully h=
ave everything else, and it should be *accurate* data and not full of lies,=
 distortions, false perspectives-- and this needs to be the right of every =
citizen to have accurate data profiles (A=3DA) and not full of documents th=
at distort information to onesided views based on corrupted and self-servin=
g authority or political agendas.<br>
<br>so here&#39;s the idea- and the critical role of cryptography in this..=
.<br><br>basically these federal and state databases can become future &#39=
;electronic records&#39; for citizens, so that all dada is stored in a shar=
ed accessible model and can be accessed from anywhere via the network, such=
 that schools can send data to those files and logins can allow shared acce=
ss for those whose files they are. then, for instance, if the government ha=
s a issue such as social security, all the data is in one place and the ref=
erence information is available from multiple locations, not duplication or=
 triplication or quadrupling of efforts or reliance on postal mail, paper a=
nd stamps and delivery networks to get snail mail validation. ZONING would =
be the primary structural issue, what are the perspectives for the combined=
 total database, say federal and state, though also health education work t=
axes and onward, though an entire life could be stored in the model, from c=
hildhood to old age. and yet these could be more than documents, it could a=
lso involve a concept of a citizen, a model or &#39;individual circuit&#39;=
 that they develop for their goals in life and their circumstance, issue an=
d skills unique them, and through this empirical context and grounding, eve=
ryone including teachers and family and doctors and the state could access =
this data model as it relates to the individual conceptualization, their di=
rection of development, and map lives into and onto and through this data m=
odeling as a model of education, health, career, citizenry.<br>
<br>to do this would require shared keys, and an infrastructure reliant on =
both security and secrecy in varying scenarios, depending on the exchange, =
and to what degree the data is made accessible. for instance a doctor visit=
 could have the medical records opened for a one-week window for updates vi=
a key exchange, or an educational institution may hold keys for each studen=
t that updates their coursework yearly or by semester yet otherwise is clos=
ed down and secured in the state model, under watchful eye, protected. this=
 too could occur with monetary exchange accessed through a substructure so =
employers payroll is automatically figured, and micro-taxation that could b=
e automatic to currency could be tabulated and tallied and recorded in this=
 central location and instead of taking money out and then returning it lat=
er, avoiding this lunacy for a just-in-time model where money accounts for =
its own existence and has identity yet does not create friction that preven=
ts monetary relations or exchange, allowing money its fluidic power.<br>
<br>the individual citizen then could be given a crypto key that is somehow=
 attached to an object, equivalent in some way to a social security card wi=
th specific ID number, yet with an authentication scheme based on a single =
unique entanglement (assuming classical quantum infrastructure is out in th=
e open) and thus the key has unique physical bits that ensure specific enta=
nglements with other paired bits elsewhere, that could be connected to this=
 central database of state. and from that, entangled further into a physica=
lly-based model of crypto, additional crypto keys that coexist in that doma=
in within infinity-models, that generate the everyday keys for accessing ba=
nk or school records or circuit diagrams of the self as a life plan, the so=
ciety actively involved and supporting development of itself in a shared fr=
amework of relations and exchange, ideas and intention, purpose and possibi=
lity for human civilization.<br>
<br>in other words, a person would carry a device that would be a keychain =
and have many active keys that are validated by an underlying state key tha=
t generates these others via physical hardware entanglement, perhaps a qbit=
-blackbox or something on a smartcard, yet its detachment from the person a=
lso could invalidate the key as it is a unique one-time correlation and thu=
s to forge it would collapse the entanglement, and other monitoring would t=
rack occurrences to prevent outside manipulations via biometric or other ve=
rification of identity. speculative, most entirely unknown though seemingly=
 feasible in the abstract, where the physical key of door/lock is updated i=
nto a future realm of entangled crypto keys as citizen ID, that then is a v=
alidation/verification system for establishing remote trust for other subsy=
stem crypto exchange via related or embedded key systems that could be adde=
d to the keychain. perhaps the quantum key resides within a home and only a=
ctivates the other keys yet need not be carried around once activating them=
, and thus provides a physical security barrier or air gap that could bound=
 any attack into the larger network or database system by whatever local ke=
y is accessed illegally, thus establishing perimeter defenses or other prot=
ocols to diagnose or act on the anomalous events.<br>
<br>it is questionable if such a keychain or crypto key system would involv=
e tracking by default, if not just in a data model given that the state may=
 have access to this information if needed, and thus in an emergency it may=
 change &#39;zone&#39; settings, open up the cell network, track a person d=
own and ring their phone to let them know of a connected event via automate=
d call, or other such functionality, though otherwise data could be anonymi=
zed and sensor networks and others would only focus on actual threats versu=
s dragnet the entire citizenry under hypersurveillence atmosphere where the=
 entire society is criminalized and made passive via fear of state violence=
 and retaliation for speaking differently or going against political party =
line, which is the daily situation in its economic, social, political conte=
xt as engineered by the binary ideologists to exploit as is.<br>
<br>in this way, crypto keys could differentiate zones of public from priva=
te and there could be state secured databases protected by law, whereby lik=
e a safe deposit box, information could be stored or this could be linked w=
ithin the home as well, decentralized, though in some sense &#39;security&#=
39; and &#39;secrecy&#39; of a private nature could be protected via these =
lawful resources that would only under extraordinary measures be accessible=
 by the state, under oversight, and monitored to ensure they are protected =
by government. for instance, someone may want photos of their granddaughter=
 to be passed on to her after the grandparents pass, and she has children, =
and such documents could be stored in such a place, as data files. maybe th=
at is not the idea of others, though it is in contrast to the &#39;fear the=
 state&#39; model if it were to exist in a context of human values, where t=
hese rights and principles and ideas are protected, then the database could=
 be citadel, a protected zone that will continue even if the house burns do=
wn or a parent dies and that data can be accessed and it is part of the pro=
cess of life within a context of electronic information and data resources =
like these.<br>
<br>the larger aspect is that such a tiered crypto system then could involv=
e house keys, vehicle keys (for eventual antigravity landspeeders i hope), =
&#39;money keys&#39; (access to currency, currency as information), state d=
atabase keys (subset: health, education, career, psychology, etc). etc.<br>
<br>the crypto infrastructure would be vital to establishing, sustaining, a=
nd securing and protecting the state and its citizenry, in addition to its =
role in secret communication which may take on other parameters in such a &=
#39;shared identity&#39; context, whereas other realms could involve unshar=
ed identity and involve tactical, strategic, operational crypto for other e=
nvironments and situations or tied into this as an infrastructure layer. sa=
y, if you&#39;re dealing with hostile robots who steal children or swap out=
 citizens and they need to be hunted down and eliminated, and so on.<br>
<br>parallel to this, hopefully the end of wi-fi will appear, the pollution=
 of the environment via electromagnetic radiation and interference with the=
 senses and nature, and regain what has been lost by toxic invisible skies =
continuing that terrible tradition of the first industrial revolutions, onc=
e citizens become literate that the technology is harming citizenry by unre=
gulated design and this relates to cancer and other issues, including nefar=
ious agendas to engineer illness, obesity, to devolve the society.<br>
<br>those codes can be broken, dismantled, revealed for the abuses of power=
 they involve and the antihuman agenda that the unconstitutional state is a=
llowing to exist, terrorizing citizens as its basis for legitimacy. the tru=
e terror today is the unlawful illegal unconstitutional state today. its co=
de is error-ridden, its ideology is completely unsound, and it is time it i=
s accounted for and error-corrected at the scale required to change its cir=
cuitry and given humanity the chance it deserves to succeed in this life. i=
f ever there has been a reason to fight, this is it.<br>
