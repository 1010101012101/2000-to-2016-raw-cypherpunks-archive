             Students PC seized after record
             industry complaint 

             By Cecily Barnes, CNET News.com

             Campus police confiscated an Oklahoma State University
             students computer after the Recording Industry Association
             of America notified the school that a person on campus was allegedly distributing
             copyrighted material.

                              The 19-year-olds computer system--including monitor,
                              keyboard, two CD burners, scanner and printer--was removed
                              earlier this month from his dorm room after campus police
                              determined he was operating an FTP server site that allowed
                              visitors to download MP3 music files and even several
                              full-length movies.

                              A representative for the RIAA confirmed that a letter was sent
             to university officials notifying them that a student appeared to be distributing
             copyrighted songs. The RIAA, which is embroiled in a high-profile copyright
             infringement case against the popular music-swapping site Napster, constantly
             prowls the Internet for repositories of music files.

             "We send out notices like this constantly," said RIAA spokeswoman Amy Weiss.
             "All were asking for is that the material is taken down. We leave it up to the
             universities to determine what to do or how to enforce this."

             OSU officials refused to disclose the students name or other details about the case.

             "He was advocating other people to download the music and upload music he didnt
             have," said James Alexander, an OSU assistant director. "Hed been advertising in
             chat rooms and we decided to notify the police."

             OSUs decision to confiscate this students computer equipment does not mean that
             all OSU students who trade music files are at risk. Alexander said the school does
             not block access to Napster and monitors the content of student Web sites only when
             objectionable material is brought to its attention.

             The seized computer gear included 105 gigabytes of hard drive space, of which
             about 40GB were made available to visitors. Assuming the average music file
             occupies about 4MB, the student could have had approximately 10,000 songs
             available for download.

             Everett Eaton, public safety director at OSU, said the department obtained a search
             warrant from the Payne County District Court in Oklahoma and seized the students
             computer equipment.

             "Were doing some forensic review of the hard drive and determining what is there,"
             Eaton said. "After we finish that review, we will evaluate the amount of substance
             he was distributing."

             College campuses, which often provide high-speed Internet connections to students,
             have become a focal point in the record industrys effort to eradicate the distribution
             of copyrighted material.

             Several schools, including Indiana University, the University of Southern California
             and Yale University, blocked access to Napster after being named as defendants in a
             lawsuit by rock group Metallica.

             Last week, the attorney representing Metallica and rap star Dr. Dre sent letters to
             other top universities urging them to do the same.
