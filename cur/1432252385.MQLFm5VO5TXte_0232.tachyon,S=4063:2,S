GEO is lousy: it's too far away, and it's packed already. Newer concepts
assume LEO with active microwave focus tracking of the rectenna ground
array with phased array antennas integrated into the solar array. You have
to have sufficient amounts of hardware in the sky for continuous line of
sight presence.

Problem is high LEO launch costs. It would seem easier to build automated
and teleoperate fabbing and (linear motor) launching facilities on Luna,
and circularize orbit mostly by aerobraking.
