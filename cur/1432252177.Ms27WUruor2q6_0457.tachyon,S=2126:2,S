Depends. If you're planning on knocking over the Empire State building then 
even if they can't crack your code (in a reasonable amount of time) they 
still have sender/receiver IP as well as a host of other information.

Come to think of it, isn't the encryption length itself unencoded in the 
header? Even if not, if your message falls into a high enough risk bucket to 
merit an all-out assault, if your message doesn't yield then after a certain 
point they'll start realizing that you probably cooked your own and did it 
very well. In THAT case they probably start thinking about sending a 
blackbag operation into your neighborhood.
