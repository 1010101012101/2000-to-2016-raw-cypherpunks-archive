I'll know I'll regret responding to the mattdproffraptroll, but briefly: I 
am not affiliated in any way with the Cato Institute. I don't believe I've 
ever written anything for them; I am not an adjunct scholar/policy analyst 
for them; I've been in their building just once in the last five months or 
so. Most importantly, they say things with which I do not agree.

That said, they are a worthy, respectable, valuable, and valued think tank, 
and I always enjoy reading what they write.

As for a "damming exposure," it's just another screed. Yawn.
