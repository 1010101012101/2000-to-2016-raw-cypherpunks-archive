This exchange is about writing code, somewhat cypherpunkly.

Jonathan Wallace's BESS/N2H2 post reminds, me...

A friend of mine runs a "garage ISP", on which I run some mailing
lists.  I got deluged with bounces the other day, all from a new
subscriber.  The mail from the (hi-traffick) list they'd joined was all
being returned, with a notice from that person's ISP saying that the
mail was blocked because the site it was sent from is blacklisted on
the ORBS anti-spam blacklist for running an open mail relay.  Funny
thing is, my friend's little ISP has not run an open mail relay is well
over a year.  Not only that, but ORBS is dead.  The "organization"
folded, and no updates to their blacklists have been published in
months.

The upshot of this is pretty scary, given that an estimated 40% of US
ISPs and 20% of ALL ISPs are using ORBS, MAPS and other.  Your ability
to communicate via SMTP with your friends, family and associates around
the world is largely dependent on sysadmins remembering to dilligently
update their blacklist subscriptions and thinking to ensure that their
chosen blacklist is actually still viable (as much as any of them can
be called that to begin with).  Not only that, but when a
spamcensorware maker kicks the bucket, if your site is blacklisted *it
can never be unblacklisted ever again, from that particular list, for
all eternity* and some site somewhere WILL be using that blacklist, for
years.  Meanwhile innocent list admins get tarred with bounce floods,
people cannot reach who they are trying to mail, and users whose ISPs
don't bother to inform them much less adhere to an opt-in (or even
opt-out) spambouncing policy will not receive mail intended for them
and often never even know about it.

The only thing worse than a blacklist, is a blacklist that is "in-play"
in the real world, but not being corrected.

If/when MAPS dies, this problem is going to *explode*.  Hardly anyone
used ORBS and this has already caused a lot of people severe headaches
that still continue.  But, maybe the problem will be so big if/when
that happens that blacklists will largely be simply abandoned.

NB: I'm not against individual spam filtering - I do it agressively
myself, and subscribe to several group-maintained *invidual-use*
blacklists that I've chosen to trust (more or less).  I'm referring to
ISP-level "stealth blocking", esp. that based on the technical
capabilities of the sending site, rather than said site being a known
spam house.

In principle I'm not sure if this is a terribly difficult problem to
solve. If the costs to subscribing to antispamlists are still not as
great as the (growing) problem of spam, admins will still want a
service and someone will probably create it.

Given sufficient demand of this sort, a standard interface may well
emerge. This would allow sites to subscribe to a antispamlist
maintainer uber-service that would selectively add and drop
MAPS/ORBS/etc. as they become more and less useful. This may be a pay
service. It would allow ISPs and individual users not to worry about
what happens if one service dies; within a few moments, one hopes, the
maintainer service would remove it. Queries would go to the maintainer
service, not the individual antispamlists.

The maintainer service could also provide the useful feature of a
standard interface; give it an IP address and it would query the
antispamlist vendors using their individual different protocols.

Obviously ISPs see a benefit to using antispamlists. Just arguing
against them isn't very persuasive; it doesn't give them a way to solve
their growing spam problem.

If EFF is concerned about this policy area (and I recognize it may be
just your personal opinion), it may want to provide the useful service
of recommending ways to improve the protocols and what marketing
flacks call "best practices."

If people begin to care about what you call stealth blocking, ISPs
will probably begin to disclose it. Perhaps an ISP trade association
will recommend a link on the home page. Then you could take your
business to an ISP, if you care enough, that does not subscribe to
antispamlists -- as long as you're willing to pay more because of the
additional bandwidth, storage, and personnel costs imposed by the
higher volume of spam.
