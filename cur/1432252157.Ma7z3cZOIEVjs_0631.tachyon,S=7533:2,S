Well, I saw the got.net quote before and that brief sample seemed to 
indicate something entirely different to me. First of all, it says they've 
'talked to the authorities about him' seems allows for the possibility of 
having been contacted BY said authorities. Second, it points out "he hasn't 
broken any laws"...third it says "please notify me when he actually breaks 
the law..."...that's kind of a nice, business-smart "fuck off" as I see it.

In other words, the guy seems to acknowledge that he doesn't like a lot of 
Tim May's philosophies, but he won't even think about doing anything unless 
Mr May personally murders someone or whatever. In other words, he's saying 
he's going to support Tim May's free speech, but he's saying it in a way 
that won't cause him to end up in Guantanamo.

But then again, that's the only quote I've seen...
