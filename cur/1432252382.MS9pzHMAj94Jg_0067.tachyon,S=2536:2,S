Hi Tom,

A while back I was  let go from my employment I held for 25 plus years.

I can't thank you enough for starting  me in this new profession. You have
given me a exciting lease on life.  Already taking home twice as much as I
earned in my old job.  

I purchased  a brand new Mercedes. Taking home 6 digit level in 18 months.
Having a great time in this business. It is exciting and I am a hero to the
judges and to my clients. What an outstanding profession to be in.

Doing exactly what your training recommends me to do, is proceeding better
than I ever dreamed possible.  I go to the local court house and locate all
of the clients I can handle. 

I take advantage of your advanced reporting services to find all items
which can be garnished. Using your fill in the blank forms I send them thru
the post office to the appropriate firms. Then the funds arrive to my PO
Box.  Its like magic.  I love it. 

I can take a holiday when ever I have the impulse to do so.  France and
Holland this year. 

Please provide this letter to others.  This profession is so massive it
needs many more of us assisting the courts and the  people who have been
damaged.

Sincerely,
Arthur N.    Virginia    


This may well be you!
