One practical method that has been, and still remains popular it seems, is a 
trusted hub approach. DirectConnect, as a more recent example, allows anyone to 
set up a central hub, and then filter the people connecting to it (e.g. by 
amount of files shared, or by personal acquaintance), in a very "localised" 
peer-2-peer group. This is the same tactic adopted by pre-Napster set-ups such 
as IRC channels, et al.

The obvious downside is immediate choice. Obscurity is naturally exaggerated in 
comparison to a completely open network. However, smaller groups tend to 
encourage increased validity of files being offered, especially when only a 
small number of those people are offering it.

This obscurity can be countered in a number of ways - chained networking, in 
that one person can be in many groups and thus has access to a wider range, 
coupled with an anonymous request/barter-driven facility would decrease 
obscurity without losing much of the validity implicit in trusted groups. 
History suggests that even in such fragmented environments, content can travel 
to as many people in as short a time as an open network.

Under this scenario, the opportunities to spread false files are much more 
limited, as their scope from origin would be more contained, probably averaging 
2 or 3 interlinked groups at most.

Not perfect, clearly. But it does seem to be the surviving philosophy.
