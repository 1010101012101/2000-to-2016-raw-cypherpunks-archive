   Newsletter
 For the week of Wednesday, February 7, 2000

"It is a popular illness." 
--International Olympic Committee (IOC) medical chief 
Alexandre de Merode on the high numbers of top-class 
competitors taking steroid-based drugs for asthma at 
Olympics (six times greater than at last year's Sydney Games).

STARTING LINE
Shaquille O'Neal will miss the NBA All-Star game because of 
a sore foot.  The L.A. center says, "Hopefully I can come 
back soon.  I'm a big 18-wheeler and one of my wheels ain't 
working, which means I can't go. But I'm getting air in the 
tire."... 

... How about fixing the drive train on the free throw 
mechanism?

HOLLYWOOD SPORTS
EXCLUSIVE: A report from our Sundance Film Festival Gala and 
Police Raid in Park City, Utah. A Happy Place Productions 
and your very own SportsHollywood teamed up to throw one of 
the most talked-about parties at the festival (and at the 
police department). You may have even read or heard about 
this one in the national press (can you say "Temporary 
Restraining Order?" That's how big it was). It was covered 
by everyone from Entertainment Weekly to CNN to Tiger 
Beat... and probably soon on Court TV... 

But here's what they didn't tell you....
http://www.sportshollywood.com/sundance.html

During the New York Knicks' victory over the Heat in Miami, 
referee Joe Forte ejected singer / songwriter Jimmy Buffett 
from the stands for using profanity...

... So he got drunk and got screwed - what's new?

... They gotta stop serving Margaritas before the games...

NBA
Clifford Robinson of the Phoenix Suns was arrested Monday on 
charges of driving under the influence and marijuana 
possession...

... No comment from Robinson... just giggling...

GOLF
John Daly had a 9 on his first hole Saturday in the Pebble 
Beach National Pro-Am. Three holes into the day, he was 
already 10 over. Only four birdies on his last six holes 
enabled him to finish with a 79. "It was just weird," he 
said, shaking his head. "Ten over after three holes..." 

... And .08 over later that afternoon...

XFL
Billing itself as tougher, dirtier and meaner than the NFL, 
The XFL is started its first season...

... It's so desperate for attention that it won't be long 
before the XFL employs murderers, rapists and drug 
addicts... wait -- the NFL already does that...

TENNIS
I think I've seen enough of Anna Kournikova... well, not 
really, but how about Jennifer Lopez's butt for a change?

THIS WEEK IN SPORTS HISTORY
In 2000, Dennis Rodman joined the Dallas Mavericks, paying 
him about $465,000 for the remainder of the season...

... Plus extra if he would cheerlead as a Maverick Girl, too...

George Foster became baseball's first "two million dollar 
man" today in 1982 when he signed a five year, ten million 
dollar free agent deal with the New York Mets...

... Ten mil - or as A-Rod calls it -'beer money'...

PENALTY BOX
"MARK CHMURA, YOU'VE JUST BEEN ACQUITTED OF ASSAULTING A 
TEENAGER! WHERE ARE YOU HEADED NOW?" One day after being 
acquitted of sexually assaulting a teen-ager, former Green 
Bay Packer tight end Mark "Chewy" Chmura broke down in tears 
as he apologized for his conduct and wished to resume his 
NFL career. Chmura said he would celebrate his acquittal by 
going to Disney World before attempting to resume his pro 
career...

... Great - head right to a place with a lot of teenage 
girls...

For the entire Offensive Line:
http://www.sportshollywood.com/shnews.html

Joel Blankenship, head football coach at Detroit 
Murray-Wright High School, faces a police investigation into 
charges he used a twenty-six-inch long wooden paddle to 
strike players who got poor grades or broke other school 
rules.  One fifteen-year-old freshman claims he received ten 
blows with the paddle, and that Blankenship struck him so 
hard the paddle cracked...

... Now there's a man headed for the XFL... He can spank the 
cheerleaders...

YOU'RE OUT:
"He called me a 'rapist' and a 'recluse'. I'm not a recluse."
- Mike Tyson, on writer Wallace Matthews 

The Dumbest Sports Quotes of All Time:
http://www.sportshollywood.com/dumbquotes.html

EDITORS NOTE: I meant to thank you guys for passing the 
SportsHollywood newsletter along, the membership is going 
nuts. We're being mentioned on sports newscasts and getting 
tons of free press over this goofy party at Sundance. Lots 
of embarrassing stuff there. I'm so ashamed.... not -- 
Rodney Lee
