Yup.

At the binary level with no headers, "good" algorithms should definitly
look alike.  There's always some data left by the implementation tho,
so in practice you've got some foothold.  But I'm willing to bet that
encrypting megabytes of 0x00000's with the same keys on different ciphers
whould show some kind of statistical foothold.  "looking" like random and
"being" random aren't the same.  Especially if you've got an army of
mathematicians to keep busy :-)

But since I've never actually done it, I don't know how big that army
needs to be.

Patience, persistence, truth,
