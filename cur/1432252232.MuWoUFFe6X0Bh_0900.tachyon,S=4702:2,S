Is what she wrote being alleged to be untrue?  From my perspective 
disparaging politicians is like shooting fish in a barrel.  Usually 
all that is needed is to truthfully compare their campaign speeches 
to their actual voting or other practices.

I'm being represented by attorney Robbin Stewart (Brother of 
Cypherpunk Bill Stewart) in an anonymous speech case as we speak. 
Robin has had several victories in Indianapolis for anon political 
speech.  His first victory was inspired from Freematt's Alerts, 
Robbin had read some commentary from my list on McIntyre v. Ohio 
Elections Commission that prompted him to challenge a city ordinance 
that ordered him to remove a campaign sign from his residence (The 
sign didn't have who paid or wrote it written on it.) The ordinance 
was overturned in the Indiana Supreme Court.

Regards,  Matt-
