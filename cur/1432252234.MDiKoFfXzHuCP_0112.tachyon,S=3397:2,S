I may as well speak up as well then... I spent most of a chapter of my thesis
looking at formal security verification in fairly exhaustive detail (if I
missed anything I'm sure I'll hear about it soon :-).  You can get it as
http://www.cryptoapps.com/~peter/04_verif_techniques.pdf.  The conclusion is
that there are more effective ways to spend your time and money, but for the
full story I'd recommend you read the above document.
