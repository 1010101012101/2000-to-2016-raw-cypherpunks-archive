    High Court Denies Reporter's Kiddie-Porn Appeal
    posted by cicero on Thursday October 05, @11:52AM
    from the so-much-for-a-fair-trial dept.

    The Supreme Court this week declined to hear an appeal from a
    journalist convicted of trafficking in child porn, which means
    veteran reporter Larry Matthews will be spending some 18 months in
    prison. Brill's Content has an in-depth article on the case, including
    how the judge barred Matthews from using the First Amendment as a
    defense when arguing before the jury. That seems wrongheaded. No
    matter whether Matthews downloaded nude images for a story or not --
    he had deleted them by the time the FBI raided his home -- he should
    have the right to tell a jury his story. Also see an amicus brief
    filed by a journalists' group, and a writeup in the Washington City
    Paper.
