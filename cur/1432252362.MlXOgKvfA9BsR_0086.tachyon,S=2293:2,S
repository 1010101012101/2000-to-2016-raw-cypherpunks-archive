For on-line clearing, a copy of the spent "coin" stops double-spending. 
I would not call it a "coin," however. We should reserve the word 
"coin" for things which behave like coins, e.g, things that clear 
locally without presentation to an issuer or other entity.

For off-line clearing, double-spending is a significant and hard 
problem. Perhaps unsolvable.

If so, then there are no digital coins and never will be.

(I don't count token-based systems, using smartcards or "observers," as 
digital coins.)

Everything connected with money costs money, by the way. Even keeping 
copies and comparing them to newly-presented exemplars.
