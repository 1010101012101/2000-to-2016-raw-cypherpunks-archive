An individual can simply fabricate an e-mail outright (requesting the help
file to provide himself with an easily-modified template and log entries
on on the mail relayy) or just not even show it. "Umm...Like I got this
death threat... but I deleted it" would be sufficient for some of the more
spineless providers.

It seems as though if you're running as a middleman and you encounter a
plaintext message, it'll encrypt the message with the next remailer's key
before it mails it out. But I only took a quick look at the code.
