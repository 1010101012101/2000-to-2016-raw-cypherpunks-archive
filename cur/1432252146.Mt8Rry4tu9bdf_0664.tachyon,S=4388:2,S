Twice since my grand jury appearance I've been contacted
by persons claiming to be journalists for comment on Jim
Bell's case.

I referred them to Cryptome for the best representation
of my views. Both resisted that, claiming they wanted to hear
from me personally.

What is striking is the similarity of their questions to those asked
during the grand jury appearance by Robb London and by
jury members, in particular my view of "anti-government activity,"
stalking of federal officials, and Assassination Politics, as well
as why AP was on Cryptome.

I explained to both callers that due to the possibility my grand
jury testimony may be used against me it was prudent for me to
refer them to files on Cryptome, and when it became available, the
testimony transcript. That I did not want to go beyond what 
was already publicly available.

Neither caller was satisfied with that, and persisted in asking
leading questions about AP and anti-government activities.
They also asked who else could they talk to about these
topics.

I said there was nobody I could suggest to talk to; that AP was 
a provocative exploration of digital technologies but not at all
lethal; and that I was not anti-government but opposed to 
government abuse of power and its excessive secrecy. 
That I did not advocate violence against public officials, 
though insults, ridicule, disrespect for their career ambitions 
were duties of the conscientious citizen.

Now that the feds have subpoenaed me for the trial and have 
refused to provide a transcript of my grand jury testimony, it 
seems to me that the feds are behaving characteristically
treacherously (as others have warned), and are likely to 
have used "journalists" to get me to incriminate myself 
and/or to name other targets for investigation or subpoenas.

So in case others are being queried for stories here are 
the names and affiliations of the "journalists" who called and 
would not take my referral to Cryptome for an answer.
