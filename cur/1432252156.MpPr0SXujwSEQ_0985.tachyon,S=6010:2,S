Hi Matt,

I've read into the Jornal do Brasil site and others (O Globo [1] and
Terra[2]) and don't see any mention of the new legislation.  I'll check w/
family in Brazil but if you get further word and could spread the word that
would be great.

thanks,
C.G.

I haven't heard anything like that around here. Ive searched JB and 
have found nothing to that respect. Furthermore, it seems a bit 
unBrazilian to take such a stance. Brazilian nationals do not have a 
Constitutional Right to bear arms ( not even for a well-regulated 
militia) and there has been a clear legislative movement towards 
restricting as much as possible the use / permission to use / 
purchase of firearms. Some time ago there was a bill introduced in 
the Brazilian Congress seeking to ban all civilian firearms, except 
for rural citizens rifles.

Even it the news was true, it would be the fastest ever action ever 
from Congress. The Brazilian Congress simply is not able to legislate 
that fast. The only way to introduce legislation with such urgency is 
by Provisional Measures, which is somewhat like an Executive Order. 
The President passes a Provisional Measure, which has the same 
efficacy of law during 60 days; during that period congress must 
confirm or deny the Measure. If confirmed, it is converted into law.

I'm really skeptical about this - handguns are generally banned in 
Brazil, so it seems really unlikely that they'd suddenly be permitted 
aboard airlines - a policy change that radical and that fast seems 
too good to be true.

I searched on Yahoo's Brazilian news - see 
<http://br.yahoo.com/noticias/> looking for "pistola" or "revolver" 
and couldn't find any mention of the change, though I did find some 
news stories about local shootings, and about how some US residents 
are buying guns because of the WTC attacks. (My mother-in-law is 
Brazilian, so I get some exposure to Portugese, but am far from 
fluent.)
