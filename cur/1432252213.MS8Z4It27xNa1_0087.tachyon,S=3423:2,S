By "like a nuclear war" he meant, and I mean, like the escalation 
scenarios for a nuclear war. Not the damage effects, unless things 
get _really_ weird.

This was clear from his context, and from general game-theoretic 
discussions over the years about nuclear war. For example, "use them 
or lose them," counter-force," "scorched earth," and similar 
scenarios and metaphors.
