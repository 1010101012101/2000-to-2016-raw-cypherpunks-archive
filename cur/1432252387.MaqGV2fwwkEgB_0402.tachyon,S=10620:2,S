The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its p|an to

milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a real problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Persona| Gateway from any ce||ular or |and|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,O00 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products will comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a global scale. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
