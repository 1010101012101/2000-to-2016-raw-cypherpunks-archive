These reasons are largely why ear shape, ear-eye-mouth geometry, etc., 
have been increasingly used in face recognition schemes. It is very 
difficult to use makeup to modify fundamental geometries over these 
scales, and fundamental geometries are easy to do math on (using affine 
or projective geometry, for example).

While a woman may be able to change her eye appearance, her lip shape, 
or even her eyebrow shape, she cannot easily change the affine geometry 
of ear-nose-eye-chin. Men cannot do even this, lest they be considered 
fags, but they can of course change beard characteristics...which is 
why no face recognitions worth a dime to Big Brother use facial hair 
(or hair style in general) as a determinant.

A friend of mine is doing a lot of work with "support vector machines" 
as generalization of neural nets, Hopfield networks, and other learning 
systems. Quite amazing how hard it is to hide from such classifiers. A 
little bit of makeup just doesn't do it, not when these systems have 
been trained on hundreds of thousands of exemplars with varying amounts 
of eye shade, eye liner, lipstick, and facial hair alterations.
