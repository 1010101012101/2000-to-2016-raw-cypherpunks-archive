It's becoming easier for the public, though.  Apple's new Mac OS X 10.3 
includes S/MIME built into the mailer.  No more watching their eyes 
glaze over as I explain to my friends that they first have to install 
GPG, then find a plugin for their mail program, then try to teach them 
to create & send people keys.

I prefer the GPG model of relying on people I actually trust to certify 
a key belongs to who it claims to belong to than relying on a 
corporation, but at least this will start people thinking about 
securing their mail.
