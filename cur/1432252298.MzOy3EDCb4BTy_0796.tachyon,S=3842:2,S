He earned killing. You would be justified in arranging his death, if 
this really happened.

If this really happened and you have not yet taken him out with a good 
rifle, why not?

(I realize you cannot say one way or the other whether you delivered 
justice to this (alleged)  miscreant, but my point remains.)

Personally, I doubt your story. Someone who does what you say was done 
to you has clearly earned killing.
