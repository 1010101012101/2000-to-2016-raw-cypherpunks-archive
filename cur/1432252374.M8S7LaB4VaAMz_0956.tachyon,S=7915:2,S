Dear "Joe Cypherpunk":


Thank you very much for your email and your kind words!

However, I have to stress to you that no member of Better A Millstone was 
responsible for taking down BoyChat, Girl Chat, and their domain, 
"ivan.net", and we have to be very careful that we are not connected with 
such illegal activity.

Now, whereas we are happy that BoyChat and Girl Chat are indeed down, as a 
legal organization that has a good relationship with law enforcement 
agencies around the world, we can not be associated with the illegal 
activities of hackers, no mater how worth of being shut down the specific 
web sites are.

All we a Better A Millstone do is provide information and intelligence about 
child sex predators, child pornographers, and their web sites by emails and 
on our web pages...and if someone happens to read this material and then get 
angry enough to take on of their web sites down, then we were simply the 
messenger.

I hope that you understand!

Now, if you would like to join us in working legally to deal with the child 
sex predators and child pornographers and their web sites, please read this 
email and the application email that I will send to you separately.

Membership in Better A Millstone--BAM for short--is open to anyone age 18 
and up who has basic Internet expertise and access and who does not have any 
felony or misdemeanor convictions involving children.

To familiarize yourself with BAM and what we do, please go to BAM's main web 
page at <http://www.shadow-net.com>.  Then go to the menu of BAM's other web 
pages at the bottom of that page and click on them to visit them and learn 
as much as you can about Better A Millstone and the information that we have 
available on the Internet and what we do.

Please understand that as a member of BAM you will be helping to protect 
children by spending part of your life gathering intelligence and 
information about child sex predators and child pornographers who are 
engaged in ingratiating themselves to innocent and unwitting children for 
the purpose of sexually assaulting and photographing them by acting as "The 
Internet Eyes & Ears for Law Enforcement".

You will be expected to spend a minimum of three hours a week lurking on the 
Internet as a child advocate and to be proactive in going on the Internet 
and gathering intelligence and information about suspected child sex 
predators and child pornographers and providing same to the appropriate law 
enforcement agencies (i.e., the specific law enforcement agencies within 
whose jurisdictions the child sex predators and child pornographers are 
operating, such as U.S. Customs for virtually ALL Internet sex crimes 
involving children as well as state and local police departments where these 
perpetrators are operating).

And you will be expected to not only initiate contact with these law 
enforcement agencies but also to follow up with them to see that they do 
indeed take your information seriously and take action.  And if you are not 
satisfied that they are doing what you think they should do to protect 
children, you are asked to contact other members of BAM for assistance.

Further, please understand that everyone who applies to become a volunteer 
member of Better A Millstone must go to their local police or other law 
enforcement agency to have their identification verified and a criminal 
background check completed and submitted to Better A Millstone.  Now, if you 
still wish to apply to become a member of Better A Millstone, please fill 
out and return the online application which has been sent to you separately.

Once you have been accepted as a member of BAM, you will be given 
instructions and information via e-mail to help you learn what to do.
And you will be provided with e-mail addresses to contact seasoned members 
of BAM to help you learn how to do your work.

Once you feel confident about what you have been taught, you will be free to 
apply your interests and talents to help protect children on the Internet 
independent of someone telling you what you must or must not do.  But, for 
your own safety as well as to uphold the principles of BAM, you will be 
expected to abide by a few simple rules:

(1) Never, ever, download and save child pornography!

(2) Always write down and save the URL (i.e., Internet address) of web sites 
with such material!

(3) Never, ever, pose as an adult or teenager seeking sex with a child or 
child pornography!

(4) Always keep detailed records of anyone who asks this of you (i.e., their 
e-mail address, IRC number, ICQ number, etc.).

After filling out and returning the On-Line Application for Better A 
Millstone (which is being sent to you as a separate e-mail) and being 
accepted as a member of BAM, you will receive a detailed e-mail to help you 
learn the ropes so that you can be an effective Internet child advocate.

Looking forward to receiving your on-line application,

I remain,

Most sincerely yours,

Mike Echols, Founder & Executive Director, Better A Millstone, Inc.
