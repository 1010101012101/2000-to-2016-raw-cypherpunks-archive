Let's see, agreeing by waving the flag is OK but disagreeing is
forbidden. Just garden variety fascism. How many kids were suspended for
the political speech that is wearing flags?

Annoying is an weak adjective to describe training our children to
accept censorship. They're a bunch of goddamned authoritarian shitheads.
People who think that way would be perfect little middle managers in a
Hitlerian Germany or the Cold War USSR. They deserve no place here.

Is that "cruft" or "crust" or would just plain dingleberry do? Or
Himmler?

I think that the dynamic in operation here is that maintaining the fear
level will :

1) allow the USA PATRIOT machinery implementation to proceed as planned
2) delay legal assaults against the USA PATRIOT act

As long as the fear levels are kept high, the "you're either with
AMERICA or against it" cry can be used to protect the power grab. The
longer the power grab persists the more difficult it will be to
dismantle in the future. I'm not quite as convinced as Tim that the
country is 100% fucked but we're sure as hell past the halfway point and
running at full throttle.
