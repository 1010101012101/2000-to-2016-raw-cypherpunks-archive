The SMB problem is not a "Linux only" issue. Samba runs under all sorts of
things, including BSD.

Interestingly enough, the bug slipped through a number of third party
security audits.  It was introduced sometime in the 1.9.x code and was not
found until very reciently.

As for "Linux being horribly insecure", that depends on the distribution.

There are some very secure versions of Linux. (Immunix is one.
http://www.immunix.org/) Just running apps you think are secure is not
enough.  Does OpenBSD deal with format bugs? Temp races? Stack overflows?
That only deals with the majority of problems, not all of them. It does
not deal with mistakes in the protocol (as happened here) or mistakes in
coding.

OpenBSD does some good things, but it is not all that is out there.
