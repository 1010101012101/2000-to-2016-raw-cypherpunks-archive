The concept of, and respect for private property are essential 
elements of individual liberty.  They cannot be separated.  There 
is an inverse proportion between the power the governments have 
over private property and freedom.

It is the initiation of force that is wrong.  People who try to rob 
others should have their behavior regulated by being killed by 
their intended victims.  Hiring professionals to deal with robbers 
is a valid response to the robbers' initiation of force.  Killing 
people who use force to regulate individuals who smoke in public is 
also a legitimate response to the their initiation of force.
