demand or scheduled conference calls allow the moderators control
to conduct their own conference calls in a convenient, quick and
cost effective manner. With firmly established relationships

=======================================



VCL's customer base will have access to undisrupted services

telecommunications services along with very competitive rates to
end users. VCL has state of the art technology and relationships
with key providers that will allow VCL to be a leader within the
teleconferencing industry. VCL's products and services can be

The voice conference call market has posted unparalleled growth
over the past three years with annual growth averaging 30 to 40%.
This $2 billion dollar market is estimated to become a $17
billion dollar industry within the next 2 years.  This growth is
due, in large part, to the globalization of businesses around the
world and uneasiness within the travel industry due to recent
events.  Growth is also taking place because of the
implementation of the Regulation Fair Disclosure Act in the
United States that requires all public reporting companies to
make earnings and analyst conference calls, corporate media
announcements and other information available simultaneously to
all investors.  Similar changes in regulatory policies in
England, Canada and Japan are imminent.


+>+>+>  SUMMARY...  There is still an opportunity to invest
within the teleconferencing industry.  With the recent
acquisition of VCL Communications Corp.,   http://www.viacall.com 
(OTCBB: UDCCF),  investors can participate in this rapidly
growing market.
