One way accommodation, wherein men accommodate female differences, but 
females do not accommodate male differences, is dysfunctional, as 
demonstrated by Katherine Hultgreen, and also admits the inequality that 
it denies.

If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards 
are upheld, this implicitly admits that women are different from men, 
and therefore in some activities and aspects inferior, while in others, 
the properly feminine sphere, superior.

If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they 
fail to live up to characteristically male standards.

If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special 
treatment, 
http://www.the-spearhead.com/2011/11/13/special-needs-employees/ then 
they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male 
forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine 
environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying 
to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women 
are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.

If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards 
are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets 
replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing 
an Amelia Earhart.

If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the 
Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special 
treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.

That path does not work.

Characteristically male environments are characteristically male because 
of characteristically male virtues.  Characteristically female 
environment are characteristically female because of characteristically 
female virtues.  If we are to have integration without social decay, 
then females entering a characteristically male environment need to live 
up to difficult, stressful, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar standards, as 
Katherine Hultgreen demonstrated in the most dramatic and terrible 
possible fashion, and Cari Matchet demonstrated in a more frivolous and 
amusing fashion.
