Squawking on a mailing list is protected behavior, and 
I figure you can probably do that all you want.  As 
someone else here pointed out, "You have to do something 
else" before they can arrest you.

But now that certain types of code have been criminalized, 
writing code counts as "something else".  So the lesson 
is, if you squawk on mailing lists, don't write code. If 
you write code, don't squawk on mailing lists, especially 
about the illegitimate uses to which criminals may put 
your code. 

So we each must come to our own decision; write code, 
or continue to squawk?  Because cypherpunks, unless they 
want to join the canarypunks, don't write code anymore. 
My decision is made. 

Goodbye.  This list wasn't a good coding resource anyway; 
maybe I'll check out perrypunks or something.  Happy 
squawking.

And in response to the inevitable "don't let the door 
hit your ass on the way out", here's my response in 
advance: Don't let them slam the jail doors on your 
dicks, I hear that hurts like a sonofabitch.
