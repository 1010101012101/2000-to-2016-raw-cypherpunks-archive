??????????


As with "A. Melon," you apparently don't bother to read the news.

Jacobson was giving a talk, using his laptop for the talk, and 
stepped away for a few moments to talk to some journalists.

One can learn from his mistake, but the thrust of your comments, 
"walking around with secrets of that severity..." is way off-base.

Folks, if you don't read the news, or watch it on CNN and CNBC and 
the like, please don't feel compelled to add foolish remarks.
