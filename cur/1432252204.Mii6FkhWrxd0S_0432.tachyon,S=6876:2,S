"...Clustering technology is designed to help companies leverage the power 
of interconnected computers by letting them serve as a single processing 
unit. The technology promises more powerful applications that provide a 
scalable, low-cost alternative to high-end, centralized servers, such as 
those sold by IBM.
"The key is the clusters, because high-end computing is the focus of our 
company," said Staats. "Linux is the ideal operating system for the 
clustering environment."
Growing Interest
With major players like Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) looking 
at clustering technologies, Terra Soft is positioned for growth, especially 
because the Xserve has been well-received in the technical community.
Staats said after three years of making Linux available for Apple 
computers, things are finally beginning to fall into place for Terra Soft.
"There are now a large number of third-party solutions and products and 
vendors and service providers and clients that are jumping on the Yellow 
Dog [Linux] boat," said Staats.
All About Science
Terra Soft recently shipped version 2.3 of Yellow Dog Linux. The newest 
version offers the KDE desktop, which provides features like graphical user 
interface "translucency."
Oh and "Now and then, for no good reason, life will haul off and knock a 
man flat," the father consoles his son. The 1957 Disney movie OLD YELLER is 
like that. For most of the film, it is a light hearted slice of life with 
scenes reminiscent of the old Disney nature documentaries. Toward the end, 
the movie takes a sharp turn, transforming it into a tragedy.
For bill Gates I hope.
