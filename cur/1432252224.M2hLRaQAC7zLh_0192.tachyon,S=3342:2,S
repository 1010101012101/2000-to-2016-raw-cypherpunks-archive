No subtlety, just an observation that non-techies found it much
easier to use the protocol since it came 'bundled'.  Imagine
all the online hausfrau trying to install a packet driver, shims, 
debugging it...

My point is that MS made Netscape's life easier by having a stack already
deployed.  And clearly Netscape made the that stack (and the computer) more
useful, at least easier to use.

And clearly the NSF giving up control allowed the current mess.

I'm well aware of the dangers of saying anything positive about
MS in a public forum.  Maybe they'll be charged under antitrust law
by all those stack-vendors who went belly-up when MS bundled 
extra functionality into the OS.  Just like when Weitek sues
Intel for bundling their FP biz into Intel's CPUs.
