    God save this great land from Tony Blair and his do-good elitest
    liberal-left New World Order. <p>

    Who's going to pay for this falderal? The Brits can't find the
    lion's tail, let alone swish it --oh, Uncle Sugar's going to
    foot the bill to reduce our standard of living to that of a
    third world nation so we can all suffer equally and fundamentalists
    can gain power over the still oppressed? <p>

    Nice words, Tony; great ideals, but how about getting down to
    the business at hand and winning the war between two cultures.

    Tony Blair: 'Let us reorder this world'
    						</b></font><br>
    Michael White, political editor <br>
    &copy; The Guardian </center><br>

    Tony Blair yesterday turned his battle against the
    terrorists who ravaged New York into a far wider
    struggle for a new world order that would uphold human
    dignity and social justice "from the slums of Gaza to
    the mountain ranges of Afghanistan". <p>

    In what was almost certainly the most powerful speech of
    his career, the prime minister used his speech to the
    Labour conference to synthesise an uncompromising
    hostility to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network - and
    the Taliban if they do not give him up - with a vaunting
    promise to remake the world as a better place. <p>

    The sweep and moral fervour of the 54-minute address
    caught friend and foe off guard. There were no party
    political jibes and barely a triumphalist mention of
    Labour's historic June 7 election victory. The
    Conservatives damned the performance with faint praise. <p>

    Evidently sensitive to charges that he was sounding too
    confrontational, Mr Blair acknowledged that many people
    are fearful of what lies ahead - and sought to reassure
    voters whose unwavering support is vital to a long
    campaign. <p>

    "Our way of life is a great deal stronger and will last
    a greal deal longer than the actions of fanatics, small
    in number and now facing a unified world against
    them. People should have confidence. This is a battle
    with only one outcome: our victory, not theirs," he
    insisted. <p>

    Admitting his own helplessness in the face of so much
    bereavement on September 11, Mr Blair had earlier said
    of the dead: "They don't want revenge, they want
    something better in memory of their loved ones. I
    believe their memorial can and should be that out of the
    shadow of this evil should emerge lasting good." <p>

    The speech, which was, unusually, drafted by Mr Blair
    himself, also reflected his private moral preoccupations
    to an unusual degree.  But before a largely secular
    audience it was repeatedly punctuated with bursts of
    applause in the packed but sombre Brighton conference
    centre, where the foreshortened 2001 conference ends
    today. <p>

    As the prime minister sat down he was praised for his
    vision and tone by friends and critics alike within
    Labour's ranks, though delegates may come down to earth
    with a jolt when they size up to the challenges he posed
    in the name of "the power of community" - local and
    global - to do good. <p>

    "He didn't deal with the whats and hows, but he
    certainly explained the why," said one former cabinet
    member. Some leftwingers and trade unionists, irked by
    the address's religiosity, called it "messianic" and
    lacking commitment to the means of righting the world's
    wrongs. <p>

    They were a minority. "Brilliant," said a senior
    colleague after hearing his party leader - famous for
    his regard for business tycoons - declare: "The
    starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant,
    they are our cause too." <p>

    Throughout the day's debates senior ministers, including
    Jack Straw, Geoff Hoon and Clare Short, had stressed the
    importance of adhering to international law in the
    search for justice - a point echoed by the veteran Tony
    Benn in an emotional warning against the "sorrows of
    war". <p>

    An end to famine, poverty and corruption in Africa, as
    well as genocidal conflicts such as Rwanda's, were only
    part of an agenda that foresaw the world tackling such
    intractable problems as global warming and the
    Israeli-Palestinian conflict - an "equal partnership"
    side by side in their own lands. <p>

    Though the back half of Mr Blair's text addressed the
    domestic agenda - the need to put improved public
    services before tax cuts - he repeatedly went out of his
    way to reconcile Islam with the west, above all with
    America. <p>

    For all its flaws the US, where a black child of poverty
    such as Colin Powell could rise to be secretary of state
    ("I wonder frankly whether such a thing could have
    happened here") was still a model to the world, he
    argued. <p>

    Nor had America lashed out, as some had predicted: "no
    missiles on the first night just for effect". When
    military strikes came they would be "proportionate,
    targeted - we will do all we humanly can to avoid
    civilian casualties". <p>

    While the west must address its shameful ignorance of
    Islam, he later suggested, "it is time also for parts of
    Islam to confront prejudice against America" - not only
    Islam, but "parts of western societies too". That was
    loudly applauded in a conference where such sentiments
    have long existed. <p>

    But Mr Blair's conciliatory and idealistic tone was not
    extended to the enemy of the moment, whose version of
    Islam was "no more obedient to the proper teachings of
    the Koran" than the crusaders of the Middle Ages had
    exemplified the gospel message, he said. <p>

    "Be in no doubt Bin Laden and his people organised this
    atrocity," Mr Blair insisted. He offered no evidence,
    although he did suggest that terrorism finances itself
    through Afghan heroin sold on the streets of Britain. <p>

    His contempt for the Taliban and their denial of human
    rights, especially for women, was stinging. But he did
    not say, as Labour briefers had indicated overnight,
    that it was already too late to avoid military
    retribution. <p>

    "I say to the Taliban: surrender the terrorist or
    surrender power. It's your choice." <p>

    Mr Blair's pledge to defeat the "act of evil" that
    destroyed the World Trade Centre - "if they could have
    murdered not 7,000 but 70,000 does anyone doubt they
    would have done so and rejoiced?" - was only the trailer
    to a declaration that globalisation made cooperation
    between nations and cultures imperative. <p>

    "This is a moment to seize," he said. "The kaleidoscope
    has been shaken, the pieces are in flux, soon they will
    settle again. Before they do let us reorder this world
    around us and use modern science to provide prosperity
    for all. <p>

    "Science can't make that choice for us, only the moral
    power of a world acting as a community can." <p>
