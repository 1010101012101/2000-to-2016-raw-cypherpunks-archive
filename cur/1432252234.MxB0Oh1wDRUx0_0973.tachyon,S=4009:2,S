The FBI explioted this mindset to the hilt--COINTELPRO kept them all 
twitching like galvanic frogs. The merest stimulus and they exploded right 
on cue. Getting your enemies to destroy themselves, what a strategy. 

The whole thing is a depressing reminder of what happens when hot-headed 
idealism faces off against cold-blooded realism. Call me a fence sitter, 
but there's got to be another way.
