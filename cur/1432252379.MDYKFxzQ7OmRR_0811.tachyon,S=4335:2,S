Too many statists who gibber as this fool "chefren" does.

(I have no idea whether "chefron" and "Rob Carlson" are the same person 
or not...part of the chaos of having my stuff sent to other mailing 
lists. For now, I am assuming it is only this "chefron" creep who 
deserves to be blasted.)

This is a disgraceful argument, which I have no particular interest in 
arguing with you on.

Declan, apparently you have been forwarding my posts to you one or more 
of your lists. Please do not do so. I have no interest in receiving 
arguments from some of the untermenschen who choose to subscribe to some 
of your lists.

To you untermenschen: don't send your socialist/statist arguments to me 
personally. If you want to argue, join the lists I am on.
