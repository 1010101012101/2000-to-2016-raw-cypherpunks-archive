	And now more people turned https on? So the gov't now has to
	steal keys? And how hard could it be to steal keys when all
	intel/amd processors are backdoored? 
 

	Also, you say "before snowden", but it just so happens that
	there were people giving the game away before snowden did : 

	This is from 2006

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A

	Yes, they now have to work more. But the million dollar
	question is how much more.

	And I believe that blowing up the white house and its contents
	is an act of justice ;)

	This being the cpunks mailing list I think it's reasonable to
	subscribe to libertarian anarchism and correctly see the
	government as the biggest criminal organization in town 
	and having zero legitimacy. So I don't think that anything the
	gov't does is reasonable (OK, defense of person and property
	would be reasonable IF they only did that, which is
	virtually impossible or an 'utopia')

	We don't. My point is, if one believes the government is
	good and it catches the bad guys, then why would one 
	object to mass surveillance?

	'crimes' as defined by the government? Like smoking pot or gay
	sex?

	 But again,  the gov't uses mass surveillance. They discover
	 'criminals', which is allegedly good, while the innocent under
	 surveillance don't suffer any harm (they don't even know they
	 are being spied). What's the objection to mass surveillance
	 then?

	Why not? The goverment is good. Why shouldn't they know
	everything, in order to 'prevent' crimes and find 'criminals'?

	Right to privacy, sounds reasonable to me, but the government
	can claim that 'national security' trumps it. Or something.

	That is of course a good question...My answer is "I don't have
	the slightest idea" - grarpamp? 

	But at least the design and fabrication of micros seems doable.
	Not only that, there are a few designs already created...

	Building a fab isn't an option - at least not a 5 billion,
	state of the art fab. What can realistically be crowdfunded is
	the manufacturing of chips at one of the fabs that do that kind
	of work.

	Yes, if enough people stopped buying stuff from intel, they
	might get worried. But how many people are we talking about?
	Tens of millions? More? Is it easier to convince that many
	people to boycott intel, or is it easier to manufacture open
	source processors for a smaller market more interested in
	security?

	Yeah, but in this particular case I don't see how software is
	going to do any damage control when 

	" the ME is capable of accessing any memory region without the
	main x86 CPU knowing about the existence of these accesses. It
	also runs a TCP/IP server on your network interface"

	Yes, agreed. But what seems to have happened so far is that
	the majority of efforts have been directed at the software side
	of things.
