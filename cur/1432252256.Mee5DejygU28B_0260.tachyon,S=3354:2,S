This shithead collective makes some very casual statements :

>  Say good-bye to the traditional photo identification at work. 
>
>  Say hello to fingerprint IDs.

It's just amazing how quickly people embrace this sheiss without
questioning it. Nobody wants to think about what will make us safer,
they just leap blindly towards technology and government. It's a sort of
long lost father figure problem - save me daddy. It's a sign of how weak
our society really is. Maybe the bad guys are not so far off the mark.
I'm ashamed by the weakness of our politicians, our journalists and all
too many of my "fellow" citizens.
