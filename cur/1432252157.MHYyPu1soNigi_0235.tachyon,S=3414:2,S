WARNING : Not only is this off-topic but it is foolish as well.

WARNING : Be careful when selecting a package size - shipping could
become a problem


UPS is recommended :
--------------------
 http://www.ups.com/using/services/packaging/wtsize-guide.html

MAXIMUM PACKAGE LIMITATIONS

The following weight and size limits apply to packages you send via
all UPS domestic and international services: 

Up to 150 pounds or 70 kilograms (68 kilograms in Canada)

Up to 130 inches or 330 centimeters in length and girth combined

Up to 108 inches or 270 centimeters in length

Note: Packages that exceed UPS weight and size limits are
subject to an Over Maximum Limits charge. Refer to the UPS
Tariff for details.

HOW TO MEASURE SIZE

Length is the longest side of a package or
object. Girth is the distance all the way
around the package or object at its widest
point perpendicular to the length. 

Add Length and Girth measurements
together to obtain total package size.


FedEx is for small fry :
