Nah. Remember, May's got a big mouth, but I doubt he's ever killed anybody. 
Hell, I bet he's never even gotten into a real fight (which is probably why 
he mouths off so much about violence).

Speech is speech. I'll worry about May when he actually tries to bring the 
"hoped for" nuke into downtown DC. Until then, he's a "sleeper cell".
