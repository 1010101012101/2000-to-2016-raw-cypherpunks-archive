Agent orange news in Nam... 
http://www.infoshop.org/inews/stories.php?story=01/12/31/3456415

Scientists investigating the effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam have found 
that people living in a so-called hotspot have the highest blood levels of 
its poisonous chemical dioxin ever recorded in the country.
Agent Orange, which has the dioxin (TCDD - short for 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) as one of its constituents, was last 
used in 1973.
But today, some residents of Binh-Hoa, near Ho Chi Minh City, have 200 
times the normal amount of dioxin in their bloodstreams.
Agent Orange was widely used by the US military during the Vietnam War as a 
defoliant so that Vietnam's dense jungle could not provide cover for Viet 
Cong forces.
'Startling' results
It was when US veterans started to become ill with a variety of health 
problems that investigations suggested that Agent Orange could be involved.
The most dangerous ingredient was the dioxin, a pollutant that stays in the 
environment for decades.
There are still about 12 dioxin hotspots in Vietnam, in areas where very 
heavy spraying took place. (cont)
