that part is put in automatically by netscape. I don't usually add
obvious statements like "look, I can write" to my mails. :)


anyways, my whole point was that for many people, religion is as or even
more important than law. I'm sure you have a fair share of them as well.
so things can get pretty interesting when 2 such high-level values
collide. more interesting than a collision between, say, the law and a
more-or-less important demand for privacy.

that's the whole point. I know some people just can't help turning every
spelling error into an attack on their fundamental values, but frankly,
that's not my problem.
