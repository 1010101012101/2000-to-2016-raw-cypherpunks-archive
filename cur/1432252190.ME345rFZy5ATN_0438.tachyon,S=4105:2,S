Heat freon up enough, it turns into phosgene gas (as it breaks down
into simpler components).  The CBR types call that Blood Agent.  
Just think of how carbon monoxide supplants oxygen in your red blood 
cells, that's what phosgene gas does.  I do not seem to remember the 
critical temperature but a lit cigarette will do it.
