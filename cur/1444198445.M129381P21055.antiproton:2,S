"State Kicks the bucket" (and other use cases) bring about some
discussion around cyber guerrilla warfare of sorts...

Assume you're a terrist, warfighter, some flavor of activist /
dissident, human rights worker, journalist, hacker, VIP, whatever...

What is the time to a fix and physical intercept on your location?

Possibly specified to within some radius such that you cannot escape
without being captured, or at least being visually identified, etc.
Modulo your own movement while on / off air.
What are the capabilities of any particular chosen adversaries that
are after your realtime fix?
What is your loiter time before you must move to avoid capture?

Consider some various theatres, densities, infrastructures, and
situations in which you might operate...
- War ravaged mideast "city"
- Paris, New York, Tokyo
- You're in soverign territory up against drones and monitoring /
  locating methods that ignore and cross political boundaries.
- You're in soverign territory against local police forces.
- On foot or on wheels.
- Cameras everywhere, discretion kept how?
- Whether you strictly follow "never use the same place twice", or
not.
- Locating tech deployed directly by adversary vs. adversary utilizing
tech deployed by local utilities that serve the population.
- How to operate on limited resources against the "haves".

Land lines are out since you'd churn through safe lines, unless
you're tapping into them. Also wifi, cellular, satcom, pamphleting.

Some examples could be drawn from the "wars" in the mideast.
ie: You're spotted and fixed by undercover CIA agent, then droned
15 min later.

What are your goals as a cyber guerrilla or OPSEC oriented individual
or group in various tactical and strategic situations that you have
an affinity with? What are the greator goals?

What are the likely interest areas of a cyber guerrilla beyond
personal survival of water, food, shelter?

Do wide and local comms channels have trade value? How to maintain
them?

Any any other things related to cyber war, OPSEC type things
that keep you alive / valued when bucket is kicked, even if you're
sheeple....
