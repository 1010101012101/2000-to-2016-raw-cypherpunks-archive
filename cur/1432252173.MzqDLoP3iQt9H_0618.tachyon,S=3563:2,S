This is why there's a need for some sort of reasonable, organized
response outlined in writing.

In my experience law enforcement (and others) will try to shift
whatever investigative tasks are convenient to them to anyone in the
loop.

Why not, it costs them nothing to have you running around all day and
night doing investigative work for them.

They will generally cite the seriousness of the underlying crime as
(bottomless) justification for your contribution.

The rational response is to sit down as a group within some framework
and come to some agreement* with them as to what is a reasonable and
sufficient response in these cases.

Otherwise you're just the complaint desk at Macy's taking all comers
and subject to whatever they can dream up to try to get you to solve
their problems.

* Agreement with LEOs is best, a unilateral document would at least
open discussion one would hope and move towards that end.
