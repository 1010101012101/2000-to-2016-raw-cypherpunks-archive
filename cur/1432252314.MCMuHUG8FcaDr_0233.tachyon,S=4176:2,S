	I believe that most download all of the headers, and then 
only download the articles one is interested in--at least the 
"Online" newsreaders do it this way.

	Trn (and IIRC slrn) can be configured to read from the local 
spool. If one is using Linux, there is also leafnode, a "small site" 
news server that gets it's feed via NNRP (the news reader protocol) 
as opposed to NNTP. It is fairly trivial to set up, and can be cron'd 
to grab all the articles in a newsgroup at regular intervals, and 
expire the messages from disk in short order.
