If the traffic is garbage (NSA fake social media accounts, intrusion =
attempts) what is the difference from stopping spam or bonnet traffic? =
Is some intel operative=92s traffic wanted anymore than the 419 spam =
from kids from a 3rd world country in a cyber cafe? I guess I don=92t =
see this as censorship since I am blocking due to the type of traffic, =
not what is being said. There are already some programs that block =
traffic to and from known malware sites, who cares if the malware comes =
from the NSA or Ethiopia=92s Information Network Security Agency?

Maybe John McAfee needs to take his company back and release something =
that really tries to protect you. Buy the Platinum Edition and get a =
free suppressor! (Offer not valid in Belize)
