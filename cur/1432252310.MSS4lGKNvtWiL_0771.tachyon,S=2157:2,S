Wow!  He's gotten even worse!

	""US Code 10" does not enslave me to some "militia" that holds views
	generally counter to my own (that negroes mostly need killing, that
	abortion is fully legal, that all drugs are legal, that women are too
	hormone-addled to have the right to vote, and that many tens of
	millions of Jews, niggers, Mexicans, PRs, and other criminals ought to
	be sent up in smoke)."

Someone please send him a refill for that thorazine scrip!
