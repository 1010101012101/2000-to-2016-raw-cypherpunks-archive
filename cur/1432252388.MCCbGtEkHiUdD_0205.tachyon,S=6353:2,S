"These PSAs are really wacked out. They are supposed to be fictional 
depictions of life in a country other than the U.S., but they are 
incredibly hypocritical! For example, the "Library" PSA shows a young guy 
asking for a book from a librarian, who informs him that it is no longer 
available and then asks him why he wants to read it. They pan the library 
and all these government agents pop out of hiding. Of course, as many of 
you know, the U.S. government would like to see this become a reality, with 
some kind of TIPS programs for libraries. The FBI is already requesting 
information from libraries and libraries have this annoying habit of 
monitoring and controlling the surfing habits of patrons at library 
terminals. I looked at another PSA, "Arrest," which shows some guy being 
pulled over by the police and then being arrested for having the wrong 
reading material. Fact it, activists and other people have routinely been 
detained at airports for having the wrong reading material. Having radical 
books in your car has frequently been a pretext for arrest and, at the 
least, harassment."ChuckO.
