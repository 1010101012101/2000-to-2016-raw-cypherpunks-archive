There is a package that encrypts e-mail, it is called something like Pretty
Good Privacy. Use the fucking PGP for e-mail at the end-user point. No need to
trust anyone. Crypto concentration points are bad as any other concentration

Or use 802.11b with a small dish ... does wonders to 20 miles and it's rather
hard to intercept *every* path.
