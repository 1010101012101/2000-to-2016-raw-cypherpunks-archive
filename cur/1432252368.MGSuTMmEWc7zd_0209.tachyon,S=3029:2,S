The Wired article was particularly interesting, as it showed him trying to do
some "due-diligence" in order to deflect the heat he knew was coming down.

So he pro-actively sold out his customers and it did him no good
anyway....kinda predictable. The government wasn't really interested in "good"
egold customers vs "bad", though nailing the baddies of course gave the
operation some nice PR and a couple of promotions, I'm sure, as well.
