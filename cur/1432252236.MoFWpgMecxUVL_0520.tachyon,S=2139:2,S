This would greatly surprise me, for government bureaucracies
are notoriously incompetent at dealing with anyone they cannot
have pistol whipped.

If police bureaucracy X has busted someone for their own
reasons, they may well hand him over to police bureacracy Y,
but police bureaucracy X is not going to bust someone because
police bureacracy Y wants him.

If Professor rat had killed a cop, or seriously pissed off an
important politician, the FBI might get its act together enough
and swallow its pride sufficiently to manage a successful
extradition, but for this sort of minor crap, nothing will
happen.
