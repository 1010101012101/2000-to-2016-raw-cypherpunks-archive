All the text-to-speech tools I've seen, which are very useful to the
blind, tend to barf when given javascript generated pages.  Not my
actual problem, but I think that theres a tremendous opportunity to
create an infrastructure which helps people with various problems, and 
I hate seeing bad design screw it up.
