Please explain. You made the first assertion of this, then "backslid" as 
people poked holes in your argument, now you appear to be swinging back 
in the other direction merely by asserting something about "seeds."

Could you give a cite for any prosecutions, or are you just speculating 
that "Happy Fun Court" will not be "amused" by free speech?

Comment: It seems to me we are seeing way too many people hitting the 
panic button, speculating about some of us getting shot by agents of 
happy fun courts, claiming that merely using secrecy methods is 
spoliation, arguing that speech is being criminalized, and that, in 
essence, we'd all better just slink away from these free speech and 
crypto thoughtcrimes.

Fuck that. Don't let the wuss ninnies scare you off.
