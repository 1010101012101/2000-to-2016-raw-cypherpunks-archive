If by "secure" you mean that the individual doing the browsing cannot
be traced, note that in any low-latency Internet access, packet timing
correlations between the parties can easily confirm any suspected
linkage.  As the Tor documentation itself states,

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination.

More difficult to trace is Internet access by email via the remailer
network.  See my "uinmyn", URL below.

    Long, random latency is part of the price of Internet anonymity.
