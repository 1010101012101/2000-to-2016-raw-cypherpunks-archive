Another example of why CACL [1] approaches don't work. Claims that
business are not as bad as the government are bogus because they fail to
realize that both are activities of people and people are the cause of
problem.

The evils of man are not a function of government, business, or whatever.
They rest solely on the human mind.

[1] Crypto-Anarchy, Anarcho-Capitalist, Capitalist, Libertarian

And note the 'big C' on capitalist....the distinction is whether the
commerce is the means or the ends. Big C capitalism it is the ends and
human lifetimes are the means.
