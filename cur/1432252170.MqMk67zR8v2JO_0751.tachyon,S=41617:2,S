@Travis Such a good point about &quot;yellow submarine graphics&quot;. I di=
dn&#39;t want to reply to the whole list, just wanted to say that it&#39;s =
a really spot on remark.<br>
Kids are not idiots.<br>
I&#39;d rather come to a Minecraft server as a kid and as an adult. There a=
re some good MC projects for learning code. Nothing with security twist tho=
ugh I came across.<br>
<br>
Barclays is cool, ok, but, I wasn&#39;t sure what it has to do with Cypherp=
unk Kidz - it&#39;s not so much about security and encryption?<br>
<br>
We&#39;re up for setting up a Minecraft server for this purpose - learn cod=
e &amp; security. Let me know if anyone would be interested to join: I can =
chat about it in detail in separate thread.<br>
@Rysiek - any thoughts?<br>
Also - multiplayers so make good live streams.<br>

&gt; work very well without them. (Get out much?) Use a cookie cleaner<br>
&gt; occasionally and block 3rd party cookies. Problem solved.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; not to mention it uses google analytics for spam.<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; Indeed. Inherent leakiness of digital technology is a gift of Olympus,=

&gt; aka James Bidzos aka RSA. Never enough fault-rich crypto.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; And hurrahs among investors, urging hackers and insiders to spill<br>
&gt; secrets sufficient to assure comsec-panicky buyers. Bug bounties<br>
