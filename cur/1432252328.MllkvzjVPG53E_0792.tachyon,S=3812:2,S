There are many good reasons why mailing lists should not use attachments:

-- viruses, worms

-- attachments are best arranged beforehand, for the virus/worm reason, 
and to minimize sudden bogdowns in downloads

-- with URLs so common, a pointer to a stored file someplace 
accomplishes most tasks people intend to do with attachments

-- attachments that are not pictures (vacation pics sent by mail, 
commonly) are usually formatted Word or whatever documents...not needed 
for mailing lists, and not welcome

-- mailing lists of several hundred subscribers...'nuff said.

-- diverse mailers...everything from Emacs to elm to Eudora to 
AmigaMail. Expecting hundreds of subscribers on dozens of mail systems 
to open an attachment is foolish.

Anyone who _did_ get a big attachment through would likely go into my 
kill file.
