It's round one of the end of prohibition.  This will be overturned on
appeal eventually, and the feds will move as slowly as possible.  It's
pretty amazing Ed got away with it for so long.  I think it's proof the
feds see the end coming and are getting hopelessly desparate.

It's interesting that Canadian courts are forcing ganja legalization, and
Canadian business is using NAFTA to force the DEA into allowing hemp
products.  The US is becoming more isolated, but now it's because everyone
else is ignoring their stupidity, not because the US is ignoring everyone
else.

The libertarians are going to have a field day with this one :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
