Palme was proof that folks who interefere in other people's business get
burned. He was far from merely a Swedish president. He lost that position
in 1976, regaining it in 1982 (he was murdered in 1986). In the interim, 
he was an international do-gooder, meddling in the affairs of many 
countries. The list of possible enemies is long, including Croatian 
nationalists, Kurds, West German terrorist factions, and South African
secret police (he was killed a week after speaking at an anti-apartheid
rally). There is also a possibility that it was an internal assassination.

Whoever killed him, this was an attack aimed at Palme personally,
not at Swedes in general.  So my point stands - very, very few
people consider the Swedes or Sweden as a 'Great Satan'. The US
could do worse than take a leaf from their book.
