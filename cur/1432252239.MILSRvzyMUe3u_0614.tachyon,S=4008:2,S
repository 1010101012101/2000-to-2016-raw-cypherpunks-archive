The question is whether a jury of properly trained Sheeple would convict
when the librarian was dragged into court, and accused of illegally
leaking information about an ongoing criminal investigation, putting
agents lives at risk, obstructing justice, having the same agenda as the
terrorists, etc.

The answer to this question is almost certainly "Yes," particularly in the
new nastier post-9/11 legal climate.

I certainly wouldn't want to be anywhere near the librarian who volunteers
to be the test case here.

A well-known Seattle Activist, the webmaster of www.stopamerica.org, was
recently indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of having
"discussions" in 1998 related to the possible setting up of a training
camp in Oregon.  It is not alleged that he did anything, merely that he
"discussed," whatever that means, and several years before anyone
flattened any New York skyscrapers.

One can now get arrested and charged with a laundry list of "terrorist"
crimes for...

Having the same training as the terrorists

Having the same radio as the terrorists

Having links to terrorists

Having discussions years ago about things that are now considered linked
to terrorists

Soon to come, I expect...

Reading the same books as the terrorists

Being pissed at the same governments as the terrorists

Supporting the same social issues as the terrorists
