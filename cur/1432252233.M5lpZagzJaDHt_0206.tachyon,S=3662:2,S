Easy to see where that's headed:

1. Joe Cypherpunk is doing 54 on Rt 95.
2. "Cops" (or guys in a black car claiming to be local cops) stop Joe, make 
arrest based on "speeding" or what have you.
3. Cops take DNA sample.
4. 2 weeks later Noam Chomsky is murdered.
5. Hey! Joe Cypherpunk's DNA has been found all over the scene of the crime.
6. Joe Cypherpunk is executed...that bastard! Murdering such a valued member 
of society....MIT professor and all that. Papers report that Cypherpunk Joe 
had once tried to become an MIT professor but never got on the tenure track. 
Clearly, he had a vendetta.
