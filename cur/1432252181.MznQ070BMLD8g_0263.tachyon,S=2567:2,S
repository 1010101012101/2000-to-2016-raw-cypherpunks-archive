Introduction

The lack of Corporate and Governmental transparency has been a topic of
much controversy in recent years, yet our only tool for encouraging
greater openness is the slow, tedious process of policy reform.

Presented in the form of a Soviet F1 Hand Grenade, the Transparency
Grenade is an iconic cure for these frustrations, making the process of
leaking information from closed meetings as easy as pulling a pin.

Equipped with a tiny computer, microphone and powerful wireless antenna,
the Transparency Grenade captures network traffic and audio at the site
and securely and anonymously streams it to a dedicated server where it
is mined for information. Email fragments, HTML pages, images and voice
extracted from this data are then presented on an online, public map,
shown at the location of the detonation.

Whether trusted employee, civil servant or concerned citizen, greater
openness was never so close at hand..
