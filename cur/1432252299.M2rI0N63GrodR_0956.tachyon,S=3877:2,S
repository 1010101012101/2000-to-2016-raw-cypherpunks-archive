Since Congress gave him virtually everything he asked for... what
would he need martial law for?

A. he's got everything he wants (and if he wants more, he'll get
it... a few more anthrax letters will do the trick).

B. martial law would be much too obvious, to openly hostile.  People
like Asscruft (love the term!) thrive on "under the covers" -> "nobody
realizes anything til it's too late".

Bye, J
