Im not trying to pitch AP for anything.It applies to everyone not 
anonymous.Anybody can nominate anyone else.I was going to bring this up as 
sort of good indicator for 'reputations'.Negative reputations need 
rating,weighing and assessment too.
The name 'assasination politics' might be seen as a negative.I use 
operation soft drill.I think that though its paradoxical that threatening 
people could lead to world peace,as long as no ones died yet,its worth a 
shot.Theoretically no one has to die.
If I was saddam hussein and knew that a pool was accumulating on me.I might 
consider retirement.I dont think youve read the essay properly or you would 
remember the 'thermostat' and the 'car thieves' bits.The point is valid and 
the other point is not to panic.(seen any flying saucers lately?)
