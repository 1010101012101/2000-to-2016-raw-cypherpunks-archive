The following is a quote from this decision, referencing a case (Smith v. M=
aryland) where the Supreme Court upheld the installation of a 'pen register=
' (a device for recording the numbers which a telephone line calls) on a sm=
all number of phone lines. =C2=A0Correctly, this appeals court rejects the =
application of the Smith case. =C2=A0Going from tapping the metadata of per=
haps 4-5 lines to that of 100 million lines was too much of a stretch. =C2=
=A0Further, the justification in Smith was based in part on the idea that a=
 telephone customer voluntarily gave a phone number to his phone company to=
 complete the call he wanted.A major problem with such a justification toda=
y is that while in 1978 (or so) it was necessary to collect and store the '=
called-party' number for billing purposes, in 2015 we no longer bill by the=
 mile (as was done by Long Distance accounts in the 1970's and 1980's) or i=
n most cases even the duration of the call. =C2=A0There is, therefore, no r=
eason for the phone company to even collect the information other than to c=
omplete the call, and to keep it only until the time the call ends. =C2=A0S=
o, trying to use the fact that the customer gives this information to the T=
PC ("The Phone Company") has become quite tenuous and unnjustifiable.=C2=A0=
 =C2=A0I recommend to all the 1967 movie, "The President's Analyst", which =
can be seen to be wonderfully prescient. =C2=A0True, they cannot (yet) impl=
ant telephones in our bodies, but the main limitation on how small those ph=
ones can get is maintaining our ability to interact with them, until they b=
ecome too small for fingers to control.=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Jim=
