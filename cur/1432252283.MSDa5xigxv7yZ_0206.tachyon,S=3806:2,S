hmm seems like anonymous may have a new project
DOXING a fake indian/professional victim and publishing all of her sordid details
publicly.. perhaps public shame will cause modification of her behavour..

   for one thing though when you choose to announce 5 nations(civilized tribe) blood 
or membership as a way of winning discussions its like saying your great great grand
parents and ALL of their family were awoken in the middle of the night and force marched
2k+ miles without supplies or belonging in an affort to exterminate them deiberately


Do that around an actual descendant of the 5 nations and you will get checked out and 
backgrounded... again.. its not something for idle chitchat... other racial groups that have experience same such as the jewish "racial" grouping also keep track of holocaust 
survivor member names and descendants for reparation and claims,

By a similar token citizenship or kin ship with a member of an indian nation is taken 
quite seriously by a lot of us as in the case of Cherokee or Seminole band membership an
and reservation status may convey serious financial advantage or hardship(depending on 
which tribe)  ie for seminole or cherokee it may mean a share of casino profits and land

for choctaw band/nation indians it means getting included as part of Obummers new
plantation system (the choctaw nation was called out specifically)

for navajo nation bands it means your res is mined for Uranium and thorium
 and you get to have ALL your water supplies polluted by the white owned company
 that was given permission to invade and ruin what is essentially a foreign nation 
by the USG(this is present day)

SO a BIG FUCK YOU to CARI MACHET FAKE WHITE BITCH CLAIMING 5 nations membership
 
You and Paula Deen both should compare your makeup  REDFACE/BLACKFACE makeup

BITCHES AND CUNTS you BOTH are from the white establishment..

NO STUPID YOU DONT LOOK A BIT LIKE a CHEROKEE BAND INDIAN!

      BITCH
