Greetings,

Cypherpunks/Meetingpunks Announcements for January 2001!

Every month they seem to doubt us and expect our early demise, but 
EVERY SECOND SATURDAY, rain or shine, we have ... wait for it ... 
that's right: a Cypherpunks Physical Meeting (that means you show 
up!) somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area, and this coming Second 
Saturday is no different... no budget, no frills, no BS (just the way 
Martin would've liked it) we're not going away until the NSA does. 
Check out the complete scoop at:
