Hi,

this is getting absurdly long.

I am going to answer this one part below.

Answer A:
Well then, do a damn pull request and fix it. With the amount of typing=
 done=20
in this thread already you could have done it 3 times over. :)

Answer B:
Can you please direct me towards any software that in your opinion does=
 not=20
have a problem with the "host security" part? A single example of any p=
rogram,=20
say any communication program, like IM, VoIP, e-mail client, etc, insta=
llable=20
on a chosen operating system.

Answer C (I think I'll go with this one):
On a more serious vein, I see I'm dealing with a view that security is =
binary.=20
That one can only be safe in a meaningful sence, when one has three lap=
tops in=20
a particular setup on their desk.

Problem is, people DIE, NOW, because they use Skype. Not because they=20=

misjudged a particular way software A uses crypto primitive B or some s=
uch,=20
but because they are using an inherently fucked up, security wise, soft=
ware to=20
communicate.

Those people do not have the privilege of having a desk with 3 laptops,=
 they=20
often don't even have damn ADMIN RIGHTS on their laptop. Giving them a =
tool=20
that works on their (insecure, I agree!!) platforms and yet LOWERS thei=
r=20
exposure actually can save lives.

This is something that has to be rammed into the heads of people with a=
=20
baseball bat. Ideal setups don't exist, that's why they are "ideal".

Here, have a read:
https://medium.com/message/81e5f33a24e1

Especially this part:

=2D - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=
 - - -

Managing all the encryption and decryption keys you need to keep your d=
ata=20
safe across multiple devices, sites, and accounts is theoretically poss=
ible,=20
in the same way performing an appendectomy on yourself is theoretically=
=20
possible. This one guy did it once in Antarctica, why can=E2=80=99t you=
?

(...)

So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts,=20
programmers, and so on was this: What=E2=80=99s the best option for peo=
ple who can=E2=80=99t=20
download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: noth=
ing.=20
They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was to=
ld, =E2=80=9Cso=20
they don=E2=80=99t have a false sense of security.=E2=80=9D Since they =
don=E2=80=99t have access to=20
better software, I was told, they shouldn=E2=80=99t do anything that mi=
ght upset the=20
people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organi=
zers,=20
and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporati=
ons and=20
criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they shoul=
d buy=20
themselves computers, I was told.

That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own comput=
er, or=20
literally drop dead. I told people that wasn=E2=80=99t good enough, got=
 vilified in a=20
few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.

Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the=
 same=20
experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations=E2=80=
=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Aeven when=20
people are being hunted by men with guns=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Awhen=
 encryption and security fails,=20
no one stops talking. They just hope they don=E2=80=99t get caught.

=2D - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=
 - - -

I accept Tox could warn about some issues better. I accept that desktop=
=20
security is a joke. But for the love of Dog, that is not what I am aski=
ng when=20
I'm asking if Tox is a sane thing to look into.

I'm asking about "do we know of serious security bugs or fuckups in thi=
s=20
software". I am asking "can anybody point out any serious, SNAFU-level =
bugs in=20
the protocol design". And so on.

How about we let stef talk about that himself.
