Stuff like this almost always makes me wish the DoJ was more diligent. If
you want to see excess laws removed from the books, have them enforced as
written. Suddenly a lot of senators families will be arrested and rich
individuals in jail (along with almost everyone else).

After that the politicians will fall over themselves to remove the law from
the books. Or at least amend it.
