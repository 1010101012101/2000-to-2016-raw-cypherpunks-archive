Folks:

The Canadian Broadcasting corporation is running a segment on the 10pm news 
tomorrow on e-privacy. To the public's comments and suggestions on the 
issue they have created a discussion forum on thier web page.

Seeing that the folks on this list are familiar with the topics, I ask that 
you visit the site and enter a few words of your wisdom.

Regards

Robert

A study by Canada's privacy commissioner reports that almost half of 
Canadians are perfectly comfortable with retailers compiling personal 
data...if there's a reward paid to the consumer. (Such as a discount or 
free goodies). Tell us what you think about e-privacy and who should know 
what about you.
