I meant a wiretap warrant, as you talked about in your article. A 
"search warrant," duly presented to the resident and defining the 
general scope of the search, is substantially different from a wiretap 
order or secret search warrant.

But such secret or extra-warrant search orders are part of the public 
lore, hence part of the current law. In "The Sopranos," Tony's entire 
house is wired for sound. In "Law and Order: Criminal Something or 
Other," a completely warrantless keystroke logger is inserted in a 
witnesses computer.

I think those who violate the C. should be killed.
