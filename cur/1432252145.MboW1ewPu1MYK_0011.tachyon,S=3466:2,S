Last I checked, the vast bulk of remailers were in North America and
Europe. Given sufficient provocation (Bush twins kidnapped, Osama
talking biochemwomdterror in DC), I could easily see a coordinated set
of pre-dawn raids to "gather evidence" and seize computers as part of
a criminal investigation. Obviously the servers would have to be held
as potential evidence for a trial - did they keep logs? our techs will
find out - which could take a decade. This would cripple the current
remailer network and generate almost no public outcry beyond the
cypherpunks and such.
