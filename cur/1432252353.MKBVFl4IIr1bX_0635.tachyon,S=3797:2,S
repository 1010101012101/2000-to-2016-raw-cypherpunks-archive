It is not a crime for an agency of another country to eavesdrop on you as
long as they are physically located outside the U.S. Similarly, it is not
illegal for a US agency to intercept messages in another country, as long as
they do it from outside the that country.

This is how (if it really does exist) the Echelon network works. Agencies in
Canada, England, Australia etc. intercept messages in the U.S. and then pass
on the intelligence to their U.S. counterparts. This information sharing
by-passes legal jurisdictional limits.
