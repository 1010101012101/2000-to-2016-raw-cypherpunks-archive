&gt;<br>
&gt; I have two questions about the recent revelations that the NSA has bee=
n<br>
&gt; collecting data about Tor users.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would like to hear from those with personal knowledge and experience=
<br>
&gt; such as Jacob, Roger, Mike, etc.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; AIUI, from the stories in the German media<br>
&gt; (<a href=3D"http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html=

&gt; the NSA has logged the IP of everyone who ever accessed:<br>
&gt; a) a directory server.<br>
&gt; b) an entry node.<br>
&gt; c) <a href=3D"http://bridges.torproject.org" target=3D"_blank">bridges=

&gt; d) requested an email of bridges.<br>
&gt; e) the tor website itself (except from five eyes countries).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This is viable as the NSA runs the Quantum network which allows it to<=
br>
&gt; intercept traffic to whichever sites it desires before that traffic<br=
>
&gt; arrives at its destination.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Two questions:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. =C2=A0 =C2=A0What would be the purpose of collecting a vast trove o=
f IP addresses?<br>
&gt; In my case, my IP could be tied to my real name since I send emails vi=
a<br>
&gt; SMTP which will contain my IP, email address, real name, etc. That sai=
d,<br>
&gt; IP addresses are dynamic. I don&#39;t know how easy it would be to ide=
ntify<br>
&gt; most people via an IP. Of course, one way would be to ask the ISP<br>
&gt; directly. But, whether tied to a real identity or not, what&#39;s the =
point?<br>
&gt; =C2=A0 What does it achieve? They also gather the IP address for those=
 who<br>
&gt; access any number of proxy services such as MegaProxy and<br>
&gt; FreeProxies.org. Would they not just end up with a massive database of=
<br>
&gt; (mostly dynamic) IPs?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. =C2=A0 =C2=A0What is the attitude that encourages the gathering of =
this<br>
&gt; information? Is it: because they can? Or do they truly believe that<br=
>
&gt; anyone who uses Tor is dangerous? Bear in mind that Tor was developed<=
br>
&gt; and is still funded by the US government. No-one can deny that<br>
&gt; dissidents in unfree countries use it. So, even if you assume that a<b=
r>
&gt; high percentage of users are bad people, what about the dissidents in<=
br>
&gt; the Middle East or wherever? What is the psychology here? I&#39;m sure=
<br>
&gt; people like Roger are in regular contact with some government types.<b=
