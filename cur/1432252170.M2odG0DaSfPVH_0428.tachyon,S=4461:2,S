Have there been test cases which have stated this?  I
pretty much agree with you as to what the law should be,
but I think you might be mistaken as to what the law is.

When I first read this,  I couldn't think of any reason you'd
want to use your own homemade descrambler box instead of
the one that the cable co supplied (assuming you've actually paid
for the channel),  but I was ablt to come up with a couple reasons.

1) you want to tape stuff while you're not there,  and the cable box
doesn't come with a way to change channels at a specific time.
Maybe you'd even like to tape 2 things at once, which I think is
legal but not practical using their box.

2) You don't like the color,  and you can't paint their box,
because you only rent it.

Well,  obviously you're not depriving them of any income if
for some reason you decide to use a homemade box and
stick the one they rent you in your closet,  but has anyone
ever actually done such a thing,  and gotten hauled into court?
