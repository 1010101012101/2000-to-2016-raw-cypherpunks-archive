That would be, as we now have been informed by the leak of the Turkish
diplomatic communication to NATO immediately after the shoot down,
'for at most 17 seconds'.

Well, Russia responded with a "moderate bombs" bombing campaign, a
rather vigorous campaign it seems (albeit a moderate one), around the
area where the Russian Su-24 jet moderately crashed in Syria after
being moderately shot down in Syrian airspace by the moderate Turkish
F-16, and one of the two Russian pilots was moderately machine gunned
to a moderate death in the air as he parachuted to the ground. Perhaps
a Geneva War Crimes Convention violation declaration will be
forthcoming (just a moderate one though) only not too soon that might
be considered an unwanted, if moderate, escalation of the situation.

In all seriousness, Russia responded quite moderately and I'm grateful
there has been no overt escalation.

Regards,
Zenaan
