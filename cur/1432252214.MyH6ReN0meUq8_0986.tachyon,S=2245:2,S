   from the following-in-your-tracks dept.
   Danathar writes "The MPAA is looking to use [1]digital fingerprinting
   technologies that in conjunction with legislation will enable and
   force ISPs to look for network traffic that matches the signatures. "
   From the article: " Once completed, Philips' technology--along with
   related tools from other companies--could be a powerful weapon in
   Hollywood's increasingly aggressive attempts to choke off the flood of
   films being traded online."
