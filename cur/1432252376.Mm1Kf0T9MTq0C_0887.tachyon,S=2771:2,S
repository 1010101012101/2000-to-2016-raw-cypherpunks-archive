    It is truly remarkable how much Osama resembles all the 
pictures of Jesus. Not just his facial features, but his eyes,
his presence. Could it be that this is really the Millenium,
the Second Coming is here and now, and we are just on the 
wrong side? Why else are so many thousands of devout people
praying for his safety, why else do so many call the US the
Great Satan? 
   Is anyone trying to do an objective comparison of recent
events with the Book of Revelations? Who knows who really 
caused those planes to crash into the WTC? If the Great 
Satan controls all the news media who knows what lies we
are being told? Why don't they want us to hear Osama?
