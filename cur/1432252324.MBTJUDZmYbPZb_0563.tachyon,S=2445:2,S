I disagree, its actually useful, in a particularly odd way. The 
profitability of hedge funds says that the markets are not efficient (one of 
their founding principles). So the inability of a massive multiprocessing 
system to build proper market efficiency indicates that no one currently has 
a solution to prove P=NP. There is also far more money in economic research 
than in algorithmic research, so anyone who manages to bring the market to 
being efficient will in fact have proven P=NP long before the algorithm is 
known. From a security standpoint this is extremely valuable information. 
Maybe Maymin should apply the same processes and become a hedge fund 
manager, they make a lot more money than mere engineers.
