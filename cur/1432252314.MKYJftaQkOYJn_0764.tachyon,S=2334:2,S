You could check the cypherpunks archives to find out what kinds of
cops have visited JYA at various times in the past,
but I'd assume that at least some of the Feds have been FBI
as opposed to Treasury, CIA, NSA, DEA, VOA, KGB, Mossad, Forest Service, etc.

Some quick Google hits include November 2003
http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/politech/msg04860.html
and July 2000 http://seclists.org/lists/politech/2000/Jul/0043.html .

Looks like the NYT guy either got this entirely wrong
or else was trying to say that a couple of weeks ago was
when the FBI first showed up about _this_ particular issue.
