     It's can be a lot more difficult than that -- people have had to
totally abandon otherwise excellent (newer and expensive) buildings.
Some people have also suffered apparantly permanent brain damage.
    Don't know exactly what the gov can do about it tho -- ban mold? New
war on (some) molds? Maybe give it to the Homeland Securidat force.
Maybe it's bio-terror? Hmm -- come to think of it, Yellow Rain was a
fungus, a rather easily grown one at that, and --- gosh, gee -- oh shit,
the Russians were
dumping that on Afganistan. Maybe Osama is behind the toxic mold
epidemic.
