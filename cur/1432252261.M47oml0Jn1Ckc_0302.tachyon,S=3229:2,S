This is a conversation with Jimmy Wales regarding how we can get
Wikipedia to let Tor get through.

Yes, but we notice that we can control a significant amount of vandalism
by blocking ip numbers which have proven to be particularly problematic.
 TOR servers are among the absolute worst.  And TOR operators don't seem
to care.

Equal *opportunity*, but we have very strong empirical evidence here.
TOR ip numbers are the worst offenders that we have seen.  People use
TOR specifically to hide their identity, specifically to vandalize
wikipedia.

Ban users who vandalize wikipedia.  That'd be a start.  Rate limit edits
at Wikipedia, that'd be good.  Write an extension to your software which
would help us to distinguish between "trusted" and "newbie" Tor clients.

I completely fail to comprehend why Tor server operators consistently
refuse to take responsibility for their crazed users.
