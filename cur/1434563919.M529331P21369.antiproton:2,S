=E2=80=8BDo you claim to understand why the Reagan administration "did this=
"
operation which eventually came to be known as Iran-Contra?
If so, then you can explain how "blocking the fall of [soviet] dominoes"
directly correlates to the distribution of drugs in specific Black-American
communities.=E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BYou can in hindsight claim to agree with the end goal of "blocking
Communism" however, in hindsight, you would be lambasted as failing to see
through the Administration's propaganda.

Still claiming to support the means to that end, squarely puts you in the
realm of the Abusers of Power.
Abuse because the voting population never had any chance to understand what
was being done in their name.

This is the cycle of Power Abuse which has many in the world turned against
the US (and increasingly its people not just government).  As long as
the (secret) three-letter agencies conduct (secret) operations using
(secret) means and continue to be governed with (secret) mandates driven by
an administration's (secret) beliefs without Transparent and Democratic
oversight this trend will continue until its logical conclusion.  Sadly.
