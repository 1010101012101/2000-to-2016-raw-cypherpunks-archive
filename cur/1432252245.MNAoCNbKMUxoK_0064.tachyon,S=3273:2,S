Not just by Y2K worriers, it was also anticipated in the late 60s by analysts
exploring the possible use of EMP effects as an effective and non-violent
strategic weapon. Here's a great quote:

"Targeting only the technology is an interesting concept but who the hell is
going to pay you to research it? The Pentagon knows that without just its phone
system it would be the ultimate Chinese fire drill. They're not about to offer
prizes for the ten easiest ways to destroy the systems they too need to
survive. These things get around...." -- Herman Kahn

Rather prophetic, I think.
