 Postal Union Advises Workers in Public Eye Not to Wear Protective Masks
                               and Gloves
Oct 23, 2001

WASHINGTON (AP) - Worried about the image of postal workers, one union
has been urging its members who work in the public eye not to wear the
protective gear being provided since the discovery that anthrax was sent
through the mail.

Workplace guidelines have been modified to allow employees to wear
gloves, masks and other protective gear.

But "this is not the visual image we wish to project to the citizens we
serve," according to a Friday newsletter by the American Postal Workers
Union's news service, dated before two postal workers died. The
newsletter was posted on the union's Web site Monday.

Workers in the public eye should not wear the gear, the newsletter said.
It does not address the issue of employees who handle mail, such as
those at the Brentwood facility in Washington, the city's central mail
processing facility.
