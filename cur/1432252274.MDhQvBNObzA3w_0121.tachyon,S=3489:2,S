While deploying them is not easy, neither is stopping them.  I
recently downloaded everything in the anime.multimedia newsgroup.
I got a handful of anime movies and a huge collection of non anime
images of preteen female children engaged in a variety of sexual
acts, presumably because the newsgroup
binaries.pictures.erotica.preteen.female gets poor distribution.

The government's ability to coerce is limited.  They will not go
over the top, and attempt measures requiring a totalitarian state,
but at the same time they are probing around, looking for measures
where they can get substantial affects at acceptable levels of
coercion.
