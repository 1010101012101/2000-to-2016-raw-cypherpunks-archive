"Remember that the spookfabs don't have to contend with *economics and
yield*."

Damn, this is precisely where I wish Tim May was still around.

Certainly, the Spooks have their own fabs, and I don't think they even hide 
this fact (I doubt they could, ultimately). And certainly, the Spooks crank 
out all sort of special ASICs using their own IP as well as some 
store-bought stuff they drop onto their designs.

However, where I have some BIG doubts is whether their fab is X generations 
ahead of the most advanced commercial fabs. Frankly, I bet they have a 
pretty good fab that was modified by a commercial vendor to support small 
production runs. This fab, however, does not utilize cosmic rays for etching 
or whatever. It's probably 0.13 microns at best (wait...I think Taiwan Semi 
and a couple of other places are one step ahead of this). This limits what 
they can do with a chip or chipset, and implies that they won't be orders of 
magnitude better at opening up LOTS of traffic.

(In non-troll mode.)
