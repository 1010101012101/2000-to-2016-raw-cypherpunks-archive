Gee, I recall making a much different point. I recall disputing the 
claim that the "real, unsubsidized" price of oil is $10 a gallon for gas.

Oil looks cheap because oil _is_ cheap.

It gets a lot more expensive at the pump because various shakedown 
artists apply taxes, which they rationalize to their proles in various 
ways.
