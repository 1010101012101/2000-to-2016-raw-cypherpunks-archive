Which is unlikely to be used, at it would be incompatible with
everything else.

The "customizability" is likely a flexibility they built for their own
(debug, architectural)
reasons and decided to expose to users.

What they need is a USB or Ethernet interface to catch up to others.
However the
attraction of a relatively fast x86 (vs say a 100 Mhz MIPS or ARM) might
offset this
lack of integration for some designs.

Am surprised not to see a little DES core stuffed into the spare space
on the die, but
kinda nostalgically pleased to see DES's EOL.  RIP.

I found the following lexical rule mildly amusing, because I have seen
the same thing
added to military docs to make them politically correct (he -> he or
she)
without editing the whole damn thing.

"NOTE: Throughout this document, a reference to encryption generally
means both encryption and
