Develop an ability to eat and digest garbage, road kill, wild 
vegetation, insects, vermin, and in a pinch dead humans,
even those once your beloved, after learning how to extract 
moisture from plants, minerals and your own piss, if not
the blood of your darling kiddies.

Some survival courses teach that along with the military's
SERE program. Peruse the Boy Scout manual but don't
succumb to its noble interpretation, read the nasty stuff
below the helping innocents crapola.

Don't bother with jewelry and other simulacra of money,
those are as phony as a 3-dollar bill. As with altruism.
Burp your competitor's carcass.

Imagine living in a non-money world, which is what most
humans knew and now know, and the body and brain still 
have those capabilities, in fact, most hso-called civilized 
human capabilities are based on those residual instinctual 
skills of survival, al-be-them fancied up as smart-ass super-
bestial intelligence and superficial religious-legal-financial-
political prevarication.

Yeah, yeah, the lazy will forever try to seduce you into
supporting their value system which just happens to
place them at the apex, boss of all they surveil. Eat them 
not their shit. Don't forget to stomp their stomachs before
roasting to blow out their shit for dessert pudding

Yummy and nourishing, that second harvest.
