OK,  but is there a legal distinction between ex ante disclosure
in anticipation of a specific court action vs.   anticipation of
court action in general?  I mean,  if I had spent a lot of time
on a particular piece of code,  and the potential existed that a 
judge might order me to turn over all copies,  I might want to
take precautions against this,  even if there were no particular case
pending where this was likely,  and the possibility itself seemed 
rather remote.

Just to clarify,  I suggested possibly encrypting it just because
I might not want it leaking without my consent.  I wouldn't expect a 
judge to be dumb enough to buy the argument that "I just can't 
remember that damn key,  but I probably will once this trial is
over".

It's not THAT obscure.  If i were in the habit of putting all my source 
code on freenet,  the argument that I must have put a particular 
piece of it on freenet to avoid complying with a legitimate judicial 
order seems to me to be pretty weak.

What I'm concerned with here is the possibility (which I consider 
monstrous) that a judge might be able to force me to surrender
ALL copies of my work,  leaving me incapable of accessing it.
I fully understand that there's no way I can get a judge to accept the
claim that I can't give him A copy of my work,  even though I can 
still access it myself.

Thanks, I'll remember that,  it could come in handy some day.

"Knew" is too strong a word in this case,  "suspected" or "feared"
would be more accurate.  And even I know better than to refer to
a judge as a "pig" in his own courtroom.  In the immortal words of
Mae West, "No your honor, I'm doing my best to conceal it."
