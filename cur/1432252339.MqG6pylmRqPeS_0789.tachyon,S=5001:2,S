Even that's not sufficient since lasers have been demonstrated for
mid-course assaults as well.

All it really takes is to get it cocked a tad off senter and aerodynamic
forces will take it apart, irrespective of hull weakness.

They've certainly managed to kill enough of them in tests starting as far
back as the ASAT fighters from the 80's. The reality is that quite a lot
of research goes on in attacking the warheads while in the mid-course
phase. It's also worth mentioning that in general the individual (assuming
MRV) warheads don't usually seperate until after mid-flight. This means a
not-so-small target.

Actually not, if you strike the tanks (they are typically filled with
Nitrogen to both provide strength, ala a plastic coke bottle with the top
on and off, and to help move fuel to the engines. Approximately half the
flight occurs in this phase.

The satellite used was specifically chosen to mimic the characteristics of
a re-entry vehicle.

All I can say is google and 'anti-satellite aircraft'.
