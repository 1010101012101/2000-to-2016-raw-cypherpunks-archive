The importance of the introduction of the Euro and the collapse of govts in 
Argentina,bolivia and Columbia must rivet the attention of all cypherpunks 
interested in the introduction of e-cash and collapse of 
Govts,crypto-anarchist style.
The amazing introduction of the Euro went surprisingly smoothly for a 
project with so many intrinsic logistical hazards.
That the introduction of barter units could happen in one fell swoop 
becomes realistic in the light of euro-experience.
Probably safer to stick with organic release through distributed P-P for 
now without working AP to defend against tax collectors.Its just exciting 
to realize the speed of change that's possible now.
That there's a dark flip side to that coin is obvious in South 
America.There's no need for anyone to die for crypto-anarchy.
The regrettable spectacle of dual power for some indeterminate time should 
not be taken as a 'given',in spite of the hirstory of the region.With 
todays networks and a global mexican wave of anarchy, collapse of govts 
becomes the precursor of crypto-anarchy.Fascism is usually the reaction of 
the oligarchs to people power.It doesnt have to be that way.We come back to 
the possible mass switch to e-cash.People need economic security as much as 
physical security.AP backs up the justice system while everyone becomes a 
mint.Reputations are not so much positive as,'least negative',as judged by 
AP nominations.The crypto revolution stands poised to inherit the earth.The 
first global revolution in hirstory.If only Hari Seldon were here to see it.
"Who wants to participate to help form what will be the LAST revolution on 
earth, the one that'll take down ALL the governments?"james dalton 
Bell.Cypherpunk cherubim,crypto-anarchist and enemy of the state.
