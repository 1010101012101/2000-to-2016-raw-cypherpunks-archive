I do agree with steve that the use of the word fuck is a exploitation or
degradation of sex/love which is not that great

We need new words

There have been psyche tests on using swear words ... that is benificial to
the psyche as a sort of release ... some fri3nds of mine that are autistic
find using them to be really helpful but which words using is important

I have 2 friends that had a giant fight about this very thing - one woman
was dutch one american - the dutch hated that the new yorker said fuck and
the new yorker hated and argued against the dutch woman using the word cunt
- which is very common in dutch culture - the giant fight was the demise of
their friendship

The dutch stated using fuck was degrading to love

The new yorker stated using cunt was degrading to women

The dutch said degrading love was far worse than degrading women
