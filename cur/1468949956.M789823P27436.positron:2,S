One (not really) counterexample, though for a very narrow use case is/was
NightWeb, which was an Android app that embedded I2P. Was somewhat easier
to set up than OrBot plus a browser, but unfortunately its author abandoned
it. Again, though, not actually the web, though email through Tor is not
exactly easy to use either. Speaking of which, there's also a standalone
Bote app. You can only send messages to other Bote users, but it's easier
to set up and probably more secure than Tor-based solutions due to the lack
of a central target, despite the concerns about I2P's security you mention
below.

And honestly, imho, I2P is probably just a compromises as tor, but it's

This continues to be my main concern about I2P. It hasn't had nearly the
attention Tor has. It could have gaping holes and we wouldn't necessarily
know about them, while any holes in Tor have to be subtle at this point,
opinions about Tor's funding & governance model notwithstanding.

I keep meaning to spend more time looking at that. Thanks for the reminder.
