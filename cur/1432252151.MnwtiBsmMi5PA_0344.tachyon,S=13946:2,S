My thinking, when I first proposed what are now called Warrant Canaries,
was to rely on the U.S. constitutional protection against ex post facto. In
the same way that you can never know what laws might someday be passed
which could criminalize current, lawful, behavior or speech, a service can
never know in advance if they might someday receive a warrant or NSL. Can
someone be compelled to refrain from free speech because someday that
speech might be prohibited? If more than one person is engaged in the
creation or publication of a Warrant Canary could it be viewed as a
conspiracy? Can someone be compelled to speak falsities under court order?

Until there are prosecutions which reach high enough in the Federal courts
we may not know.

Steve

website operators should simply obviously violate the law and then

    The point of a warrant canary is to communicate in a legal way
