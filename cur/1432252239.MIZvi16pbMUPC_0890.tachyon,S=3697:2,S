That is one method of "well hidden"

How about placing blocks of data on a safe site? A petit Napoleon would
be able to subpoena a plaintext copy of the data and possibly make a
fight about getting the keys but would not be able to deprive the owner
of the data. That is, to me, the strangest and most disturbing part of
this story considering how easy and cheap it is to make decent copies of
almost anything written or taped. 

Why should an owner not be allowed to retain a copy?
