Actually, somehow, I have a feeling of relief to see that major hardware
vendors don't seem to specifically work hand in hand with the NSA to
implement backdoors. I don't see that having a JTAG connector publicaly
accessible on a RAID controller as a hint for that. The other disclosures
also point to my conclusion that the NSA is mostly working on their
own. Of course, not all of Snowden's documents are released yet and
hence my feeling could be deceiving.

I thought it could be worse.

Bye,

  Hannes
