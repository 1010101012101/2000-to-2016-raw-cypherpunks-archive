the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any telephone, not just

button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

contractua|

units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team,

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH
