Economists do that all the time.  It is called modeling.  Lucas and 
Lawrence Klein won nobel prizes for doing it.  I expect that other 
economists that I am not familiar with have also won Nobels in it.

I doubt that I could provide any source on economics that you would regard 
as understandable.

You are asking for a prediction of the behavior of human actors, predicting 
what people will do.  One can only derive "rigorous" results if one makes 
assumptions about how people think and what they want.  The most rigorous 
attempt at that is known as "rational expectations theory".

Rational expectations theory (for which Lucas got his Nobel) assumes that 
people will make the best guess they can about future behavior of the 
market, then base their present behavior on that best guess, and the market 
will then reflect that present behavior.

  This of course produces inaccurate results for obvious reasons, and 
economists attempt to model people more accurately but less rigorously by 
using "rational ignorance" and "bounded rationality."   All these are major 
areas of study in economics.
