It continues to mystify why Greenwald and others crop and
redact documents and slides but show them to staff at
O Globo, Guardian, Der Spiegel, New York Times, ProPublica,
Washington Post and perhaps others yet to be disclosed
with bombshell releases (now even Clapper is applauding
the Snowden campaign, which stinks of the fix is in on
what to release and when).

O Globo videos show glimpses of slides which are then
further redacted or cropped for release as slides alone.

Schneier claims to be working with Greenwald so he is
presumably seeing full views of docs and slides. Yet he
sustains a steady beat of surprise and outrage, almost
as if overly defensive about who knows what.

Greenwald has tweeted that there are legal reasons to
not show full views nor "distribute" document instead only
"report" on them. No answer to a tweet to GG about who
set those legal boundaries.

This seems to be game the Snowden manipulators are
playing with authorities, or at least lawyers are playing
with the gov, to toy with and tease the public by hoarding
documents, maintaining insider privileges of "journalists"
against outsiders, their readers, and experts who could
deconstruct the journo's pallid intepretation.

This is a game played also by secret-hoarding governments
against their citizens, aided and abetted by duplicitous
laws and lawyers.

MITM exploitation is what it is whatever they chose to call
their privilege protection racket.

And not to overlook the singular role of Tor in MITM
exploitation. The same distinctive rhetoic is deployed
by all of them to wave off suspicions as as if tradecraft.
