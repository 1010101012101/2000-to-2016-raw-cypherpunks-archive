	A thing which no one else has entitlement or authority to take away.

	What you confuse is that just having a *right* to something 
doesn't put the onus of responsibility on anyone (or society) to 
provide it.

	For instance, you *do* have a right to housing, but there is 
neither a responsibility on government/society to provide it for you, 
nor a responsibility on them to make sure you keep it once you have 
it. They are just not allowed to prevent you from acquiring it 
without violating the property rights of others.

	You have the right to happiness, but I don't have to make you 
happy. I am also not obligated modify my behavior to keep you happy, 
absent an obligation not to initiate force against you.

	In your little fantasy world a right is an entitlement.

	It ain't so.

	There is a distinct difference between the initiation of 
force and withholding aid.
