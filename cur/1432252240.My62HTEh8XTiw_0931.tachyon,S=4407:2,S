Indeed. From press accounts, his mother turned him in. (That's how Fedgov got 
his diary/notebook from what I understand.) The appelate decision that was 
recently in the news is that he pled guilty thinking he would get 
probation/treatment. The judge, in effect said, "I don't know why the hell 
you would have thought that. Lock him up!"

I'm concerned that Fedgov has been able to successfully prosecute this 
thoughtcrime using his own private writings. It could very well be possible 
that writing his evil thoughts down kept him from acting on them. I know that 
sometimes when I have a good rant building up, I have to just write it to get 
it out of my system. This case could well have unintended consequences if 
people finally understand that Fedgov doesn't give a rat's ass about any 
alleged 'right to privacy'. Americans allegedly have  right to 'keep and bear 
arms' as well, spelled out on paper (currently being used as toilet paper in 
government offices across the land), but there are thousands of laws 
regulating against same.
