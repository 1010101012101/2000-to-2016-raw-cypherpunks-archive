I didn't say a birth certificate was required. I said if you had one you
were required to provide a copy. As usual twist the words...:(

If you google you can actually find forms and such used since the Civil
War online. They ask a variety of questions like mother, birthplace, age,
etc.

Where's your evidence, or is this simply your opinion as well? It's easy
to 'win' a discussion if you get to make up your 'facts'. How many of
these hobbo's did you know personaly (considering you weren't even born
then I'd guess nil).

Whis is irrelevant since nobody but you has brought this up before.

Again, nothing I said implied that at all.

Typical CACL responce, attack the personality and to hell with the facts.
