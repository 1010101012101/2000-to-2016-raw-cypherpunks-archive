Some people have a desperate need for the State to validate
other people's names and faces and lives before they feel comfy.
Other people are just fine with knowing them (and by whatever
moniker) in the context in which they know them. A list full of
crackpots running on the hidden undernets is just as easily
validated as one in the real world... it's a question of content and
how well developed in whichever world (or both) the context is.

Don't post in both worlds. Or do. Or post your face or name
or whatever else, or not. It's your choice. In a hidden medium
others can make their own choices. Confusing?, not feeling
comfy? ... then stay Stateside.
