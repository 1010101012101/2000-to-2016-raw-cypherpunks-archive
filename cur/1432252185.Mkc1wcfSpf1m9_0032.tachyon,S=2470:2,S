Yep, the state fights to preserve its "life"
while the people suffer their own.
The mistake of top down thinking
lies in the inability to really model large populations with rules,
too much of the action happens at the fine grained level
of every day staying alive.

When change comes, it will happen as the cummulative effects
of millions of stuborn folk who subvert excessive authourity, 'cause 
they need to.
As the state tries to squeeze more gold out of the untaxed ecconomy
ordinary people will swarm to new work-arounds
