For semaphores and codewords, stego isn't needed. Simply
agree on a signal - if a post appears in
alt.anonymous.messages with the subject "To JAT", the
intended recipient has got all the info he needs.

Stego is needed only when the message is too complex
to have a codeword.

Even without software, 'numbers station' type
transmissions can be sent anonymously through the net.
