Hmmm.  That would seem to be a violation of separation of powers.

The Florida deadline law is very clear.  If the Florida Supreme
Court wishes to rule on a suit that the Dems bring up then that
is their authority, but preventing the Secretary of State from
doing her duly appointed job seems to be a violation of 
separation of powers.

What if Jeb Bush told her to do it?  Who wins?  The executive
authority or the judicial?

Since when did the Florida Supreme Court have executive authority?
