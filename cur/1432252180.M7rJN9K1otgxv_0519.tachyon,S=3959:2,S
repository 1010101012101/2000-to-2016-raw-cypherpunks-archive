Even if they did, there's no argument for defamation liability - 
all of the popular flavors of defamation (slander, libel, invasion
of privacy) require that the defamatory content be made available
to third parties (e.g., not the plaintiff nor the defendant). 

User-configured spam blockers don't create risk of defamation
(or interference with contract, etc.) liability - but supplying
block lists to other users does.

However, there's a line of caselaw which says that there's an
exception to traditional defamation liability, where the speaker
acts with a good purpose, to warn others of a perceived danger;
perhaps that would be a useful approach for the MAPS people
to take. They're the ones with their necks on the chopping
blocks.
