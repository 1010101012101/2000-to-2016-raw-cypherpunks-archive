#    David Duke Phones Home, Learns of FBI Raid
#    
#    Monday, November 20, 2000, By Brett Martel
#    
#    
#    NEW ORLEANS - White supremacist David Duke finally called home 
#    from Russia to learn that federal agents raided his home last 
#    week and carried away boxes of materials, a spokesman said Monday.
#    
#    "He was outraged at this invasion of his home," said Vincent 
#    Edwards, a spokesman for Duke's National Organization For 
#    European-American Rights.
#    
#    The FBI is investigating whether Duke gambled away hundreds of 
#    thousands of dollars he solicited from supporters of his white 
#    supremacist cause. He has not been charged with a crime.
#    
#    Duke has been in Russia to promote his new book, The Ultimate 
#    Supremacism, in which Duke argues that Russia and the former 
#    Soviet bloc can save the white race from Jewish oligarchs and 
#    organized crime. The book is being published in Russian.
#    
#    Edwards said he has never known Duke to visit a casino in the 
#    two years he has worked for him, but said it would not be a crime 
#    if he had.
#    
#    "He has been very clear in his mailings that the money is for 
#    his work and to sustain him personally," Edwards said. "If he 
#    accepts a supporter's check for $25 and happens to go out to 
#    dinner that night and it costs $25, it's not a crime."
#    
#    Edwards also said he suspects the FBI's investigation is largely 
#    based on the claims of disgruntled employees who have no 
#    credibility.
