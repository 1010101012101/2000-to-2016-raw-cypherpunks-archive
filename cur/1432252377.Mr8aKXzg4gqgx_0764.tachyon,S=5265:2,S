And what list would that be? I'd like to take a look at it.

Last summer I read "the physics of consciousness". It was a pretty
disappointing attempt to explain consciousness with QM, mixed with
lots of emotional and relgious hand waving, nice background info
though.

Anyway, this is exactly why I want to do computational neuroscience. I
also think that the turing machine is a sorely classical model, and
that the brain is definitely not a turning machine, but something
else, far more powerful.

As for making a neuron, look into the research of henry abarbanel. I
was in his lab the other day, and his students have actually made
simple neurons that can be wired into the brain of a lobster to
simulate removed neurons, creating the proper oscillation to generate
the signals which allow the lobster to digest things. He mostly does
research into the nonlines dynamic properties of neurons. I'm hoping
to work in his lab next year.
