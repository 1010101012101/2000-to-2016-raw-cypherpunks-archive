Negative, bend it in half and get two edges for the price of one.

If you have the can opening tool it is a weapon as well, great for making
big gaping puncture wounds.

Bullshit. A strike to the throat just above the shoulder blade, into the
eyes, slash into the fingers or heal, lips/ears, etc.

-EVERYTHING- is a weapon. A 'weapon' is nothing more than a STATE OF MIND.
It is the intent to do harm.

The flat circular tops and bottoms are prefered, but a piece of the
sidewall is effective just like a small razor blade (hint: fold the piece
in half).

Actually all sizes are good. You can use crochet hooks as well, hurt like
hell pulling that baby out.

Chip a bottle into a knife? Doofus, just break the bottle and use the
pieces. If you want to be stealthy don't use the kneck/bottom as a handle,
use a piece from the side just like a razor (hold betwix thumb and first
two fingers).

Like a pencil, a rolled up magazine, a plastic credit card (it will cut if
wielded in such a manner), a shoe string as a garrot, etc. Your opponents
body can be used as a weapon against itself as well (eg strangle somebody
with their own arm, or break it and then stab them with the lower bone
shard).

But that would mean they'd have to treat them as equals, and they can't
have that now....
