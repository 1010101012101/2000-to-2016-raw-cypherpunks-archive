This is really nothing new -- I've been seeing systems like these,
though home brewed, in use for years. The availability of good tools as
a foundation (things like Snort, the layer7 iptables patch, and so on)
makes building decent layer 8 inference not far from trivial. Calling
this "piercing network anonymity in real time" is highly misleading; in
reality, it's more like "making it bloody obvious that there's no such
thing as network anonymity".

The best one can hope for today is a bit of anonymous browsing and IM
with Tor, and that only insofar as you can trust a system whose single
point of failure -- the directory service -- was, at least until
recently, Roger's personal machine sitting in an MIT dorm room.
