   LATE EDITION
For the week of Friday, February 2, 2001

"They're selling sex."
-- Art Model, owner of the Super Bowl champions Baltimore 
Ravens, on the XFL (the league says the "X" doesn't stand 
for anything).

"Hot Babes." 
-- Vince McMahon of the XFL, describing his cheerleaders. 
The league debuts this weekend.

STARTING LINE
Thousands of Super Bowl fans were subjected to a 
"computerized police lineup" at America's biggest sporting 
event last weekend as police used cutting-edge technology to 
scan the crowd for criminals...

... So how did Ray Lewis get in...?

HOLLYWOOD SPORTS
The XFL football league will be unveiled this weekend. The 
league revealed they will put cheerleaders on raised 
platforms, making their underwear visible to fans and 
cameras...

... Vince McMahon always did put women on a pedestal...

POST SUPER BOWL
After being trounced by the Baltimore Ravens in the Super 
Bowl, New York Giants head coach Jim Fassel guaranteed his 
team would return to the Super Bowl, and do so soon...

... Even if we're just in the hotel across the street, 
watching on TV...

NBA
There is no evidence an Indiana fan made racial slurs 
against Philadelphia guard Allen Iverson during a game, a 
Pacers spokesman said Thursday. NBC taped Iverson shouting a 
derogatory remark about gays back at the fan near the end of 
the 76ers' 86-81 victory Sunday in Indianapolis...

... It wasn't a fan - they were playing Iverson's rap album 
over the arena sound system...

HORSE RACING
Make it 99 straight defeats for Quixall Crossett, the 
world's losingest racehorse. The 16-year-old gelding failed 
to finish a 3-mile race Thursday at the Scottish course of 
Kelso. Trailing the field for most of the way, Quixall 
Crossett was well behind when his rider decided to pull up. 
Quixall Crossett went off as a 200-1 shot in a field of nine 
in the Isle of Skye Novices' Chase, which was won by 
favorite Lord of the Sky. Quixall Crossett's losing streak 
began in 1990. Caine has to decide where and when his 
thoroughbred will make his 100th appearance...

... I hear there's a glue factory not too far away...

NFL
Ron Wolf, the architect of the Green Bay Packers' return to 
the Super Bowl in the mid-1990s, retired as executive vice 
president/general manager on Thursday... 

... Now Mark Chmura needs him to be the architect of his 
defense...

THIS WEEK IN SPORTS HISTORY
In 1997, former Atlanta Olympic bombing suspect Richard 
Jewell agreed to a $500,000 deal that gave 20th Century Fox 
the right to make a feature film about his ordeal at the 
hands of the media and the FBI...

... So he WAS be responsible for a bomb...

BOXING
Spectators in a Turkish town cheered recently as two 
four-year-old girls squared off in a boxing ring.  The 
girls, who were wearing safety helmets, exchanged blows to 
the head and repeatedly knocked each other down...

... Nick At Night is now pondering Pay-per-view...

PENALTY BOX
Seattle SuperSonics forward Ruben Patterson was suspended by 
the NBA for three games Thursday because of his conviction 
on an assault charge for breaking a man's jaw...

... The team also suspended him for doing Gary Payton's job...

The teen who accused Mark Chmura of sexual assault flirted 
with the former Green Bay Packers player at a post-prom 
party, a high school football player testified Thursday. 
Michael Kleber testified that he watched Chmura's accuser go 
willingly into a bathroom where the alleged assault took 
place. Chmura, 31, has pleaded innocent to third-degree 
sexual assault and child enticement charges, both felonies. 
He could face up to 40 years in prison and $20,000 in fines...

... "That underage kid I had illegal sex with - it wasn't my 
fault; SHE WANTED IT!!!"

For the entire Offensive Line:

YOU'RE OUT:
"I'm a golfer -- not an athlete."
-Lee Westwood of Britain, then the world's fifth-ranked golfer.
