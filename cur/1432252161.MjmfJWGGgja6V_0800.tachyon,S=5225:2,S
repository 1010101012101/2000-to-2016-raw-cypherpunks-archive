Answering only to this concrete question: the kind of things you want are
accomplished by contract signing protocols. A few recent papers:

Optimistic Protocols for Fair Exchange(N. Asokan, Matthis Schunter,
Michael Waidner, 1996)

Optimal Efficiency of Optimistic Contract Signing(Birgit Pfitzmann,
Matthias Schunter, Michael Waidner, PODC 98)

Optimistic synchronous multi-party contract signing(N. Asokan, Birgit
Baum-Waidner, Matthias Schunter, and Michael Waidner, dec 1998)

Asynchronous protocols for optimistic fair exchange(N. Asokan, Victor
Shoup, Michael Waidner, may 1998)

Optimistic asynchronous multi-party contract signing(Birgit Baum-Waidner
and Michael Waidner, nov 1998)

Optimistic fair exchange of digital signatures(N. Askon, Victor Shoup,
Michael Waidner, oct 1999)

Abuse-free Optimistic Contract Signing(Juan Garay, Markus Jakobsson, Phil
MacKenzie, CRYPTO '99)

Abuse-free Multi-party Contract Signing( Juan Garay, Phil MacKenzie, DISC
'99)

Provable Secure Certified Mail(Birgit Pfitzmann, Matthias Schunter,
Michael Waidner, 2000)

Analysis of Abuse-Free Contract Signing( Vitaly Shmatikov, John C.
Mitchell, 2000)

06/23/01 Optimistic Asynchronous Multi-Party Contract Signing with Reduced
Number of Rounds(Birgit Baum-Waidner, eprint 2001/044)

(you can find links to them at

Answering more generally: it does not help you to get non-repudiation.
Nothing does, unless Bob is able to prove that you signed this document
consiously, being sober, and generally, that you MEANT to sign it.
