"Writers Especially Concerned About NSA Actions"
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=245660885

While polls show many Americans are uneasy with government actions
revealed by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, one profession in particular
seems to be alarmed. A new survey of professional writers finds them
much more concerned than the general public. An organization of
writers says that a large majority of its members have "never been as
worried about privacy rights and freedom of the press as they are
today."
