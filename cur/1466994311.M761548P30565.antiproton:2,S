	From pretenting to be an anarchist who sucks the DMV's cock to
	being a torbot who now (maybe) admits he is promoting a
	'compromised' piece of garbage? 

	Your are too stupid rayzer - and dishonest.

	What proof do I need for such self-evident fact, fucktard? You
	promote a fake-anomity network because that's the way to
	'compromise' people. Have them use a 'compromised' tool.

	And what kinf of fucktard would argue that 'compromised' tools
	are still useful? What's the point of ever fixing anything if
	'broken' tools 'work'.

	You can't be that fucking stupid rayzer.

	Of course. They accomplish a lot for the people who compromised
	them. That's the whole point, fucktard.
