DEPT MR 21368
PO Box 55819

Re: NRO Case #F15-0117
Dear Mr. Peck:
This is in response to your request dated 19 September 2015, received
in the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on 21 September 2015. Pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act, you are requesting "Records associated
with self inspection of classified materials handling pursuant to Executive
Order (E.O.) 13526 and E.O. 13587 for the last ten (10) years."
We have accepted your request, and it is being processed in accordance
with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552, as amended. As an interim release in
response to your request, we are providing to you thirty-nine pages of
responsive information that has previously been released in part to another
requester. These pages are being released in part to you, as well.
Information that is denied is withheld pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3),
which is the basis for withholding information exempt from disclosure by
statute. The relevant withholding statute is 10 U.S.C. Â§ 424, which
provides (except as required by the President or for information provided to
Congress), that no provision of law shall be construed to require the
disclosure of the organization or any function of the NRO; the number of
persons employed by or assigned or detailed to the NRO; or the name or
official title, occupational series, grade, or salary of any such person.
Since it is unlikely we will be able to provide a complete response
within the 20 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the right to
consider this a denial and may appeal on this basis to the NRO Appeal Review
Panel, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715 after the initial 20 working
day period has elapsed. It would seem more reasonable, however, to allow us
sufficient time to continue processing your request and respond as soon as
we can. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that you agree
and will continue processing your FOIA request on this basis. You will have
the right to appeal any denial of records after you receive a final response
to your request.
The FOIA authorizes federal agencies to assess fees for record
services. Based upon the information provided, you have been placed in the
"other" category of requesters, which means you are responsible for the cost
of search time exceeding two hours ($44.00/hour) and reproduction fees ($.15
per page) exceeding 100 pages. We will notify you if it appears that we will

meet or exceed our $25.00 minimum billing threshold in processing your
request. Additional information about fees can be found on our website at
www.nro.gov .
If you have any questions, please call the Requester Services Center
at 703 - 227-9326, and reference the case number F15-0117.

PART C: Description of the Program
A description of the agency's self-inspection program to include
activities assessed, program areas covered, and methodology
utilized. The
description must demonstrate how the self-inspection program provides
the SAO with information necessary to
assess the effectiveness of the CNSI

program within individual agency activities and the agency as a whole.

Responsibility
10. How is the SAO involved in the self-inspection program? (Describe
his or her involvement with the self-inspection program.)

The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (D/OS&CI) advises the
Senior Agency Official (SAO) when
events warrant. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program (ISAP)
results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).
11. How is the self-inspection program structured to provide the SAO
with information necessary to assess the agency's CNSI program in
order to
fulfill his or her responsibilities under section 5.4(d) of E.O. 13526?

The DOS&CI receives periodic reports on the program and advises the
SAO when the DOS&CI believes events
warrant advising the SAO. The NRO ISAP results are also reported to
the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
12. Whom has the SAO designated to assist in directing and
administering the self-inspection program? Who conducts the
self-inspections?
(If the SAO conducts the self-inspections, which may be the case in
smaller agencies, indicate this.)

The DOS&CI is provided a Letter of Instruction by the Director, NRO
which assigns his responsibilities.

Approach

13. What means and methods are employed in conducting self-inspections?
(For example: interviews, surveys, data calls, checklists, analysis, etc.)

NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because contractors
make upillif the total NRO workforce
and have the overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is a
collaborative
between Government and industry to identify and address security

NRO APPROVED FOR RELEASE
28 August 2014
PART D: A summary of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The summary should present specific, concise findings from your
self-inspection program for each of the required program areas below.
It is not a
description of the requirements of the agency's CNSI program. Rather,
the summary outlines the essential self-inspection findings based on
the
compilation and/or distillation of the information contained in the
agency's internal self-inspection reports, checklists, etc. In large
agencies where
findings are drawn from multiple agency offices and activities, the
findings that are reported here may be the most significant or most
frequently
occurring.
44. Original Classification:

OCAs are senior officers and mainly exercise their authority through
the signing of classification guides for
information unique to their activity. While OCA decisions get
implemented through the classification guide,
written documentation of individual OCA decisions is difficult or
impossible to locate. OCA's were not using
the appropriate OCA classification block but a derivative block. OS&CI
Policy Branch will issue clear
instructions for all classification guides to contain the appropriate
OCA classification block.
45. Derivative Classification:

NRO activities result in complicated Power Point slide briefings with
complex tables, diagrams, and text boxes
describing engineering and R&D activities. Under reduced manning from
sequestration and budget cuts which
have resulted in a loss of over 1,000 man-years of experience across
the NRO, derivative classifiers struggle to
get all derivative markings accurate after they have compiled
difficult subject matter on compressed time lines
under stressful conditions. It is admirable that individuals perform
as well as they do.
46. Declassification:

Not included in self-inspection.

47. Safeguarding:

Regular conduct of exercises provides vital feedback to the physical
security program. Exercises identify areas
for corrective measures, enhancements, validates current tactics
techniques and procedures (TTP) and the
adoption/employment of new TTP to meet a dynamic threat environment.
Regular inspections/audits are
essential to ensuring status and validity of issued IC badges and
conformity to physical security requirements.
Risk assessments/physical security assessments provide a helpful
"outside" perspective to site security offices.
48. Security Violations:

The ISAP program is the formal mechanism by which we corroborate
self-inspections. Included in these formal
reviews is an assessment of the respective security violation program
and trends. In addition, each component
Security team evaluates Security incidents and violations by tracking
them according to general broad categories.
During this past FY, the majority (63%) of incidents/violations were
related to categories within personnel
electronic devices in SCIFs. Other categories that have multiple
occurrences indicating potential trends are data
49. Security Education and Training:

100% of personnel assigned to the NRO are required to complete an SCI
indoctrination briefing to include
signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. E.O. 13526 is called out
specifically so that personnel fully understand
their responsibilities and requirements to protect classified
information. This message is repeated by the release
of awareness videos and reminders throughout the year; to include
presentations, written materials, and training.
Specifically, OS&CI incorporates classification management questions
within the Annual Security Refresher
50. Management and Oversight:

Government oversight of NRO-sponsored SCIFs is achieved in a multi
faceted manner. Program Security
Officers, Physical/Technical, and Computer Security Officers review
self-assessment results and participate in
on-site reviews. Some program findings for FY 13 were identified in
the following areas:
â€¢ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) require more detail and more
frequent revision to stay up-to-date with
security requirements.

PART E: An assessment of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The assessment

discerns what the findings mean. The assessment is an evaluation of
the state of each element of your agency's CNSI program
based on an analysis of the specific, concise findings of the
self-inspection program. It reports what you have determined the
findings indicate about
the state of your agency's CNSI program.
The assessment should inform the SAO and other decision makers of
significant issues that impact the CNSI program. It should be used to
determine
how security programs can be improved, whether the agency regulation
or other policies and procedures must be updated, and if necessary
resources
are committed to the effective implementation of the CNSI program. The
assessment should report trends that were identified during the
reporting
period across the agency or in particular activities, as well as
trends detected by making comparisons with earlier reporting periods.
It can be used to
support assertions about the successes and strengths of an agency's program.
51. Original Classification:

While OCA's produce timely and sufficient Classification Guides,
decisions are not normally documented
outside the guide by a separate source document. OCAs are not using an
OCA style classification block but this
will be corrected soon when specific detailed policy is issued by
Security Policy.
52. Derivative Classification:

Derivative classifiers are still wrestling with proper portion marking
and classification of complex power point
slide presentations and other documents concerning difficult subject
matter and formats. To try and stem this
tide, we are adding more classification management questions to our
ASR. Dwindling budgets, reduced
manpower, and "greening" (reducing) of salaries has reduced longevity,
increased turnover, and reduced portion
marking proficiency.
53. Declassification:

Not included in self-inspection.

54. Safeguarding:

Awareness and education programs are vital to ensuring the workforce
maintains awareness of security policy
and procedures. Regular and aperiodic exercises, inspections, and
audits provide crucial inputs that are
indispensable to ensuring that the physical security program is
current and effective. Key challenges are
maintaining adequate funding to replace aging, malfunctioning, and
obsolete security equipment and training and
education for new personnel. The NRO has an organization-level process
for the Assessment and Authorization
55. Security Violations:

The NSM detail the NRO process for reporting and investigating
security incidents, infractions and violations.
Appropriate and prompt corrective actions were taken to mitigate the
severity of the infraction/violation, and to
sanction the offender via management, counterintelligence, and
personnel security processes. Infractions and
violations are centrally tracked in the Security Log (the NRO
incident/violation database). This database is
managed by the Program Security Officers in each directorate and
office, and enables the PSO to automatically
56. Security Education and Training:

OS&CI works closely with PSOs, Counterintelligence personnel, and the
Integrated Self Assessment Program
to determine any trends or specific areas that need an additional
educational awareness campaign. Security
communications are then targeted, utilizing large scale efforts, per a
topic area and audience for best impact
results. The NRO is adding additional classification management
questions to the Annual Security Refresher to
better satisfy the derivative classification training requirement.
OCAs complete yearly training provided by
57. Management and Oversight:

The NRO has a very mature Security management and oversight program.
Over the past FY, much greater
emphasis has been placed on ensuring all sites and facilities
accomplished the self-assessments and submited the
findings to the Government within the mandated time requirements. This
improved management oversight has
made an impact. Our self-inspection program coupled with security
officer visits, and formal team assessments
provide managers a report card on the health of our security programs.
When negative trends are identified,

89. Describe actions that have been taken or are
planned to correct identified program deficiencies, marking
discrepancies, or misclassification
actions, and to deter their reoccurrence.

OS&CI Policy Branch will issue written instructions that all
Classification Guides and original classification
decisions will use an OCA style classification block.
We plan to issue NRO-wide, monthly, short written educational
reminders of the most error-prone mistakes
reported in item 88 which will also include the proper way to classify
and mark materials.

PART I: Best Practices
Best practices are those actions or activities that

make your self-inspection program and/or CNSI program more effective
or efficient. They set your
program apart through innovation or by exceeding the minimum program
requirements. These are practices that may be utilized or emulated by

other agencies.

90. Describe best practices that were identified during the self-inspection.

One contractor site developed a database that allows self-assessments
to be completed by each program area at
that site. The database can apply filtering and reporting
capabilities, thereby allowing managers to focus
resources on a wide-range of security-related disciplines. This type
of approach and comprehensive tool
development had not been previously seen by the ISAP Program.

EO 13526 CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE

REQUIREMENTS
PART 1. DESCRIPTION OF SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM: A description of the
DoD Components self-

inspection program should include activities assessed, program areas
covered, and methodology
utilized. The description must demonstrate how the self-inspection
program provides the senior
agency official with the information necessary to assess the
effectiveness of the classified national
security information program within the individual Component
activities and the Component as a
whole. It should include the following:
1. Responsibility for the program:
(1) Whom does the senior agency official designate to assist in
directing and administering the self-inspection
program?
Answer . The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (DOS&CI) is
provided a Letter of Instruction by the
Director, NRO which assigns his responsibilities.
(2) How is the program structured to provide the senior agency
official with the information necessary to assess the

agency's classified national security information program?

Answer: The DOS&CI advises the Senior Agency Official (SAO) when the
DOS&CI believes events warrant
advising the SAO. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program
(ISAP) results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).

(b)(3) 10 USC 424

(3) Who conducts the self-inspections?

Answer: NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because
contractors make upgAof the total NRO
workforce and have the overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is
a collaborative process between Government and industry to identifi ,
and address security vulnerabilities, provide
datfornlysi,findings
e tmcuriyseand.Th
may lead to identification and
definition of risk mitigation practices, and enable sharing of best
security practices across government and
industry. The primary purpose of the ISAP is to ensure the proper
safeguarding of classified information through a
single comprehensive review by various components of the Office of
Security and Counterintelligence (OS&CI).
ISAP integrates reviews utilizing program security, classification
management, transportation and transmission of
classified information, physical and technical accreditation,
information systems security, personnel security, and
Counterintelligence (CI) perspectives. The integrated assessment
evaluates implementation of and ensures
compliance with, established security policies, procedures, and plans
at all NRO government and contractor
location&
Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NRO Security Manual
(NSM). Security Officers will conduct self-assessments of their SCIFs
at least annually. For the reporting period
there were 343 site self-assessments. The ISAP Manager or designee
reviews the site assessments and enters a
copy into an NRO database listing each NRO sponsored facility.
Based on the self-assessments, the ISAP Manager, Program Security
Officers (PSOs) and stakeholders discuss
findings and formulate recommendations for a formal assessment, if
required OS&CI stakeholders represent the
major OS&CI divisions and program office security staffs, including,
but not limited to, PSOs, Physical/Technical
Certification Officers, and Security Certification Officers.
Stakeholders will develop and provide ISAP candidates
to the ISAP Selection Board. Each ISAP recommendation shall contain
detailed factors used to formulate the
recommendation. Recommendation for site visits is then provided to the
selection board Sites are selected based
on ring proximity, resources, budgetary constraints, time since last
assessment, and random sampling. A team
composition is proposed for each site visit and a Lead PSO is selected
The Assessment Team will, at a minimum,
consist of a Government PSO and an OS&Cl/Facilities and Information
Security Division (F&ISD) representative.
Additional team members will be added as needed based on site size,
mission, facility risk, and subject areas being
assessed. An out-briefing is provided to site security site - and
other site senior management identfying security
program successes, observations, and any security "best practices"
discovered during the formal assessment. The
results are then loaded into the facility database that contains
information from all previous visits with any problem
areas or "best practices" noted. A final report requiring corrective
actionsto be taken within 90 days of the date of

report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site is required to
provide follow-up reports of corrective action to
the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90 days until all
corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of corrective
action are loaded into the NRO facilities
database for historical purposes. For the reporting period, 16 formal
team assessments were performed An
additional 9 formal specific-issue reviews were conducted There were
an additional 1,491 visits by OS&CI
stakeholders to contractor SCIFs.

(4) How is the senior agency official involved in the program?
Answer: The DOS&CI keeps the SAO advised of trends and issues
developed by the ISAP. The NRO ISAP results
are also reported to the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
2. Approach:

(1) What means and methods are employed in conducting self-inspections?
Answer: For formal assessments, the Assessment Team evaluates
implementation, and ensures compliance with,
established NRO security policies, procedures, and plans.

(2) Are different types of self-inspections conducted? If so, describe
each of them.
Answer: Formal assessments will vary based on the experience of the
lead PSO and the stakeholders with the
facility and items noted in the self-evaluation report as well as the
areas of responsibility of the attending subject
matter experts. However, the objective for all is to identify and
address security vulnerabilities, provide data for
analysis, and identift system security issues and trends.

(3) Do the self-inspections evaluate adherence to the principles and
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its implementing
directive and the effectiveness of agency programs covering:
â€¢ Original classification?
Answer: Since Original Classification items only apply to 13
government employees who are Original
Classification Authorities (OCA) at NRO Headquarters, a formal tasking
is sent to Program Security Officers
supporting the OCA to determine the date the OCA received their annual
briefing and the number of original
classification decisions they made during the reporting period.
Experience has shown that not all of the OCAs
make individual OCA decisions every year but most require their
authority to sign classification guides for
their area of responsibility. For the reporting period there, nine OCA
decisions were made.

â€¢

Derivative classification?
Answer: Included. In NRO Implementing Instructions released on 31 May
2011, derivative classifiers were
instructed to include in the classification block a personal
identification number rather than their name to
protect their identity and association with the NRO. This
"Classification ID (CLID)" number exists in the
NRO Access Database so the specific individual with that number can
always be identyled Employees of other
agencies, who already have an ID number assigned by their parent
agency, will use that number instead
Headquarters NRO derivative classifiers have their PSO available for
questions regarding classification and
marking and to review their derivatively classified documents for
format and accuracy of classffication and
marking. Available on the OS&CI website are the Order, Information
Security Oversight Office (IS00)
Implementing Directive and Marking booklet, videos and documents that
explain the correct way to classify
and mark documents, the Controlled Access Program Coordination Office
(CAPCO) register and manual, over
120 Frequently Asked Questions with answers that are posted about
portion marking a Security Policy hotline
that will answer their questions in real-time, and numerous other
experts who are available to answer their
questions. Once the document is distributed, they face additional
scrutiny from any security or classification
management officer who reads it or from subject matter experts who
point out classification and marking
errors to security officers.
The ISAP team visiting a site will review a sample of derivatively
classified documents to point out errors in
classification and marking, omissions of required information, and to
make suggestions for improvement.

â€¢

Declassification?
Answer: The NRO has a formal declassification program which restricts
to one office the authority to officially
declassify NRO information and release it to the public, and which is
not included in the self-inspection
program. The results of this program are reported in the SF 311 report
provided to USD(I) in October 2012.
The NRO Declassification Guide (known as the Review and Redaction
Guide) is updated and approved by the

(4) Do the self-inspections include a review of relevant security
directives and instructions, as well as interviews with
producers and users of classified information?
Answer: All directives and instructions are issued by the DOS&Cl and
are reviewed and updated annually. All
directives and instructions are maintained on-line and are accessible
to all government employees and contractors.
(5) Do the self-inspections include reviews of representative samples
of your Component's original and derivative
classification actions?
â€¢ Do these reviews encompass all Component activities that generate
classified information?
Answer: There are hundreds of individual activities that can generate
classified information. While the annual
self-assessment questionnaire covers 343 of these activities, the ISAP
formal assessment inspects only a small
percentage of these activities yearly. However, the Program Security
Officers, Contractor Program Security
Officers, and Classification Specialists review hundreds of classified
documents yearly and provide direction to
originators to correct those that are improperly marked.

requirements stated in the NSM
â€¢ Do the reviews include a sampling of various types of classified
information in document and electronic
formats?
o How do you ensure that the materials reviewed provide a

personnel who are familiar with the type
of materials produced by the site. However, contractors are not
required to count classified pages produced
because of the additional costs that would be incurred by the NRO, so
the documents reviewed may not be a
representative sample.
o How do you determine that the sample is proportionally sufficient to
enable a credible assessment of your
Component's classified product?
Answer: We do not attempt to do this as it would increase costs to the
NRO (as explained above).
â€¢ Who conducts the review of the classified products?
o Are they knowledgeable of the classification and marking
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its
implementing directive?
Answer: Yes
o Do they have access to pertinent security classification guides?
Answer: Yes
â€¢ Have appropriate personnel been designated to correct
misclassification actions? If so, identify.
Answer: All Program Security Officers and Classification Managemeni
Specialists are authorized to correct
misclassification, incorrect use of SCI channels, and incorrect
dissemination restrictions.

4. Coverage:
(1) How do you determine what program elements and Component
activities are covered by your self-inspection
program?
Answer: Self-assessments are to be completed on each contractor SCIF.

(2) What Component activities are assessed?

Answer: All contractor activities are assessed.

(3) How is the program structured to assess individual Component
activities and the Component as a whole?
Answer: Contractor locations far outnumber government locations in the
NRO. Government locations are
relatively few in number and have professional government security
officers assigned who can monitor
safeguarding and classified information production and correct errors
as they occur. We chose to concentrate on
contractorfacilities which are visited relatively infrequently. The
conditions at contractor locations are not directly
applicable to government locations.

(4) If your Component has any special access programs (SAP), are
self-inspections of the SAP programs conducted
annually?
Answer: Most SAPs are reviewed as part of the ISAP program. The ISAP
formal assessment team has PSOs
assigned that are briefed for most SAPs. In addition. the NRO conducts
special annual reviews (in some cases.
semi-annual) of the entire Sensitive Activities portfolio.

o

o

Do the self-inspections confirm that the Component head or principal
deputy has reviewed each special access
program annually to determine if it continues to meet the requirements
of E.O. 13526?
Answer: The NRO's entire Sensitive Activities portfolio is reviewed
and briefed annually to the DNI's Senior
Review Group (SRG) who then reports to Congress.

Do the self-inspections determine if officers and employees are aware
of the prohibitions and sanctions for
creating or continuing a special access program contrary to the
requirements of E.O. 13526?
Answer: Yes. In keeping with E.O. 13526, all Sensitive Activities'
compartments that are established
terminated, or transitioned (to another program or lower
classification) require NRO Special Activities
Management Board review and approval, followed by notification to the
DNI's Senior Review
Group/Controlled Access Program Oversight Committee.

5. Reporting:

(1) What format for documenting self-inspections in your Component?
Answer: Self assessments are documented using the self-assessment
review tool in the NSM, Appendix B. For
formal assessments, an out-briefing is provided to site security staff
and other site senior management identi&ing
security program successes, observations, and any security "best
practices" discovered during the formal
assessment. The results are then loaded into the facility database
that contains information from all previous visits
with any problem areas or "best practices" noted A final report
requiring corrective actions to be taken within 90
days of the date of report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site
is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90
days until all corrective actions are
complete. The responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports
of corrective action are loaded into the
NRO facilities database for historical purposes.

(2) Who receives the reports?
Answer: The OS&CI ISAP Manager.

(3) Who compiles/analyzes the reports?
Answer: The ISAP Manager and the responsible PSO analyze the report.
(4)

How are the findings analyzed to determine if there are problems of a
systemic nature?

Answer: The ISAP Manager provides to the sponsoring Government Program
Security Officer (GPSO) for review
and subsequent action.
(5) How and when are the results of the self-inspections reported to
the senior agency official?
Answer: The DOS&CI determines when results warrant informing the SAO.

(6) How is it determined if corrective actions are required?
Answer: The GPSO and security stalceholder(s) review.

13. What means and methods are employed in conducting self inspections?
(For example: interviews, surveys, data calls, checklists, analysis, etc.)
-

NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because
of the total NRO workforce and have the
contractors make up
overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is a collaborative process between
Government and industry to identify and address security
vulnerabilities, provide data for analysis, and identify system
security issues and trends. Site personnel conduct/document
security self-assessments, per requirements stated in the NRO
Security Manual (NSM) at least annually. The ISAP Manager or
designee reviews the site assessments and enters a copy into an
NRO database listing each NRO sponsored facility. Based on the
self-assessments, the ISAP Manager, Program Security Officers
(PSOs) and stakeholders discuss findings and formulate
recommendations for a formal assessment, if required. OS&CI
stakeholders represent the major OS&CI directorates and program
office security staffs, including, but not limited to, PSOs,

UNCLASSIFIED
Physical/Technical Certification Officers and Security
Certification Officers. Stakeholders develop and provide ISAP
candidates to the ISAP Selection Board. Each ISAP
recommendation shall contain detailed factors used to formulate
the recommendation. Recommendation for site visits is then
provided to the selection board. Sites are selected based on
risk, proximity, resources, budgetary constraints, time since
last assessment, and random sampling. A team composition is
proposed for each site visit and a Lead PSO is selected. The
Assessment Team will, at a minimum, consist of a Government PSO
and an OS&Cl/Facilities and Information Security Division
(F&ISD) representative. Additional team members will be added
as needed based on site size, mission, facility risk, and
subject areas being assessed. After the on-site assessment, an
out-briefing is provided to site security staff and other site
senior management identifying security program successes,
observations, and any security "best practices" discovered
during the formal assessment. The results are loaded into the
facility database that contains information from all previous
visits with any problem areas or "best practices" noted. A
final report requiring corrective actions to be taken within 90
days of the date of the report is issued by the D/OS&CI. The
assessed site is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager
every 90 days until all corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of
corrective action are loaded into the NRO facilities database
for historical purposes. For the reporting period, 291 selfassessments
were received and 10 formal team assessments were
performed. No additional formal specific-issue reviews were
conducted. There were an additional 742 visits by OS&CI
stakeholders to contractor SCIFs. In addition, a data call was
conducted with all PSOs and CMOs in NRO Headquarters to answer
items 87 and 88.
20. Describe below how the agency identifies activities and
offices whose documents are to be included in the sample of
classification actions. (Indicate if NA.)

assessment, if required. OS&CI stakeholders represent the major
OS&CI directorates and program office security staffs,
including, but not limited to, PSOs, Physical/Technical
Certification Officers and Security Certification Officers.
Stakeholders develop and provide ISAP candidates to the ISAP
Selection Board. Each ISAP recommendation shall contain
detailed factors used to formulate the recommendation.
Recommendation for site visits is then provided to the selection
board. Sites are selected based on risk, proximity, resources,
budgetary constraints, time since last assessment, and random
sampling. A team composition is proposed for each site visit
and a Lead PSO is selected.
Additionally, several types of documents at NRO headquarters are
reviewed annually by CMOs and PSOs for proper classification and
marking. A data call was conducted with all PSOs and CMOs in
NRO Headquarters to answer items 87 and 88.
22. How do you ensure that the materials reviewed provide a
representative sample of the agency's classified information?
(Indicate if NA.)
Documents are selected for review in cooperation with site
personnel who are familiar with the type of materials produced
by the site. However, contractors are not required to count
classified pages produced because of the additional costs that
would be incurred by the NRO, so the documents reviewed may not
be a representative sample. The data call conducted with NRO
Headquarters PSOs and CMOs for item 87 and 88 represents all
documents they reviewed during FY 2013.
31. How is the self-inspection program structured to assess
individual agency activities and the agency as a whole?
Contractor SCIF locations far outnumber government SCIF
locations in the NRO. Government locations are relatively few
in number and have professional government security officers
assigned who can monitor safeguarding and classified information
production and correct errors as they occur. We chose to
concentrate on contractor facilities which are visited
relatively infrequently. The conditions at contractor locations
are not directly applicable to government locations.

35. What is the format for documenting self-inspections in your
agency?
Self-assessments are documented using the self-assessment review
tool in the NSM, Appendix B. For formal assessments, an outbriefing is
provided to site security staff and other site
senior management identifying security program successes,
observations, and any security "best practices" discovered
during the formal assessment. The results are then loaded into
the facility database that contains information from all
previous visits with any problem areas or "best practices"
noted. A final report requiring corrective actions to be taken
within 90 days of the date of report is issued by the D/OS&CI.
The assessed site is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager
every 90 days until all corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of
corrective action are loaded into the NRO facilities database
for historical purposes.
47. Safeguarding:
Regular conduct of exercises provides vital feedback to the
physical security program. Exercises identify areas for
corrective measures, enhancements, validate current tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTP) and the adoption/employment of
new TTP to meet a dynamic threat environment. Regular
inspections/audits are essential to ensuring status and validity
of issued IC badges and conformity to physical security
requirements. Risk assessments/physical security assessments
provide a helpful "outside" perspective to site security
offices. NRO government and contractor personnel work in SCIFs
equipped with secure telephones, FAX, and teleconferencing
equipment, badges and badge readers, guard forces in several
locations, document shredders and other features to ensure
compromises of classified information do not occur. While the
insider threat is always a possibility, we take every precaution
to prevent security incidents from occurring. The NRO applies
uniform procedures established by the Intelligence Community
Directive (ICD)-503 family of policy and guidance for
Information Technology Systems Security Risk Management and
Assessment and Authorization (A&A) activities.

self - inspections. Included in these formal reviews is an
assessment of the respective security violation program and
trends. In addition, each component Security team evaluates
Security incidents and violations by tracking them according to
general broad categories. During this past FY, the majority
(63%) of incidents/violations were related to categories within
personnel electronic devices in SCIFs. Other categories that
have multiple occurrences indicating potential trends are data
spills (9%) and inadvertent removal of classified information
(12%). Personal cell phones and prohibited electronic devices
are not allowed in SCIFs. While we have installed lockers
outside SCIFs to secure cell phones, entry of prohibited
electronic devices into SCIFs is still a problem. Visitor
attendance to NRO conferences/facilities result in numerous cell
phones being brought into the conference even by individuals
with security duties who should know better.
49. Security Education and Training:
100% of personnel assigned to the NRO are required to complete
an SCI indoctrination briefing to include signing a NonDisclosure
Agreement. E.O. 13526 is called out specifically so
that personnel fully understand their responsibilities and
requirements to protect classified information. This message is
repeated by the release of awareness videos and reminders
throughout the year; to include presentations, written
materials, and training. Specifically, OS&CI incorporates
classification management questions within the Annual Security
Refresher (ASR) web-based training (WBT). In 2014 ASR will
include additional Derivative Classification questions. With as
many contractors as the NRO employs, training can be a major
expense. Every contractor and government employee with a secure
computer account is required to take the Annual Security
Refresher training otherwise they lose their computer
connection. There are numerous additional courses and
specialized security training available on-line even though
sequestration has reduced training manpower overall to include
elimination of the Information Management Branch which ran the
OS&CI web site and security-specific applications.

50. Management and Oversight:
Government oversight of NRO-sponsored SCIFs is achieved in a
multi-faceted manner. Program Security Officers,
Physical/Technical, and Computer Security Officers review
selfassessment results and participate in on-site reviews. Some
program findings for FY 13 were identified in the following
areas:
â€¢ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) require more detail and
more frequent revision to stay up-to-date with security
requirements.
â€¢ Foreign travel and contact reporting were not always
accomplished using the mandated NRO Counterintelligence Network
(CINet).
â€¢ There are undocumented information systems within facilities.
â€¢ Not all employees with AIS privileged user type access have
been identified and tracked.
â€¢ Facility alarm test records are not always maintained for the
required time period.
â€¢ Red/Black cabling is not labeled for identification.
54. Safeguarding:
Awareness and education programs are vital to ensuring the
workforce maintains awareness of security policy and procedures.
Regular and aperiodic exercises, inspections, and audits provide
crucial inputs that are indispensable to ensuring that the
physical security program is current and effective. Key
challenges are maintaining adequate funding to replace aging,
malfunctioning, and obsolete security equipment and training and
education for new personnel. The NRO has an organization-level
process for the Assessment and Authorization (A&A) of
Information Systems and a Directive 51-1, "Information
Technology, Information Assurance, and Information Management
Architecture and Strategy for Certification and Accreditation"
to ensure automated information systems that collect, create,
communicate, compute, disseminate, process or store classified
information are protected in accordance with applicable national
policy issuances.

55. Security Violations:
The NSM details the NRO process for reporting and investigating
security incidents, infractions and violations. Appropriate and
prompt corrective actions were taken to.mitigate the severity of
the infraction/violation, and to sanction the offender via
management, counterintelligence, and personnel security
processes. Infractions and violations are centrally tracked in
the Security Log (the NRO incident/violation database). This
database is managed by the Program Security Officers in each
directorate and office, and enables the PSO to automatically
notify Counterintelligence Division and Personnel Security
Division, via a system generated e-mail, of
infractions/violations that require immediate CI and/or
personnel security attention. The database also enables both
OS&CI management as well as individual PSOs to track and analyze
trends linked to the various categories of security
infractions/violations.
56. Security Education and Training:
OS&CI works closely with PSOs, Counterintelligence personnel,
and the Integrated Self Assessment Program to determine any
trends or specific areas that need an additional educational
awareness campaign. Security communications are then targeted,
utilizing large scale efforts, per a topic area and audience for
best impact results. The NRO is adding additional
classification management questions to the Annual Security
Refresher to better satisfy the derivative classification
training requirement. OCAs complete yearly training provided by
NRO/OS&Cl/Policy Branch with direct knowledge of current CAPCO
guidelines.
57. Management and Oversight:
The NRO has a very mature Security management and oversight
program. Over the past FY, much greater emphasis has been
placed on ensuring all sites and facilities accomplished the
self-assessments and submited the findings to the Government
within the mandated time requirements. This improved management
oversight has made an impact. Our self-inspection program
coupled with security officer visits, and formal team

assessments provide managers a report card on the health of our
security programs. When negative trends are identified,
managers from across industry and the Government develop
corrective action plans to reverse the trends and ensure
security requirements are met. Impacts are being felt to
overall security programs due to reductions in security
resources. While security requirements are increasing,
especially in the area of information systems management,
resources are being reduced. Additionally, some sites assessed
have made decisions not to fully comply with a security
requirement because of resource constraints.
