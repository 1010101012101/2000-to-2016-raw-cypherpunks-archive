That *so* wasn't the idea.

Precisely as in the case of copyright law and its rules for public playback.
Those permit some pretty wild interpretations, if stretched to their limit.
The record companies simply aren't stupid enough to try. The bad-will
aroused by such a move would be far too bad a PR blunder. And if they ever
wanted to harrass people via such laws, they would do much what was done
during the DeCSS trial - prosecute on the letter of the law, speak to the
public about their favorite view-of-the-day of its spirit.

Which is good, considering that dormant law often doesn't stay that way. I'm
just worried that if they pass some AHRA type deal over here, what will not
be copied is this single acceptable part.

If I really thought of Finland as the pinnacle of liberal achievement, I
would not be subscribed to this list. Unlearning takes some time, see.
