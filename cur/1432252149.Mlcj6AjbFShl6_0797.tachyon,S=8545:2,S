JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FUNDS TO 26 STATES FOR INFORMATION SHARING 
INITIATIVES

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FUNDS TO 26 STATES FOR INFORMATION SHARING 
INITIATIVES

         WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Justice Department grants to 26 states totaling 
more than
$16 million will help them share information across jurisdictional and 
criminal justice system component lines and lead to improving the way they 
do business.  The funds will help states link key information systems that 
include crime and offender information that will lead to better sentencing 
decisions, enhanced public safety and other benefits derived from more 
comprehensive, better coordinated criminal justice information systems.
         "For too long, the different arms of the criminal justice system 
at the federal, state, and local levels have not known what the others were 
doing," said Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Acting Assistant Attorney 
General Mary Lou Leary.  "By helping law enforcement, courts, probation and 
parole agencies, and other components of the criminal justice system to 
more effectively share information, we will exponentially enhance public 
safety."
         The grants are being made under a program authorized by the Crime 
Identification Technology Act of 1998-more commonly referred to as 
CITA.  The program is being administered by the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA), a component of OJP, in cooperation with the National 
Governors' Association's Center for Best Practices.

         In Fiscal Year 2000, BJA and NGA's Center for Best Practices 
provided Information Integration program planning grants of $25,000 to 42 
states and hosted a series of information integration workshops that were 
attended by representatives of state implementation teams  from 45 states.
         These 26 grants will allow selected states to build on that work 
and lay the groundwork for future national information integration efforts.
         "Rapid advances in technology have allowed police, prosecutors, 
courts, and corrections to build impressive information systems," said 
Leary.  "The key is to allow these systems to share information.  Judges 
who have reliable up-to-date arrest records will be able to make better 
sentencing decisions.  In turn, police who have complete information about 
outstanding warrants and criminal histories will be in a better position to 
detain dangerous criminals, who do not belong back on the street."
         The projects being funded with the grants being announced today 
range from $40,000 to $1 million initiatives.  The projects will last 
between 12 and 24 months and must contribute directly to improving 
information sharing among all or some of the law enforcement and criminal 
justice agencies at the state and local levels.
