this part i like!

i'm waiting for some judge to rule that these tricks effectively
disclose the reception of an NSL and are thus illegal.  judges don't
like technical hair splitting when the intent is clear: to disclose
what you are forbidden from disclosing.

(of course, Doug Thompson was able to skate by disclosure carefully so
perhaps this isn't much of a concern[1] :)

no keys are stored at the remote location?  or the traffic is
encrypted before the files are stored to disk plaintext?

keeping remote secrets secure is hard (usually requires hardware
tokens with tamper resistance)
