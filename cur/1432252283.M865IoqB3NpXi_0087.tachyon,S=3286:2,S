Integrated Multicast for Ad-Hoc Networks

The IMAHN project is investigating multicast protocols in ad-hoc
networks.
Ad-hoc networks are collections of mobile nodes communicating using
wireless media, without any fixed infrastructure.
Conventional routing is inadequate in these scenarios, as the mobility
aspect can cause rapid and frequent changes in
network topology. Moreover, each mobile host must be able to act both as
a network router and an endpoint, because
limited transmission ranges necessitate forwarding packets over multiple
hops.

Existing multicast protocols fall short because node mobility causes
conventional multicast trees to rapidly become
outdated. Frequent state changes require constant updates, reducing the
already limited bandwidth available for data, and
possibly never converging to accurately portray the current topology.

Instead, a stateless multicast protocol is proposed for the above
scenario. This is based on flooding the network with
packets of the multicast stream. Adaptive flooding is introduced to
enhance multicast reliability in the face of high
mobility.
