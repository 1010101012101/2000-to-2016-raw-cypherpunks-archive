	I argue that the market is distorted by the financial mafia, by
	big (and even some small) business, by public 'education' (makes
	people stupid) by religion (makes peoples stupid *and* evil), by
	'fashion' (advertising) - and more. 

	As a result, people buy useless and 'fashionable' stuff,
	produced by privileged firms, and financed by 'cheap' (i.e. fake) credit.

	'economically wise' choices can be made in a free market, not
	in the current mercantilistic/fascist system.

	So a criminal monopoly is going to define what 'justice' is,
	and enforce it, too. 

	You can keep repeating absurd, mainstream propaganda without
	any regard to logic, but what's the point? What can you
	achieve?

	So your criminal monopoly is not only going to pretend that
	their crimes are 'just' and 'fair'. They are so enlightened that
	they are also going to 'advance' 'science'. 

	Come on Lodewijk. Why don't you do your homework? Learn the ABC
	of poltical theory. 



> But, there is no

	Ah, so your monopoly of crime is going to tyranize the whole
	planet. Cute.

	I think your baseless, economically ignorant opinions are just
	that. Baseless and ignorant. 

	Plus, you thik you have the 'right' to force people to conform
	to your 'utopia'. Do you mind explaining how you acquired that 'right'?
	<----fundamental question.

	Do you mind answering fundamental questions?

	So, you are also defending the 'intellectual property' mafia? 

	It's a 'necessary evil'? (doubly retarded since you don't
	believe in 'evil' eh? )

	Sure. What if I beat you to a pulp? For your own good of
	course. Oh, 'your own good' is whatever I say it is. I am the
	government. 


> But coercion for

	Okay. You can keep repeating the same totalitarian
	'progressive' nonsense ad nauseam. But I had enough.

	Clueless rambling. Or ill intentioned, self-serving propaganda.

	Sure. Soldiers and wall street bankers are just as innocent as
	4 year old children.
