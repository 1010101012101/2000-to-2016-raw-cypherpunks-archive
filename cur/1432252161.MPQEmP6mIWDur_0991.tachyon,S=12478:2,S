tonight in the us of agh  on 60 minutes they had on a giant ad for the NSA

fr what i understand alexander has his office set up as star trek battleship

and this was really weird they do standing meetings with a blue light on
where he gets a report read to him - they gave the appearance of children
playing a game

they said every summer they have high school student interns break code for
them and they are highly successful

i just wonder if ppl are thinking about the bio sphere at all in terms of
some sort of 'encryption' method i mean if we can work outside of the
little box they have made for themselves (and us) then  mayb things r
movable?
