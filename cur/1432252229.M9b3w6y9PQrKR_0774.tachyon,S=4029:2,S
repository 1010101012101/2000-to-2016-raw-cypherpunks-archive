Certainly gives a new twist to TEMPEST. I suppose now if you wanted to
tempest your home, you'd additionally have to install randomly "blinking"
heat generators.

Hmmm, something like a big grid of resistors where they get turned on and
off at random.

You might want the resistors to spell out "Mind your own business, pigs!"
when viewed with a thermal device, but of course this kind of thing will 
only attract their attention.

You could also use peltier coolers, but they generate heat on the other 
side.

Another option would be to get big huge water circulators and call it
art - there are a few restaurants here in NYC where they have water 
running over glass panes.  It's a nice calming waterfall effect. :)
