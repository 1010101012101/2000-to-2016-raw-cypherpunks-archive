Perhaps some on the list can explain to me what the governors are asking 
from Congress.  A plain reading of the Constitution supports and recent SC 
decisions have confirmed that the Commerce Clause prohibits states from 
taxing out-of-state corporations without an in-state nexus.  Congress is 
also prohibited from delegating their taxation powers to the states, in the 
same way the SC ruled they may not delegate to the Pres the editing of 
bills via the line item veto, so what are they asking for?
