So what do we need to put that back in to a working cryptocoin? I see
all this nonsense about putting stuff 'on top of' bitcoin, but it seems
like it really ought to be integrated, or if not integrated, at least 
follow the unix philosphy of individual tools you can compose together.

Libbitcoin seems to have had that 'tools' approach, but it appears to
have no use case, and can you even mine an altchain with it?
