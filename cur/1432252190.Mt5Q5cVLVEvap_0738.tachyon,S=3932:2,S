Increasing voter turnout is, of course, a Bad Thing. For the reasons we 
discuss so often.

Mandating a National Election Holiday is, of course, statist and 
unconstitutional. If Employer Alice negotiates with Employee Bob that 
he work on a particular day, he works on that particular day. 
Government cannot interfere.

(Or if they try to, those involved have earned a loaded 747 flown into 
their building.)

And, practically, elections come at various times during the year in 
different states, with sometimes several elections in a year. Can't 
have a "mandated holiday" for each, right?

Further, even on mandated holidays, _some_ people must work just to 
keep the machinery going. Examples are legion, from cops to oil 
refinery workers to election place employees. What, are these people 
especially disenfranchised by having to work while employees of Intel 
and Apple are told the State has decreed they get to skip work? (Won't 
even work for Intel, as the wafer fabs run 24/7 and _cannot_ be shut 
down....don't know about Apple's situation.)


When the fuck will people stop proposing statist solutions?

Or should we just add 20 of the remaining 30 list subscribers here to 
the list of 25 million in these united states who need to be sent up 
the chimneys? Works for me.
