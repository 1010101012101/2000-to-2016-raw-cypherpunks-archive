I'd say there's multiple layers. "Bitcoin" is defined by name in a paper
describing the crypto algorithms. But there's a "bitcoin economy" that
is based around bitcoin itself, plus a number of traders who will swap
bitcoins for things (some of those things being other currencies). Then
there's a "bitcoin community" that encompasses those traders as well as
mere players in the market, interested parties, pundit bloggers...

Bitcoin itself seems to be weathering the recent turmoil of the bitcoin
economy well. The economy is in tatters because it's small and immature,
but such things can only be grown upwards from tiny seeds, so this is a
hard-to-avoid stage of growing pains. Whether it will succeed or not
remains to be seen, but even if the bitcoin *economy* fails, bitcoin
itself may well still succeed, perhaps by finding a new application in
more limited economies... we'll see.

Who knows? It's the only decentralized algorithm I've seen yet for
*electronic* currency (gold/diamonds/etc work in the Real World).

That's hard to predict... let's wait and see!

That's complex :-)

It's hard to say... People need to think of more electronic currency
systems so they can be compared. Digital bearer cash has never quite
taken off, for mainly commercial reasons. The decentralisation of
Bitcoin seems to be an important factor.

Not necessarily

It's been tried, and not taken off; but if the exact reasons why can be
pinned down sufficiently, and fixes found, they may have legs in the
long run.

Yep! But I think we need to watch and see for now... stuff is happening
faster than people seem able to reason about it :-)

It'd be nice if something better could be designed, but as I see it,
while currencies can be designed, economies and communities are complex
dynamical systems that have to *evolve*.

Exactly... I wouldn't bet my life savings on it, but it's an interesting
gamble, and an investment into something that could lead to an
interesting new economy if it takes off :-)

There's not much I actually want to buy with bitcoins, but I try and
spend them when I can, to encourage the actual merchants into the market
- all this currency speculation is well and good, but I'd like more of
an actual products market. I've bought a "I bought this badge with a
bitcoin!" badge from nerdmeritbadges.com, and donated a few bitcents to
some folks who were doing good work for the community; but most of the
fun stuff for sale in BTC is in the States (bitmunchies.com and the
alpaca socks people), while the same products can be had a LOT nearer me...

Quite. We're mainly disagreeing over terminology ;-)
