Still confused...

The original connection to www.amazon.com is an SSL connection, right?
We are following an https: URL?  (Otherwise, SSL would not even come
into the picture.)

If you do a DNS hack to redirect www.amazon.com to amazon.hackeddomain.com,
the latter site will not be able to complete SSL handshaking without
triggering a browser warning, will it?

Are you suggesting that the server would reply to the SSL handshake
with a NULL transform?  I just checked my browser (Netscape) and it
did not offer NULL as an option.  The only ciphersuites offered in the
client_hello message were:

     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC4_128_WITH_MD5          = { 0x01,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC4_128_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5 = { 0x02,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC2_CBC_128_CBC_WITH_MD5  = { 0x03,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC2_CBC_128_CBC_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5 = { 0x04,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_IDEA_128_CBC_WITH_MD5     = { 0x05,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_DES_192_EDE3_CBC_WITH_MD5 = { 0x07,0x00,0xC0 };

The server must choose from this list, and all of these require the
server to respond with an RSA certificate.

So it looks to me like the SSL protocol will not allow the redirection
attack to work without triggering a user alert, unless there is some
subtlety here...
