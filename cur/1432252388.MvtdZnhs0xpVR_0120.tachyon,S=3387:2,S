 >> The Tristan Chord: Wagner and
Philosophy (Bryan Magee, 2001, 397 p.) When? Last week.<<

Is there any mention of Bakunin and Wagner in Dresden during an 1848 era 
uprising? Its been suggested Siegfried might have been modelled on Bakunin 
at the barricades. The reviews of this book are worth a look at Amazon.

 >>VCR: the old BBC
productions of Shakespeare's Timon of Athens, <<

Ever thought about greek birth control? The greek technique?

 >>The Merchant of Venice, <<

If I prick you...how does that go? Something about 2handfulls of flesh.

 >>Richard
II, <<

Was he the one with the hump?

 >>and Henry IV part 1, one a night. <<

 >>Some C-SPAN, bookTV on C-SPAN 2. <<

When Adam delved and Eve span,who then was the Gentleman?

 >>So the next time you feel like sniffing at somone else's <<
