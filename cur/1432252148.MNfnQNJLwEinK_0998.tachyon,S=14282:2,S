Maybe, but he could reply just based on public information.  Despite this
he was unable or unwilling to challenge Ross Anderson.

I don't agree with this distinction.  If I use a smart card chip that
has a private key on it that won't come off, is that protecting me from
third parties, or vice versa?  If I run a TCPA-enhanced Gnutella that
keeps the RIAA from participating and easily finding out who is running
supernodes (see http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/09/2347245 for
the latest crackdown), I benefit, even though the system technically is
protecting the data from me.

I wrote earlier that if people were honest, trusted computing would not
be necessary, because they would keep their promises.  Trusted computing
allows people to prove to remote users that they will behave honestly.
How does that fit into your dichotomy?  Society has evolved a myriad
mechanisms to allow people to give strong evidence that they will keep
their word; without them, trade and commerce would be impossible.  By your
logic, these protect third parties from you, and hence should be rejected.
You would discard the economic foundation for our entire world.

David Grawrock of Intel has an interesting slide presentation on
TCPA at http://www.intel.com/design/security/tcpa/slides/index.htm.
His slide 3 makes a good point: "All 5 members had very different ideas
of what should and should not be added."  It's possible that some of
the differences in perspective and direction on TCPA are due to the
several participants wanting to move in different ways.  Some may have
been strictly focused on DRM; others may have had a more expansive
vision of how trust can benefit all kinds of distributed applications.
So it's not clear that you can speak of the "real goal" of TCPA, when
there are all these different groups with different ideas.

Nonsense.  The web is ubiquitous, but is not a monopoly.

That same language is in the Credible Interoperability document presently
on the web site at
http://www.trustedcomputing.org/docs/Credible_Interoperability_020702.pdf.
So I don't think there is necessarily any kind of a cover-up here.

Yes, DRM can clearly benefit from TCPA/Palladium.  And you might be
right that they are downplaying that now.  But the reason could be
that people have focused too much on it as the only purpose for TCPA,
just as you have done here.  So they are trying to play up the other
possibilities so as to get some balance in the discussion.

You are reading an awful lot into this one word "transaction".  That
doesn't necessarily mean buying digital content.  In the abstract sense
"transaction" is sometimes used to refer to any exchange of information in
a protocol.  Even if we do stick to its commercial meaning, it can mean
a B2B exchange or any of a wide range of other e-commerce activities.
It's not specific to DRM by any means.

I agree that the documentation is a problem, but IMO it probably reflects
lack of resources rather than obfuscation.  I believe that TCPA has many
more applications than you and other critics are giving it credit for,
and that a good, clear explanation of what it could do would actually
gain it support.  Do a blog search at daypop.com to see what people are
really thinking about TCPA.  They read Ross Anderson's TCPA FAQ and take
it for gospel.  They believe TCPA has serial number revocations and all
these other features that are not described in any documents I have seen.
A good clear TCPA description could only improve its reputation, which
certainly can't go any lower than it is.

I agree in principle, but I am appalled that you believe that Lucky in
particular is heading in the right direction.  Adam on the other hand
has at least begun to study TCPA and was asking good questions about
Palladium before Peter Biddle flew the coop.  Will this document say
that TCPA is designed to support intelligence agency access to computers?
to kill free software?  and other such claims from Lucky's presentation?
If so, you will only hurt your cause.  On the other hand, if you do
come up with factual and unbiased information showing both good and bad
aspects of TCPA, as I think Adam has come close to doing a few times,
then it could be a helpful document.

Conclusions should be based on technology.  TCPA can be rightly
criticized for weak protections of privacy, for ultimately depending on
the security of a few central keys and of possibly-weak hardware, and on
other technical grounds.  But you should not criticize it for supporting
DRM, or for making reverse engineering more difficult, because people
are under no obligation to give their creative works away for free,
or to make it easy for other people to copy their software.  Leave your
values at home and just present the facts.

No one has made any such allegation, although presumably it happens to
be true.  The point in contention is whether TCPA has DRLs!  Lucky has
claimed this, and Ross claimed the related serial number revocation
list, SNRL.  Both of them have linked this technology to TCPA/Palladium.
Yet as Ross admitted in
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/ukcrypto/2002-June/019463.html,
SNRL's do not need TCPA!

In fact, you are perfectly correct that Microsoft architectures would
make it easy at any time to implement DRL's or SNRL's.  They could do
that tomorrow!  They don't need TCPA.  So why blame TCPA for this feature?
TCPA is a technology.  You can't take every bad thing Microsoft ever
will do and say that TCPA is at fault.

I don't even see that TCPA would particularly help with a SNRL, except
insofar as TCPA can generally strengthen security in all respects.
But remote attestation and sealing, the core TCPA technologies, don't
have anything to do with SNRLs.

The association of TCPA with SNRLs is a perfect example of the bias and
sensationalism which has surrounded the critical appraisals of TCPA.
I fully support John's call for a fair and accurate evaluation of this
technology by security professionals.  But IMO people like Ross Anderson
and Lucky Green have disqualified themselves by virtue of their wild and
inaccurate public claims.  Anyone who says that TCPA has SNRLs is making
a political statement, not a technical one.  For a credible evaluation,
you need people who have no track record of bias with regard to the
technology.
