I agree completely. The Home Recording Act I referenced in my last 
message was also a tax (on blank tape), and yet it certainly didn't 
stop the recording companies from going after Napster, MP3, and 
various other companies.

The governments of the world always love new excuses to add taxes.

And the extra lobbying that will result as companies scramble to try 
to glom onto this "revenue stream" will also be welcome to 
governments: this will increase campaign contributions, kickbacks, 
bribes, and lucrative post-gov't. employment offers. The mother's 
milk of politics.

And cretins like Gore and McCain babble on about "campaign reform." 
Why do high tech companies feel the need to fund _both_ major parties 
in these United States? Insurance. Protection money. The nation is a 
"shakedown state," a protection racket, with campaign contributions 
and the like just the rent the government collects. This funds the 
lobbyists in their large Georgetown mansions, this funds the 
Caribbean cruises, this funds the lucrative jobs at Halliburton 
(Cheney), Microsoft (Patty Murray), and so on, for a hundred other 
such examples.)

This whole foo-fah over MP3 is just seen as a chance to shake down 
the companies for more money, with the highest bidder winning the pot.

Germany is just trying to get into the racket as best it can.
