And, as you say, it was an unthinking act - for which ONLY you (as a
company) should be responsible.

I'll cry for them - not.  The insurance industry has it pretty
sweet.  They are specifically exempted from anti-trust laws, and are
pretty much free to do as they please.  I seriously doubt there is a
person on this list who has not been screwed at least once by the
insurance industry.

Then the industry should cease to write these policies.

Like I said, the insurance industry has a pretty sweet deal...

As it should be.

Um, pardon me, but isn't the assesment of risk what the industry does for
a living?  Or are they hereby admitting that they in fact operate on some
other basis?

Again, as it should be.

Of course: the insurance industry is merely a form of gambling, and as
such, needs to "balance their book", i.e., charge based on likely risk of
loss.

You mean it would have *anti insurance industry* consequences.  At least
be honest here.

Which of course will have to be factored into the rents/leases/development
plans/etc.  One of the many reasons people move away from cities is the
very significant drop in insurance rates (based on risk of loss in the
flight areas of course.  My rates dropped by almost 2/3rd when I left the
city).

Then the industry will have to either adjust their rates to distribute the
risk across their entire subscriber group, or charge what they need to,
and let the cities worry about themselves.

Too late. These costs are already levied on those who live in cities.  If
they don't like it, they can (and will) move to a place where conditions
are more amenable to their lifestyle and financial situation.  Why should
I subsidize someone elses risk so they can live in a [high crime / highly
attractive terrorist target].  These are life choices made by people who
choose to live in these places - it is not my job to pay their way
disproportionally.

Yeah, right.  This is the outfit that allowed the S&L debacle of the 80's
to thrive.  I am not keen to using a model of modern corruption as a model
for anything else that I have to [also] pay for.

Again, as it should be.   Now of course, the FDIC and it's ilk have
created a situation where "banks" can bilk billions of dollars from those
who don't even do business with them (through the forced application of
force to collect the "taxes" which pay for the likes of the FDIC.

If bankers were responsible for their own fuck ups, we'd have a much
better banking system.

This is simple bullshit.  If the insurance industry wants to provide
insurance with collosal risk, they can simply charge collosal premiums.

And then reintroduced by the FDIC encouraged "bailout".

So?  The assumption of risk is a business decision, like all others.  It
must balance many different things, including the risk of terrorists,
police officer payouts, consumer confidence/spending, and a myriad of
other things.  If the risk of financial loss is greater than the risk of
financial gain, then you do the business.  Otherwise, you don't - unless
this logical balance is disturbed by the kind of drivel we are seeing here
(the requiring of those [relatively] not in risk to assume the risk of the
person who is *supposed* to be balancing these diverse risks him/herself.

> Insurers won't assume the risk -- 
> we were previously dumb, but we've learned.

Dumb?  No.  The actuaries merely underestimated the actual level of risk,
and as a result the industry had to payout.  Thats what it is all about.

> It isn't right, though, that 
> these risk-laden millions should have to shoulder this burden themselves.

Why not?  Be precise: what's "not right" about making a person assume the
risks of their own actions?

Or, as I pointed out above, the industry can do this for themselves.  It
is not governments place to be acting as an insurance business: this is
forcing those of us who do not believe the assumption of the insurance
risk is a wise move to participate in it anyway, usually to the detriment
of those who [as business persons as well as individuals] would NEVER
consider underwriting these risks.  This is theft, pure and simple.

Yeah, right: look at what "no fault insurance" did to places like New
York...

Huh?  Oh yeah, I get it.  If the USG "covers" war losses, there will
likely be less concern and flack from Joe Six.

By whom?

Theft under threat of violence is hardly an "innovative solution".

Agreed.  When governments stop practicing terrorism, it will no longer be
a problem which can claim a moral high ground, and the incidenc will
likely decline.  Until then, if the insurance industry wishes the public
to underwrite their losses, then they had better be prepared to also hand
over any profits.

Actuaries.  Cost == risk.

Bullshit.  This was written for the insurance industry.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
