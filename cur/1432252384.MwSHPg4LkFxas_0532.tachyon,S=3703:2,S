100 million or more persons have died in the last 100 years through the 
actions of statists like Mao, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hitler, Pol Pot, Amin, 
and a dozen others like them.

If D.C is someday incinerated in an act of thermonuclear purification, I 
will cheer.

In a free country, I am entitled to cheer.

However, Amerika is not a free country. Several Arabs were arrested a 
few days ago in New Jersey for cheering the  WTC action. Others are 
being detained nationwide. And the U.S.G. is calling on other countries 
to "stop" (suppress) any show of joy over the events. So much for free 
expression.

Amerika is not a free country. Hasn't been since Lincoln.
