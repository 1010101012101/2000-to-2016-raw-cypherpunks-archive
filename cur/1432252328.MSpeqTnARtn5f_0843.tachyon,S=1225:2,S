Reverse Mortgage is a loan against your home that you do not have to 
pay back for as long as you live there. With a reverse mortgage, you 
can turn the value of your home into cash without having to move or to 
repay the loan each month.

To be eligible for reverse mortgage, you must own your home and be 
62 years of age or older.
