re: bitmail, goldbug, etc.

With all due respect, I doubt few here have or will anytime soon.
You spam out links to binaries no one's heard of, your source probably
isn't deterministic to your binaries, bsd/linux support?, your development
model doesn't appear open, code is hosted on a site few care about anymore,
you've no papers, presentations, mailing list or community involvement,
you've advertised the good name of other projects as being affiliated with
your work without their permission. And you've failed to address any of
this publicly despite people kindly prompting you to do so. In these
communities, that's a big red flag.
As always, full benefit of the doubt is given. If you need hosting for code,
lists, website... some code review, testing, etc... just ask an appropriate
list. We need more cool ideas and software... but you really need to step
up to the plate in these areas if you want people to take you seriously.
