Politicians getting RFIDs.

Will it spur a new generation of smart roadside bombs, landmines, and 
perhaps homing missiles?

1. Get the politico's ID.
2. Release a tiny unmanned drone with a small shaped charge.
3. Let it fly over the city or a highway, patroling patiently, drinking 
   the nectar of the sunshine with the panels of its wings, occassionally 
   pinging the ground below.
4. Wait until it hears the target response, then aims to the target using 
   the RFID's response signal the way tracking radars do, falling down for
   a suicide kill, not dissimilar to a beast of prey.

....then a counter-technology appears and the cycle will repeat again.
