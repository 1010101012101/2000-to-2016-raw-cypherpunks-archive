Yer funny, buying high priced tulips during the mania.

If you bought a farm in 1910 for $45 an acre it'd have
been $10,000 a couple of years ago.

The petrodollar has come, and the petrodollar will go,
and y'all are going to eventually want to eat. If we're
lucky food can be bought with crypto. If not I suppose
we better all learn chinese.
