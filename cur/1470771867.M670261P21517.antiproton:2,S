Besides all the stuff already mentioned, some decent "anarchy
fiction" would be the Culture books by Ian Banks..  set in a distant
post-scarcity future, the "Culture" in question is definitely an
interesting take on anarchy. Large swaths of humanity populate the
galaxy, mostly living in enormous space stations (huge rotating
stanford torus-style rings). Benevolent AIs "watch over" humanity,
but anyone can choose to opt out and no one has to obey, although
obviously cooperation helps..  the books are great.

If you dig punk/hardcore, the band Propagandhi makes some great
shit. Their lyrics are all about freedom and the crimes of our
oppressors, and the lyrics are smart, the music is fucking great.
Less Talk, More Rock and Todays Empires, Tomorrows Ashes are both
fantastic. Although, they do get a little too precious about veganism
for my, err, tastes... ;)

I haven't read Bakunin or any of the 'real' stuff since high school
or early college.. Reading about the russian revolution recently
was very depressing. Personally I don't hold much hope for humanity..I
figure the solution to Fermis paradox is self-evident. We are going
to fucking destroy ourselves. Live it up while you can ;)
