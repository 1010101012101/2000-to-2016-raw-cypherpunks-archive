No, active devices should be able to image down to mm and better (T-ray).
Ultrawideband is good for a portable radar to penetrate wood/plaster (maybe
even brick and concrete, if not too thick), and pick up breathing and
heartbeat signatures, as it can resolve time domain very well.

Penetration depth depends on the wavelength: red penetrates deeper than blue,
NIR even deeper (it's being used to diagnose early stages of skin melanoma,
you look really mottled in NIR, try it; apparently it's being used for
transcranial infrared oxytometry and even stimulation), microwaves and T-ray
are cm to dm.
T-ray could augment x-Ray, since capable of instant portable imaging without
requiring ionizing radiation.

If it's a wooden door I don't see why you can't resolve limbs and even
individual digits with active imaging.

This is very likely.
