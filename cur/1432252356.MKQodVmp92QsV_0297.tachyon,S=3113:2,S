The privacy, coercion, intimidation, vote selling and election integrity
problems begin with giving away a receipt that is linkable to a ballot. 

It is not relevant to the security problem whether a voter may destroy 
his receipt, so that some receipts may disappear. What is relevant is 
that voters may HAVE to keep their receipt or... suffer retaliation...
not get paid... lose their jobs... not get a promotion... etc. Also
relevant is that voters may WANT to keep their receipts, for the same
reasons.

As long as this does not go against the 'first law' for public voting 
systems: voters must not be linkable to ballots.

The 'second law' also takes precedence: ballots are always secret, only
vote totals are known and are known only after the election ends.

There is no tradeoff prossible for voter privacy and ballot secrecy.
Take away one of them and the voting process is no longer a valid
measure. Serious voting system research efforts do not begin by
denying the requirements.

There is no such principle.

You don't have this option when the public at large is considered, for
a public election. You can do it in a private election for a club,
for example, but even then only if the bylaws allow it.
