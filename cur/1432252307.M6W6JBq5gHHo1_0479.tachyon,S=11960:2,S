"it" being "opposite sides of the same coin".

Sure, but for me both are almost entirely separable from my personal 
evaluation of someone's scholarship and competence.

Okay, I'll apply this to my example of dear old Doctor X, a man I 
simultaneously respect and can't stand. 

You can infer certain aspects of his attitude towards his colleagues from 
the mocking and contemptuous way he addresses them in meetings--which he 
never fails to hijack with an endless barrage of commentary, transforming 
any occasion into a platform for self-aggrandizement. If you've ever seen a 
nature special and observed the alpha chimp's posturing before the younger 
males who inadvertently pose a challenge by attracting the attention of one 
of the females, you'll understand this dynamic quite well. The unwritten 
rule is that no one is "allowed" express a theory before the group without 
getting it ripped apart by Dr. Alphachimp, he just can't seem to stand it.  
His demeanor--presentation to others--alternates between what can best be 
described as "genteel patronizing condescension" and "being a full-bore 
asshole". 

None of this has the slightest bearing on the fact that he's one of the 
most brilliant, knowledgeable and incisive people I've ever met: his social 
skills deficit is just an unfortunate by-product. Is he a "nice person"? 
No. Would I ever want to spend time with him in a social setting? Hell no. 
Do I enjoy arguing with him? Definitely. Would I want him to review my 
research before I published it? You bet your life I would!

Why do you think concepts need to be orthagonal to be useful?

No, I realize that I'm probably a little more sensitized to (and upset by) 
the way Dr. Alphachimp treats the people around him because I have a 
tendency to the same sort of failings myself. If I had an easygoing sort of 
temper, the things that irk me most about him would probably sail over my 
head unnoticed. You sure can learn a lot about yourself by stepping back 
and noticing how you react when interacting with other people...

It's important not to shut yourself off from new ideas, but you have to 
have a way to decide at what point you're wasting your effort.

No quarrel here.

Oh not really, it's fine as long as at least one person is able to maintain 
the veneer of civility. As long as Dr. Alphachimp never figures out what I 
really think of him, it'll be an awesome opportunity to keep learning from 
him. I see more of the "genteel patronizing condescension" side anyway, 
which helps a lot. Or at least that's the way it feels, ha.

Not orthagonal enough..?

I can't say I agree with anyone in sum either; it's what you can take away 
from it with you that counts.

Oh yeah? Schopenhauer is about as honest and real as they come.

But that's part of what makes him so interesting! :)

That's a pretty heavy dose of Platonism, no?

Well it's certainly worth keeping in mind.

Just because an event is nonlinear and non-determined doesn't mean it  
negated the laws of causality. The building blocks are much smaller and 
less obvious, but they're still present in some form, even when they're not 
readily ascertainable. No one ever invented anything unless the conditions 
preceeding it were in place. Is there a great degree of freedom in 
discovery? Of course, but you have to have some mental dice to throw before 
you can throw them!

That issue is fairly clear-cut for me. But if you were to ask me about 
something I'm more ambivalent about--say, "globalization"--it's easy to 
imagine having simultaneous viewpoints that are seemingly contradictory on 
a superficial level.

Maybe some people are just wired or socially conditioned to relate to more 
viewpoints. "Do I contradict myself? Very well then...I contradict myself."

>noggin around?

No, but then there's the issue of whether you really can, or just think you 
can. If you're sensitive enough to be able to pick up on how and why 
someone formed a certain view, it helps. Great page on empathy, analogy and 
cognitive processes:
