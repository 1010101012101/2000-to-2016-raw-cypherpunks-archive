So von Neumann, Kahn, Schelling and Nash are boring, huh.
I'd rather follow their examples than spend year after year chitchatting
on Usenet. Such an intelligent and creative man, what a waste.

Good point, but where did you ever hear me say analysis was enough?

For someone who claims not to know whether I'm a woman or not, your
overactive imagination certainly got busy on the details. Unlike you, 
I'm not so easily trolled into showing my hand. So if whipping up some dreary
banalities for me makes you feel better, go right ahead. Though you're
so far off, it really is amusing.

Speaking of straw men and your overactive imagination, did you ever find 
anything in the archives to support your rant about my interpretation of the
first and second amendments? Just wondering.



~Faustine.
