Amen.

Incidentally I was put under a lot of pressure when releasing the 
OpenSSL advisory a few weeks ago to allow CERT to notify "vendors" 
before going on general release. I have a big problem with this - who 
decides who are "vendors", and how? And why should I abide by their 
decision? Why should I pick CERT and not some other route to release the 
information?

Also, if the "vendors" were playing the free software game properly, 
they wouldn't _need_ advance notification - their customers would have 
source, and could apply the patches, just like real humans.

Cheers,

Ben.
