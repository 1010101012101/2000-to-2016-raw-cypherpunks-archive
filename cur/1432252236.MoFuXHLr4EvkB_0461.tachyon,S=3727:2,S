Yes. Of course. And, if you actually read it, or even just thought
about it instead of spewing oppositional bullshit to everything you
disagree with politically, :-), you'd soon realize that you can't
actually control an truly anonymous voting scheme any more than you
can control a truly anonymous bearer asset. Like equity, an anonymous
vote is completely salable.

In short, sir, please to fuck off, until you actually know what
you're talking about.

Cheers,
RAH
