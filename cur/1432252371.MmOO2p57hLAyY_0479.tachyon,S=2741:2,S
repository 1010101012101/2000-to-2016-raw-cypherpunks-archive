Well, it's probably safer to publish the hack anonymously
and see if it withstands counter-hacking. Could be Microsoft
is baiting and waiting for just such attacks. The giant might
even leak and spread a few itself in order to shoot them down, 
to boost its eye-mote credibility.

Send the hack to Cryptome anonymously if there's no better 
way to test its effectiveness. Keeping snakeoil secret is a sure
way to uncontested success, aka the way of Redmond.
