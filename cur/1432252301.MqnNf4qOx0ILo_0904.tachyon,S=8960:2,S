Are there deadman-type services yet behind the TOR cloud which would allow for
automatic release of data if someone doesn't check in on a regular basis (or
checks in with the "wrong" credentials?).

Am I wrong or has Wikileaks more or less already won?

Tim May is cackling in his grave (I hear he's set up a lounge chair in it).
