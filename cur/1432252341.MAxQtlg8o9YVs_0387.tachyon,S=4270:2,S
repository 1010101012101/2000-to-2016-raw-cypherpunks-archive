>whaling fleet in Reykjavik harbor and destroy their whale processing station.

>1988 March: A Sea Shepherd agent documents the killing of dolphins by a 
>U.S. tuna seiner. The footage scandalizes the nation, embarrasses the tuna 
>industry, and leads to the creation of the "dolphin-safe" tuna label law.

>1989 June: The Sea Shepherd II intercepts two Venezuelan tuna seiners off 
>the coast of Costa Rica, documents evidence of kills exceeding a thousand 
>dolphins, disrupts Mexican tuna seiner operations in the Eastern Pacific.
>
>1990 August: The Sea Shepherd II encounters two Japanese drift net vessels 
>in the eastern Pacific, cuts and confiscates thirty miles of drift net.
>
>1991 July: Sea Shepherd goes to Trinidad to protest Caribbean driftnetting 
>by the Taiwanese. Sea Shepherd is made an official auxiliary to the 
>Trinidad & Tobago Coast Guard.

>Cocos Island Emergency
>A report from Nicola Ghersinich and Mario Arroyo
>
>Every year, 1,250 visitors come to scuba dive Cocos Island, off Costa 
>Rica, attracted by its extraordinary biodiversity of this World Heritage Site.
>
>Today, Cocos Island can no longer be considered a marine reserve. It is 
>now a fishing base. What had been considered a sanctuary for threatened 
>marine species is now just an extended community for fishermen to exploit.
>
>We are confronting a crisis.
