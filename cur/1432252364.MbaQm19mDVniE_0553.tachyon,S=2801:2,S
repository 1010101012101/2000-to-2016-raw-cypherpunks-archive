Sure.  Its not censorship (yet).

But what kind of environment suffers a publisher who won't publish? 

Information is leaked, at some risk, so that it can be broadcast.
Sure, this is a private action, but when someone gives you a treasure
you don't hide from it.  You don't ask the queen how far to bend over.

Maybe I'm spoiled on cryptome.  Maybe I'm a boorish 'Merikan
Bill-of-Rights-fetishist who doesn't sympathize with Germans burning CDs,
France threatening Yahoo, the UK rubber hosing passwords.   Who finds the
SUN's begging for a leash abhorrent.  So sue me.
