Jim, quit being an ass.  Just because there is a limit doesn't mean you should strive to reach it.

No, it's called fair use.  And no, you don't EDIT it, you quote one paragraph or two out of the entire story, and you post the url
so those who are interested can go off and read it.

Sending the whole entire thing isn't fair use.

Poor excuse.  You aren't at the mercy of your software.  Learn to use your mouse.  Learn to use the edit menu.  Drag your mouse over
the first paragraph, right click, select copy.

Hit Control-M in Netscape since that's what you're claiming to be using, click in the body, right click, select paste. 
Congratulations you've just quoted a paragraph.

Now, hit Alt-Tab to go back to the browser window, click on the url and highlight it by dragging or double clicking it.  Right
click, select copy, or hit Control-C.  

Now Alt-Tab back to your message, click somewhere where you want to paste the url, right click and select paste.

Why is that so hard?

See above.  Consider yourself empowered.

Cypherpunks is a mailing list composed of servers and users.  Just as it would be off topic to talk about carpet cleaning solutions
or your favorite brand of toilet paper because you'd piss off those with whom you wish to share, it's not useful to most of us for
you to post big huge chunks of HTML blobs and force us to drag cookies and images in from the web site they came in from.

The reason I even bother to tell you this is because I usually find the articles you post intesteresting, but it would be more
useful if they weren't such huge hogs.

But hey, at some point, you weigh the benefit versus the trouble of dealing with huge messages and the balance tips over.  At that
point, you go into the killfile.  Nothing personal, but if you waste my time and bandwidth for something marginally interesting,
I'll decide to not waste my time any longer.

That others agree or not is up to them.

It's not a demand.  It's not a mandate.  It's a request.

Analogy: Say were in a hunting club that decides to share the bounty: 

Say, I go off and shoot wild boars, and leave you a leg once in a while, some ribs to someone else, a leg to another, etc.

On the other hand, you went out in the woods and shot some deer and dropped several carcases, bleeding and still not gutted, some
still alive and pain, off on my doorstep, I might be quite happy to enjoy some vennison.  

But if you did it every day, I'd find too much vennison a pest rather than a boon.  Now, I go and ask you, "Thanks much for the
favor, I appreciate it, but it's too much, could you just leave me no more than a leg once a month?"

[Or an even better analogy, rather than bringing me carcases, tell me where you've picked them off, so if I need more meat or
trophies, I can hunt them down myself.]

If you go off spewing about dictatorships and holier than thou, I have no choice but to think that you're a loon and ask you to no
longer bring me any vennison and I no longer provide you with bacon.  If it still shows up on my property bleeding and messy and
more than I need, then I lock my gate to you.


In a free society you're free to do whatever you like.  That includes pissing people off for sure.  But that includes the ability to
complain to others whose behaviour is somewhat beneficial, but in being excessive becomes detrimental.  It includes the ability to
ask those who piss you off to cease doing so.  Sure, it's up to them to do so or not.  But in free society, no one should be forced
to live with abusive behaviors from others either.

[Hint: the difference between this and socialism is that in socialism, you're not only forced to live with the bores, but you're
forced to buy them a free drink, meal and housing every so often.]

You should be free to ask others who share a resource to do so in a way that makes the majority of its members happy.  No, this
isn't about democracy, it's about common courtesy.  

And when they say, "I don't know how to do that" you can of course show them how, but what would YOU do when they refuse and insist
on continuing?
