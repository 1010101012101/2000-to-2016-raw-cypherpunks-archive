As hysteria over imagined sexual predation and the criminalization of even
thoughts and written words make headlines in the news, there's one
individual who's reaping a bountiful harvest from the dancing Sheeple.

He is, of course, everyones favorite Network Vigilante, convicted criminal
and religious nut Walter Harlan "Mike" Echols, who runs BAM, the largest
and most successful child advocacy scam on the Internet.

Echols' latest wet dream is a plan to harrass tier one backbone providers
into not carrying content he deems objectionable, and the rotund one, who
is fond of labeling his dissenters as "Internet Child Sex Predators and
Child Pronographers," has set his sights on MCI/Worldcom/uunet as his
latest target.

It will be interesting to see whether the resulting "Boycott and Hound"
campaign will bear fruit, and whether a multinational corporation is as
vulnerable to the same threats and harrassment tactics that have worked so
well with smaller providers over the years, and have resulted in Echols
presently being on probation for terrorism.

According to Echols, ...

<<M.C.I./WorldCom Canada shows a total lack corporate morality and
  disregard for the safety of children by knowingly providing Tier 1
  Internet access to the IP hosting the child sex predator web domains
  freespirits.org, boylinks.net, boychat.org, & legarcon.net which are web
  chat boards used by child sex predators (many of whom have been
  convicted of felony sexual assaults on children) to discuss their past
  crimes, lusts, and plans for future sexual assaults of children which
  provides support and vallidation for child sex predators and on 
  boylinks.net click on links to child-related web domains including some
  containing child pornography.>>

BoyChat is one of the most heavily moderated and G-Rated forums of its
type on the Internet, and also one of the most widely read.  It is absurd
to suggest that all its viewers are pedophiles, or even more silly,
convicted child sex predators publicly plotting and scheming to commit
shocking new crimes.

Still, Echols' organization continues to grow, raking in sponsorship from
companies like Gateway, MP3.com, and Kinkos.  Self-declared child-advocacy
seems to have a baptismal effect these days.  Lengthy criminal records are
instantly washed away with a simple declaration that one is devoting ones
life to hate speech directed at "pervs."

Some links, if anyone cares:
