	No, that's not what the 'blank slate' metaphor is
	about. 

	'blank slate' is a name for the view or doctrine that the 'mind'
	doesn't have any kind of innate knowledge and that everything
	comes from experience.

	In the moral realm it would mean that people don't have INBORN 
	ideas of good and evil BUT that doesn't mean that the concepts
	are meaningless. Only that they are acquired later in life as
	the mind develops. 

	On the other hand, the people who don't regard actions as good
	or evil are amoralist psychos. Nothing to do with anarchism.

	Sure. 'anarchism' is amoralism. Slavery? Just a historical
	custom. War? An innocent mistake. Well not a mistake
	since truth and error are also 'social constructs' - or
	something like that.

	1) that is false. While a 'majority' of your beloved psychos
	may say that, not necessarily all do. Actually I wouldn't be
	surprised if the majority admitted **off the record** that they
	are scumbags who love to boss people around and even get
	paid for it.


	2) even if the majority of cops *said* that they regard
	themselves as the good guys, so fucking what.

	Hey. Now I'm a pink elephant. Because I say I'm a pink
	elephant.
