Crazy idea.

Put the server into the hands of a third party outside of the US. Have
that 3rd party have total and absolute rights to the SSL root
certificate and your party to not have any capacity to force said party
to hand over the certificate. You use it, but you don't have any ability
to actually get access to it directly.

Crazy idea, but I wonder if there would be some way to make this work
where even if they tried to force you, you couldn't hand it over.
