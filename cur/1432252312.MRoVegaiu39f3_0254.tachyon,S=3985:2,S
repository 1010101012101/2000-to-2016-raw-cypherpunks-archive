NixOS distro[1] takes build reproducibility seriously and build determinism is 
being worked on.

I have patched the most important toolchains to not systematically introduce 
non-determinism[2]. Some of the patches are in the master branch already, some 
are in the staging branch and will be merged in a month or two. These patches 
are sufficient to make a large subset of package builds deterministic.

After the merge, I'll do another round this time fixing non-determinism due to 
quirks of build systems of specific packages. Luckily, there aren't that many 
packages like Firefox and luckily Firefox has been already tackled by someone 
else :)

I'm committed to making at least installation media, typical desktop and 
server installs fully deterministic.
