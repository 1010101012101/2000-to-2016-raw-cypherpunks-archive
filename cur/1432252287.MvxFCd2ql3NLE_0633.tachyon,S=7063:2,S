Dear "Joe":


So, you really DO want to become a member of Better A Millstone!

Well, on behalf of children everywhere, congratulations and thanks!

Please understand that to become a member of BAM a number of intrusive 
questions need to be asked because BAM must be in a position to vouch to law 
enforcement agencies to whom it provides intelligence and information that 
you have been checked out and that they can trust the information that you 
provide as valid and that you are of good character.

And after receiving and reviewing your application, to become a member of 
Better A Millstone, you will be required to go to your local law enforcement 
agency to be properly identified and to have them do a criminal history 
background check on you for forwarding to Better A Millstone.

And please know that we will only confirm your actual identity and location 
to law enforcement on an individual "need to know" basis for those cases 
that you are involved in helping them to solve.  And after receiving and 
reviewing your application, and becoming a member of Better A Millstone, we 
will only confirm your actual identity and location to law enforcement on an 
individual "need to know" basis for those cases that you are involved in 
helping them to solve or to another member of BAM with whom you are working.

Please answer the following questions accurately by typing in the requested 
information or responses and--when completed--simply return this e-mail in 
its entirety to <applyforbam@hotmail.com> so that I and/or members of the 
Board of Directors of Better A Millstone may check out the information which 
you provide.

After reviewing your application--and within ten days or so--you will 
receive a phone call from me or one of the members of the Board of Directors 
to chat with you and get to know you.  And soon thereafter you will be 
notified as to your acceptance as a member of BAM.
