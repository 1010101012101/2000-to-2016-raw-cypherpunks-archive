While these online polls are rarely terribly meaningful,
I will note that CNN has one going now, at
http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/19/gen.america.under.attack/

It asks 'Would you accept more government involvement in your
life if it meant more security against terrorism?"

So far:

Yes: 70% 118946 votes
No:  30% 49938 votes
