Brunner seconded, and a bid for Ken MacLeod. "Stone Canal" is probably
the one most cypherpunks would like the most - set in a well-described
crypto-anarchic polity where "information wants to be free" and is
willing to fight for it.  CPs ought to love the trial scene.  In an
anarchy you start by agreeing on what law you will be judged by and who
is to be the judge.

Reading them in order is best - "Star Fraction" is basically
old-fashioned 1980s-style cyberpunk (but he knows his stuff & is serious
about AI & cryptography, then "Stone Canal", "The Cassini Division" (my
favourite), then "Sky Road".

Some of the best sf of the last 5 years.

Ken (not him - the other one)
