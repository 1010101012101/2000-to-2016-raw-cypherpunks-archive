Subject: [liberationtech] Google Bows Down To Chinese Government On
	Censorship
Reply-To: liberationtech <liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu>

Sometime between December 5 and December 8 last year, Google made a
surprising decision that hasnbt yet been reported. They decided to remove a
feature which had previously informed users from China of censored
keywords. At the same time, they deleted the help article which explained
how to use the feature. This indicates a new development in the
relationship between the Chinese government and Google. Since Google moved
its search engine to Hong Kong in 2010, censorship of its services such as
YouTube, Google Plus and thousands of keywords on Google Search has been
done by the Great Firewall, out of control of Google. This latest move was
fully controlled by Google and can as such only be described as
self-censorship.
