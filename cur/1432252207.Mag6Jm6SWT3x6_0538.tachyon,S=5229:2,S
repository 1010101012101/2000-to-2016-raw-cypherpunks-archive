Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of. I've had a look around, and can't 
actually find many other similar groups. Mind you, most of the lawyers I've 
spoken to seem feel that the Internet is nothing new, legally. This leads 
me to think that lawyers on the whole, are not particularly imaginative or 
attentive people.

Oh hurrah. A bargain.
