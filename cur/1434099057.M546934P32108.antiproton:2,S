Harden and trim something like Tails. Run the better minimum.

Don't do F2F at the lowest network layer. Don't give away sociograms, don't
allow timing attacks, and avoid the whole NAT issue.

Just stick with I2P or similar traffic anonymization networks and run your
traffic on top of that. Oneswarm (now abandoned, IIRC), RetroShare, or
whatever else, run that over the anonymizing networks. Inviting somebody
would be a matter of sharing the public key based address to the public
services and noting his public key so you can accept an invite request, or
directly send an invite to private mail of his like Bote mail or Pond.

I've done a lot of thinking on P2P social networks, I'll share later,
haven't written it all down yet. You can find a bunch of my thoughts on
these matters in my blog, https://roamingaroundatrandom.wordpress.com,
there's multiple relevant posts there. I know approximately what I want and
how to make it easy to secure. One crucial part is key management where I
believe hardware tokens is the best solution, including for in-person key
exchange (see the developments for Bitcoin hardware wallets).
