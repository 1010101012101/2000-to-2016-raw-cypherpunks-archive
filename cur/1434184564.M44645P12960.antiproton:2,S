Steve, thank you very much for your broad answer. Interesting and valuable
points...
I just wanted to answer your (rhetorical?) question

In my opinion, its from the top. They just DONT CARE. They are so self
confident in their superiority over us (in money & technologies), that they
deliberately act so bold and open.
It's like "and what are you gonna do/what can you do, when you knowwww all
this?"

IMHO, they even get some kind of sadistic pleasure seeing and reading our
relatively powerless reactions.

Alexander
