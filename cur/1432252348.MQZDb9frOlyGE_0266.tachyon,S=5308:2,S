The lemon dilemma
Oct 11th 2001
 From The Economist print edition

This year's Nobel prize for economics honours work inspired by a simple 
observation about used cars

...

This year's other two laureates, Michael Spence of Stanford University and 
Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia, won their prize for analysing how firms and 
consumers separate the gems from the lemons in a variety of industries.

Mr Spence's early work focused on how individuals use signalling to 
communicate their abilities in the labour market. Job applicants, for 
example, want to distinguish themselves from the mass of other hopefuls. 
They may try to do this in a number of ways, from a fancy suit to a fancy 
education. But for signals to be believable, Mr Spence observed, they need 
to differ substantially in their cost of acquisition. For example, for 
education to work as a credible signal, it must be harder for less able 
employees to get. Indeed, even if such an education gives a student no 
tangible skillsreading classics at Oxford, sayit can still be a useful 
signal of relative quality to employers.

Signalling is used in many markets, wherever a person, company or 
government wants to provide information about its intentions or strengths 
indirectly. Taking on debt might signal that a company is confident about 
future profits. Brands send valuable signals to consumers precisely because 
they are costly to create, and thus will not be lightly abused by their 
creators. Advertising may convey no information other than that the firm 
can afford to advertise, but that may be all a consumer needs to know to 
have confidence in it. Perhaps advertising, as a signal, is not money 
entirely wasted, as some economists argue.

...

It's all about signaling.
