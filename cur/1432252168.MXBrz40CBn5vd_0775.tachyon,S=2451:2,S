The Feindgold amendment to S1510 (The Senate Anti-Terrorism Bill), which 
would have subjected LE requests for personal (medical, educational and 
library) and business records to a higher level of judicial scrutiny and 
stricter state provisions, was just tabled (defeated) by a vote of 89 to 
8.  Our only hope is in the House-Senate committee charged with working out 
differences between the two bills.
