Multimap has that for the UK.  From planes I'm pretty sure.

http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=europe&scale=1000&X=529700&Y=182000&width=700&height=410&gride=0&gridn=0
has the building I work in.  Windows on upper stories clearly visible.
As are cars and vans in the street  - of course they are where they
where when the picture was taken, which was sometime before summer 2000
going by the building works in the British Museum at the bottom of the
street.

Also proper maps, with contours and buildings and field boundaries and
so on.  

It makes you wonder why anyone made a fuss about Arab-looking folk
taking photos of airfields and dams.
