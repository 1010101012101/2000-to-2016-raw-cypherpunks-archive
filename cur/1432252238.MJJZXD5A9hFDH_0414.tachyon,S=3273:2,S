Subject: Pentagon Targets Blogs

In what may be the understatement of the year, the Pentagon includes
the warning that their actions may "sound ominous."  Not only are we
paying to have favorable stories planted in foreign newspapers, but
now we're employing professionals to post information to blogs.
Question: Do you suppose when they blog they identify themselves as
paid Pentagon informants?

"Pentagon Targets Blogs

"A new U.S. Central Command team, according to a news release,
"contacts bloggers to inform the writers about any given topic that
may have been posted on their site. . . . The team engages bloggers
who are posting inaccurate or untrue information, as well as bloggers
who are posting incomplete information."

"While that may sound ominous, the release says the unit works with
more than 250 bloggers "to try to disseminate news about the good
work being done by U.S. forces in the global war on terror." This,
says Army Reserve Maj. Richard Norton, has a "viral effect" that
drives Web users to CentCom's Web site. The team's motto: "Engage."
