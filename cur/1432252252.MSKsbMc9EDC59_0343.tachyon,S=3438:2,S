Cryptography is a moderated list that is fairly tightly focused
on cryptography.  It's a good list.

However if you are interested in the political and soceital
implications of cryptography (also traditional cypherpunks topics)
then cryptography is not the right list.

The cypherpunks list has moved to a distributed list run from
a number of sites.  Each site has a different policy-- some
are wide open like cypherpunks-unedited@toad, some moderated, and
some are unmoderated but filter out spam.

The web page http://www.lne.com/cpunk/ explains the Cypherpunks
distributed mailing list in more detail and lists each node
their policies and subscription info.
