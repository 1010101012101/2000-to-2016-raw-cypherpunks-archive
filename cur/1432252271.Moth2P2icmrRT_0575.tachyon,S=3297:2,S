What would be an example of a privilege that you fear would be taken
away from you with TCPA?  It will boot any software that you want, and
can provide a signed attestation of a hash of what you booted.  Are you
upset because you can't force the chip to lie about what you booted?
Of course they could have designed the chip to allow you to do that, but
then the functionality would be useless to everyone; a chip which could
be made to lie about its measurements might as well not exist, right?
