Hey, I did not say it at all, hard headed Juan!  :P

But it is their list and their rules, being unjust or not.  If they want to
censor their list in a dishonest and stupid way, using bad excuses, they
will lose credibility, respect and collaborators.  Their problems, not mine.

If censorship is OK 'sometimes', then she can't complain about being
censored 'sometimes', like 'this' time.

Sorry, I wanted to read the list and don't care about following rules to do
it, if necessary.  Social rules, for example:  - In the Summer, I really
prefer to be nude all the time, but I use clothes or I will be arrested.
:-/

Reading the tor-talk list is not possible because my personal positions are
different?  Ok, what could I wait of a guy who can't simply admiss that was
stupid, limited and cruel for calling a raped woman, a "ludicrous rape
apologetics".

I know it is a terrible bad karma, but I would love to graffitti these
exact words in his house.  So Boyce would be able to understand how heavy
and offensive were his words.
