German Minister's Interview Rips 911 Case Open
Rumor Mill News Reading Room Forum

(DRAFT) [Source: Tagesspiegel, Jan. 13] PARTIAL TRANSLATION

The following interview with Von Buelow appeared in the German daily
'Tagesspiegel,' on Jan. 13.

Q: You seem so angry, really upset.

Von Buelow: I can explain what's bothering me: I see that after the
horrifying attacks of Sept. 11, all political public opinion is being
forced into a direction that I consider wrong.

Q: What do you mean by that?

Von Buelow: I wonder why many questions are not asked. Normally, with
such a terrible thing, various leads and tracks appear that are then
commented on, by the investigators, the media, the government: Is there
something here or not? Are the explanations plausible? This time, this
is not the case at all. It already began just hours after the attacks in
New York and Washington and--

Q: In those hours, there was horror, and grief.

Von Buelow: Right, but actually it was astounding: There are 26
intelligence services in the U.S.A. with a budget of $30 billion--

Q: More than the German defense budget.

Von Buelow: --which were not able to prevent the attacks. In fact, they
didn't even have an inkling they would happen. For 60 decisive minutes,
the military and intelligence agencies let the fighter planes stay on
the ground, 48 hours later, however, the FBI presented a list of suicide
attackers. Within ten days, it emerged that seven of them were still
alive.

Q: What, please?

Von Buelow: Yes, yes. And why did the FBI chief take no position
regarding contradictions? Where the list came from, why it was false? If
I were the chief investigator (state attorney) in such a case, I would
regularly go to the public, and give information on which leads are
valid and which not.

Q: The U.S. government talked about an emergency situation after the
attacks: They said they were in a war. Is it not understandable that one
does not tell the enemy everything one knows about him?

Von Buelow: Naturally. But a government which goes to war, must first
establish who the attacker, the enemy, is. It has a duty to provide
evidence. According to its own admission, it has not been able to
present any evidence that would hold up in court.

Q: Some information on the perpetrators has been proven with documents.
The suspected leader, Mohammad Atta, left Portland for Boston on the
morning of Sept. 11, in order to board the plane that later hit the
World Trade Center

Von Buelow: If this Atta was the decisive man in the operation, it's
really strange that he took such a risk of taking a plane that would
reach Boston such a short time before the connecting flight. Had his
flight been a few minutes late, he would not have been in the plane that
was hijacked. Why should a sophisticated terrorist do this? One can, by
the way, read on CNN (Internet) that none of these names were on the
official passenger lists. None of them had gone through the check-in
procedures. And why did none of the threatened pilots give the
agreed-upon code 7700 over the [Steuerknueppel: STEERING NOB?] to the
ground station? In addition: The black boxes which are fire and shock
proof, as well as the voice recordings, contain no valuable data--

Q: That sounds like--

Von Buelow: --like assailants who, in their preparations, leave tracks
behind them like a herd of stampeding elephants? They made payments with
credit cards with their own names; they reported to their flight
instructors with their own names. They left behind rented cars with
flight manuals in Arabic for jumbo jets. They took with them, on their
suicide trip, wills and farewell letters, which fall into the hands of
the FBI, because they were stored in the wrong place and wrongly
addressed. Clues were left like behind like in a child's game of
hide-and-seek, which were to be followed!

There is also the theory of one British flight engineer:

According to this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out of
the pilots' hands, from outside.

The Americans had developed a method in the 1970s, whereby they could
rescue hijacked planes by intervening into the computer piloting
[automatic pilot system]. This theory says, this technique was abused in
this case. That's a theory....

Q: Which sounds really adventurous, and was never considered.

Von Buelow: You see! I do not accept this theory, but I find it worth
considering. And what about the obscure stock transactions? In the week
prior to the attacks, the amount of transactions in stocks in American
Airlines, United Airlines, and insurance companies, increased 1,200%. It
was for a value of $15 billion. Some people must have known something.
Who?

Q: Why don't you speculate on who it might have been.

Von Buelow: With the help of the horrifying attacks, the Western mass
democracies were subjected to brainwashing. The enemy image of
anti-communism doesn't work any more; it is to be replaced by peoples of
Islamic belief. They are accused of having given birth to suicidal
terrorism.

Q: Brainwashing? That's a tough term.

Von Buelow: Yes? But the idea of the enemy image doesn't come from me.
It comes from Zbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Huntington, two
policy-makers of American intelligence and foreign policy. Already in
the middle of he 1990s, Huntingon believed, people in Europe and the
U.S. needed someone they could hate-- this would strengthen their
identification with their own society. And Brzezinski, the mad dog, as
adviser to President Jimmy Carter, campaigned for the exclusive right of
the U.S. to seize all the raw materials of the world, especially oil and
gas.

Q: You mean, the events of Sept. 11--

Von Buelow: --fit perfectly in the concept of the armaments industry,
the intelligence agencies, the whole military-industrial-academic
complex. This is in fact conspicuous. The huge raw materials reserves of
the former Soviet Union are now at their disposal, also the pipeline
routes and--

Q: Erich Follach described that at length in {Spiegel}: ``It's a matter
of military bases, drugs, oil and gas reserves.''

Von Buelow: I can state: the planning of the attacks was technically and
organizationally a master achievement. To hijack four huge airplanes
within a few minutes and within one hour, to drive them into their
targets, with complicated flight maneuvers! This is unthinkable, without
years-long support from secretapparatuses of the state and industry.

Q: You are a conspiracy theorist!

Von Buelow: Yeah, yeah. That's the ridicule heaped [on those raising
these questions] by those who would prefer to follow the official,
politically correct line. Even investigative journalists are fed
propaganda and disinformation. Anyone who doubts that, doesn't have all
his marbles! That is your accusation.

Q: Your career actually speaks against the idea that you are not in your
right mind. You were already in the 1970s, state secretary in the
Defense Ministry; in 1993 you were the SPD [Social Democratic Party]
speaker in the Schalk-Golodkowski investigation committee--

Von Buelow: And it all began there! Until that time, I did not have any
great knowledge of the work of intelligence agencies. And now we had to
take note of a great discrepancy: We shed light on the dealings of the
Stasi and other East bloc intelligence agencies in the field of economic
criminality, but as soon as we wanted to know something about the
activities of the BND [German intelligence] or the CIA, it was
mercilessly blocked. No information, no cooperation, nothing! That's
when I was first taken aback.

Q: Schalck-Golodkowski mediated, among other things, various business
deals abroad. When you looked at his case more closely--

Von Buelow: We found, for example, a clue in Rostock, where Schalck
organized his weapons depot. Well, then we happened upon an affiliation
of Schalck in Panama, and then we happened upon Manuel Noriega, who was
for many years President, drug dealer, and money launderer, all in one,
right? And this Noriega was also on the payroll of the CIA, for $200,000
a year. These were things that really made me curious.

Q: You wrote a book on the dealings of the CIA and Co. In the meantime,
you have become an expert regarding the strange things related to
intelligence services' work.

Von Buelow: ``Strange things'' is the wrong term. What has gone on, and
goes on, in the name of intelligence services, are true crimes.

Q: What would you say determines the work of intelligence services?

Von Buelow: So that we don't have any misunderstandings: I find that it
makes sense to have intelligence services....

Q: You don't think much of the earlier proposals by the Greens, who
wanted to dismantle these agencies?

Von Buelow: No. It is right to take a look behind the scenes. Getting
intelligence about the intentions of an enemy, makes sense. It is
important when one tries to put oneself into the mind of the enemy.
Whoever wants to understand the CIA's methods, has to deal with its main
tasks, {covert operations}: below the level of war, and outside
international law, foreign states are to be influenced, by organizing
insurrections, terrorist attacks, usually combined with drugs and
weapons trade, and money laundering. This is essentially very simple:
One arms violent people with weapons. Since, however, it must not under
any circumstances come out, that there is an intelligence agency behind
it, all traces are erased, with tremendous deployment of resources.

I have the impression that this kind of intelligence agency spends 90%
of its time this way: creating false leads. So that, if anyone suspects
the collaboration of the agencies, he is accused of the sickness of
conspiracy madness. The truth often comes out only years later. CIA
chief Allen Dulles once said: In case of doubt, I would even lie to the
Congress!

Q: The American journalist Seymour M. Hersh, wrote in the {New Yorker,}
that even some people in the CIA and government assumed, that certain
leads had been laid in order to confuse the investigators. Who, Herr von
Buelow, would have done this?

Von Buelow: I don't know that either. How should I? I simply use my
common sense, and-- See: The terrorists behaved in such a way to attract
attention. And as practicing Muslims, they were in a strip-tease bar,
and, drunken, stuck dollar bills into the panty of the dancer.

Q: Things like that also happen.

Von Buelow: It may be. As a lone fighter, I cannot prove anything,
that's beyond my capabilities. I have real difficulties, however, to
imagine that all this all sprung out ofthe mind of an evil man in his
cave.

Q: Mr. von Buelow, you yourself say that you are alone in your
criticism. Formerly, you were part of the political establishment, now
you are an outsider.

Von Buelow: That is a problem sometimes, but one gets used to it. By the
way, I know a lot of people, including very influential ones, who agree
with me, but only in whispers, never publicly.

Q: Do you still have contact with old SPD companions, such as Egon Bahr
and former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt?

Von Buelow: There are no close contacts any more. I wantedto go to the
last SPD party congress, but I was sick.

Q: Can it be, Mr. von Buelow, that you are a mouthpiece for typical
anti-Americanism?

Von Buelow: Nonsense, this has absolutely nothing to do with
anti-Americanism. I am a great admirer of this great, open, free
society, and always have been. I studied in the U.S.

Q: How did you get the idea that there could be a link between the
attacks and the American intelligence agencies?

Von Buelow: Do you remember the first attack on the WorldTrade Center in
1993?

Q: Six people were killed and over a thousand wounded, by a bomb
explosion.

Von Buelow: In the middle was the bombmaker, a former Egyptian officer.
He had pulled together some Muslims for the attack. They were snuck into
the country by the CIA, despite a State Department ban on their entry.
At the same time, the leader of the band was an FBI informant.

And he made a deal with the authorities: At the last minute, the
dangerous explosive material would be replaced by a harmless powder.

The FBI did not stick to the deal. The bomb exploded, so to speak, with
the knowledge of the FBI. The official story of the crime was quickly
found: The criminals were evil Muslims.

Q: At the time Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan, you were in the
cabinet of Helmut Schmidt. What was it like?

Von Buelow: The Americans pushed for trade sanctions, they demanded the
boycott of the Olympic games in Moscow....

Q.... which the German government followed...

Von Buelow: And today we know: It was the strategy of the American
security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to destabilize the Soviet Union
from neighboring Muslim countries They lured the Russians into
Afghanistan, and then prepared for them a hell on earth, their Vietnam.
With decisive support of the U.S. intelligence agencies, at least 30,000
Muslim fighters were trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a bunch of
good-for-nothings and fanatics who were, and still are today, ready for
anything.

And one of them is Osama bin Laden. I wrote years ago: ` `It was out of
this brood, that the Taliban grew up in Afghanistan, who had been
brought up in the Koran schools financed by American and Saudi funds,
the Taliban who are now terrorizing the country and destroying it

Q: Even though you say, for the U.S. it was a matter of raw materials in
the region, the starting point for the U.S. aggression, was the
terrorist attack which cost thousands of human lives.

Von Buelow: Completely true. One must always keep this gruesome act in
mind. Nonetheless, in the analysis of political processes, I am allowed
to look and see who has advantages and disadvantages, and what is
coincidental. When in doubt, it is always worthwhile to take a look at a
map, where are raw materials resources, and the routes to them? Then lay
a map of civil wars and conflicts on top of that --they coincide. The
same is the case with the third map: nodal points of the drug trade.

Where this all comes together, the American intelligence services are
not far away. By the way, the Bush family is linked to oil, gas, and
weapons trade, through the bin Laden family.

Q: What do you think of the Bin Laden films?

Von Buelow: When one is dealing with intelligence services, one can
imagine manipulations of the highest quality. Hollywood could provide
these techniques. I consider the videos inappropriate as evidence.

Q: You believe the CIA is capable of anything, [wouldn't stop at
anything].

Von Buelow: The CIA, in the state interests of the U.S., does not have
to abide by any law in interventions abroad, is not bound by
international law; only the President gives orders.

And when funds are cut, peace is on the horizon, then a bomb explodes
somewhere. Thus it is proven, that you can't do without the intelligence
services; and that the critics are {nuts,} as Father Bush called them,
Bush who was once CIA head and President.

You have to see that the U.S. spends $30 billion on intelligence
services, and $13 billion on anti-drug work. And what comes out of it?

The chief of a special unit of the strategic anti-drug work declared, in
despair, after 30 years of service, that in every big, important drug
case, the CIA came in and took it out of my hands. (Rosalinda: Michael
Levin)

Q: Do you criticize the German government for its reaction after Sept.
11?

Von Buelow: No. To assume that the government were independent in these
questions, would be naive.

Q: Herr von Buelow, what will you do now?

Von Buelow: Nothing. My task is concluded by saying, it could not have
been that way [according to the official story] Search for the truth!
