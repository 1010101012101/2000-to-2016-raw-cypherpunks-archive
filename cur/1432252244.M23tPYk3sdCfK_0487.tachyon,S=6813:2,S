7/10 State of the Net Forum : "Toward a Framework for Internet Accountability"

·       Date: Thu, 5 Jul 2001 14:28:14 -0400
·       To: update@cdt.org
·       Subject: 7/10 State of the Net Forum : "Toward a Framework for 
Internet Accountability"
·       From: ari@cdt.org


You are cordially invited to a luncheon discussion "Toward a Framework for
Internet Accountability", Tuesday, July 10 beginning at 12:00 noon. This
event, hosted by the Internet Education Foundation (IEF), will explore the
Markle Foundation's new study, "Toward a Framework for Internet
\Accountability." The study, to be released Tuesday morning, finds that at a
time of intense debate over key Internet policy Americans are enthusiastic
about the Internet, but that they are eager to have new forms of public,
private, and non-profit governance of the Internet in order to give them
more protection and control when they go online.

WHAT: "Toward a Framework for Internet Accountability",
IEF State of the Net Series

WHO: Zoe Baird, Markle Foundation
Stan Greenberg, Greenberg, Quinlan, and Rosner Research
with appearances by Leaders of the Internet Caucus

WHERE:  Reserve Officers Association
One Constitution Ave, NE, Across from Dirksen
Senate Office Building

WHEN:  Tuesday, July 10, from 12 NOON to 1:30 pm (Lunch
served)

RSVP:  If planning to attend RSVP@neted.org or via phone to
Danielle 202-638-4370.


About the State of the Net Series

"Toward a Framework for Internet Accountability" is the second in a series
of discussions on the "State of the Net" hosted by IEF. The "State of the
Net" project seeks to examine the policy and governance framework  needed to
assure that the Internet reaches its fullest commercial, communications and
democratic potential. IEF believes that an assessment of the "State of the
Net" is long overdue. The goal of the project is to take a "snapshot" of
where we are in the development of the Internet. This snapshot will serve as
a benchmark for measuring progress — or lack thereof - in Internet policy.
