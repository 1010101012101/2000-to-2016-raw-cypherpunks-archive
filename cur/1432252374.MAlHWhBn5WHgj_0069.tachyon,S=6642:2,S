Subject: [bitcoin-list] Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind version 0.5 released

Bitcoin version 0.5.0 is now available for download at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.5.0/
The major change for this release is a completely new
graphicalinterface that uses the Qt user interface toolkit.
This release include German, Spanish, Spanish-Castilian, Norwegianand
Dutch translations. More translations are welcome; join theproject at
Transifex if you can help:
https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/bitcoin/
Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues
If you cannot or do not want to run Bitcoin-Qt, a bug-fix-only
Bitcoin version 0.4.1 is also available at sourceforge.

MAJOR BUG FIX  (CVE-2011-4447)------------------------------
The wallet encryption feature introduced in Bitcoin version 0.4.0did
not sufficiently secure the private keys. An attacker whomanaged to
get a copy of your encrypted wallet.dat file might beable to recover
some or all of the unencrypted keys and steal theassociated coins.
If you have a previously encrypted wallet.dat, the first time yourun
bitcoin-qt or bitcoind the wallet will be rewritten, Bitcoin willshut
down, and you will be prompted to restart it to run with the
new,properly encrypted file.
If you had a previously encrypted wallet.dat that might have
beencopied or stolen (for example, you backed it up to a
publiclocation) you should send all of your bitcoins to yourselfusing
a new bitcoin address and stop using any previouslygenerated
addresses.
Wallets encrypted with this version of Bitcoin are written properly.
Technical note: the encrypted wallet's 'keypool' will be regenerated
thefirst time you request a new bitcoin address; to be certain that
thenew private keys are properly backed up you should:
1. Run Bitcoin and let it rewrite the wallet.dat file
2. Run it again, then ask it for a new bitcoin address. Bitcoin-Qt:
Address Book, then New Address... bitcoind: run the 'walletpassphrase'
RPC command to unlock the wallet,  then run the 'getnewaddress' RPC
command.
3. If your encrypted wallet.dat may have been copied or stolen, send
all of your bitcoins to the new bitcoin address.
4. Shut down Bitcoin, then backup the wallet.dat file. IMPORTANT: be
sure to request a new bitcoin address before backing up, so that the
'keypool' is regenerated and backed up.
"Security in depth" is always a good idea, so choosing a
securelocation for the backup and/or encrypting the backup
beforeuploading it is recommended. And as in previous releases, if
yourmachine is infected by malware there are several ways anattacker
might steal your bitcoins.
Thanks to Alan Reiner (aka etotheipi) for finding and reportingthis bug.
MAJOR GUI CHANGES-----------------
"Splash" graphics at startup that show address/wallet/blockchain
loadingprogress.
"Synchronizing with network" progress bar to show block-chain downloadprogress.
Icons at the bottom of the window that show how well connected you
areto the network, with tooltips to display details.
Drag and drop support for bitcoin: URIs on web pages.
Export transactions as a .csv file.
Many other GUI improvements, large and small.
RPC CHANGES-----------
getmemorypool : new RPC command, provides everything needed to
constructa block with a custom generation transaction and submit a
solution
listsinceblock : new RPC command, list transactions since given block
signmessage/verifymessage : new RPC commands to sign a message withone
of your private keys or verify that a message signed by the privatekey
associated with a bitcoin address.
GENERAL CHANGES---------------
Faster initial block download.
