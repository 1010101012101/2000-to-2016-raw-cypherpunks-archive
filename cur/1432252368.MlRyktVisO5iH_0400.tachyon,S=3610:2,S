  Uranium is not malleable in the same way either gold or silver are.

Nearly all metals are malleable to some extent (in that they don't 
shatter when subjected to shear forces), but I was responding to your 
"beat the metal in a stainless steel bowl" idea. Good luck on beat U 
this way!

A chart of the rigidity moduli for the elements gives a good idea of why 
U is not normally considered very malleable:

intensity/rigidity-modulus.html

Also, I don't get what you mean by saying it has a luster when polished. 
Yeah, all metals do..until they oxidize/tarnish/anodize.

The chunks of uranium I used to work with were pure metallic...and dark 
grey/black.
