How do you know?

A very good friend of mine once described what you call the "big
microphone" as the panopticon.  Clearly this is not a new idea, and
consequently we may assume that the TLAs are well in advance of whatever
is known about global surveillance by the general public.  Technical
sophisticates have, however, a distinct advantage here.  Furthermore, as I
have stated previously, the use of information gleaned from a surveillance
effort leaks 'bits' about the surveillance action itself -- this is a
mathematical certainty.

But, seeing as how the public is expected to live in a rather small
fantasy world of conceptual and information poverty, at least as such
relates to the activities of TLAs, we can assume that mathematical
realities will have zero correlation with politically motivated policies
in the public `sphere'.

It's likely that "he" is practising his stupidity in order to establish
the background of his mailing-list persona.  Perhaps his messages also
carry coded `freight' of some kind intended for a certain class of reader.
 If so, and if he uses perfect encryption for his coding scheme, we cannot
have any hope of decyphering what he is saying beyond the superficial
face-value of his text.

Don't forget about rubber-hose cryptanlysis.  Rumour has it that method is
preferred in many cases since it makes the code-breakers feel good by way
of testosterone release.
