If Sarath is, in fact, a student who will soon be looking for work, he
may do just fine. Getting a tech job has little to do with how much you
know or how well you can do the work. Most of getting a job, at least in
the US, has to do with putting together a resume that will get you a
call-back, and with impressing the HR guys during the first interview.
Neither of these need have any bearing on actual qualifications.

Once he has a job in the tech field, someone with people skills
sufficient to get others to do his work for him will get farther ahead
than the techie who actually does the work. Of course, it's easier for a
woman to pull this off in the typical tech-heavy company -- a woman just
has to chat with the guys, whereas a man will have to actively
brown-nose the bosses or ask favors of his co-workers.
