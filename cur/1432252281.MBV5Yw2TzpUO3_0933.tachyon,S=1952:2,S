James overlooks the agricultural virtue of cypherpunks death 
and rebirth for the natural cycle gets rid of old growth and allows 
for a new improved version. 

No doubt the old crop doesn't get much satisfaction being 
taken for manure, nor do the new sprouts see any reason to hail 
the shit doing what it's supposed to do.

Cypherpunks surely will not vaunt tradition when innovation
starts to peter out.

True, declaring the war is won and going over to war-storying is 
a grand tradition of bullshitting.
