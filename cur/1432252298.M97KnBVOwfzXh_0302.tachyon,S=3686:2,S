Clearly Condit was declaiming against his own demons when he
co-sponsored legislation calling for displaying the Ten Commandments in
public buildings. How easy it is to forget the admonishment against
adultery
when it is not prominently posted at every turn in the Capitol. 

The argument typically advanced in support of the government's dabbling
in
religion is that the constitutional mandate of a separation of church
and state
erodes the power of religious truths and leads inevitably to a liberal,
secular
and amoral society. 

How then is one to explain Condit, who has been an evangelical Christian
all
his life? There's nothing liberal or secular about him. He's a strong
pro-life,
family values, Bible-quoting son of a Baptist minister who is rated
highly by
the Christian Coalition and flunks out with the ACLU. 

...
No more pearly white smile for photogs but the power haircut will look
good when he
does the perp walk in orange.
