4.6 Military Training

Although sometimes it is difficult to obtain comprehensive military
training in one's home country, it is very easy to do
plenty of background reading using freely-available books and CDs,
before one actually goes abroad.

The US Army has produced a number of military field manuals on CD on all
topics from light weapons, tanks and
artillery to mines, military fieldcraft and combat medicine. The full
set is available on CD for less than US$100 and
many field manuals are also available on the Internet. One source of
availability is
http://www.sgtquartermaster.net/CDROM.html or by searching for the term
'US Military Field Manuals CD' or just 'US
Military Field Manuals Online'. Even though the US Army Field Manuals
contain information specific to US Weapons,
they still contain a large amount of useful information applicable in
all circumstances. It is useful to get a full set of CDs
for your mosque or Islamic society that everyone can use.


4.4 Firearms Training

Firearms training differs from country to country. In some countries,
possession of firearms by the public is illegal, in
other countries it is legal. In some countries of the World, especially
the USA, firearms training is available to the general
public. One should try to join a shooting club if possible and make
regular visits to the firing range. There are many
firearms courses available to the public in USA, ranging from one day to
two weeks or more. These courses are good
but expensive. Some of them are only meant for security personnel but
generally they will teach anyone. It is also better
to attend these courses in pairs or by yourself, no more. Do not make
public announcements when going on such a
course. Find one, book your place, go there, learn, come back home and
keep it yourself. Whilst on the course, keep
your opinions to yourself, do not argue or debate with anyone, do not
preach about Islam and make Salah in secret. You
are going there to train for Jihad, not call people to Islam.
