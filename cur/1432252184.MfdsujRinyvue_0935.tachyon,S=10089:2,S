For immediate release: September, 2001

* Libertarian Futurist Society announced Prometheus Award winners
   Sept. 2 at the Philadelphia Worldcon
* L. Neil Smith won Best Novel for "Forge of the Elders"

At its annual Worldcon award ceremony Sept. 2 in Philadelphia, the
Libertarian Futurist Society  presented its annual Prometheus Award
for Best Novel to L. Neil Smith's "Forge of the Elders" (Baen Books).

The Prometheus Awards ceremony preceded a panel discussion on "Beyond Ayn
Rand and Robert Heinlein: Libertarian SF." The panel was held from 4 to 5
p.m. Sunday Sept.  2 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and
Philadelphia Marriott in Philadelphia.

L. Neil Smith has won the Prometheus Award twice before: in 1984 for The
Probability Broach, and in 1994 for Pallas.

Forge of the Elders combines two previously published novels with the
story's finale, finally published a decade later.  The story concerns the
culture clash between the human members of an expedition to asteroid 5023
Eris, and the multitude of aliens they find when they arrive.  The twist
is that the aliens are anarchist individualists with a sophisticated
culture, while the humans were sent by a monolithic socialist/communist
world government.  The culture clash results in a few mysterious deaths,
and the investigation of the possible murders reveals much about the
motivations of the perpetrators and suspects.


The other finalists in the voting for the 2001 Prometheus Award were:

* Lodestar, by Michael Flynn  (TOR Books)
* The Sky Road, by Ken MacLeod  (TOR Books)
* The Truth, by Terry Pratchett  (HarperCollins)
* Eagle Against the Stars, by Steve White (Baen Books)

    Twelve novels were nominated by LFS members for this year's awards.
The other nominees were Candle, by John Barnes (TOR Books); The Legend
That Was Earth, by James Hogan (Baen Books); Outlaw School, by Rebecca
Ore (HarperCollins/EOS); Chimera, by Will Shetterly (TOR Books);
Vampire Nation, by Thomas Sipos (www.communistvampires.com);
Conspiracies, by F. Paul Wilson (Forge Books); and All the Rage, by
F. Paul Wilson (FORGE Books)


The 2001 winner of the Hall of Fame award for Best Classic Fiction was
"The Survival of Freedom", an sf anthology edited by Jerry Pournelle and
John Carr.  Pournelle shared the prometheus award in 1992 with Larry Niven
for Fallen Angels.  The LFS' first Special Prometheus Award for Lifetime
Achievement went to Poul Anderson.  Both of these awards were presented at
LFScon, the Libertarian Futurist Society's first national conference and
20th anniversary celebration, held May 25-27 in conjunction with Marcon 36
in Columbus, Ohio.  The audience of more than 1,000 people were treated to
the Awards ceremony as part of the Masquerade festivities.

Karen Anderson, Poul's wife and a guest of honor, accepted for Anderson,
whose illness had prevented him from attending LFScon as Marcon's Grand
Master guest of honor.  Anderson, widely respected as a Grand Master of
S.F., already had been recognized by the LFS three times over the past two
decades, having won the Prometheus Hall of Fame twice for "The Star Fox"
and "Trader to the Stars" and the Best Novel award for "The Stars Are Also
Fire" (1995).  Poul Anderson passed away July 31, 2001 at the age of 74.

    The Prometheus awards for Best Novel, Best Classic Fiction (Hall of
Fame) and (occasional) Special awards honor outstanding science
fiction/fantasy that explores the possibilities of a free future,
champions human rights (including personal and economic liberty),
dramatizes the perennial conflict between individuals and coercive
governments, or critiques the tragic consequences of abuse of power--
especially by the State.

The Prometheus Award, sponsored by the Libertarian Futurist Society (LFS),
was established in 1979, making it one of the most enduring awards after
the Nebula and Hugo awards, and one of the oldest fan-based awards
currently in sf.  Presented annually since 1982 at the World Science
Fiction Convention, the Prometheus Awards include a gold coin and plaque
for the winners.

The Hall of Fame, established in 1983, focuses on older classic fiction,
including novels, novellas, short stories, poems and plays.  Past Hall of
Fame award winners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn Rand to Ray Bradbury
and Ursula LeGuin.

     Publishers who wish to submit 2002 novels for consideration should
contact Michael Grossberg (614-236-5040, mikegrossb@aol.com, 3164
Plymouth Place, Columbus OH 43213), Chair of the LFS Prometheus Awards
Best Novel Finalist judging committee.
