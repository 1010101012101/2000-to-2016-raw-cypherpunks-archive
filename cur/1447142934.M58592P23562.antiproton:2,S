This debate is little bit over edge because of its explicitly political.
Thing is that I do not believe that in democratic country government is
something more or other than ordinary people [in totalitarianism country
it is little bit different because than government is usually bunch of
mass murders].
What is my point? Discussion and strong arguments even smart propaganda
can change a lot.
I've met our first democratic president Vaclav Havel and I tend to meet
politics during or ofter some civic actions, I have right to care and
right to discuss things with politics. I could even be one of them and
there are just people.
They do not know, they do not understand, they are afraid of ask... as
most or all of us.

We already know that governments will not disappear. That idea is
strongly decentralized and have a lot of side control mechanisms. So we
should count with government same as criminality, drugs, police,
military or violence against woman. It is just here and we should be
prepared not to attack [to read about German RAF could be interesting,
because terrorist managed to be government for some time, or at least
change its decisions, but do we really pour oil in fire of brutality,
is  that really needed?].

So think about governments as about "ordinary people" most of em' will
never be able to sign their email and most of them never used ssh. That
is part of our work, to show them why my argument *fly*, how much
cryptography is needed to have at least some way stable society without
basic holes. I do not care about *system* anymore I care about society
and I do love word citizen. That is what my parents where fighting for
during velvet revolution.
