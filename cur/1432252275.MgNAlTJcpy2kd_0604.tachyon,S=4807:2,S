NOT TRUE. This is abysmally shitty journalism. Here's what the article actually
states:

"Israel has warded off dozens of cyber-attacks on its government and
corporations since the Palestinian uprising began last year, blazing a trail
that could help the United States develop defenses for future electronic
conflicts, terrorism experts and Israeli officials say."
...
 Terrorism experts from RAND and from iDefense, an Alexandria firm
advising the U.S. government and industry, say Israel's experience in beating
off cyber-attacks will likely serve to protect American government and
industry against similar attacks.
...
"If the United States came to become involved in activity in the region
which generates a significant level of outrage in the Muslim community, there
is a distinct possibility that U.S. government and commercial organizations
will face cyber attacks much like those hitting Israel today," said the
iDefense report.

In other words, we can learn something from what's happening in Israel and
apply it to our own context and subsequent analysis. "RAND urging to adopt the
same defenses" my ASS. Which defenses, when? Under what circumstances? Which
specific RAND study, which researcher? How do you derive this so-called RAND
position from a few unrelated sentences by Bruce Hoffman? Did he even read the
iDefense report, or is he just content to misrepresent the Washington Times
piece? One wonders.

In sum, where's the proof? Looks like he made it up wholesale because it
suited his point to say so. But then, smug fifth-rate hacks who lack basic
reading comprehension skills are prone to these sort of overblown whiny smears
to score easy brownie points with the peanut gallery. Talk about not caring
about the truth! Disingenuous scaremongering.

Either that, or he's absolutely rock-bottom fucking retarded.

Zero respect.
