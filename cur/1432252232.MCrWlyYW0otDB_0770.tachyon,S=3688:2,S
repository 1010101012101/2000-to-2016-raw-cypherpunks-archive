Not speaking for the website operator but it appears that he
includes the language as an ass covering like most crypto
developers do in accord with legal advice to invoke protection
of the herd. 

What is called elsewhere "standards of the profession" 
meaning that if all members behave in the same way 
no harm will come to any of them because they have 
agreed to not blame each other, will lie for each other,
will screw customers in the same fashion, will excuse
ineptitude, will bill for services in concert, will seek
government protection for monopolistic practices,
as professionals are selected, schooled, trained and
certified to do to display the exculpatory appelation. 

Like the oldest professions: corn-holing and stealing
food and clubbing your baby's mother and claiming 
direct approval from the various gods in your image
invented and worshipped for auto-eroticism.

Then there are the financial reasons for using the
"do no evil" lingo. Knowing that your product will be
used for exactly that evil you advertise its value 
by forbidding that evil. See any bible for enlighenment.
Or any product warranty or privacy protection or
national security. In a pinch, claim mathematical
unbreakable crypto, and wheel out the standard
fault of implementation when your math disintegrates.

In these times forbidding use of crypto for terrorism, 
paedophilia and crimes is the very best way to attract 
high-paying customers who do just those, in particular 
warmakers, governments, banks, pornographers, 
cryptographers and those who racketeer against 
those fat heads, i.e. Robin Hood hackers.

Now please describe what are you offering with baloney
oppostion, I want to steal it and kill you if it is really 
good, which I have to say, speaking as a pro everready
to flog crap, it probably is pure gold.
