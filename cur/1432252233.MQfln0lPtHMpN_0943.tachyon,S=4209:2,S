You're on the right track.  Take several encryption algorithms
of your choice, then use a fixed IV, and the same sets of keys,
and encrypt blocks of 0's.  For each algorithm, compute several sets of
staticstics (a la NIST or DIEHARD).  With 100 blocks of 10 Megabytes
(100 different keys) you should see some interesting differences.

Remember, your question originally was "how can you tell which algorithm",
not "how do you find the key".  Let us know what you find out :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
