So if the Americans aboard the International Space Station were civilians
from Florida, their franchise could be accommodated so long as they had
willing "immediate family..."?  

Do those designees have to meet voter qualifications?  i.e. could Joe
Astronaut's 8yrold daughter (and Freedom user, of course) fill out daddy's
ballot and take it to her local grade school voting place so long as she
had daddy's written authorization?

Given that many astronauts are active service members, how do they fulfill
the following:

No mention of whether immediate family members can be "designated" (power
of attorney?) 

Think of the awful jading lesson our children might learn if they found
out their hero, Joe Astronaut, most-patriotic-man-in-the-universe didn't,
or more importantly, *couldn't* perform his civic duty.
