Holocaust survivors pressure company over shoe name

range of sports shoes after Jewish groups pointed out the gas with the same 
name was used by the Nazis to kill millions of people in concentration camps.

Activists from the Network Against Prohibition today presented NT Police 
Minister Syd Stirling with a platter containing 2 pigs heads. Other 
activists had pigs heads mounted on sticks. The action was taken to 
demonstrate against the pig-headed approach to policing being taken by the 
NT Government.
