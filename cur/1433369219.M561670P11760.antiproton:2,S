There's some amazing stuff going into the US House of Representative's HR2578. Here's some links to some of it:

You can read the discussion on the amendment to ban the DEA from bulk surveillance here at page 83: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-06-02/pdf/CREC-2015-06-02.pdf It passed!

I got the link to that PDF at the Recent Sessions On-Demand tab at this link which also has archived videos of the proceedings: http://houselive.gov/

These other amendments also just passed a few hours ago:

3:26:26 P.M. 	H.R. 2578 	POSTPONED PROCEEDINGS - At the

amendment until a time to be announced.
