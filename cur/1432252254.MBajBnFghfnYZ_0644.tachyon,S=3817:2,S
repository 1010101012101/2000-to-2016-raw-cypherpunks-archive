Nope. Back to the books for you.

Here's a three-letter hint about the enforceability of "electronic 
contracts" - EDI.

Also, take a look at these Internet-related cases -

_Caspi v. The Microsoft Network LLC_, 323 N.J. Super. 118, 732 A.2d 528 
(N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999) (at 
<http://legal.web.aol.com/decisions/dlother/caspi.html>)

_Hotmail Corp. v. Van$ Money Pie_, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10729; 47 
U.S.P.Q.2D 1020 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (No. C98-20064 JW) (at 
<http://eon.law.harvard.edu/property00/alternatives/hotmail.html>)

_Groff v. America Online_ 1998 WL 307001 (R.I. Super. Ct. May 27, 1998) (at 
<http://legal.web.aol.com/decisions/dlother/groff.html>)

_Specht v. Netscape_ 150 F. Supp. 2d 585 (S.D.N.Y 2001) (at 
<http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/01-07482.PDF>)

You might find _Law of the Internet_, Lexis Law Pub (2001) of interest.
