This article touches on a note that irritates me, a pro-Capitalist, pro-gun
American.  The fact that many militias, 'right winger's' and so on are
claiming that
"global corporations, the wealthy, and ruling-class billionaires as being
behind the plot to take away America's Second Amendment rights. "
I'll agree that global corperations (such as lowe's) and "ruling-class
billionaires" (such as George Soros) are 'behind the plot to take away 2nd
amendment rights.  But generalizing that to "the wealthy" is a big mistake.
By allying with 'populists' and nationalists, we could see the NRA
supporting protectionism, stronger Union laws, and other anti-capitalist
dogma.
So should libertarians do to fight the NRA's trend left, as well as the
"liberal power-elite"
