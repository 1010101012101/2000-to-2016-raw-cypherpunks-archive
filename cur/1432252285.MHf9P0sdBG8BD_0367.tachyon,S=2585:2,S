I noticed some discussion of the SafeWeb cancellation of free
services here.

ZKS announced yesterday freedom websecure, which is an anonymous web
browsing system with more robust redirection and script blocking than
systems that rely on html re-writing.  There is a free trial offered
for a couple of months.

	http://www.freedom.net/products/websecure/

Unfortunately it only works as shipped with IE on windows in this
version.

(The local browser plugin is the point where srcipting, java etc are
disabled, and traffic is encrypted (with SSL) and directed to a
proxy).
