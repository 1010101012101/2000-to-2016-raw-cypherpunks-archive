Cryptographers and U.S. Immigration

Seems like cryptographers are being questioned when they enter the U.S.
these days. Recently I received this (anonymous) comment: "It seems that
the U.S. State Department has a keen interest in foreign cryptographers:
Yesterday I tried to renew my visa to the States, and after standing in
line and getting fingerprinted, my interviewer, upon hearing that my
company sells [a cryptography product], informed me that "due to new
regulations," Washington needs to approve my visa application, and that to
do so, they need to know exactly which companies I plan to visit in the
States, points of contact, etc. etc. Quite a change from my last visa
application, for which I didn't even have to show up."

I'm curious if any of my foreign readers have similar stories. There are
international cryptography conferences held in the United States all the
time. It would be a shame if they lost much of their value because of visa
regulations.
