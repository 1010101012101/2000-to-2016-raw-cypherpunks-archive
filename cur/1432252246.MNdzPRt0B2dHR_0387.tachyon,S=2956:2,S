Obviously AT&T is innocent since they did not know or intend and
likewise so is a remailer operator who is not privy to the schemes of
the terrorists so has no knowlege or intent.

Or does innocence depend upon the depth of one's pockets?

I doubt getting rid of remailers is so simple as the authorities that be
not liking them. There's some time and effort involved and success is
not certain. While they're at it might as well get rid of personal ads
and public bulletin boards newsgroups ad infinitum.

Our speech-restricting politicians are worthless.
