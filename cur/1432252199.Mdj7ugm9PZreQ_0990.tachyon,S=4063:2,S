Subject: quarantine on Clavius and corralitos.
During a health emergency, health officials would be able immediately to 
take over any materials or facilities "as may be reasonable and necessary" 
for emergency response -- including the management of a health care 
facility and the rationing of medicine and other supplies if a shortage 
develops.
They could compel a person to submit to a physical exam or test without a 
court order or be charged with a misdemeanor offense and face the 
possibility of forced isolation. Physicians and other health workers could 
be forced to do the testing or face criminal liability.
Court orders would be required for quarantining someone, but faced with an 
immediate threat, officials could quarantine first and go to court afterward.
The law sets forth a procedure for contesting court orders and for hearings 
on the need for continued isolation. Officials could compel people to be 
vaccinated or treated for infectious diseases, though not those likely to 
suffer serious harm from a vaccination. The law would shield officials and 
their agents from civil liability, except in cases of gross negligence or 
willful misconduct.
[George] Annas, the Boston University critic, says that the law's major 
problem is that it gives "tremendous powers to unnamed and unaccountable 
public health officials to order people examined, treated, vaccinated or 
quarantined and do it with immunity unless acting with willful malice.
Mousepox that was converted to a selective strain that infects white men 
only with 100% fatality rates is suspected.It is believed a professor R ,a 
molecular biologist accidently released the virus on a recent trip to 
sacramento.
