(This is a ONE-TIME EMAIL, please click delete and accept my apologies 
If you are not interested in making a legal CASH income by investing a 
small amount of time and money)

There is no need to reply or ask to be removed from any mailing list. 
You will not receive any more identical emails from this source.

Dear Entrepreneur:

This program is intended for those people who understand that nothing in 
life is free.
This is not a SCAM, it is a BUSINESS; and like all businesses, you must 
work in order 
to make it successful.  If you are honestly willing to put some effort 
and you have a little
patience you can earn enough money to make your life much more comfortable.
 
If you've read this far, chances are your are currently working in a home 
business or have in the past.  Unfortunately, there is also a 90% or better
chance that you are not seeing the kind of income you had hoped for either.

If you're honest with yourself, you know exactly what I'm saying. You 
did everything you were told to do, but it just hasn't happened for you, 
time and time again. Sound familiar?

Spend a fraction of the time you would at most day jobs or home 
businesses and make some cold, hard, CASH!!!!   I send out these emails, 
as many as I can, and people send me cash in the mail for information 
that I just email back to them. It is all completely legal, and I get to 
make that walk to the mailbox every day knowing that it is full of $5 
bills for me!!

What you are about to read is very exciting.  Prepare to be amazed.  
It will explain how almost anyone can legally make a lot of money, in 
CASH!!!

You don't need to have a lot of experience, time, or money to do this, 
but if you do - all the better!  The most important thing you need is 
the desire to get ahead, a bit of spare time, and an entrepreneurial 
spirit.

Have you been disappointed with a lot of so-called "opportunities" or 
all the hassles associated with selling on online auctions? This is 
different!  I'm sure you've heard that before, but please take a few 
minutes to go through the plan, and make sure you read all of the 
information.  

Make this the one you act upon! 


THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
   
BE WEALTHY LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
   
Before you say "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter
you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described
below, to see if it really can make people money.  The show also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal.
  
Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 
follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost."
   
  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
  ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
   
This is what one had to say:  "My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I 
live
in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled to Jody 
about receiving "junk mail.  "I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my 
knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't 
work.
  
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she
jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready
to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work.
  
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 
responses.  Within the next 45 days she had received total $147,200.00 
...... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby."

  PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

Please read the following…THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

FOLLOW THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR
FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE!

   Order all 5 reports shown on the list below. 


For each report, send $5 CASH (US CURRENCY), THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS (plus an alternate 
Email address, if you have another one (in case of unforeseen problems)
to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER,
in case of any mail problems.
  
When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.  

You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.
   
Within a few days you will receive, via email, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer
so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who 
will order them from you. Also make a copy on a floppy disk of these
reports and keep it somewhere safe in case something happens to your 
computer. 
   
IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way
other than what is instructed below in steps "1 through 6" or you will 
lose out on a majority of your profits.
   
Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does
not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if
you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the
money. But it does not work this way.

Believe us, some of us have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. 
So do NOT change anything other than what is instructed. Because
if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

  1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
  REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has 
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
  
  2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
  
  3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
  
  4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
  
  5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

  6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE
  SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! (Using the cut & paste
feature makes it easy)
                  

  *** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save
it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a diskette as well just in case you lose any data. To assist
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads and much more.  Once you see the reports, you will
no doubt agree that $25 is a bargain.
   
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going.

  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

Let's assume you start out small and send out only 5,000 emails.  With 
a 
0.001% response that means that you sell only 5 people the reports:*** 

1st level - You sell 5 reports for $5.00 each. You receive $25.00 cash. 

2nd level - Each of the 5 people you recruited will recruit 5 new members. 
That's 25 people x 5 new recruits each = 125 people. 
Which is 125 people x $5.00 ea. = you receive $625.00. 

3rd level - Those 125 people recruit 5 new members each. 
That's 125 people x 5 new recruits each = 625 people. 
Which is 625 people x $5.00 ea. = you receive $3,125. 

4th level - Those 625 people recruit 5 new members each. 
That's 625 people x 5 new recruits each = 3,125 people. 
Which is 3,125 people x $5.00 ea. = you receive $15,625. 

5th level - Those 3,125 people recruit 5 new members each. 
That's 3,125 people x 5 new recruits each = 15,625 people. 
Which is 15,625 x $5.00 ea. = you receive $78,125.

Your grand total is $97,525.

***Rather than exaggerate, our suggestion that you will only sell 5 reports 
is extremely low. You can expect significantly greater sales.  Many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of just 5,000.


METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
    
Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
will easily get a larger response. This is an excellent way to get
started if you are low on cash!  You will, however, have a little less
work if you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD# 2 as you go along.
  
For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.
   
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and
address, will be prompt because they can not advertise until
they receive the report.
   
AVAILABLE REPORTS:

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER AND NAME ONLY.  Notes:  Always send $5
cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.  Checks NOT accepted.  Make sure 
the cash is 
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.  On one sheet of 
paper, write or type the 
NUMBER and NAME of the Report you are ordering, your E-Mail ADDRESS, and 
an 
alternate, if you have one, and your name and postal address.

        $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
   
If you do not receive at least 5 orders for Report #1 
within 2weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
   
After you have received 5 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that 
you should receive 25 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 25 or more orders for Report # 2,YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash 
will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your
name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different 
report.
   
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME, SEND ANOTHER
BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to
the income you can generate from this business!!!

Remember to email a copy of this exciting report to yourself also, after 
you have put
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ......# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!
  
  MORE TESTIMONIALS:


"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way 
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least "get my money back."

I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed 
with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing
about this deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."

  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada


"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, thanks to internet."

  Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand
