If this was true then the proportion of wealth spent on
informational goods, and income earned from informational
goods, would be smaller and smaller.   Instead it is larger and
larger.

Some kinds of Information continually get used up, as in being
no longer relevant to the individual or the situation.  This is
the kind of information people still pay serious money for.

Most of us on the cypherpunks list earn our living producing or
transforming information.  We expected that by now we would be
telecommuting from some tropical isle and being paid in
anonymous untraceable money.  We were wrong, but it certainly
is not because the provision of information has come to accord
with some communist utopia.
