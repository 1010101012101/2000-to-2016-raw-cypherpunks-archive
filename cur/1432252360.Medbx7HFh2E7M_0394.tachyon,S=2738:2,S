ITU Approves Deep Packet Inspection

Posted by Soulskill on Tuesday December 04, @08:19PM

from the inspect-my-encryption-all-you'd-like dept.

dsinc sends this quote from Techdirt about the International
Telecommunications Union's ongoing conference in Dubai that will have an
effect on the internet everywhere: "One of the concerns is that decisions
taken there may make the Internet less a medium that can be used to enhance
personal freedom than a tool for state surveillance and oppression. The new
Y.2770 standard is entitled 'Requirements for deep packet inspection in Next
Generation Networks', and seeks to define an international standard for deep
packet inspection (DPI). As the Center for Democracy & Technology points out,
it is thoroughgoing in its desire to specify technologies that can be used to
spy on people. One of the big issues surrounding WCIT and the ITU has been
the lack of transparency b or even understanding what real transparency might
be. So it will comes as no surprise that the new DPI standard was negotiated
behind closed doors, with no drafts being made available."
