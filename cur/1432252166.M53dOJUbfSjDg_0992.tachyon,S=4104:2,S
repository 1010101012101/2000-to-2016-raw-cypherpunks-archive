I think you hit the nail on the head here. For most USAns these days the
word "socialism" doesn't really mean anything specific, it is just a
generalised insult (much the same as the way people on the left
sometimes use "Nazi" or "Fascist").

There were a few big rants on this topic a couple of years back...

Yep,
http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.98.10.12-98.10.18/msg00019.html
has a rant about Rosa Luxemburg and various people redefining the word
"socialism" so that it included only ideas they didn't like & excluded
ones they did. It was a sort of reply to a thread started by Jim Choate:

which is exactly the sort of thinking that leads to what most  Europeans
call "socialism", but he got really cross when people used the S word
about him.

Yep. Who is this guy to say what "the morons" should or shouldn't have?
Maybe a supporter of the feudal system?
