Cryptome was given a preview of OpenLeaks.org yesterday.
It appears to have learned from Wikileaks and many others.
An impressive preparation which advances development of
superior methods of combating secrecy openly, not just rushing
to copy Wikileaks.

It addresses many of the issues raised in this thread. Among others,
it promises to invite and respond to critiques openly and will share 
what it learns with other intiatives. Funding will be disclosed.

It is in testing now with access by invitation. It will be gradually 
rolled out with further testing, revision and fully opened in early 
2011. 

The site has a link to an article in which Daniel D-B explains 
the initiative.

Daniel generated a PK on December 13, 2010 with the address
ddb@openleaks.org. 

He welcomes inquiries and advice, as he says, from those with 
more capabilities than the current "gang" which are working 
their asses off to get it right before rushing a faulty product 
to meet a PR-driven deadline, oh my, that goes against industry 
practice in an admirable way.

Except for OpenLeaks, in prep since September, the rush of 
new copycat Leaks sites and thousands of Wikileaks mirrors 
is Buster Keaton Charlie Chaplin comical.
