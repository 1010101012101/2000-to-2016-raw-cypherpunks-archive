 hi there,

 my name is miriam... I just came across your article on filevault (http://
 www.vmeng.com/mc/archives/2004-March/000626.html)
 I was wondering if you might have an answer here for me.... since
 something really terrible just happened to me:


 I do have a powerbook g4 with filevault turned on. the other day I turned
 my computer of, turned in on and had to realize that my entire desktop was
 set to default and all data on it were gone.... including music files from
 my i-tunes library and images from i-photo.

 I found a file on my homefolder: xxxxx.sprseimage with the filevault icon
 .... stating that it contains 25gb.

 No way of copying this file. And no way of turning file vault off as long
 this file is on the computer.

 I have not lost any password but trying to turn off file vault results in
 an error message after ca. 40 minutes.


 NOW THE BIG HOPE QUESTION: any chance of decrypting this file???

 the geniusses at apple did not know what to do...






 I would appreciate any answer on this
 thank you
 miriam
