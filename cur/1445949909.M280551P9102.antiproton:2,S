I dont know-know but test it all out irl ask someone in love with you if
you can fuck them ...watch the facial expression

Steve could be wrong as steve was wrong about that upper eschelon no say
fuck

I am an artist and have worked with whats considered high level artists ...
say fuck more than me which seems impossible and these kind of caste
distinctions of words or body functions seem to slap in the face the life
of language

Well known thinkers and artists minds dont wotk overall in these
hierarchies ... exclusionary breaks of fenced off condemnation ... spaces
of life - all of them - are expressionable and loved which is actually very
difficult in having no good and bad no good and evil is a complexity the
western mind - christian mind finds hard to bare

Where can they put the control valves and buttons to press if there are no
societal goods and evils as if mass stupidity is the overall normative of
each and everyone needs instriction booklets with their bodies

I like that maybe both realities are acknowledged - saying fuck or mother
fucker is now considered a right  - to be upheld like other rights and
maybe also at the same time a degradation of women or love
