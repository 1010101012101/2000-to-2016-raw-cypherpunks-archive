Try explaining that to the widow of the fireman who was trying to save your
house.

...of course, that's assuming that it works perfectly, with no false
returns.

Reality rarely matches marketing. The accuracy rates for face recognition
are good
iff and only iff the subject is cooperating. With your proposed system, if
you forgot to
take off your sunglasses when you went in the house, you're probably dead.

--------------------------------

All professional alarm systems have an "armed state" and "triggered" warning so the property owners can shut it off before any action is taken.  I'm sure something appropriate can be devised to handle false IDs.

As for the firemen, this would indeed be a weakness.

BTW, open source face recognition SW is available from Intel.
http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/research/opencv/pr/visionSystemsDesignMag.htm#IntelTop

Does anyone know of open source SW which could be adapted for target tracking and fire control?  Imagine how feature-face recognition could be married with targeting and anaonymous open broadband wireless access (commuication is encrypted and only used when a possible target match has been identified) to identify, target, authorize and eliminate vermin.  OpenJackal anyone?
