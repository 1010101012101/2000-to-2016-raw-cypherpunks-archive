One of the eternal problems of X.509 software:

Implementation Problem Redux

Certified for use with Windows

- Microsoft owns the trademark
- Submit software to Microsoft, who perform extensive testing
- Passing software can use the certification mark
- Reasonable (given the size of the deployed base) interoperability among 
  tested products

S/MIME

- RSADSI owns (owned) the trademark
- Simple interoperability test for signing and encryption
-- Anyone could participate, at no cost
- Passing software can use the certification mark
- Good interoperability among tested products

X.509
- No quality control
- You cannot build software so broken than it can't claim to be X.509v3
