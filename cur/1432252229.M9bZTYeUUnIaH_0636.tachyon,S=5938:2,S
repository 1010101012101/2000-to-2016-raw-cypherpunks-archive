No.  Your acceptance or rejection of my definitions is irrelevant.
I'm predicting what definitions will be used by those who are
important in this situation---the people acting to decide whether or
not the insurance policy will be paid.

You can question them, but in this case it's clear that the
definitions that are important are those that the insurance company
will use in determining whether an act of war was committed.  If they
don't pay out, the people who hold the policies will go to court, and
once in court the legal definition will be used.

> I did, you lost. Your definition of 'war' and 'terrorism' are inaccurate.

Perhaps they do not agree with your definitions.  I contend that my
definitions are accurate inasmuch as they reflect those which will be
used when the people who will eventually make this decision endeavor
to do so.

Yes, but it does not recognize that state-sponsored terrorism
constitutes an act of war, which is the important question here.

The question here was "will the insurance companies pay out?"  My
answer was that this was clearly an act of terrorism and not an act of
war.  Even if it were sponsored by a state, it would be an act of
terrorism, not an act of war.  I'm not questioning the existence of
state-sponsored terrorism.

Interesting that you're accusing me of ad hominem attacks and the use
of straw men, as this is your standard m.o.---in this case, the
squirrel definitions that started this ridiculous discussion and 'your
beenie is wound too tight, junior."

> Come back when you can play with adults.

Jim, I'm going to give you a clue.  You're generally regarded here as
the village idiot.  You are not respected, your arguments are ignored,
and your posts are deleted on reception by most people.  To some this
would send a clear warning that something is wrong.  Perhaps you need
someone to tell you this outright: shut the fuck up and crank up those
meds.
