Subject: Do ethnic Germans have the right to racial and cultural
strength? - was Re: At a Berlin church, Muslim refugees converting in
droves.

Hi Jim, a good question indeed. At Germany's 6% Islamic population set
to grow to 12% in the next few years, there is going to be quite the
shift there in the next couple of years.

Some questions which Germans might ask themselves:

1) Do ethnic Germans, who are citizens of Germany have:
 - the right to racial strength, and or
 - the right to cultural strength, and or
 - the right to political strength, and or
 - the right to religious strength,
in their own country (Germany)?

2) Is it racist for ethnic Germans of Germany to want to maintain
their political majority in Germany?

3) We note that Islamic Muslims strongly practice and proclaim their
rights to racial strength, cultural strength, religious strength, and
political strength, and more than this, the right to change/ convert
any and all non-Muslim jurisidictions (countries or part thereof) to
Sharia Law and Muslim religion. So:
- Are German citizens so naive to think that Muslims will change, just
because they crossed a "border"?

Regards,
Zenaan
