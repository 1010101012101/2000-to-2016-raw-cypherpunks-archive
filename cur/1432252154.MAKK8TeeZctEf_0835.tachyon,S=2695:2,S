   It's hard to believe that anyone with half a brain would be taken in by these
"finds" -- there's absolutely no shred of a chain of evidence. Any
"reporter" could have some Arabic writer cobble together any sort of document
which they'd then claim to have "found" in the files. Or a "looter" planting it,
as you say. 
    And for that matter, why would the supposed authorites be allowing anyone at
all to go rummaging thru the Iraqi files? There's no possible way the CIA or
anyone else could have thoroughly looked them over since the fighting stopped,
and you'd think they'd certainly want to. 
     Why would they think anyone at all would believe this stuff? Of course,
look at what they tried to pass off to the Security Council as "evidence."
