By the way, the same problems with MIME, HTML, attachments, etc. is 
hitting the Newsgroups as well. Some of the newsgroup folks are 
posting reminders (from charters, FAQs) not to do this.

Here's one I just saw in the comp.lang.ruby group:

"  (a) General format guidelines:

         - Use *plain* text; don't use HTML, RTF, or Word.
         - Include examples from files as *in-line* text; don't
           use attachments.
         - PLEASE NOTE! Include quoted text from previous posts
           *BEFORE* your responses. And *selectively* quote as much
           as is relevant.
"


Good advice for our list as well.
