The following information from the Rijndael Page 
http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~rijmen/rijndael/index.html may come 
in handy later today when NIST announces the new Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES):

'Rijndael FAQ

     1.How is that pronounced ?
        If you're Dutch, Flemish, Indonesian, Surinamer or 
South-African, it's pronounced like you think it should be. 
Otherwise, you could pronounce it  like "Reign Dahl", "Rain Doll", 
"Rhine Dahl". We're not picky. As long as you make it sound different 
from "Region Deal".

     2.Why did you choose this name ?
        Because we were both fed up with people mutilating the 
pronunciation of the names "Daemen" and "Rijmen". (There are two 
messages in this  answer.)

     3.Can't you give it another name ? (Propose it as a tweak!)
        Dutch is a wonderful language. Currently we are debating about 
the names "Herfstvrucht", "Angstschreeuw" and "Koeieuier". Other 
suggestions are welcome of course. Derek Brown, Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada, proposes "bob".'
