Subject: Re: Harvard mathematician creates 'provably unbreakable' code

Let me tell you how the Rabin system works in the Crypto 99 paper.
I'll do it as pseudo code and copy it to BXA so everything is kosher.
Basically they generate a one time pad by xoring a random subset of the
message bits, where the subset indices are agreed upon in advance by
the communicants:

Security Parameter k // Error probability = 1/2^(k/5)
Random data length PER MESSAGE BIT n = 5E // E is maximum size of adversary memory
Message Length m //bits
Message M = {M_1, ..., M_m} // m bits long
Secret key s = {sig_1, ... sig_k} // each in range 1-n, k of them
Random data alpha[n][m]  // n*m bits long
One Time Pad X[m]  // Will be xored with M

for i = 1 to m do
  for j = 1 to n do
    if j is an element of s then
      R and S store alpha[j][i]
  end for j
  S and R set X[i] = xor of stored alpha[j][i] values (k of them)
  S sends M[i] xor X[i]; R recovers M[i] by xoring with X[i]
end for i

For each message bit M_i we need to use 5*E random bits, where E is the
estimate of the maximum amount of memory the adversary can hold.

For example if Eve can store 100 Tbits, we need to use up 500 Tbits of
data for each message bit.  To send say a 1 Mbit message that is, well,
it's a lot.  500 exabits.  (It goes giga, tera, peta, exa.  Then zetta
and yotta.)

The initial shared secret key is simply k indexes in the range 1-n,
where k is the security parameter such that the guaranteed probability of
failure is bounded by 1/2^(k/5).  k = 300 would give a security level of
2^60.  The size of the initial shared secret key is therefore k log n, so
with k = 300 and n = 2^49 as above, this is about 15000 shared key bits.

So I would say no, this 1999 scheme is not practical.  Maurer's original
approach used only n random bits in total, not n bits per message bit,
but it did not have as strong provability.  The authors leave it as an
open problem whether they can achieve similar levels of provable security
using n bits total, which would make it much more practical.

Maybe the new result presented in the Times fixes this problem and reduces
the data quantity to something sane.
