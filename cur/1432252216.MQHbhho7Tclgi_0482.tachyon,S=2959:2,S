    Total, absolute, unadulterated bullshit! You must work for the
feds to be able to lie that baldfacedly. There were no agri-chemicals
before WWII. They tried using asenic as an insecticide early on, but 
gave up on it rather quickly. At any rate, there were certainly no
herbicides before WWII.
  Sounds like the chem lab experiments you did in high school did
a number on your forebrain. 
  Or maybe you can give us a cite?
