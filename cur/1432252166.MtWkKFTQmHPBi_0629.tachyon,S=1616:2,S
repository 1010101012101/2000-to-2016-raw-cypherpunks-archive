I heard an announcement on NPR tonight that tomorrow's
Talk Of The Nation program will be discussing the "Papers Please" case.

Mark Rotenberg of EPIC will be on.

Refusing to give your name to a police officer could get you arrested. 
That's what the Supreme Court ruled this week. Guests: Bill Johnson, 
executive director and legal counsel of the National Association of Police 
Organizations; and Marc Rotenberg, president of Electronic Privacy 
Information Center.
