In some cases it would be trivial to distribute a key for DHCP trust
purposes.
My cable ISP distributes a CDROM which configures Wintel machines for
it.  (I don't use this.)  It would be easy enough for them to distribute
secret
or public keys or even hash sigs that worked with their DHCP, *if* the
clients
could use it, and *if* the users paid attention to whatever UI
accompanied
problems.

In other cases --the visitor who wants to connect a laptop to an office
net--
there is a perhaps unacceptable burden.
