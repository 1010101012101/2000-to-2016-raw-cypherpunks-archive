The nearest equivalent in European history to the crimes of the the nazis 
and commies was the spanish inquisition,and that was a small scale 
operation: Handcrafted murder rather than mass produced murder.  Each 
victim was individually identified and processed, rather dumped by the 
truckload.  They murdered about 12000, and the world was horrified by their 
crimes.

No they do not.

Laws of war are universally accepted by except by those who break 
them.  Those who claim to find it terribly shocking that innocents get 
killed when legitimate military targets are attacked, never seemed to 
notice when their favorite terror regimes murdered hundreds of thousands of 
peasants in peacetime.

themselves good and the other side evil.

This is the classic problem of pointing out the mote in the other's eye 
while ignoring the beam in one's own eye.  Both sides use the murder of 
children as a deliberate tactic to get their way.  The middle eastern Jews 
are likely to murder any non Jew, as their christian allies in Lebanon so 
painfully discovered, and perhaps the crew of the USS Liberty discovered 
also, and the arabs are similarly likely to murder friends and allies.  On 
both sides, murdering scum are in charge with overwhelming popular 
support.  When Clinton was organizing peace talks, he had one arm around a 
murdering terrorist, and his other arm around another murdering 
terrorist.  This was the basic cause of the lack of success in the peace talks.

Both.  As is confirmed by the propensity of both to deliberately murder 
innocents and allies.
