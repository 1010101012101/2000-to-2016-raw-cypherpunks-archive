This has to be true for the basic security goal of remote trust, right?
The purpose is so that the user can credibly convince a remote system that
he is running a certain program.  Explain to me how he could do this if
he were able to reload the TPM key with one of his own, or get access
to the private key?  Wouldn't that let him forge arbitrary messages?
You might as well complain that Verisign doesn't share their private key
with everyone.  Either way you lose the trust properties of the system.

We have had other systems which work like this for a long while.
Many consumer devices are sealed such that if you open them you void
the warranty.  This is to your advantage as a consumer; it means that you
can take the device in to get it fixed, and the intact seal proves that
you didn't mess with the insides and break it.  By your logic, consumers
ought to be able to bypass such seals since they own the device.  But if
this were true, don't you agree that it would make the seals useless?
