Birdbrain nescio plops>>Declan McCullagh has been producing a one-sided 
series...

Well he's a prime CALC suspect.Ill grant you that.

 >>everything the pornographer says is taken as gospel

Corn patch moving violation? Tim? anyone?

 >>the police are filthy liars.

Season with a little truth as garnish

 >>McCullagh's twisted narrative

On Cato yes.sadly.

 >>Missing from this tidy story is the cost-benefit analysis from the part 
of the evil policeman. He has supposedly committed a felony that could lead 
to decades in prison, just to avoid the difficulty of handing the computer 
back with an apology, which happens all the time in police work.

Im suspecting NN as filth now,he's dirtier than 'Faustine". The standard of 
police work gets exposed sometimes like the OJ  fuckup. They've not  handed 
back my computer yet,either.This particular policeman sounds like 'Maniac 
cop' to me.
Bad lieutenant.

 >>Smears,classic cointelpro coin of the realm.Agent nomen nescio crawls 
out into the light.no name nsacia.Slime.
