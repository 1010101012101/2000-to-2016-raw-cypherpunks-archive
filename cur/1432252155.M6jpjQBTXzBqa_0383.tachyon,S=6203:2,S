Welcome to the Operation Clambake Lawsuit Club :-)

While I may be misreading what you wrote, it _appears_ that you are not
really familiar with the Co$/RTC campaigns against Clambake et al...

Google is your friend here: this has been litigated to death already.  Of
course, that won't stop them from doing it again, using the "we can
outspend you" stratgey so common to lawyer larvae.

Read up, aand then decide how seriously you feel about free speech.  If
you fight them you'll very likely win, but it's gonna cost you *dearly*
(with lots more thn just mere money).


Yours,

It appears that some of the infringements may be true ( I will have to look to be sure) but what really gets me is the part quoted below.. They are saying since "Scientology", "Dianetics", "Hubbard" and "NOTs" are registered trademarks they cannot be used in metatags in a webpage... The restriction in use of words in a web page is just flat out censorship.. Absolutely ridiculous... It would be one thing if someone used the words to represent a business.. But I would think metatags at the very least would fall under the "Fair Use" clause.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
