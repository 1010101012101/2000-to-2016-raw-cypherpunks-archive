Actually that's not true. Take for example the nearly nationwide ban on
committing suicide. This clearly only impacts a single person directly, and
is by it's very act clearly consensual. But it has even been proposed that
attempted suicide should be tried as attempted murder 1. Oddly enough this
would in some areas make attempted suicide punishable by death. There are
other examples of similar, but not as ludicrous, legal situations where the
only person being impacted is the person acting, but it's still illegal.
