The circle is complete.  We started with 3270 terminals doing
page-update transactions with central servers, and that's where we're

What OS? Think X terminals, with HTTP substituting for the X protocol.
It's an ideal consumer medium, too.  All that's available is what the
servers offer, with no chance for local wizard-wannabees to install
