That's commendable idealism, but in most modern countries the electorial
process is practically guaranteed - and in fact mostly designed - to in
essence round out dissent. The fact that voting for the loser implies
casting your vote for nothing, *even in matters which had nothing to do
with the winner being elected*, simply means that there is absolutely no
point in voting for someone who cannot win. It's a nasty side effect of the
present implementation of democracy based on a mix of representative 
democracy, political parties, the relative voting system (dunno if you guys
have this) and what have you.
