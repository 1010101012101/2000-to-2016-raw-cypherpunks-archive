I can fire 9 shots in about 4 seconds and stay in the 9 ring of a
B-27 silhouette at 10 yards, and slow fire I can neatly remove the
X-ring at the same distance...I don't think it would be a bad option
against an armored opponent--2 in the body to knock them on their
behind, then one more between the eyes to finish things. The only
real drawback is the muzzle flash would be a problem in the dark.
With the standard 6 inch barrel, the flame is about a foot in
diameter and 2-3 feet long with some loads. Now when I attach the 14"
barrel with the scope, I can put 5 shots in about 2 inches at 50
yards, and the muzzle flash is greatly reduced due to the increased
barrel length. It is definitely on the heavy and bulky side for
concealed carry, but I wouldn't agree that it is impractical.

Those are typical Hollywood guns, largely impractical.  Cool looking,
certainly.

Now a Barrett in .50...
