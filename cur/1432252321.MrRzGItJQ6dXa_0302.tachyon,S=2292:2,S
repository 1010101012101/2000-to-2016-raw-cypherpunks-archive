LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the eve of grand jury proceedings in the Michael
Jackson molestation case, the presiding judge of the Santa Barbara
courts barred pictures or communication with any prospective or final
panelists, or grand jury witnesses.

Superior Court Judge Clifford R. Anderson III did not mention Jackson's
name in his order Wednesday, but acknowledged a grand jury summoned this
week "has created significant media and public interest."

The order threatens to hold in contempt anyone who communicates with a
juror, prospective grand juror or witness - or reveals secret testimony.
It also prohibits photography of jurors or prospective jurors entering
and exiting the courthouse and "any other facility or property utilized
by the grand jury."

Media lawyers immediately protested, calling the order "overbroad and
unconstitutional prohibition of activity protected under the First
Amendment and California law." They said the courthouse and its environs
have long been recognized as a public forum.

"I've not seen an order so broad and so sweeping," said attorney
Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents several media organizations
including The Associated Press.
