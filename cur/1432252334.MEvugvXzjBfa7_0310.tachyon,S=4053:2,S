I accept that. A point of clarity, I'm not claiming that N=NP for a single
problem means I can solve all of them. I believe that to say that if a
problem isn't polynomial then it must fit into NP and that ALL NP are
equivalent is just silly. It's like saying N! and be reduced to e^x,
though neither can strictly be reduced to a polynomial.

However, especialy in the press, there seems to be exactly this sort of
view. It seems to be that the impression they leave is that if we find a P
solution to primality we'll as a consequence have a solution avenue to
all other NP problems. It's that 'all other' that I object too. With
respect to your statement above, it just seems they use your wording and
leave the 'particular problems' part out.
