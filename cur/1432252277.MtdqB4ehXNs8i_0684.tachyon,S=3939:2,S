Your comments naturally lead us to think how to make simple systems, yet functional enough for the purpose we are building them.

KISS is coming back into vogue.

We are up to a revival in self-made purpose-specific web servers. Learning the few needed protocols and building from the ground up using open-source tools seems the way to go.

Notwithstanding hardware issues, using things out of intel and amd seems also to become a trend.
