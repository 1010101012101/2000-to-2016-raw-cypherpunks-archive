OK, I agree I was a bit snarky. Mea culpas below.

Not only that, but it doesn't burn that fast:
http://northstarind.com/lngfaqs.html
"Natural gas is only combustible at a concentration of 5 to 15 
percent when mixed with air. And, its flame speed is very slow. 
These facts may best be experienced by a simple demonstration 
often done at LNG fire schools. A large pit, i.e., 20' x 20', 
is filled with LNG, allowing the vapor cloud to drift with the 
wind. The cloud is ignited with a torch from a downwind side. 
Ignition typically occurs near the visible fringes of the 
cloud. The resulting flame front moves back toward the pit 
at a speed only slightly faster than a walk."

Well, I tried. Every dictionary I checked refers only to direct
solid->gas transition. I'm aware of the effect you describe, but
its not sublimation. See:
http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/antarctica%20environm
ent/weather.htm
If you throw boiling water into the air at -32C, much of it 
evaporates instantly (the humidity is near zero), and some of the
larger droplets freeze, falling to the ground as ice. No liquid 
will hit the ground.

Volcabulary flames are about as pointless as they get, so I 
apologize for starting this one.

Mea culpa. I was confusing LPG and LNG. (Some of the sources I 
looked at refered to liquid propane and butane is LNGs.) Those 
gases are denser than air. Correctly speaking, they are referred 
to as Liquified Petroleum Gases (LPG), not  Liquified Natural 
Gas (LNG). LNG is primarily methane,  which, as you say, is 
lighter than air.
