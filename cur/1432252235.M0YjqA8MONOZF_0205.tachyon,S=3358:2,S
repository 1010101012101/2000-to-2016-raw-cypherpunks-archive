John

You will need to be present at the Tacoma Courthouse at 9:00am on Tuesday,
4/3/01.  We anticipate you will testify on Tuesday, but it may extend to
Wednesday 4/4/01, depending on the pace of the trial, so the return flight
should not be scheduled prior to 5pm on 4/4/01.  In order to be reimbursed
for travel, all travel arrangements need to be made through the Dru Mercer
at the US Attorney's office, (206) 553-7970.  Let me know if you have any
questions.

Jeff

Jeff,

Thanks for the information.

Could you find out if I can buy a transcript of my grand jury 
testimony before the trial? Robb London has not answered 
my three inquiries. The court reporters office told me it
can be released only with Robb's approval.

John
