They claim they have over 1 million users. Is a class action suit in 
order? Their privacy policy clearly states 

"We consider your email address to be confidential information. We will 
never rent, sell, or otherwise reveal it to any other party without prior 
consent, except under the conditions set forth in the User Agreement for 
spamming and related abuses of netiquette, or unless we are compelled to 
do so by court order."
