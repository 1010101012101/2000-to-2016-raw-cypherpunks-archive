Your internal combustion experience is of little relevence here.

The law is wrong for pinning a rabid security force's wrongs on their
employer.
That is simple deep-pocket mining like the tobacco suits.  

However, Tim is being unjustifiably condemning of citizens with old cars,
methinks.  Even having
an agenda to provoke the brownshirts by slowly driving by does not justify
violence.  Again,
violence is the responsibility of the perpetrators, not their bosses, or
the authors of words
they read.  

Frankly, thinking critically, the backfire defence sounds like
straw-grasping, esp.
given no firearms found on the victims.  One hopes that TM does not
discharge his artillery
towards misfiring vehicles passing his terrain on public roads.

Again: its wrong to bust the smalldicked neonazis for the actions of their
'security force',
its wrong of them to assault passers-by for impulsive noises.
