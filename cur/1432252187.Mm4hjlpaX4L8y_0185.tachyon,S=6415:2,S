to clarify, the POTUS jammin' described by OP is a simple, and brute
case.  however, there is precedent for "intelligent jamming", where
attempts to avoid the specific DoS using wide band, complex encoding
would be met with a specific wide-band, complex response telling you
to get stuffed. these systems cooperate together, and surely
countermeasures are in place if you evade the trivial measures.

note that avoiding POTUS jammin' is a violation of FCC regs, #include
<std_disclaimer> etc,...

a shielded, passive receiver would be overwhelmed by the brute flood.

yup.

they probably use a few tens of watts EIRP at most, unless they need
to react to a perceived threat to penetrate that barrier. military
systems go to many thousands of watts.
