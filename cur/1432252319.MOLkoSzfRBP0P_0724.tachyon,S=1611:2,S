>John's an "anarchist" now!  LMAO!

This is a perfect example of media bias and manufacture of enemies.

Collecting public material at one place *is* anarchism today.

You may laugh but 74% (or whatever is the % who believes Saddam personally
piloted all 9/11 planes) of americans will believe it.

So Mr. Young is anarchist for all practical purposes and consequences.
And you are all his associates.
