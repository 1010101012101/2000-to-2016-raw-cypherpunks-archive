That sounds like a job for IPSEC.  All the packets are encrypted
at the IP level, though you can still tell the source and
destination of the outer packet, and you can tell the packet size,
so it's not a strict Pipenet substitute - if you see traffic from
A to B and same-sized traffic from B to C, you can guess that
B might have routed some packets from A to C.
But it still answers your basic request.
