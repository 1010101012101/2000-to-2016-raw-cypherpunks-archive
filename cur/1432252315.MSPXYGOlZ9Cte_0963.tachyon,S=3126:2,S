So you agree, then, that tax-paying US subjects are bona fide targets because they
shelter and support US-based men with guns ("government") that killed more (per
capita) than any other gang ?

And, agent Gordon, if you continue to use "we" someone could get irritated enough
to snuff someone. You may use "we" only when in company of exclusively
government-paid goons. There are few on this list left which are not.
