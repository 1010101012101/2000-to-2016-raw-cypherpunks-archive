Look at the PadLock ACE programming guide [1]. Only seems to support Rijndael
with a block size of 128 bits (= AES); it allows both key scheduling in
hardware and in software, the latter allowing you to have your own custom
key schedule. It also allows you to increase the number of rounds if you
think Rijndael-128's security margins are too low. Props to the VIA engineers
for both the customizability. The errate are funny as well. Looks like the
current stepping has a bug in the key schedule for 192 and 256 bit keys.

Cheers,
Ralf
