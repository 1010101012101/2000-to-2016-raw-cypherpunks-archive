   from the many-purposes dept.
   An anonymous reader writes "U.S. security officials say they [1]will
   use RFID technology at border posts with Canada and Mexico to track
   foreigners driving in and out of the United States. A Department of
   Homeland Security spokesman said wireless chips for vehicles would
   become mandatory at designated border crossings in Canada and Mexico
   as of Aug. 4. At the same time, British officials are considering
   using [2]RFID chips to identify the dead in the wake of a disaster."
   From the British article: "...following the bomb blasts on the London
   Underground, the process of identifying some bodies - particularly on
   the deep-lying Piccadilly Line - became very difficult, with some
   families upset by the amount of time it took to confirm a relative had
   died. VeriChip advocates argue it could help in these circumstances. "
