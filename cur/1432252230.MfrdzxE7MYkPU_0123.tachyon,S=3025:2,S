On this topic, I very strongly suggest to people that they not carry on 
conversations on both open lists and moderated lists.

Also, I thought Perrypunks was a "no politics, crypto only" list? 
Debating how to do campaign finance reform is heavily political, and 
very light on cryptography, math, etc.

There are too many loopholes to close.


You also don't address the other point I raised, that if an 
"untraceable campaign contribution system" is in fact unlinkable to the 
donor, then Warren Buffett is able to donate $10 million, all in 
"unlinkable" contributions.

(Nothing wrong with this, of course, but it sure does contradict the 
"only small contributions" intent of the various statist rules about 
campaigns.)

So, why work on a system which is guaranteed to fail, by its nature?

And guaranteed to fail for social reasons, when it is pointed out that 
inner city negroes rarely have access to PCs or digital money systems 
and that the system thus skews toward techies and those with computers?
