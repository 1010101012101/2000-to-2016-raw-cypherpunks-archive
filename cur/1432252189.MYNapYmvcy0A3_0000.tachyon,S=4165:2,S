Actually this is true for most artificial fertilization techniques ---that's
why they implant multiple embroyos, they expect a few to die.

Of course, this is true for natural conception, where a lot of embroyos
are resorbed, probably because they're fatal mutants.

Bingo.

Yes.  My earlier comments on just how wacky the religion is was not
meant to minimize the fed visit.

Agreed.  Query: So if you were on the jury of a kid suing his rogue cloners
for his defects,
how would you decide?   Would the religious aspect affect your judgement of
liability? 
Criminal and/or civil liability?  Can grown kids sue if they find their mother
drank/smoke/snorted/etc and had reason to believe this bad?
