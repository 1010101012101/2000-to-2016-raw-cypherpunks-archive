Perhaps because the system would be easier to implement and much more 
efficient in both space and time.

The idea is to have a division of labor, where the anonymous transport 
layer takes care of the nasty stuff and the application writer has it 
relatively easy.

Consider that even in a blinded note system, the black hats will be 
able to detect that you are making a habit of contacting the note 
server, even if they cannot tell which specific notes you are 
generating.  An anonymous transport layer would help to conceal that as 
well.

It's just a thought.  In programming, laziness is sometimes, but not 
always, a virtue.

By the way, does a working Tarzan library and network even exist right 
now?
