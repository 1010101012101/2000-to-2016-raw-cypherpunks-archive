>Spy Agency Sought U.S. Call Records Before 9/11, Lawyers Say

>June 30 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. National Security Agency asked AT&T
>Inc. to help it set up a domestic call monitoring site seven months
>before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, lawyers claimed June 23 in court
>papers filed in New York federal court.
>
>The allegation is part of a court filing adding AT&T, the nation's
>largest telephone company, as a defendant in a breach of privacy case
>filed earlier this month on behalf of Verizon Communications Inc. and
>BellSouth Corp. customers. The suit alleges that the three carriers,
>the NSA and President George W. Bush violated the Telecommunications
>Act of 1934 and the U.S. Constitution, and seeks money damages.
>
>``The Bush Administration asserted this became necessary after
>9/11,'' plaintiff's lawyer Carl Mayer said in a telephone interview.
>``This undermines that assertion.''
>
>The lawsuit is related to an alleged NSA program to record and store
>data on calls placed by subscribers. More than 30 suits have been
>filed over claims that the carriers, the three biggest U.S. telephone
>companies, violated the privacy rights of their customers by
>cooperating with the NSA in an effort to track alleged terrorists.

>``The U.S. Department of Justice has stated that AT&T may neither
>confirm nor deny AT&T's participation in the alleged NSA program
>because doing so would cause `exceptionally grave harm to national
>security' and would violate both civil and criminal statutes,'' AT&T
>spokesman Dave Pacholczyk said in an e-mail.
>
>U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller and NSA spokesman
>Don Weber declined to comment.
