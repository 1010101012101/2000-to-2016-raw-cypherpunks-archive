They'll have a team of SAS and demographics experts somewhere. Given the 
financial services industry, this could be anywhere from half a dozen to 
several dozen people.

Yes...it's VERY interesting to consider how they are transmitting those 
policy updates. Clearly they have a LAN. Does it use dedicated bandwdith? 
(eg, it's own GbE, for instance) are they in-band with other traffic? (ie, a 
tunneled VPN inside a big GbE?) or are they leveraging some of the unused 
SONET DCC-ish overhead bytes?

The next obvious question could actually cause a knock on the door so I 
won't ask it.
