A better definition of privacy is:

When Mr. GovernmentAgent or Mrs. BusyBody asks, you have the ABILITY to
say yes, no, or bugger off and they have no recourse in the matter but
to involve magistrates.

This is why the ABILITY to look up the information in the face-scanning,
RFID-tracking, Money Monitoring, GPS, Insurance Service Evaluation
system(s) (government or corporate), is an intuitive affront to most
peoples' intuitive sense of what privacy is.

Transmitter is easy to find. Receiver is easy to jam with a micropower
jammer. Sometimes all you need could just be creatively tweaking the
ignition and antenna wiring to get "faulty shielding" in the right
places;
it requires much more experience to make it look "accidental", though.

Matter of time. The next generation of sleuths will be much more tech
savvy than the current one.

> You can call up and find out where your car is.

..eg, in a nameless radio shadow.

Another possible definition is the right to tell the truth and get away
with it.

But both definitions are rather about free speech than about privacy,
but
then we'd get to a fight over definitions which is in this context
better
to leave on the shoulders of people making encyclopedias.
