 Abstract
 The aim of this proposal is to develop new techniques for information
gathering, analysis and modeling of chatroom communications. First, the
investigator and his colleague consider graph-less models to capture the
structure of chatroom communications. In particular, the investigators
study how to develop a multidimensional singular value decomposition
approach for component analysis of chatroom communication data. Second, the
investigators develop new visualisation techniques to display the
structural information found in the first step.

 Internet chatrooms provide an interactive and public forum of
communication for participants with diverse objectives. Two properties of
chatrooms make them particularly vulnerable for exploitation by malicious
parties. First, the real identities of the participants are decoupled from
their chatroom nicknames. Second, multiple threads of communication can
co-exist concurrently. Although human-monitoring of each chatroom to
determine "who-is-chatting-with-whom" is possible, it is very time
consuming, hence not scalable. Thus, it is very easy to conceal malicious
behavior in Internet chatrooms and use them for covert communications
(e.g., adversary using a teenager chatroom to plan a terrorist act). This
project aims at a fully automated surveillance system for data collection
and analysis in Internet chatrooms to discover hidden groups. The
surveillance is done in the form of statistical profiling for a particular
chatter, a group of chatters, or for the entire chatroom. The statistical
profiles are used to devise algorithms to determine chatters and their
partners and answer to queries including (i) "in which chatrooms topic A is
discussed", (ii) "who is chatting about topic A in chatroom X", (iii) "is
topic A is a hot one in chatroom X" etc. Thus, the proposed system could
aid the intelligence community to discover hidden communities and
communication patterns in chatrooms without human intervention.

 This award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community.
The Approaches to Terrorism program in the Directorate for Mathematics and
Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce
development with the potential to contribute to national security.
