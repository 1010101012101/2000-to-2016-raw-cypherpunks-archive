Huh?
What about IPv6?

Also, ex (?) Cypherpunk (?) Adam Shostack has an information security book
hitting the stores, called the New School of Information Security...

http://www.amazon.com/New-School-Information-Security/dp/0321502787/ref=pd_bb
s_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1216462207&sr=1-1.


It seems to be well received. At least, one of the quotes is good:

"Amateurs study cryptography; professionals study economics" (this in the
context of running a corporate security function).

As for the San Fransisco fiberWAN takeover, does anyone know if this network
was purely routed, or did this guy also steal telecom passwords as well?

(I'm interested because TCP/IP management functions are in band, but telecom's
management channel is in the SONET overhead.)
