The rear window had been smashed in when they whacked the cop with the four inch steel pipe, or when they whacked the cop with the two by four timber. so there was no problem with chucking it underhand and sideways.  Plenty of room.  One is naturally inclined to chuck large heary objects in this 
fashion, because it is difficult to sling them overhand.  In order to sling it in frontwards, he would have had to chuck it in one handed, and it was too heavy for that.  In order to chuck it, he needed both hands, and in order to chuck it with both hands, he needed to chuck it sideways.

You try chucking a great big fire extinguisher.  Unless you are Arnold, you will chuck it in the same fashion.
