Maybe I am missing something, but what would be the big deal if NIST 
did take patent claims into account?  There were five excellent 
candidates. If NIST picked Rijndael in part because it least likely 
to be tied up in court for the next N years, does that diminish their 
glory?

Quite right. There is plenty of credit to go around.  I was 
particularly pleased that NIST had the guts to pick a non-U.S. 
design. That's risky in Washington.

P.S. What is the licensing status of the other finalists? For 
example, I seem to recall reading that RC6 would be licensed to the 
public at no charge if it won the competition. What now?
