Back in the early days of the public internet we didn't require any id
to create an account, just that you found a way to pay us. We had
anonymous accts some of whom dropped by personally to pay their bill,
some said hello but I usually didn't know their names and that's how
they wanted it, I'd answer "hello <ACCOUNT>", whatever their login was
if I recognized them. Some mailed in something, a mail order, even
currency tho that was rare but it did happen, or had someone else drop
by to pay in cash (that is, no idea if they were local.)

LEO occasionally served a warrant for information, usually child porn
biz (more than just accessing child porn, selling it) tho I don't
remember any anonymous accts being involved.

I never expected to be held accountable for anyone's behavior unless I
was knowingly involved somehow (just the usual caveat.) LEO never
showed any particular interest in the fact that we were ok with
anonymous accounts. If I was made aware of illegal activities we'd
shut them off, didn't really happen much, maybe some credible
"hacking" complaint on occasion.

It's funny, it's all illusion like show business. It's not hard to set
up anonymous service, crap, just drop in at any wi-fi hotspot, many
just ask you to click that you accept their T&Cs and you're on. Would
they raid them, I was just using one at a major hospital this week
that was just like that, if someone used that for child porn etc? But
I guess stick your nose out and say you're specifically offering anon
accts and watch out I guess.
