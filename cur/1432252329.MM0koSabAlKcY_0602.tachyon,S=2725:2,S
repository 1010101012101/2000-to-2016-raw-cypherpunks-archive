That is untrue.  In fact, RSA was introduced to the wider audience
via Sci Am IIRC.

I disagree.  I think some here --even you-- could write such an article.

Simply state entanglement as a given, much like gravity or maxwell's
electromagnetics, and then explain how its useful.

*Why* and *how* the "givens" are correct is not necessary, perhaps
not even known.  (After all, all physics does bottom out with
phenomenology).
The same is true for explaining symmetric crypto, hasing, or PK ---just
assume a "hard" function, or a "one way trap door function", ignoring
avalanche or the number theory behind it, and go to applications
immediately.

That Sci Am has gotten lefty and soft is regrettable, but don't think
this means
that crypto and QM apps can't be explained to your grandmother.
