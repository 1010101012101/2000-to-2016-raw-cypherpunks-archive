Reading from the Wikipedia's relevant page
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinThread about the software the NSA's
folks was trying to use, it seems much like that today they would be
just making/using a Palantir's plug-in (http://www.palantir.com/) to do
so, connected to the right set of databases .

It would be nice a FOIA request to know which kind software and/or
software manufacturer get used by US Security Agencies in handling
"phone call logs" and/or "email logs" and/or "mobile phone's location
data" .

We may spot the company where are the NSA's whistleblowers of tomorrow ;-)
