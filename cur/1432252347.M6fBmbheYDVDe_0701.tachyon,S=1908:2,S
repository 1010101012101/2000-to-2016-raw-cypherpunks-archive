That might have been me.  I did post about apparently legal ways to 
circumvent such secret warrants but I did not use a BB method but rather 
provide a service where clients can request if a warrant has been served on 
the library or ISP for their account or any account.  The service provider 
is free to reply if no warrant has been received but is muzzled if one has. 
This failure to reply, which is not a positive action, is what reveals the 
warrant.  rsync's approach appears consistent with mine.
