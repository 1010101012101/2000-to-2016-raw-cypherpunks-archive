hmm, a couple of weeks ago, i did a traceroute of my packets while 
running a tor client.  It was 'comforting' to know that my isp was 
courteously operating an exit node...just 1-2 hops away.  Well, i just 
re-started my tor client and the 'problem' went away...i felt like i was 
playing the lotto with my tor client.

what's to stop a group of malloric tor routers from communicating 
out-of-band with each other and with the mallory exit node as an accomplice?

well, users (the humans using the tor client)  have absolutely no idea, 
where those circuits are being switched through.  unless, users take the 
time to trace each http request (each of which go through a different 
circuit)...and also having to do whois queries on each hop.

perhaps a mechanism (maybe a gui console showing each hop, ip and whois 
query ) for users to monitor the circuits that their tor client has chosen.
This will give users awareness (or the option to exercise that) about 
the confidentiality of their communications.
