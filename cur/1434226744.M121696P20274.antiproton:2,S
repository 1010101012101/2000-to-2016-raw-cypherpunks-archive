No way yet to tell what really happened in these "massive breaches."
Accounts vary from initial reports, to later reports, to investigations,
to hearings, interlaced with remediations of various alleged iterations,
leading in most cases to claim the full story cannot be revealed due
to possible harm by disclosure. And best, the favorite runaround:
the usual suspects are named without evidence, indeed, assessments
are shaded with the customary claims by the usual experts consulted,
"it is  hard to tell who did it" and not only that evasion but the best and
brightest security wizards (there are six of them named, 2 for, 2 against
2 undecided) who disagree on not only who did but what to do about
breaches, whether they are breaches or malfunctions or publicity stunts
or fund-raisers, hair-raisers, fear-raisers, TED talks, rigged hearings
testimony (hearing testifiers are 2 for, 2 against, 2 undecided).

Reportedly, cybersec market to increase to $130B by 2020 if not sooner.
This increasingly generates more breaches, more massive, more ritual
for, against, undecided.

This cascading chaos was invented by six cypherpunks, each of
them for, against, undecided. Then as now, certain, uncertain,
confused about everything and nothing and whatever. No wonder
the media follows that leadership, copies its methodology, denies
feeding the trolls.
