None. But I think both terms are easily misunderstood - in most cases we can
analyze the local time behavior of differential equations based on steady
state assumptions. However, global properties of the system, like
unconditional stability, cannot. I think most of what a layperson knows
about economics is based on the former while the latter is a specialty to
chaos theorists.

Cellular automata are nice and well understood. But isn't this quite a leap
from analytic treatment to the direction of numerical simulation? Not that
there's anything wrong with that, but to me some of the theoretical
questions (like the question of fundamental stability) really seem to live
more in the domain of equations.
