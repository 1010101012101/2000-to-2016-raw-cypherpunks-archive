Doesn't have to be overnight. It would be already enough to arm the pilots
and issue an SOP to lock the doors before the plane starts rolling, and
keep them locked until the plane stops. But this means depriving the
pilots of stewardess company in flight, and installing toilets in the
cockpits, so it's a hard one.

Well, the next one is synchronous-release nerve gas in the subway rush
hour, a big stadium, or a nuke in Manhattan. Kinda difficult to achieve
enough scale otherwise using biological agents. You need a lot of
weapon-grade stuff, or get lucky to achieve sustainable burn within a
high-density high-interaction area, which restricts you to very exotic
agents. Doesn't appear very likely.
