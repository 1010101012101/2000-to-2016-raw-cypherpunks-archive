Am I the only one delighting in the irony of someone using the name Orwell 
having no better writing skills than to rely on repetitive phrases in an 
attempt to brainwash us into thinking that Herr May is the enemy?

I realize the traditional Internet way to deal with these fools is to ignore 
them, but perhaps pointing out the humorous side helps make this junk a 
bit easier to read.  Or am I also the only one finding it difficult to believe 
that the Cypherpunks lists have been besieged by those attempting to make 
a case of state-sponsored censorship?  Sure, Jody went away and eventually 
one can suspect that George will too, but does it matter that they go away 
when they're replaced by those with the same agenda?

Cypherpunks don't write as much code as they used to (and hey, I still use 
LCM PRNG's because they're sufficient for my needs), but the lists also 
serve as an example of the Cypherpunk ideals regarding privacy, free speech,
 and anonymity.  Not just technical discussions about how to achieve and 
protect these ideals, but discussions that show the need for them.  Perhaps 
it has been realized that it's not the tools that are a danger to those 
in power, but the ideas that lead to a desire for them.  

It's always been easy to complain that law enforcement, politicians, and 
other state workers don't understand crypto, but one needs to consider that 
it's not crypto itself that's important, it's the ideas that need to be 
protected using crypto that are important.   Sure, protecting the right 
of people to speak out against their unelected totalitarian government seems 
like a justifiable high-minded use of crypto compared to protecting the 
rights of a cranky neo-anarchist from California, but isn't the whole point 
supposed to be that it's not what's being protected that's important, just 
that it can be protected?

Has Tim suddenly changed in some way to have recently become so dangerous 
that he must be attacked from the left to expose his evil right-wing thoughts? 
 Or is this part of a campaign to demonstrate the danger inherent in the 
popular use of crypto by linking it to the dangerous thoughts of one man? 
 What ideas will be declared dangerous next, and what people will be used 
to demonstrate that danger?

I don't claim there's a conspiracy, I merely point out that those who attack 
Tim's dangerous thoughts are also attacking crypto.  Whether it's an intentional 
organized activity or merely the knee-jerk responses of children hiding 
being "proper ideology", the result is the same.  Jim Bell's dangerous ideas 
have resulted in his freedoms and property being confiscated, and no doubt 
there are those who would wish the same for Tim.  To the spectators: beware 
Tim May and his dangerous ideas, because if his ideas are dangerous, so 
are yours.

Here's to being dangerous.
