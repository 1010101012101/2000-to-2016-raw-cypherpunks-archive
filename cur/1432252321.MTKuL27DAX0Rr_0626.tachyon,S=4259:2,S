    legislation to grant police unprecedented eavesdropping powers that
    would automatically expire in two years.

    Leaders of the House Judiciary committee have crafted a new
    anti-terrorism bill, called the Patriot Act, that includes nearly all
    the surveillance abilities requested by President Bush -- but with a
    sunset date of Dec. 31, 2003. A vote on the bill is expected this
    week.
