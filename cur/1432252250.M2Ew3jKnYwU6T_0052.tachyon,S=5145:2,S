I've appraised the Waco scenario more than most.  You might want to 
do a little digging before you trumpet the statist line.  I don't
know if you're a US citizen Reese, but owning firearms in Texas is
not a reason to burn and gas people alive.  Go get informed.

Unlikely.  My guess is that his so-called record, while not stellar A+
NRA material, is certainly a lot better than most.  He is almost certainly
telling Feinswein exactly what she wants to hear.  His most egregious 
downfall is his position on the drug war.  This is the most critical of
all positions and the one that the media is curiously un-interested in.
