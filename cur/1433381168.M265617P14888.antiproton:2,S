Yes, as you said to Juan: "Talking about childhood brings out my inner
anarchist." And I'm not very hopeful about the future. I don't know what
else to say, so I'll quote from "Dead Flag Blues" by Godspeed You! Black
Emperor:

| the car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
| and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
| and a dark wind blows
|
| the government is corrupt
| and we're on so many drugs
| with the radio on and the curtains drawn
|
| we're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
| and the machine is bleeding to death
|
| the sun has fallen down
| and the billboards are all leering
| and the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
