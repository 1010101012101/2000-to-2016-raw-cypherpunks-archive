Jon, first of all thank you for your extremely thoughtful note.

I suspect that we will find that we don=E2=80=99t actually disagree about m=
uch, and also my previous rant was driven by the general anger and frustrat=
ion that all of us are experiencing. That is, I amy have been misdirecting =
my anger at the whole situation at you, a fellow victim.

I would put it more strongly than that. I think that NIST needs to be punis=
hed. Even if Dual_EC_DRBG were their only lapse, any entity that has allowe=
d themselves to be used that way should be forced to exit the business of b=
eing involved in making recommendations on cryptography. I don=E2=80=99t ha=
ve to think that they are bad people or even that they could have prevented=
 what happened. But I think there needs to be an unambiguous signal to ever=
y other (potential) standards body about what happens if you even think of =
allowing for the sabotage of crypto.

I imagine that everyone is looking at public protocols for picking curves n=
ow. Everyone is looking at how every step in the establishment of a recomme=
ndation can be made provably transparent. That is all a good thing, and it =
does require that NIST pay dearly. But it isn=E2=80=99t a trust issue. I do=
n=E2=80=99t =E2=80=9Ctrust=E2=80=9D the NIST less than I trust any other st=
andard=E2=80=99s body. The need to be put out of the crypto business as a s=
ignal and deterrent to others, but not because they are inherently less tru=
stworthy.

But not using AES is a protest that hurts only ourselves. It doesn=E2=80=99=

Agreed.

 is *empty* or *mere* trust-building,

I still think the term is appropriate, and indeed I think that your sentenc=
e about conscience and emotions actually reinforces my claim that it is the=
ater. But I think that it is largely a definitional question which isn=E2=
=80=99t worth pursuing. I=E2=80=99m using the term in a slightly different =
way than you are.

be right for you and vice-versa.

Absolutely! Although I still stand by my =E2=80=9Csecurity theater=E2=80=9D=
 statement, I think I also mean it less pejoratively than it came across. A=
nyone (including me and the company that I work for) who has moved to 256 b=
it symmetric keys is engaging in =E2=80=9Csecurity theater=E2=80=9D in my s=
ense of the word. It=E2=80=99s nothing to be particularly proud of, but it =
doesn=E2=80=99t make us the TSA either.

Yep. And (sadly) that has go. As I said, they need to pay a heavy price so =
that it is absolutely clear that some behaviors are beyond the pale.

> A good standard, however, is not necessarily the *best*, it's merely agre=
ed upon.

That=E2=80=99s true.


>  I think Twofish is a better algorithm than Rijndael.

OK. I was flat out wrong. I was ignorant of your longstanding view of ciphe=
rs. I=E2=80=99m not competent to really have an opinion about whether your =
judgement is correct there, but that isn=E2=80=99t relevant. I thought Twof=
ish was pulled out of a hat. I was wrong. And I also apologize for accusing=
 you of pulling Twofish out of hat.

> ZRTP also has in it an option for using Skein's one-pass MAC instead of H=
MAC-SHA1. Why? Because we think it's more secure in addition to being a lot=
 faster, which is important in an isochronous protocol.=20

I agree that if you are changing ciphersuites, it=E2=80=99s as good a time =
as any to move to a SHA-3 candidate. And as there some questions that need =
to be answered about official SHA-3, I=E2=80=99m happy with Skein. Again, I=
=E2=80=99m not competent to judge the relative merits of SHA-3 candidates.

> Silent Phone already has Twofish in it, and is already using Skein-MAC.

Ah. So yes, we are in very different starting places. Your choice seems ver=
y reasonable.

> In Silent Text, we went far more to the "one true ciphersuite" philosophy=
=2E I think that Iang's writings on that are brilliant.=20
>=20
> As a cryptographer, I agree, but as an engineer, I want options.

I think I am in a different position. I=E2=80=99m neither an engineer nor a=
 cryptographer. I=E2=80=99m the guy who can kinda sorta read bits of the cr=
yptography literature and advise the engineers on what to do with respect t=
o using these tools. And what we decide affects the security of a very larg=
e number of users. So for me, the =E2=80=9Cone true ciphersuite=E2=80=9D no=
tion was ideal. I could pay attention and follow the consensus advice.  You=
 may be competent to, say, pick Skein over Blake for some particular purpos=
e, but I=E2=80=99m not. And I don=E2=80=99t want to have to make those choi=
ces.

Not only is it that I don=E2=80=99t want to make such choices, but you shou=
ldn=E2=80=99t want me to either. You don=E2=80=99t want me and zillions of =
application developers to be making such choices. So the loss of =E2=80=9Co=
ne true ciphersuite=E2=80=9D. Think about it, it=E2=80=99s taken a decade t=
o get typical application developers to understand that for many purposes y=
ou can=E2=80=99t just use SHA1, but you need to contain it in HMAC. Now the=
y are going to have to unlearn that for the new class of hash algorithms.  =
If we are forced from the Eden of one true ciphersuite, we may end up with =
people who really aren=E2=80=99t competent to judge picking algorithms out =
of a hat.

So, I guess that some of my frustration that I=E2=80=99m taking out in vari=
ous directions is rooted in that. Expelled from the paradise of one true ci=
phersuit, I have the responsibility to choose between the good and the bad =
didn=E2=80=99t get enough to eat from the tree of knowledge.


> One True Suite works until that suite is no longer true, and then you're =
left hanging.

Yep. I was certainly aware of the risks, but I guess I took a bit of a CYA =
approach. If people spent enormous amounts of money building certain things=
 into chips, they surely would have investigated very carefully before maki=
ng such a commitment. (I should say that it really isn't CYA; I want to mak=
e the best choices for our customers. I also am intensely curious about thi=
s stuff, even if I=E2=80=99m not a cryptographer by any means.)

> Now let me go back to my comment about standards. Standards are not about=
 what's *best*, they're about what's *agreed*, and part of what's agreed on=
 is that they're good enough. When one is part of a standards regime, one s=
ublimates one's personal opinions to the collective good of the standard.

Yes. I fully agree. And I agree that there were things that went into the s=
election of Rijndael that may not be what I would chose. I fully get that. =
But having been selected more than a decade ago, AES has been subject to fa=
r far more scrutiny than anything else. As a consequence, I think that the =
gap between our understanding of AES and the NSA=E2=80=99s is smaller than =
the gap for lesser studied ciphers. So I=E2=80=99m not talking about follow=
ing the standard as soon as the winner is declared, but the benefits of it =
having been the standard for so long decrease my uncertainty about it.


> That collective good of the standard is also "security theatre" in the se=
nse that one uses it because it's the thing uses to be part of the communit=
y.

I can see how that might be the case under an even looser definition than I=
 was using, but I=E2=80=99m not really buying it in this case.=20

> I think Twofish is better than AES. I believe that Skein is better than S=
HA-2. I also believe in the value of standards.

Acknowledged. I had misjudged your motivations, and in a fairly insulting w=
ay. I appreciate the grace in your response.=20


> The problem one faces with the BULLRUN documents gives a decision tree. T=
he first question is whether you think they're credible. If you don't think=
 BULLRUN is credible, then there's an easy conclusion -- stay the course. I=
f you think it is credible, then the next decision is whether you think tha=
t the NIST standards are flawed, either intentionally or unintentionally; i=
n short, was BULLRUN *successful*. If you think they're flawed, it's easy; =
you move away from them.

My take is that BULLRUN was successful in parts. I=E2=80=99m not sure wheth=
er the count Dual_EC_DRBG as a success or not, as problems with it were dis=
covered early. It stank from the outset and BULLRUN just confirmed that the=
 stink had a nasty source. Leaving RSA Inc aside, no one really needed to c=
hange ciphersuites. Yet it was that revelation that sent me reeling. So the=
 question which other standards *could* they have gotten away with subverti=
ng. Quite simply not everything has the kind of math that Dual_EC_DRBG has =
and not everything has the same =E2=80=9Cgaps=E2=80=9D in the history of wh=
ere certain things come from.

You seem to be suggesting that if BULLRUN was successful anywhere, then it =
was successful everywhere (and they tried it with everything). Furthermore,=
 at least with AES, you seem to be assuming that if BULLRUN was successful =
in a case in 2006, then it was also done successfully before 2001.

And so when looking at which things I need to move away from, I have to jud=
ge the risks that they=E2=80=99ve been compromised in light of all of the i=
nformation that we have. The new information was confirmation that at least=
 after 2001, the NSA was willing and able to subvert at least one NIST cryp=
tographic standard. I have to integrate that piece of exceedingly distressi=
ng news in light of everything else we know about the things I rely on.

And so this is what we rely on: AES, SHA-2, and the (alleged) CSPRNGs in co=
mmercial operating systems.

Looking at those realistically, my energies haven=E2=80=99t been focused on=
 looking for replacements for AES and SHA2, but how to deal with potentiall=
y malicious CSPRNGs from Apple and Microsoft.  So my focus on improving key=
 generation against undetectably malicious CSPRNGs.=20

> The hard decision is the one that comes next -- I can state it dramatical=
ly as "Do you stand with the NSA or not?" which is an obnoxious way to put =
it, as there are few of us who would say, "Yes, I stand with the NSA." You =
can phrase less dramatically it as standing with NIST, or even less dramati=
cally as standing with "the standard." You can even state it as whether you=
 believe BULLRUN was successful, or lots of other ways.

I=E2=80=99m sorry, but that I have to reject. That is an all or nothing abs=
olutism that I not only think is wrong, but is pernicious. =E2=80=9CIf you =
don=E2=80=99t take my position on all things that have come out of NIST you=
 are a stooge for the NSA=E2=80=9D. I really don=E2=80=99t think that is so=
mething you want to be saying.

> Moreover, it's not all-or-nothing. Bernstein and Lange have been arguing =
that the NIST curves are flawed since before Snowden. Lots of people have b=
een advocating moving to curve 25519. I want a 384-or-better curve because =
my One True Curve has been P-384.

Ah. Good. You are not taking an all-or-nothing position. I seem to have mis=
read something then. I concur about P-384. Were we using elliptic curves, I=
 would be advocating the same move.


> If I'm going to move away from the NIST/NSA curve (which seems wise), wha=
t about everything else?

This isn=E2=80=99t a philosophical or judgement difference between us. It=
=E2=80=99s just a technical starting place, but

cket, where they've been *alternates* in my crypto going back years. They'r=
e even in part of the software, sublimated to the goodness of the standard.=
 The work is merely pulling them to the forefront and tying a bow around it.

OK. You have persuaded me that you are making the right choice for your sit=
uation.


> And absolutely, this is an emotional response. It's protest. Intellectual=
ly, I believe that AES and SHA2 are not compromised. Emotionally, I am angr=
y and I want to distance myself from even the suggestion that I am standing=
 with the NSA. As Coderman and Iang put it, I want to *signal* my fury. I a=
m so pissed off about this stuff that I don't *care* about baby and bathwat=
er, wheat and chaff, or whatever else. I also want to signal reassurance to=
 the people who use my system that yes, I actually give a damn about this i=
ssue.

So do I. So do I. I am furious. And I want to let the world know. And most =
importantly, I want to do what I can to make sure that nothing like this ha=
ppens again. I wrote at top what kind of signal I think is needed for that.

> I admire your cool head,

Don=E2=80=99t mistake it for lack of anger.

> but I have to stand over there. I apologize for angering you, but I'm not=
 sorry.

No apology needed. And I once again apologize for thinking and saying that =
you made your ciphersuite choices naively. And again, thank you for this di=
scussion.

Cheers,
