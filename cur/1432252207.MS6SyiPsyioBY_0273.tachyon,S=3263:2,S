Amie,

In case you haven't seen them, there are many companies making land drones
bristling
with guns.  For instance, Foster-Miller:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster-Miller_TALON

Do an image search for SWORDS; their business model seems to be to put
every kind of gun they can think
of on the platform.  iRobot and others have similar initiatives.

Future coastal RNCs will also doubtlessly deploy USVs:

That said, as the Tampa Trib has learned, there is often a great distance
between demo videos, press
releases, and a weaponized drone-in-the-wild.  F-M and iRobot are
"respectable" Route 128
businesses, though, with military contracts, so they are worth following.
