Yes, I am. One legitimate function of government is to limit the
concentration and power of wealth, and ameliorate impacts on others.
Society needs concentrated wealth, of course. But concentrated wealth
tends to subvert government, in ways that support further concentration.
The US crapped out in about 1870.

I don't know. But it doesn't scale well. Even with adequate site
security and logistics, and adequate funding, there are too many
assholes that need killing. And I worry that it would be gamed.

Bottom line: I don't believe that we can get there from here.

With prevailing surveillance and general cluelessness, AP sites would be
honeypots.

It's about killing the "ten to twenty percent of folks who can't mind
their own business" and who are committed to being right. But of course,
he's being ironic.
