Pinochet was not a fascist, not a totalitarian, and murdered only two or 
three thousand.  Any communist ruler that murdered so few would be hailed 
as a living saint and the moral equivalent of Ghandi.  Franco was a 
fascist, a totalitarian, but milder than most fascists, and most fascists 
are milder than most communists.  Franco only murdered fifty to a hundred 
thousand, which would not quite qualify him for sainthood if he was a 
communist, but close enough.

Only if you define socialism as war.  Socialist famines are usually imposed 
once the proletariat have been completely disarmed, and all resistance has 
been shattered.  The Ukrainian famine, the hungry ghosts famine, and the 
recent North Korean famine are all good examples of such famines.

Socialist famines are incomparably more severe and prolonged than war 
famines, the two greatest famines of the twentieth century being the 
liquidation of the kulaks, and the hungry ghosts.

Socialist famines are in a sense caused by war, in the sense that socialism 
tends to be unending war against a disarmed and already conquered populace.

So let us go back to the original question:  Where was there a significant 
twentieth century famine other than those caused by war or socialism?
