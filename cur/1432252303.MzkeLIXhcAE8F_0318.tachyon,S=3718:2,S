The wonderful KDE2 Browswer 'Konqueror' loaded it with no
problems.  Of course it was being pounded heavily, but it
did eventually come up.

BTW: If you get a chance to install Linux Mandrake 7.2 distribution,
I highly recommend KDE2.  Despite a few remaining bugs Konqueror is
the browser so many of us waited for from the Mozilla group, but never
received.  

ObCrypto: Konqueror implements full SSL with client-side certs
and its Cryptography configuration dialog allows fine-grained control
over crypto settings (as well as displaying transforms currently in use).
