All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally open
source. Presenters must be one of the active developers of the code in
question. We emphasize that demonstrations be of *working* code.

Sponsorship:

If your organization is interested in sponsoring CodeCon, we would love to
hear from you. In particular, we are looking for sponsors for social meals
and parties on any of the three days of the conference, as well as
sponsors of the conference as a whole, prizes or awards for quality
presentations, scholarships for qualified applicants, and assistance with
transportation or accommodation for presenters with limited resources. If
you might be interested in sponsoring any of these aspects, please contact
the conference organizers at codecon-admin@codecon.org.

Press policy:

CodeCon strives to be a conference for developers, with strong audience
participation. As such, we need to limit the number of complimentary
passes for non-developer attendees. Press passes are limited to one pass
per publication, and must be approved prior to the registration deadline
(to be announced later). If you are a member of the press, and interested
in covering CodeCon, please contact us early by sending email to
press@codecon.org. Members of the press who do not receive press-passes
are welcome to participate as regular conference attendees. Questions:

If you have questions about CodeCon, or would like to contact the
organizers, please mail codecon-admin@codecon.org. Please note this
address is only for questions and administrative requests, and not for
workshop presentation submissions.
