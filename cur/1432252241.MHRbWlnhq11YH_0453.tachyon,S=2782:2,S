What's missing from the inventory is material which would
disclose other ongoing investigations.

And how to tell which material is of genuine interest and 
which is listed for camouflage. The public docs never 
disclose everything but are often used to misinform.

Jim is being used as bait. Whether he knows that doesn't 
matter.

To ponder: How long has he and AP been used for bait?

"I love this list."
