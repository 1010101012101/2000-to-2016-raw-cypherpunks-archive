Yes that IS the choice.  This is not a logical fallacy.  This is the real
choice real people have to make every day.  "Changing the system" is not an
individual option.  Right now, in the real world, prisoners have to decide
whether they are going to be "hard cases" and staying in the joint or of
"going along" and getting out sooner, albeit on parole.  Eliminating parole
should be the LAST thing done to reform the system.  Anything else merely
compounds the evil.

I'll go a bit further.  To the extent a libertarian society had prisons, I
think there would--and should--be a system of parole (i.e., "conditional
release") to help released inmates re-enter society.
