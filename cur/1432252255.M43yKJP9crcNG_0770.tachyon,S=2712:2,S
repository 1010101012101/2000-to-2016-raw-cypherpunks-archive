Heh.  Having seen Tim's property, at the edge of a fairly high hill,
that'd be a pretty entertaining freeway....


More to the point, if Tim wanted to rent his spare bedroom to somebody,
there'd be a whole raft of constraints and requirements.
I have one friend whose agreement with his housemate was that
she wasn't a tenant paying rent, because then he'd be a landlord
being regulated and paying income taxes - instead she was a housemate
paying her (large) fair share of the utilities, maid service,
maintenance, swimming pool cleaning, etc.


				Thanks!
