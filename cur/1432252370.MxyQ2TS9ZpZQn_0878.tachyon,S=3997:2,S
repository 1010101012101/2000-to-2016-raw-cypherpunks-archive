The more common British term is "in hospital".  I don't recall
ever hearing anyone say "at hospital".

There are innumerable small distinctions in usage .  If you are 
in hospital, you are ill, not a member of the staff.  

Your being ill may the result of an injury.  That is, the same
term covers both sicknesses and injuries.  If you are in hospital

If you are sick, on the other hand, it means that you have vomited.

They aren't equivalent at all.  In the UK [young] children go to 
"school" and "college" generally refers to something very roughly

to school, they tend to be offended, thinking you are poking fun at 
them.  Taking the mickey, that is.
