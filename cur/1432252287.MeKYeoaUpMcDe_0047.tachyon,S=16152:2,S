Immigration Policy re 6 Stipulations, A Christian Nation, Multi-Culturalism

Dear Friends and subscribers to the Anti-Immigration Email list, 

I am opposed to the massive waves of immigrants that our national immigration policy is currently allowing. Why? Because we are being overwhelmed by such large numbers of immigrants and they are not joining our churches and they are not melting into our Christian culture. 

Friends, my highest goal is that we remain a Christian nation with liberty and justice for all. The Bible states that "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty." I believe that the source of America's greatness and the source of America's wealth and the source of America's liberties is The Gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe that if America continues down the path to secularization and rejection of God, then we will lose our freedoms, lose our prosperity, suffer great tribulation, become slaves and ultimately be destroyed as a nation. Taking all of this into consideration I am not opposed to reasonable but much smaller numbers of immigrants who meet the following list of stipulations. 

First, I would demand that potential immigrants read, write and speak English proficiently at least at a 6th grade level. Rigorous tests should be designed and administered at American Embassy’s for the purpose eliminating applicants who do not know how to read, write and speak English proficiently.

Second, they must be "selected" or chosen from the upper income and or more highly educated classes in the nation that they hail from. Why? Because we want our immigration policy to strengthen our nation and thus we want ONLY the best intellectuals and most successful types of people to be eligible for immigration into America.

Third potential immigrants must either be well educated and have a useful University degree in a field such as medicine or engineering, or else they must have a high level of skill in an employable field such as engine repair, carpentry or plumbing. Potential immigrants must, for example, be computer programmers, electrician's or have some other such skill that is useful and makes them employable in the American economy. 

Fourth I would demand that they have an American sponsor who is reasonably financially successful and could support them during their transition to self reliance. 

Fifth, I would make them and their family ineligible for any kind of government benefits, whether welfare and or social security, Medical care, housing allowance, food stamps, University or college scholarships from any government supported agency of any kind until they have lived and worked in America for at least 21 years. 

Sixth and most important of all, I would demand that in order to be eligible to obtain a visa to emigrate to America that potential immigrants must be a "Christian," any kind of "Christian." Using and defining the term "Christian" in the broadest sense possible. Potential Immigrants must Orthodox, Anglican, Catholic or Protestant, or even members of western "Christian" cults such as the Morman church or Jehovah Witness'es.  Potential immigrants must prove this with documentable evidence of faithful membership in such a church in their own nation for at least 10 years prior to their application to emigrate to America. 

Muslims, Buddhists, Hindi's, Taoist's, Ba'hai's, Pagan's, Wiccan Witches or those who practice Witchcraft or Shamanism, Atheists, Agnostic's and all members of all other manifestly non-Christian religions should be absolutely, permanently and strictly denied any and all rights to emigrate to America. 

Friend, Will you agree with me that we want our immigration policy to make our nation stronger, not weaker? 

Will you agree with me that anti-Christian Multi-culturalism is weakening our nation? 

Will you agree with me that our immigration policy has to be modified, because as it currently stands it is harming more than it is strengthening our nation? 

Please open your spiritual eyes and observe the wisdom of what I am proposing. I want to make America stronger because I believe that a strong America is a benefit to advancing the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Can you imagine the wonderful implications for the Gospel of Jesus Christ if America were to grow stronger and stronger and wealthier in comparison to the nations of the world and if America at the same time became a more moral and more righteous and thoroughly Christian nation. Can you imagine how our missionaries in other nations would be benefited if America became a strong, righteous, moral, exceedingly wealthy and militarily dominant nation? 

Friend, are you in agreement with me? Do you agree with me that we need a drastic and immediate change in our immigration policy in America? Can you see how important it is to keep America strong? Can you see how our enemies have been using immigration policy to weaken our nation and turn us further away from Christ? 

I am sincerely yours, Bob from Michigan.

Note from moderator of Anti-immigration list:  

In Quebec Canada there are two groups of people who hate each other. The French and the English. Why do they hate each other? One reason, the diffence in their language and culture. 

In the article below we see another example of multi-culturalism NOT working. Where? In Mexico. 

The root word of culture is CULT. The word cult refers to a religion. (Remember, one man's cult is another man's religion). Liberals in America and around the world are forcing Multi-culturalism upon the western nations. Let me say in no un-certain terms, WE DO NOT WANT MULTI-CULTURALISM. Multi-culturalism is a recipe for disaster. 

Multi-culturalism means that Christianity will no longer be the dominant religious group in Western nations. Multi-culturalism means that western nations will be subdivided into tiny little groups that all hate one another. Multi-culturalism means that western nations will be Balkanized into tiny subdivided religious groups, ethnic groups and language groups which are forever warring with each other over the monetary crumbs from the socialist government nipples. 

We must stop immigration now or America may very well likely be forever changed for the worse. 

It is a fact that immigrants are far more likely to vote for the Liberal candidate who is promising to give him free education, free health care and free everything. This is how America is going to be destroyed and turned into a socialist slave state if we do not get our immigration policy under control. 

In the past, our strength as a nation was our homogeneity, our shared religion, shared language and shared culture. Wake up your friends. Ask people to join this email list. Sincerely Yours, Bob from Michigan.]

Persecution of Evangelicals Continues in Mexico

By Allie Martin and Jim Brown

(AgapePress) - Local authorities in three small towns in different Mexican states are telling evangelical Christians to change their religion to traditional Catholicism or suffer severe consequences.

Evangelical Christians who do not renounce their faith are being threatened with jail time, expulsion, the removal of public services such as water and drainage, and even death.

In one case, two recent converts were jailed for 36 hours and asked to deny their new evangelical Christian faith.

Terry Madison is president of Open Doors, a ministry which tracks the persecution of Christians. He says this is not a new problem.

"This has been an ongoing challenge in Chiapas, where when people accept the Lord they choose not to participate in some of the local Catholic celebrations, many of which involve 'posh,' which is a locally fermented drink," Madison says. "They choose not to participate, which means they're not buying the candles and the costumes and the fireworks, and some of the other products that some of the local authorities profit by, so there's an economic loss."

Madison says things are particularly bad for evangelical Christians in the state of Chiapas. "A particular community had 230 evangelicals. We're talking about a large body of Christ," he says. "Another had forty Christian church members who were challenged to renounce their evangelical faith and return to Catholicism or they would face having their homes burned and their animals destroyed."

In another example of intolerance, The Alabama Baptist newspaper reports Catholic leaders in San Nicolas, Mexico, a town of some 4,000 people, are telling 36 evangelical families they must leave town within 90 days "or be kicked out." The paper says the families' water and sewer services have been cut off.

A San Nicolas spokesperson is quoted as saying, "What the town wants is for the evangelicals to stop spreading their religion to more people and to stop having their meeting."

Patrick Scully, a spokesman for the Catholic League, said he couldn't comment on the story because he was not aware of the details and also since the persecution is taking place outside the United States.

Religious Jews in Israel are Anti-immigration, Jews in USA pro-immigration
 
NOTE FROM MODERATOR: I have a question for your consideration... Why do the religious Jews in Israel oppose immigration laws that will increase diversity? And why do Jews in the USA support immigration laws in America to "increase diversity"? The religious Jews in Israel are strongly Anti-immigration. The Jews in America are strongly Pro-immigration. Why? 

If it is a good policy for Jewish Israel to oppose the immigration of non-Jewish immigrants, why isn't the same policy, opposing non-Christian immigrants, also good for Christian America? Do I sense some hypocrisy or double standards here?

See article below:

Israelis Debate Immigration Laws
By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer

JERUSALEM (AP) -- The bedrock of the Jewish state-a law that grants
Israeli citizenship to anyone with a Jewish grandparent-is coming 
under the harshest attack in years, amid allegations it has enabled hundreds
of thousands of non-Jews to immigrate.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews, with the support of some government officials,
proposed this week that the Law of Return be tightened. "Even sacred
cows are slaughtered sometimes," Rahamim Malul, a lawmaker from the
religious Shas party, asserted Monday.

Prime Minister Ehud Barak staunchly opposes restricting immigration,
angrily insisting at a Cabinet session Sunday that the law would not 
be amended as long as he is prime minister.

The debate reflects the disagreement between secular Zionists and
observant Jews about what Israel should look like. For the religious,
the most important value is to preserve the Jewish character of 
Israel, while Zionists believe immigration should be encouraged at all costs.
The recent debate was triggered by figures showing that non-Jews
outnumbered Jews, 55 percent to 45 percent, among immigrants from the
former Soviet Union in the first three months of 1999.

Rabbis have complained that the influx of non-Jews has led to a
proliferation of butcher shops selling pork, despite religious laws 
that prohibit Jews from eating it. Others warn that non-Jews from the 
former Soviet Union, estimated at 225,000 of Israel's 6 million citizens, are
amassing increasing political clout.

"The loopholes in the law must be closed," warned Malul, "so that the
state will not turn into a country where a large percentage of its
citizens are gentiles."

The Law of Return was conceived five decades ago, when Israel was a
poor, besieged, fledgling nation where survivors of Holocaust-ravaged
Europe and Jews from Arab countries sought shelter.

Now that Israel is a prosperous country with a per capita income on a
European scale, some fear non-Jews from economically depressed areas 
may be lured by generous government benefits for newcomers.

Faced with the statistics, officials in the Ministry of Immigrant
Absorption have drawn up a proposal for restricting non-Jewish
immigration. It aims at reducing the number of non-Jewish descendants
who can gain automatic citizenship because of a distant Jewish 
ancestor. 

However, ministry spokeswoman Michal Aharoni said the proposal "will
never be the policy of the ministry." The minister for immigrant
absorption, Yuli Tamir, opposes restrictions on immigration.

Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said the Law of Return is the basis of the
Jewish state, offering a home to Jews "in the wide definition and not
the narrow religious definition."

Under religious law, a person is a Jew if his mother is Jewish. The 
Law of Return recognizes a much wider category as eligible for 
citizenship.

Ramon said experience shows that even those who are technically
non-Jewish "become good Jews in a few years."

Yet even some immigrants from the former Soviet Union feel it is time 
to make changes. Yuri Stern, a member of parliament from Israel 
Beiteinu, a party representing the immigrants, said those with no link to the 
Jewish people must be stopped from immigrating.

Though his party stands to benefit from additional immigrant votes, Jewish or not, Stern warned that Israel could face a demographic problem if no changes are made.
