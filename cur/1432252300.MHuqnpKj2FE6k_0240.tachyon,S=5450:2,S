That was also my first thought.

In Afghanistan, for example, out Iyad illegal to run voice or SMS gateways
due to telco restrictions (and probably others). Until last year this made
running SMS projects legally very difficult because the telcos didn't have
good facilities for interfacing with small contractors, among other things.
