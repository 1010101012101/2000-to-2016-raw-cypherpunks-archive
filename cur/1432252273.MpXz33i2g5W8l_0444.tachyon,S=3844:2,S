The usual arrangement is that some jurisdictions will allow one free 
false alarm per specified time period and then start charging.  The 
costs typically range from $25-50 on average.

My home system doesn't ring into the police as I consider that akin 
to inviting vampires into your home.  My system rings my pager when 
an intrusion is detected plus I have 24-7 IR video surveillance on my 
exterior and a couple choice locations interior.
