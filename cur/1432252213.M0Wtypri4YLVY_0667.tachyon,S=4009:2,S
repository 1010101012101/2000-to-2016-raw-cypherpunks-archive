At least one of the propaganda articles said the kill mechanism was to
make a hole in the hull near the fuel tank.   High albedo may help the
missile here as well as the warhead, though it's probably harder
to deploy decoys at launch and boost phase than re-entry.

The primary purpose of demos is to create public pressure
to get increased funding, plus to remind the public that we still have a 
nuclear-war-industrial-complex that's Protecting Our Country Against Somebody,
so in case EastAsia ever becomes a credible threat to Oceania,
Our Brave Military will have the infrastructure to do something about it.

Meanwhile of course, any foreign terrorist that wants to nuke the US
with a physically small weapon only needs to pack it in cocaine
and bring it in with the regular shipments, 
while Rogue Nations that can only make large Fat Boy style weapons
need cruder methods, like bribing a crane operator to load the wrong
container on a ship bound for New York or Los Angelese harbor.
