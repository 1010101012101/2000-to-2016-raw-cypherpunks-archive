Robert Windrem, national security correspondent for NBC,
reported on July 12 about Jeffrey Richelson's new book,
"The Wizards of Langley," on the CIA's deceptive technologies:

  http://www.msnbc.com/news/599637.asp

Blurb: "Intelligence historian Jeffrey Richelson's
latest book focuses on four decades of innovation 
and inside  secrets at the CIA's Directorate of 
Science and Technology."

Windrew describes one deception involving a faked
satellite failure which apparently deceived Soviet
experts but not amateurs who track sats.

Publication date of Richelson's book is August 3 but
copies are available early.

MSNBC offers an informative series on "The Secret
Empire: The U.S. Military in the 21st Century," which
provides uncommon technological critique of the
tools of war and espionage and their piggish industries.
Far superior to the fluff being peddled by the agencies and
their puff-ball hosts.

Windrem is alleged to be the first to report on Echelon
by name, purpose and field stations and fed earliest stuff 
to Duncan Campbell. He may someday republish his NBC 
reports of decades past on national security that are no 
longer available.
