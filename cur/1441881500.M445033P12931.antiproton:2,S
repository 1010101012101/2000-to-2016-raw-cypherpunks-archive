If its only about politics, why add to the monotonous brain-rot drivel.

Cypherpunks list covers politics and everything else, without
chopping up into marked-up and branded packages: politics,
civil liberties, NSA, crypto, privacy, online diddly. each with its
own political agenda, lobbyists, PACs, Dear Leaders, bribery,
followers, deranged oligarchs. Sure, cypherpunks suffers from
the same diseases as politics but, praise the holy founders,
suffers them all at once, not piecemeal, so develops anti-bodies
for all of them, to send the worms and germs to fight it out on
monodrone-weakened corpuses.

Finally, last two hours of a question soon over, cypherpunks
has gone through a long list of failures due to politics rising to
the surface as if that's all there is worth cut-throating about.
Offshoots have been set up to avoid politics as a topic, or
some other forbidden fruit iconizing a moderator's tits and ads.

 From those cpunk-siphoning Ashley Madisons have come weirdly
deformed creatures and mindsets, missing some capabilities,
overloaded with others -- evolving into the frankensteins of
secretkeeping, thematic dwarfs and thuggish giants, you might
say, like politicians and their sharks, press agents, campaign
and polling leeches determined and amply paid to make
politics the premier gobbler of subscribers' beliefs and fellow
soldiers of murderous religion.
