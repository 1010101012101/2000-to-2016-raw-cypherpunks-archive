Horizontally directional perhaps not but vertically is a possibility.  By 
this I mean an omni antenna with gain, like a stacked dipole.  What this 
means is antenna with gain in all compass points but with a flat 'pancake' 
vertical profile.  In many driving situations the hot spot is likely to be 
within 10 degrees of horizontal. They are commonly used in commercial TV 
and radio broadcast.   I think its possible to get 6 or more db gain this 
way with a small antenna.  6 db effectively doubles your range.
