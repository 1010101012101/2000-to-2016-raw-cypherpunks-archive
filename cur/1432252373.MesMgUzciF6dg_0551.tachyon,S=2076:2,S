I'm no big fan of science by press release, but when's the last time you 
heard of anyone saying "Well, we looked at our security situation, and two 
teenagers with bottle rockets could set this thing off.  That's why the CEO 
has decided to move out of town."  The usual response after you've pointed 
out a devastating attack on someone's system is "yeah, but who'd think of 
that" or "but you're being unrealistic--real attackers will do this other 
thing (that we just happen to have defended against) instead."
