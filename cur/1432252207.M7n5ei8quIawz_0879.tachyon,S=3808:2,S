A 2-mile wide cloud is WAY too big to be caused by a single explosion, 
unless REALLY big. The forest fire claim sounds more plausible in this 
regard. An existing cloud could be used for masking, though.

But a surface or atmospheric blast would produce a flash plowing through 
the entire EM spectrum; from long-wave radio to microwaves to hard gamma. 
That's something the satellites Up There can't miss even through a smoke 
cloud - at least if they are still operational or replaced by newer ones. 
(Remember the strong flashes of gamma bursts, originally discovered by 
satellites observing the nuclear test ban: 
<http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast19sep97_2.htm>.) Also a 
disruption of this kind would be perceivable in long range, possibly by 
quite many people.

An underground blast, if not screwed up, wouldn't produce a cloud at all.

However, both surface and underground blast would have a peculiar seismic 
signature. There is a network of both nonproliferation-surveillance and 
plain old scientific seismic stations all over the world. Something like 
that couldn't stay hidden for too long. Remember the day the the Kursk 
submarine became famous; the recording of the double signature, the 
explosion and shortly later following implosion, appeared online in couple 
days (or maybe even hours?) after the Event. It's difficult to imagine a 
true nuclear blast would stay unreported for more than few days. Even if 
it would really be a nuke test and the politicians would want to be quiet 
about it, there are too many subjects outside of the direct US political 
control to either report the measurements or the eventual pressure to not 
report them.

According to CNN, there was also a strong blast reported in the area of a 
missile base. We don't know how strong the blast was, and if it couldn't 
be just a "conventional" explosion, caused by eg. a combination of a 
forest fire and an ammo depot.

There is also a possibility the "senior officials with access to 
intelligence" were injecting media with false information. Remember there 
are many subjects with different agendas here and a little psyops here and 
there is quite common.

Let's not jump on the conclusions yet. Wait 2-3 days, optionally watch the 
traffic in conferences of geologists taking care of the seismic activity 
worldwide and in the vicinity of the area of interest. It's Saturday and 
many people who could know the answers are away from their instruments; 
let's wait what they will find on their screens on Monday morning.
