DOWNLOAD YOUR OWN CONCRETE eSLIDE RULE

"How many Software engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb? - None,
it is a hardware problem!"

Being a former Civil Engineer, I was never too far from dirt, stone,
concrete, and rebar.  Somewhere along the line, I transitioned into the
CLEAN environment of electrical engineering, and eventually the STERILE
environment of computers.

Now I've worked with some very good computer people, but I must say there is
a certain "gulf" between the computer screen and my former occupation.
Perhaps that gulf is where all those dot-coms got lost ;>)

I find myself trying to fill that gulf, with something a little more...
well... concrete.

Well, at any rate, here is my offering.  We have this really cool concrete
SoftSlide at:

http://www.softslide.com/volumes/v4/t5/p1/page.htm.

Try it for free, and if you want a custom one for your company - let me
know.  We do them up on custom printed mini-CDs, or as a download from your
site.

We are the only ones who make these - we invented them.  And you are one of
about 200 people we mailed this message to.

I hope you find the SoftSlide useful, and perhaps entertaining.  Oh... and
be sure to "right-click" on it!

Kind regards,

Rod Spencer
