This is a silly, naive view of things. First, the concept of 
"privilege" is one of those lefty, cockeyed notions the liberals use to 
vaguely imply that success in life is due to "privilege."

Second, though I strongly disagree with the Second Iraq War, nothing 
that happens there has anything substantive to do with economic success 
and "money, power" for anyone I know. Our "money, power" comes from 
work, investments, high tech, etc.

I have no idea if you are really the Third World mutant you usually 
come off as being, but you really need to get out more.
