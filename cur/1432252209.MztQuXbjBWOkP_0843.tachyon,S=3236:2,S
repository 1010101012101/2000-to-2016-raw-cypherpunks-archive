Not of a hell of a lot with PC keyboards.

1. You can epoxy shut the keyboard itself so it can't be opened.
But, they can tap the cable, or get another keyboard of the same brand
and epoxy it shut the same way you did.

2. If you protect the cable as well, they can use a keyboard capture
program, or they can tempest detect your keystrokes.

3. Further, the usual trick is to hide a pinhole camera above where your
keyboard is (ceiling tiles usually), so you'd have to sweep for cameras.

It's not a pretty situation.
