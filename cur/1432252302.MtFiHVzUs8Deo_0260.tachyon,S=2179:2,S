You also had to look at what they were up against.  Witness the complete
massacre at Isandlwana (the classic Zulu bull-and-horns overran the
British camp because the troops were too far away from their ammunition
to resupply, no doubt copying Elphinstone's tactic in Afghanistan) vs.
post-Isandlwana use of Gatling batteries and massed field artillery 
(some of which was converted Naval artillery), e.g. Ulundi, where 
post-battle reports were of piles of Zulu dead mown down by Gatlings.

The British only thought that the Zulus were just semi-naked savages 
until Isandlwana.
