The last laugh may be from the lawsuits. Yahoo reports "hundreds" of 
people reporting sickness, blah blah, from contact with the debris. 
Almost certainly all either bullshit or sympathetic magic, but the 
obvious result of the news outlets widely reporting "the space debris 
may make you very sick!"

Some fraction actually think they are sick, some fraction hope to share 
in a possible payout of billions by a backed-into-a-corner space 
agency, and some very, very tiny fraction may have actually touched 
some component which made them slightly ill.

Dumb fucks, all.
