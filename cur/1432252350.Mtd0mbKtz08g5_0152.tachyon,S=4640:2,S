Read the article. Of course the time is well known, and the logs
are stamped. You are naive, though, if you beleive that will stop
an LEA from trashing the lives of innocents...

...and of course they'll get away with it.

[Now, I'm not excusing the FBI's jackboot tactics in this case,
but I will point out that Mr. Salomon poked at 'unusual' ports,
and zone transfered yankee.com during his investigation. An
IDS might well trigger an attack alert under those conditions.
The government's theft of his property after all this was 
explained, is of course inexcusable.]
