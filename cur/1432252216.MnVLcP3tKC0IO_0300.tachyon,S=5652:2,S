   No matter what sort of architecture one chooses for long term key
   protection it is inevitably going to fail once some threshold
   fraction of the system fails.  With a simply multiple copies system
   you have to have 100% failure, but such a system has poorer security
   properties.  K-of-N threshold schemes fail once you've lost N-(K+1)
   shares but generally have much better security.  It is my
   understanding that Verisign have multiple HSMs for the root and they
   simply go out of their way to keep them very safe.  At nCipher our
   critical keys (such as firmware signing keys) are distributed using a
   threshold scheme and we have procedures in place to periodically
   check the integrity of each share (though never checking more than
   one at a time).

   As far as I know there are no active commercial key escrow services
   around.  One problem is that the half-life of Internet companies is
   short compared to the time people seem to want to keep their keys so
   it would be hard to trust such a company unless it was very carefully
   set up.

   Cheers,
   	Nicko
