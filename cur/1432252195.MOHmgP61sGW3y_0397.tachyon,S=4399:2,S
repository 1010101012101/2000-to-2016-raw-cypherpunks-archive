The ballot form was used in past elections, CNN reported today. The 
ballot was published in newspapers, to let people familiarize 
themselves with its form. And the head of the voting commission, who 
approved the ballot's final form, is a Democrat.

Ballots are often of different forms. Sometimes a mechanical punch is 
used, sometimes a Number 2 pencil, sometimes a pen.

There cannot be a re-vote of the County, or even of the entire State, 
as this would distort the forces acting on the electorate in a way 
never seen before. The Palm County voters would know _they_ would be 
electing the next president. Billions of dollars would be spent 
trying to buy each and every voter.

And there is no precedent for using "statistics" by Democrat 
consultants to propose that votes be Buchanan be assigned to Gore. So 
Gore won't get those votes, and there won't be a County-wide revote.

(If there is, I'll help in rigging the dynamite truck .)
