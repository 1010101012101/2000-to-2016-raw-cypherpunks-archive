FPGAs will have very hard time to be as fast as "dedicated" CPUs, 
frequency-wise. The FPGA structures have to be too generic, and are much 
bigger than specialized structures of the CPUs, so they have higher 
capacity, which limits the maximum achievable switching frequency. The 
length of the wiring between the structures together with the lazy speed 
of light plays its role as well. However, the FPGA structure allows 
parallelizing of processing tasks, which can in some cases neatly beat the 
sequential CPUs.

There are FPGAs with on-chip RISC CPU cores, allowing reaping the benefits 
of both architectures in a single chip.
