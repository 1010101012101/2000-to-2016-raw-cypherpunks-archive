Good point - I've played with dyes (histology work)
but not DMSO.  I guess your entire body would 
glow under UV :-)

Actually UV flourescent dyes might not be so good, 
since an application of SP50 sunscreen might stop 
them from showing.

But I have no doubt that a  semi-permanent dye mark
can be engineered. It only has to resist removal for
about 12 hours.
