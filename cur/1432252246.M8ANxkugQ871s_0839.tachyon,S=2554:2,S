   from the now-this-is-a-good-use-of-engineering dept.
   [1]HTS Member writes "California has a new excuse for more taxes.
   Claiming losses due to fuel-efficient cars, such as Gasoline/Electric
   Hybrids, California is cooking-up a new system to punish people who
   aren't using enough gasoline. They want to [2]tax commuters by the
   mile. How would this be accomplished? By requiring everyone to install
   a GPS device in their vehicle, and charge them their "taxes" every
   time they fuel-up. From the article: 'Drivers will get charged for how
   many miles they use the roads, and it's as simple as that.. [a] team
   at Oregon State University equipped a test car with a global
   positioning device to keep track of its mileage. Eventually, every car
   would need one.'"
