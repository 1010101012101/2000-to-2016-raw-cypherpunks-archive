BTW, I wasn't arguing it is "better" nowadays; I'd think the kilowatt-hour
(aka joules) would be more useful today.  I was thinking about
how the use of inert metals (etc) arose historically.  At first
the 'trust' was minimal and it was a 1:1 trade for the more portable
gold.

Also why it was available to cavemen, and why it was shiny,
which was attractive.

Isotopically pure gold :-) 

Watts are 'uniform'; so is an N% solution of ethanol (if you
want to put your joules in your car, etc.)

They sleep with you because of your large cattle herd only they
have accepted abstracted value and settle for gold or stocks...
