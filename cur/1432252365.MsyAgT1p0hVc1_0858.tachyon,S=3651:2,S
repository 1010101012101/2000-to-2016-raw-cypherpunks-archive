Could we move into the current time zone for a moment? Thanks. Now 
re-read what was written there... Got the words? Good, now try to 
understand the meaning of those words, done? Okay. Now try to

Yes? Perfect.

way the US is saying one thing and doing the other without trying to 
point at someone who is worse.
