First it was the Internet, now it's TV.  Geesh, haven't these guys ever
heard of short-wave?  All that Bin Laden has to do is broadcast the words,
"Allah akbar" and his operatives execute "Plan A," "inshaalha" and they
execute "Plan B," "Bert & Ernie" and they execute "Plan C."  They don't need
American TV, folks.  (Reminds me of the aliens in INDEPENDENCE DAY, using
our communications satellites...)
