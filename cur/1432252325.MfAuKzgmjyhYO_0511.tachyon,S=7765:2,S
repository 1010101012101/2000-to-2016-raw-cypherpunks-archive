Why not ask IRS Agent Jeff Gordon to be your guest speaker? The Feds
are certain to have someone in attendance.

During today's opening remarks by the prosecution (took almost an hour),
we learned that the Feds had an agent who infiltrated Bell's common
law court and was far more active than Bell, voting to convict Janet
Reno in absentia etc. The same guy also appeared to infiltrate the
Libertarian Party of Washington state. Cypherpunks and AP play a key
role of the government's case, with Tim May and Eric Hughes being
mentioned, and this is just Day One.

Don't mean to tease, more on this after I finish my writeup.
