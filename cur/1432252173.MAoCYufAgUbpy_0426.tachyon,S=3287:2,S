Speak for yourself. :-).

They're also called checks payable to cash. Even Travellers' Checks.
:-).

You just redeem them and "deposit", without reissuing like you would
normally do on every transaction.

Remember the *asset* is held in bearer *form*. There are no accounts
required to execute/clear/settle the transaction. However a
*certificate* representing ownership of that asset is
redeemed/reissued on every transaction to prevent double spending and
guarantee that the asset is now in the control of the
certificate-holder.

For instance, if someone does a transaction offline, stuff like
Chaum's m-of-n where m=n=2 thing is supposed to un-blind a signature
in the case of double spending, but the underwriter can't be expected
to be liable anything. He just says, "here's the signature that
double spent. The 'train-locker' is empty. Thank you for playing. You
might consider doing your transactions on-line from now on."

BTW, I forwarded a link to something from Nick Szabo about tickets
(but not necessarily access control) within the last week or so. I
didn't read it closely, but you may find it interesting.

Cheers,
RAH
