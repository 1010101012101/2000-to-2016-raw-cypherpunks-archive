| What technology is available to create a 2048-bit RSA key pair so that:

| 1 - the randomness comes from quantum noise
| 
| 2 - no one knows the secret part,
| 
| 3 - The secret part is kept in the "box" and it is safe as long as the box is physically secured (expense of securing the box is a don't care).
| 
| 4 - "box" can do high-speed signing (say, 0.1 mS per signature) over some kind of network interface
| 
| 5 - you can reasonably convince certain people (that stand to lose a lot and have huge resources) in 1, 2, 3 and 4.
| 
| 6 - The operation budget is around $1m (maintenance not included).
| 
| 7 - attacker's budget is around $100m
| 
| 8 - the key must never be destroyed, so backup is essential.
| 
| In other words, convincing translation of a crypto problem into physical security problem.

Look at NCipher, and host in the Bunker.
