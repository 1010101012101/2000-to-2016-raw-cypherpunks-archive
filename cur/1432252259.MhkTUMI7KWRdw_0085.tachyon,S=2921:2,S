The Isreali's are showing incredible restraint? I agree, any country that
makes it illegal to fly ones own national flat in ones own front yard is
truly showing incredible restraint. Any country that uses tanks and attack
helicopters to keep control of other peoples land is showing incredible
restraint.

The Isrealis are a bunch of fucking fascist who are out to steal other
peoples land by killing them.

Hell if the Isreali's had one speck of human dignity and compassion they'd
agree to Jerusalem being an open city and allow it to represent both
religions.

Neither side is 'right' in this until both sides can see a way to live
next door to each other and share their commen heritage.
