i like to think you don't need any bats at all; waging direct lethal
violence against the largest and best equipped military in the world
(esp. adding up police, swat, n.guard, military, etc) fuels their
propaganda machine and gets you crushed like an ant under foot.

bomb throwers and assassins get no sympathy from the public no matter
justified your perceived grievances.

cutting at the heart of this nation-scale responsibility diffusion
machine requires taxing communication and commerce engines which make
its very existence possible.  this tax is applied in the form of
continued and targeted infrastructure disruption against those
entities which are refusing and deflecting oversight and
accountability for their actions, and all those who serve them
directly or indirectly.

punks with portable saws and thermic lances slicing fiber and junking
equipment is much more palatable to the public when used against
entities already perceived unpopular and abusive to fundamental
rights.  we've already talked about data mining and critical
infrastructure analysis to direct such attacks in the most effective
manner possible.

although somehow i think this will get you a more severe response than
killing random yes men (despite the fact this is limited to property
damage alone).

hmmm, the information required to organize such efforts would be a
good fit for the blacknet.
