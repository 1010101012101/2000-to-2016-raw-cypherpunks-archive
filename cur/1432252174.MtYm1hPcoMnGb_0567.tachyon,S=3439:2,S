Actually the scheme described based on Chaum's talk (corrected for
probable typos) is essentially what you describe in your paper as the
Type II Defence, in section 5.  Your analysis shows that it is not
vulnerable to marking and is anonymous.

Speaking of anonymous, you should give credit in your paper to Anonymous
for discovering the possibility of marking Lucre coins, in a coderpunks
posting at
http://www.mail-archive.com/coderpunks@toad.com/msg02186.html, and for
inventing the Type II Defence, both in the posting above and amplifed
at http://www.mail-archive.com/coderpunks@toad.com/msg02323.html.

It may seem pointless to credit anonymous postings, but it makes the
historical record more clear.
