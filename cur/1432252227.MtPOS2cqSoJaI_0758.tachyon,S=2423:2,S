Please pass to anyone who is thinking about booking a holiday in Europe.

I would like to introduce my new web site to you, my house in North France sleeps up to 10 people.

It is very close to St.Michel and the WWII Normandy landing beaches.

Please visit http://lomas.chat.ru for more information.

Why look through brochures when you can browse completely freely?
