Sociocultural Implications of Biometrics

The Army is considering how it can use biometric systems -- automated 
methods of authenticating an individual based on physical or behavioral 
characteristics -- to improve security, efficiency, and convenience. 
Recognizing that biometrics is not without controversy, however, the Army 
asked RAND's Arroyo Center to assist in an assessment of the legal, 
sociological and ethical implications. A new publication reports the 
findings. http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1237/


Privacy and Emerging Technologies

A recent RAND conference, sponsored by the Arroyo Center, looked at the 
question of how emerging technologies such as biotechnology, computer 
monitoring, and overhead imaging impact privacy and privacy policy. The 
conference drew leading scholars, government officials, privacy advocates, 
journalists, attorneys, technologists, and industry representatives.

Modernizing the National Imagery and Mapping Agency

Over the past year, RAND has provided staff and analytic support to the 
Independent Commission on the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. (See 
related article.) Recently, Kevin O'Connell, Manager of RAND's Intelligence 
Community program, testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence on the findings and recommendations of the commission.
