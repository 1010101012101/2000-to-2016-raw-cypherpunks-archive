Shanghai strives to monitor internet bars

www.chinaview.cn 2004-09-14 10:02:41



    BEIJING, Sept.14 (Xinhuanet) --  Shanghai will invest 7 million yuan,
or nearly 850,000 US dollars, to monitor internet bars. The monitoring is
also aimed at keeping underage youngsters away from the bars.



    The government will supervise the operations of nearly 1400 bars to
make sure they don't stay open past the official closing time of midnight.
China Radio International reported Monday.

     The monitoring is also aimed at keeping underage youngsters away from
the bars.

     The government will foot the bill for the monitoring, which is
estimated to be around 2.58 million yuan, or 312,000 US dollars a year, but
bars will face stiff penalties if they break the law.

     Central government regulations limit internet bars to opening only
between 8:00am and 12:00 midnight.

     The monitoring will be in place by the end of the year.
