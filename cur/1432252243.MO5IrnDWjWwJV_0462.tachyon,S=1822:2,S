How well is VoIP going to work over SSL/TLS (ie, TCP) though? I've never used
any VoIP-over-TCP software before, but some people I know who have say it sucks
(terrible latency, sometimes as bad as 5-10 seconds). That may have just been
an artifact of a bad implementation, though. DTLS might be a better pick for
securing VoIP. There's also SRTP.
