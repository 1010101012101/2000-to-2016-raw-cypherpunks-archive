"Domestic Bioterrorism(tm)" is scarier.  The media has learned a long
time ago that if you frighten people and appeal to the fear/threat portion
of their natures that they will buy more papers, watch your news programs,
and be led by the nose into giving up whatever rights and property
demanded by those in power.

Of course in Congress they think "Domestic Bioterrorism" is the day the
maid serves the chicken sushi with sun-ripened mayonaise for lunch.
