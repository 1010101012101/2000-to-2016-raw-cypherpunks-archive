So now that the hunt is officially off.

It truly is a shame that the media is not all over this. Once again we see
the coporate media covering for their boy W.

*******************

But for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or
banned weapons, they're wrong, we found them. George W. Bush, President
Interview with TVP Poland 5/30/2003

We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud Condoleeza Rice, US
National Security Advisor CNN Late Edition 9/8/2002

How the United States should react if Iraq acquired WMD. "The first line
of defense...should be a clear and classical statement of deterrence--if
they do acquire WMD, their weapons will be unusable because any attempt to
use them will bring national obliteration." Condoleeza Rice, US National
Security Advisor January/February 2000 issue of Foreign Affairs 2/1/2000

We are greatly concerned about any possible linkup between terrorists and
regimes that have or seek weapons of mass destruction...In the case of
Saddam Hussein, we've got a dictator who is clearly pursuing and already
possesses some of these weapons.. A regime that hates America and
everything we stand for must never be permitted to threaten America with
weapons of mass destruction. Dick Cheney, Vice President Detroit,
Fund-Raiser 6/20/2002

Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of
mass destruction. Dick Cheney, Vice President Speech to VFW National
Convention 8/26/2002

There is already a mountain of evidence that Saddam Hussein is gathering
weapons for the purpose of using them. And adding additional information
is like adding a foot to Mount Everest. Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary
Response to Question From Press 9/6/2002

Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for
the production of biological weapons. George W. Bush, President Speech to
UN General Assembly 9/12/2002

Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons, and is rebuilding the
facilities used to make more of those weapons. We have sources that tell
us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use
chemical weapons -- the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not
have George W. Bush, President Radio Address 10/5/2002

The Iraqi regime . . . possesses and produces chemical and biological
weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. We know that the regime has
produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas,
sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. George W. Bush, President Cincinnati, Ohio
Speech 10/7/2002

And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities
that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. George W.
Bush, President Cincinnati, Ohio Speech 10/7/2002

After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions,
inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam
Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his
capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a
nuclear weapon. George W. Bush, President Cincinnati, Ohio Speech
10/7/2002

We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet
of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse
chemical or biological weapons across broad areas George W. Bush,
President Cincinnati, Ohio Speech 10/7/2002

Iraq, despite UN sanctions, maintains an aggressive program to rebuild the
infrastructure for its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile
programs. In each instance, Iraq's procurement agents are actively working
to obtain both weapons-specific and dual-use materials and technologies
critical to their rebuilding and expansion efforts, using front companies
and whatever illicit means are at hand. John Bolton, Undersecretary of
State for Arms Control Speech to the Hudson Institute 11/1/2002

We estimate that once Iraq acquires fissile material -- whether from a
foreign source or by securing the materials to build an indigenous fissile
material capability -- it could fabricate a nuclear weapon within one
year. It has rebuilt its civilian chemical infrastructure and renewed
production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin,
and VX. It actively maintains all key aspects of its offensive BW
[biological weapons] program. John Bolton, Undersecretary of State for
Arms Control Speech to the Hudson Institute 11/1/2002

Iraq could decide on any given day to provide biological or chemical
weapons to a terrorist group or to individual terrorists,...The war on
terror will not be won until Iraq is completely and verifiably deprived of
weapons of mass destruction. Dick Cheney, Vice President Denver, Address
To Air National Guard 12/1/2002

If he declares he has none, then we will know that Saddam Hussein is once
again misleading the world. Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing
12/2/2002

The president of the United States and the secretary of defense would not
assert as plainly and bluntly as they have that Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction if it was not true, and if they did not have a solid basis for
saying it Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Response to Question From Press
12/4/2002

We know for a fact that there are weapons there. Ari Fleischer, Press
Secretary Press Briefing 1/9/2003

I am absolutely convinced, based on the information that's been given to
me, that the weapon of mass destruction which can kill more people than an
atomic bomb -- that is, biological weapons -- is in the hands of the
leadership of Iraq. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader MSNBC Interview
1/10/2003

What is unique about Iraq compared to, I would argue, any other country in
the world, in this juncture, is the exhaustion of diplomacy thus far, and,
No. 2, this intersection of weapons of mass destruction. Bill Frist,
Senate Majority Leader NewsHour Interview 1/22/2003

The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought
significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources
tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes
suitable for nuclear weapons production. George W. Bush, President State
of the Union Address 1/28/2003

Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials
to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent.
George W. Bush, President State of the Union Address 1/28/2003

We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass
destruction, is determined to make more. Colin Powell, Secretary of State
Remarks to UN Security Council 2/5/2003

There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the
capability to rapidly produce more, many more. And he has the ability to
dispense these lethal poisons and diseases in ways that can cause massive
death and destruction. If biological weapons seem too terrible to
contemplate, chemical weapons are equally chilling Colin Powell, Secretary
of State Addresses the U.N. Security Council 2/5/2003

We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi
field commanders to use chemical weapons -- the very weapons the dictator
tells us he does not have. George W. Bush, President Radio Address
2/8/2003

In Iraq, a dictator is building and hiding weapons that could enable him
to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world -- and we
will not allow it. George W. Bush, President Speech to the American
Enterprise Institute 2/26/2003

If Iraq had disarmed itself, gotten rid of its weapons of mass destruction
over the past 12 years, or over the last several months since (UN
Resolution) 1441 was enacted, we would not be facing the crisis that we
now have before us . . . But the suggestion that we are doing this because
we want to go to every country in the Middle East and rearrange all of its
pieces is not correct. Colin Powell, Secretary of State Interview with
Radio France International 2/28/2003

I am not eager to send young Americans into harm's way in Iraq, or to see
innocent people killed or hurt in military operations. Given all of the
facts and circumstances known to us, however, I am convinced that if we
wait, a threat will continue to materialize in Iraq that could cause
incalculable damage to world peace in general, and to the United States in
particular. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Letter to Future of Freedom
Foundation 3/1/2003

Iraq is a grave threat to this nation. It desires to acquire and use
weapons of mass terror and is run by a despot with a proven record of
willingness to use them. Iraq has had 12 years to comply with UN
requirements for disarmament and has failed to do so. The president is
right to say it's time has run out. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader
Senate Speech 3/7/2003

So has the strategic decision been made to disarm Iraq of its weapons of
mass destruction by the leadership in Baghdad? . . . I think our judgment
has to be clearly not. Colin Powell, Secretary of State Remarks to UN
Security Council 3/7/2003

Getting rid of Saddam Hussein's regime is our best inoculation. Destroying
once and for all his weapons of disease and death is a vaccination for the
world. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Washington Post op-ed 3/16/2003

Let's talk about the nuclear proposition for a minute. We know that based
on intelligence, that [Saddam] has been very, very good at hiding these
kinds of efforts. He's had years to get good at it and we know he has been
absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we believe he
has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons. Dick Cheney, Vice President
Meet The Press 3/16/2003

Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that
the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal
weapons ever devised. George W. Bush, President Address to the Nation
3/17/2003

The United States . . . is now at war "so we will not ever see" what
terrorists could do "if supplied with weapons of mass destruction by
Saddam Hussein." Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Senate Debate
3/20/2003

Well, there is no question that we have evidence and information that Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical particularly . .
. all this will be made clear in the course of the operation, for whatever
duration it takes. Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing 3/21/2003

There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of
mass destruction. And . . . as this operation continues, those weapons
will be identified, found, along with the people who have produced them
and who guard them. General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief Central
Command Press Conference 3/22/2003

One of our top objectives is to find and destroy the WMD. There are a
number of sites. Victoria Clark, Pentagon Spokeswoman Press Briefing
3/22/2003

I have no doubt we're going to find big stores of weapons of mass
destruction. Kenneth Adelman, Defense Policy Board member Washington Post,
p. A27 3/23/2003

We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and
east, west, south and north somewhat. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of
Defense ABC Interview 3/30/2003

We simply cannot live in fear of a ruthless dictator, aggressor and
terrorist such as Saddam Hussein, who possesses the world's most deadly
weapons. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Speech to American Israel
Political Action Committee 3/31/2003

We still need to find and secure Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
facilities and secure Iraq's borders so we can prevent the flow of weapons
of mass destruction materials and senior regime officials out of the
country. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Conference 4/9/2003

You bet we're concerned [concerned that those weapons might have been
shipped out of the country]about it. And one of the reasons it's important
is because the nexus between terrorist states with weapons of mass
destruction ... and terrorist groups -- networks -- is a critical link.
And the thought that ... some of those materials could leave the country
and [get] in the hands of terrorist networks would be a very unhappy
prospect. So it is important to us to see that that doesn't happen. Donald
Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Conference 4/9/2003

Obviously the administration intends to publicize all the weapons of mass
destruction U.S. forces find -- and there will be plenty. Robert Kagan,
Neocon scholar Washington Post op-ed 4/9/2003

I think you have always heard, and you continue to hear from officials, a
measure of high confidence that, indeed, the weapons of mass destruction
will be found. Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing 4/10/2003

But make no mistake -- as I said earlier -- we have high confidence that
they have weapons of mass destruction. That is what this war was about and
it is about. And we have high confidence it will be found. Ari Fleischer,
Press Secretary Press Briefing 4/10/2003

Were not going to find anything until we find people who tell us where the
things are. And we have that very high on our priority list, to find the
people who know. And when we do, then well learn precisely where things
were and what was done. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Meet the
Press 4/13/2003

I have absolute confidence that there are weapons of mass destruction
inside this country. Whether we will turn out, at the end of the day, to
find them in one of the 2,000 or 3,000 sites we already know about or
whether contact with one of these officials who we may come in contact
with will tell us, ``Oh, well, there's actually another site,'' and we'll
find it there, I'm not sure. General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief
Central Command Fox New 4/13/2003

We are learning more as we interrogate or have discussions with Iraqi
scientists and people within the Iraqi structure, that perhaps he
destroyed some, perhaps he dispersed some. And so we will find them.
George W. Bush, President NBC Interview 4/24/2003

There are people who in large measure have information that we need . . .
so that we can track down the weapons of mass destruction in that country.
Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Briefing 4/25/2003

We'll find them. It'll be a matter of time to do so. George W. Bush,
President Remarks to Reporters 5/3/2003

I'm absolutely sure that there are weapons of mass destruction there and
the evidence will be forthcoming. We're just getting it just now. Colin
Powell, Secretary of State Remarks to Reporters 5/4/2003

We never believed that we'd just tumble over weapons of mass destruction
in that country. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Fox News Interview
5/4/2003

I'm not surprised if we begin to uncover the weapons program of Saddam
Hussein -- because he had a weapons program. George W. Bush, President
Remarks to Reporters 5/6/2003

U.S. officials never expected that "we were going to open garages and
find" weapons of mass destruction. Condoleeza Rice, US National Security
Advisor Reuters Interview 5/12/2003

I just don't know whether it was all destroyed years ago -- I mean,
there's no question that there were chemical weapons years ago -- whether
they were destroyed right before the war, (or) whether they're still
hidden. Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, Commander 101st Airborne Press Briefing
5/13/2003

We said all along that we will never get to the bottom of the Iraqi WMD
program simply by going and searching specific sites, that you'd have to
be able to get people who know about the programs to talk to you. Paul
Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense Interview with Australian
Broadcasting 5/13/2003

Before the war, there's no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical. I expected them to
be found. I still expect them to be found. Gen. Michael Hagee, Commandant
of the Marine Corps Interview with Reporters 5/21/2003

It's going to take time to find them, but we know he had them. And whether
he destroyed them, moved them or hid them, we're going to find out the
truth. One thing is for certain: Saddam Hussein no longer threatens
America with weapons of mass destruction. George W. Bush, President Speech
at a weapons factory in Ohio 5/25/2003

Given time, given the number of prisoners now that we're interrogating,
I'm confident that we're going to find weapons of mass destruction. Gen.
Richard Myers, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff NBC Today Show interview
5/26/2003

They may have had time to destroy them, and I don't know the answer.
Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Remarks to Council on Foreign
Relations 5/27/2003

For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass
destruction (as justification for invading Iraq) because it was the one
reason everyone could agree on. Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of
Defense Vanity Fair interview 5/28/2003

The President is indeed satisfied with the intelligence that he received.
And I think that's borne out by the fact that, just as Secretary Powell
described at the United Nations, we have found the bio trucks that can be
used only for the purpose of producing biological weapons. That's
proof-perfect that the intelligence in that regard was right on target.
Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing 5/29/2003

We have teams of people that are out looking. They've investigated a
number of sites. And within the last week or two, they have in fact
captured and have in custody two of the mobile trailers that Secretary
Powell talked about at the United Nations as being biological weapons
laboratories. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Infinity Radio
Interview 5/30/2003

You remember when [Secretary of State] Colin Powell stood up in front of
the world, and he said Iraq has got laboratories, mobile labs to build
biological weapons ...They're illegal. They're against the United Nations
resolutions, and we've so far discovered two...And we'll find more weapons
as time goes on. George W. Bush, President Press Briefing 5/30/2003

It was a surprise to me then -- it remains a surprise to me now -- that we
have not uncovered weapons, as you say, in some of the forward dispersal
sites. Believe me, it's not for lack of trying. We've been to virtually
every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and Baghdad, but
they're simply not there. Lt. Gen. James Conway, 1st Marine Expeditionary
Force Press Interview 5/30/2003

Do I think we're going to find something? Yeah, I kind of do, because I
think there's a lot of information out there. Maj. Gen. Keith Dayton,
Defense Intelligence Agency Press Conference 5/30/2003

Q: The fact that there hasn't been substantial cache of weapons of mass
destruction -- is that an embarrassment? Wolfowitz: No. Is it an
embarrassment to people on the other side that we've discovered these
biological production vans, which the defector told us about? Paul
Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense CNN Interview 5/31/2003

This wasn't material I was making up, it came from the intelligence
community Colin Powell, Secretary of State Press Briefing 6/2/2003

We know that some of them, especially the biological weapons, were being
destroyed," Hastert said, adding that it would "take a little while to
find weapons of mass destruction... and we're going to continue to do it.
Dennis Hastert, House Speaker R-IL Press Briefing 6/4/2003

We recently found two mobile biological weapons facilities which were
capable of producing biological agents. This is the man who spent decades
hiding tools of mass murder. He knew the inspectors were looking for them.
You know better than me he's got a big country in which to hide them.
We're on the look. We'll reveal the truth George W. Bush, President CAMP
SAYLIYA, Qatar 6/5/2003

I would put before you Exhibit A, the mobile biological labs that we have
found. People are saying, "Well, are they truly mobile biological labs?"
Yes, they are. And the DCI, George Tenet, Director of Central
Intelligence, stands behind that assessment. Colin Powell, Secretary of
State Fox News Interview 6/8/2003

No one ever said that we knew precisely where all of these agents were,
where they were stored Condoleeza Rice, US National Security Advisor Meet
the Press 6/8/2003

What the president has said is because it's been the long-standing view of
numerous people, not only in this country, not only in this
administration, but around the world, including at the United Nations, who
came to those conclusions...And the president is not going to engage in
the rewriting of history that others may be trying to engage in. Ari
Fleischer, Press Secretary Response to Question From Press 6/9/2003

Iraq had a weapons program...Intelligence throughout the decade showed
they had a weapons program. I am absolutely convinced with time we'll find
out they did have a weapons program. George W. Bush, President Comment to
Reporters 6/9/2003

The biological weapons labs that we believe strongly are biological
weapons labs, we didn't find any biological weapons with those labs. But
should that give us any comfort? Not at all. Those were labs that could
produce biological weapons whenever Saddam Hussein might have wanted to
have a biological weapons inventory. Colin Powell, Secretary of State
Associated Press Interview 6/12/2003

Those documents were only one piece of evidence in a larger body of
evidence suggesting that Iraq attempted to purchase uranium from Africa
... The issue of Iraq's pursuit of uranium in Africa is supported by
multiple sources of intelligence. The other sources of evidence did and do
support the president's statement. Sean McCormack, National Security
Council Spokesman Statement to press 6/13/2003

My personal view is that their intelligence has been, I'm sure, imperfect,
but good. In other words, I think the intelligence was correct in general,
and that you always will find out precisely what it was once you get on
the ground and have a chance to talk to people and explore it, and I think
that will happen. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Briefing
6/18/2003

I have reason, every reason, to believe that the intelligence that we were
operating off was correct and that we will, in fact, find weapons or
evidence of weapons, programs, that are conclusive. But that's just a
matter of time...It's now less than eight weeks since the end of major
combat in Iraq and I believe that patience will prove to be a virtue
Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Pentagon media briefing. 6/24/2003

MS. BLOCK: There were no toxins found in those trailers. SECRETARY POWELL:
Which could mean one of several things: one, they hadn't been used yet to
develop toxins; or, secondly, they had been sterilized so thoroughly that
there is no residual left. It may well be that they hadn't been used yet.
Colin Powell, Secretary of State All Things Considered, Interview
6/27/2003

That was the concern we had with Saddam Hussein. Not only did he have
weapons -- and we'll uncover not only his weapons but all of his weapons
programs -- he never lost the intent to have these kinds of weapons. Colin
Powell, Secretary of State All Things Considered, Interview 6/27/2003

I think the burden is on those people who think he didn't have weapons of
mass destruction to tell the world where they are. Ari Fleischer, Press
Secretary Press Briefing 7/9/2003
