As the US President is CinC of the US armed forces, he may deploy these
forces as he sees fit.  However, Congress holds the purse strings, and
the impeachment vote.  My understanding is that the War Powers Act,
passed in the wake of the SouthEast Asia Disagreement of 1965-1975,
limits such deployments to 30 or 90 days.

I have to admit being somewhat confused myself over just what
distinctions there are between a formal declaration, and a vote of
support such as we saw following the 9/11 attacks.  I believe a formal
declaration would entail far more Presidential support and powers,
resources for the military, including likely more sweeping restrictions
on civil liberties.

Peace.
