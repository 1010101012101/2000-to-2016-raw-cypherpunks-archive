	I've got a paper ready to publish that uses this technique for digital
credentials.  It'll be nice to have it at least referenced in the literature,
since Ben's paper is the only place I know of where it's really explained.  I
give a URL for it as well as credit to Anonymous, but it would be helpful to
know who really should be credited with what.

	I'm listing it as Laurie's method since he wrote the Lucre paper, but
I haven't been able to tell how much David Wagner had to do with the idea.  
Ben?  David? The URLs to the Anon messages are handy; I'll see about including
them too.
