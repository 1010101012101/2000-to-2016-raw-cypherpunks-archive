Unless it was something indispensable, they'd be sitting on something
worthless. That's why, until the industrial age, almost all wars were
over WATER rights., Not extractive resource rights (currently thinking
of DRC, pretty much the sole source for the tantalum for your
smartphone's touchy-feelie screen and micro-capacitors)

By extension, cornering the market in silver, or tantalum, or any
industrially-used extractive resource brings the industrial age one step
closer to extinction (snigger...)

Before nation-states and city states it was most likely THE way of life
for humans ... Until the industrial revolution it still existed in many
tribal-based hunter-gatherer and agrarian cultures.

Even today the Zapatistas have a slogan that spells out the cultural
mindset:

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Communities based on getting for oneself so one can 'give' to others is
sickness. In healthy cultures one works for the community so the fruits
of one's labor comes to all who participate.

W. Edward Deming knew that was the way things should work, and so does
every industrialist on the planet. But it doesn't maximize THEIR profit.

Admittedly, like databases, 'scaling' can be a bit of a problem.
