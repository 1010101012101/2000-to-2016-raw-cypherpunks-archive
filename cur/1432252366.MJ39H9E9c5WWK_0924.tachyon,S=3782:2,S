"It is beneath the station of those those with the power to define,

I gotta admit that made me a little uncomfortable. Made me think twice about 
pulling a few thou out if it were possible. But then again, it's arguable 
that if this dude spent more time trying to DO something productive he might 
make more than the beating he's taking perpetuating his pathetic scam. 
Actually, among all the African groups I've encountered in the US so far, 
Nigerians seem to have a lot more drive than other groups, and they seem to 
excel at technical subjects. So maybe this dude needs a beating or two to 
set him straight.
