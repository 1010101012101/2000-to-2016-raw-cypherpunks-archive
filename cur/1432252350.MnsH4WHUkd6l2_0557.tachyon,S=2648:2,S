there are still a large number of risks to your anonymity when using
things like Java, Flash, arbitrary applications with Tor, even in a
fully transparently Tor'ified VM configuration.

local DNS resolver IP disclosures and side channels, chained exploits
(accelerated VM interfaces are very risky but oh so performant...),
many, many other considerations and risks.

you need to carefully consider your risks for using such things, hence
my recommendation for the stock bundle without those risky things
unless you really know what you're doing or the risks are
exceptionally low.

best regards,
