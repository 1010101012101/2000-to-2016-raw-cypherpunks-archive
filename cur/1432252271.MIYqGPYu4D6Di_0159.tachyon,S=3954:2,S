I meant there is no crime in reading anyone elses (lost) trade secrets.

Yes I know about this.  The solution was that the engineers
worked from specs only and had never seen the code.  It was OK
if the specs were derived from reverse engineering, or in M$'s case,
a source leak.  So a cleanroom use of leaked code (Alice extracts specs,

Bob who doesn't look at the code writes to them.) would be OK.

How are you going to show that Bob read the leaked code?
There simply won't be enough similarity *even if* (I'll assert)
Bob does take a peak.  Unless he's got photographic memory in
which case he should be in Vegas.

Its mostly about employee-grabbing being bad, and writing to specs to
interoperate
being ok.

An abuse perhaps, perhaps it would be noticed after the first few
hundred
uses... And one would hide or wipe or shred such files after use anyway,

good hygiene.

Essentially any program could look

Yes but what to do?  Perhaps organizations will help the sued with legal
costs,
precedents will get established that protect folks in the future.

..and goofball judges will be collected on wheelbarrows, bulldozed into
the flaming ovens..
sorry..... channelling you know who...

And surely this list is thirsty for conspiracy theories.

If someone spills the trade secret recipe for Coca Cola, its not the
case that
no one else can ever make a soda closer to Coca Cola than before.

You can sue a ham sandwich.  Sucks to be that ham sandwich though.
