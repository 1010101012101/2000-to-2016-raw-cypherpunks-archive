I am in need of a protocol that allows something between freenet and
cocaine auction. bonus points for pointers to existing software:


imagine a network of nodes that store information, say a number of
websites. the information is identical on all (mirrors).
I'm looking for a way to insert information (new pages, updates...) in
such a way that it is impossible to find out where the information was
injected. i.e. one node is the "master node", but nobody except it
knows who. only the master node can insert information.

bonus problem: in case the master node fails, the protocol should allow
for a pre-determined (by the master node) other node to take over. who
the "successor" is should not be known to anyone except the master node
and maybe the successor.
