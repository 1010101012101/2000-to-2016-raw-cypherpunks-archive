Here I have to politely disagree with you: By double-clicking on the
"Start Tor" icon not only was the Tor control panel started up, but a
fully configured instance of Tor and a fully configured and hardened
web browser ready for use.  That's hard to beat.

What was the last game you installed?

People routinely go to much farther lengths to conceal their points of
origin just to access Etherpad or search for a .torrent file.  Much
farther lengths, and they're a lot more strict about maintaining their
OPSEC than most of us on this 'list are, I have a feeling.
