Seth,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but I was out of town.  I 
really can't send this to Freematt's Alerts as I don't want to censor 
what you wrote, but on the other hand I don't want to explain to my 
readers the origin of your hostility for pro-freedom libertarians.

I've said this before, but lets stick to fighting censorship and lets 
leave the petty insults and past net intrigue alone.  I'm willing.

Regards,  Matt-
