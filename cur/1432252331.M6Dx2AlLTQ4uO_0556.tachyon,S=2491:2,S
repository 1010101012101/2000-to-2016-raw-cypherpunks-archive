remember those cell phone number history sales?  that same information
feed contains tower identifiers for every call placed.  those
identifiers in turn can be linked to GPS coordinates and
inter|extrapolated location of the caller, thus the 150 yard accuracy.
 (this is how some carriers are approaching E911 as well).

does anyone really expect strong privacy from any telecommunications
provider these days?  time to roll your own...
