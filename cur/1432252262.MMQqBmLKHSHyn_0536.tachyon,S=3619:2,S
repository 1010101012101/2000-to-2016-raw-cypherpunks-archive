If only it were true.  That is why I recommend readily 
achievable goals, like stealing the oil, rather than goals that 
require direct involvment mano a mano.

But in reality, the US government is pursuing goals such as 
"building democracy" that require Americans to walk the streets 
of Baghdad, a daily exercise of tremendous courage.

Here is my prescription for winning the war on terrorism

We SHOULD rely on shock and awe, administered by men in white 
coats far from the scene.

A number of governments are disturbingly tolerant of terror. 
Usually they are only tolerant of terror against their non 
Islamic subjects, and disapprove of external terror committed 
by their subjects against outsiders, but the two cannot readily 
be separated.  One leads to the other.

The US government should expose and condemn these objectionable 
practices, subvert moderately objectionable regimes, and 
annihilate more objectionable regimes.  The pentagon should 
deprive moderately objectionable regimes of economic resources, 
by stealing their oil, destroying their water systems, and 
cutting off their trade and population movements with the 
outside world.

Syria should suffer annihilation, Iran subversion, Sudan some 
combination of annihilation and subversion, Saudi Arabia and 
similar less objectionable regimes should suffer confiscation 
of oil, destruction of water resources, and loss of contact 
with the outside world.
