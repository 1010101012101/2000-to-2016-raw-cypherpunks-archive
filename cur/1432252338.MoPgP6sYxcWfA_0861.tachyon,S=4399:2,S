Does anyone have any ideas on implementing a more libertarian approach to airport security technology and policy? For example, if someone asked you to contribute to a policy point paper to brief the White House, what would you recommend?

I'm sure we could all recite the endless litany of Surveillance State measures best flushed straight down the toilet--but where are the proactive solutions? Here's a start:


1. Simplify Federal air regulations: the current patchwork of requirements creates sometimes contradictory rules that hinder industry initiative and confound enforcement efforts.

2. Improve air traffic control practices, including emphasis on GPS enroute navigation over traditional airways routing (Free Flight) and better analysis of and response to changing airport capacity issues.

3. Implement private sector fault-checking airport/airline security systems using adversary testing (teams organized to regularly attempt to breach security).


We can't afford to throw in the towel in disgust (tempting though it may be) and leave this debate to the cowardly 70 percent. Which reminds me, here's a word of wisdom from Herman Kahn for those of you who lost your nerve:

"Critics frequently refer to the icy rationality of the Hudson Institute, the RAND Corporation and other such organizations. I'm always tempted to ask in reply, 'Would you prefer a warm, human error? Do you feel better with a nice emotional mistake?' We cannot expect good discussion of security problems if we are going to label every attempt at detachment as callous, every attempt at objectivity as immoral. Technical details are not the only important operative facts. Human and moral factors...must never be missing from policies and public discussion. But emotionalism and sentimentality, as opposed to morality and concern, only confuse the debates. Nor can experts be expected to repeat, 'If, heavean forbid...", before every sentence."
