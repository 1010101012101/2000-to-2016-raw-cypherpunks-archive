Speaking of that, both in itself at your leisure,
and more specific on this that came up...

Do you, or anyone, have [links], or can post, archives of the
content Jacob Appelbaum pushed out before during and
after relavent his .IQ journey?

Welcome IRAQ!
Streamtime.org - Free as a fish
Haan al-Irsaal (Arabic for Streamtime), was born in the spring of 2004
when in the attic of Cultural Political centre De Balie in Amsterdam
two journalists and a hacker joined their forces with the purpose to
promote independent, free speech web-radio and blogging from war-torn
Iraq and its Diaspora.
Today and after many years, Streamtime consists of a rich collection
of on-line sound recordings collected between 2004 and 2010, some
rather complex memories, huge archives stored off-line and a network
of good friends. It is a unique narration about the many Iraqi
bloggers who where online since the beginning of the war in Iraq.
We focused on a cultural sense of finding our own way in the quagmire
that is Iraq, and its representation in the global media. We don't try
to change politics in order to foster cultural change; we support
cultural manifestation in order to force political change.
We imagine improvised expressive devices like a CD that turns your PC
into an on line streaming studio. Imagine a mob that creates a traffic
jam. Think of the religious policeman in London, the konfused kollege
kid and the jealous dentist in Baghdad and the jailed blogger in
Cairo. Building autonomous networks in extreme conditions.
