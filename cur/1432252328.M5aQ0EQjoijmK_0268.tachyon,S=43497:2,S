not containable just within concrete, though it can and does have
major influence at certain stages and within specific approaches. its
conceptual innovation feeds into architecture and vice-versa,
symbiotic, including conceptual stagnation due to loss of larger

 The Future

"Modern cryptographic equipment consists of nothing more than a 'black
box' with powerful digital processors and advanced mathematical
algorithms. There is not much to see, and there are definitely no
moving parts. We realize that this is probably where our collection of
historical cipher equipment will end. However, there are numerous
earlier cipher machines and much of this is still undiscovered. 'New'
old machines will, no doubt, pup-up and many side-tracks will be
walked. Furthermore, the history of some famous cipher machines is
still very clouded, leaving much to be researched and much to be
discovered in the years to come.

"On the Crypto Museum website, we have done our best to raise an
interest in historical cipher machines and cryptology in general.
Where possible, we will give as much background information as we can.
Perhaps you too will eventually get contaminated with the Crypto
Virus. If it happens, be careful as it might get under your skin.

The Mozart Effect myth: research finds music doesn't make you smarter
http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/12/5204124/the-mozart-effect-myth-research-finds-music-doesnt-make-you-smarter

(note: headline made me wonder what the difference actually is in
terms of intelligence or ability to think and process information in a
different conceptual framework/model, from those who actually _play
music, to those who are _trained to remotely  reproduce "music", say
musical compositions repeated for 240 years from the institutionalized
cultural canon, versus making your own music, exploring musical
principles versus rote behaviorism that may remove those learning
principles from the interaction, so people as tape recorders in a
context of music playback, repeating someone elses musical learning,
versus developing their own via unique exploration and grounding. the
latter approach would seem to indicate 'new information' models could
develop whereas repetition of preexisting structures and approaches
may limit this to a realm of memorization, for instance. likewise, any
effects from playing music may require longer-term integration to be
expressed as intelligence, years even, as motor skills and new
neuronal connections and pathways take hold, rewiring the brain, and
six weeks is not going to allow this known and basic benefit to be
evaluated. it may be a time of peak confusion, instead, because it is
new knowledge not yet integrated so to test on that is to force its
benefits into a realm of observable tangibility it may not be able to
provide, though may still exist as this inside people, expressing
itself over a longer time.)

:-:-:-: Ten books - Vitruvius, recontextualization :-:-:-:

i wanted to substantiate an approach to crypto in a larger context
from its parallel within architecture as a discipline that involves
real-time development based on principles that are shared as a
framework and value system, in other words common consciousness about
a given domain or areas of importance or relevance as this effects
what can or cannot develop.

in the existing late 20th c. worldview my research interests into
electrification as critical to understanding the existing built
environment had no place within the history books. such views are
literally erased, censored from books, both as content though also
imagery, there are few 'electrical poles' in those fashion photographs
of buildings, removing the ubiquitous context of infrastructure, as if
they function in a more pure condition than are reliant upon an
external source of power, light, heat, than 'the elements' of nature
and sunlight. because those are the beliefs, shade shadow mass spatial
experience, pre-electric, communication about experience shared in a
context of 'the senses' removed of their electromagnetic truth, such
that ungrounded subjectivism and indoctrination into a world view is
established and _must be followed to succeed in the systematized view
and training to become an architect, within such narrowed parameters.
to continue to extend the existing ideology in this way.

so it was necessary to find justification for such thinking and
consideration, and Plato offers this in terms of conceptualizing the
state as a body, essentially a nervous system. and then considering
this in terms of its governance. how the individual and group are
established via various principles of relation, what is prioritized,
etc.

there were also many fragmentary views from Modernist masters relating
to electrical aesthetics, i think it was Walter Gropius who related
the eyeball to the television set, and Le Corbusier had great interest
in the aesthetics of electrification, generators, motors, turbines.
and so an archaeological aspect, yet not integrated into a larger
framework. so as it happens, this continues to a threshold where
scholar-architects Venturi, Scott-Brown, and Izenour share very
insightful observations about the developing electromagnetic
landscape, to include such aesthetics of infrastructure relied upon
(in the desert no less, for life sustaining a/c and casinos and
signage: essentially OASIS and MIRAGE), in their Learning from Las
Vegas and yet the strong and silent type still does not mention or
investigate the electrical order while certainly referencing it and
including it within the chaos of the built environment in the
photographs taken. and yet, in architectural history, there is
supposedly no precedent, no way to make the case that this
infrastructure is an extension of architecture, of fundamental and
foundational relation as an ordering device within the city grid, its
planned development (ala plug-in city, though originating millennia
ago). and yet there is direct lineage with these billboards along the
highway that cars drive by and signage along busy routes near ancient
cities, the present day is an extension of similar structure and order
over a long span of time. it is part of a language, although it may
become subconscious, mediated in other terms or only indirectly, else
could be edited out as 'not architecture' which is the default
loophole.

(http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/learning-las-vegas)

what interested me about this, and i am not sure exactly the sequence
my readings occurred, though in deciding to delve into reading a
classic work of literature, the earliest account of architectural
authority (in the West) in terms of its classical culture and
development, if not mistaken, is that it was unlike the existing
conception of what architecture is, and had a far wider boundary for
knowledge and interpretation that today has been narrowed by special
and private interests in a 'training approach' to office workers than
an educational approach that questioned the parameters of
architecture, beyond a confined technical enterprise that overlaps
aesthetics onto a deterministic approach to answered problems of
culture, society, economic development, and political agendas driving
the development, its destructiveness.

Ten Books on Architecture - Vitruvius
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura

so what took me by surprise is that the architect is speaking of not
only geometry and the proportion of temples and buildings at that
time, based on the classical ordering systems...

(Classical Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, Composite)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_order

...though also about armaments and fortifications, about the quality
of water in wells (wells that produce black bile or something along
these lines), and various other important areas of knowledge in terms
of buildings and development in their larger realm of functioning,
which today would include areas like environment and defense as part
of this architectural inquiry and area of knowledge- for how
architecture exists and functions. In this way, to understand nature
and surrounding culture, infrastructure would fit into this same
approach, and without it the existing dwellings, buildings, the entire
built environment, cities themselves- do not make any sense because
they cease to function without electricity. A skyscraper no longer
functions in this era without electrical elevators and ventilation
systems, lighting, etc. A home would lose its washing machine, food
storage, communications ability, etc. And yet this vital and basic
information is left out of the equation, removed from architecture as
a viewpoint, which is ridiculous, and not allowed in 'reasoning'
within the schools likewise. In this way the ideas of architecture are
shallow, hollowed out of their meaning for a surface-based
interpretation, which serves a particular oil-based development agenda
perfectly.

the reason this was introduced here is because of ancient principles
now absent within the realm of architecture: approximated as
Commidity, Firmness, and Delight... these principles are often
presumed or claimed to exist for the given approach to image-based
development yet have become signage-only, language game seeking to
misrepresent what is going on, as if more is occurring, higher minded
activity than a base activity under the guise of architecture

Commodity, Firmness, and Delight, or Toward a New Architectural Attitude
http://classicistne.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/commodity-firmness-and-delight-or-toward-a-new-architectural-attitude/

(for instance, commodity replaced by anti-economy as 'economics';
firmness by using false foundation and understanding for development,
thus developing ungrounded civilization, and 'bliss of ignorance'
delight while this process is being subverted for ulterior motives).
There is misalignment and misrepresentation and short-circuiting and a
sabotaged detour going on within the ancient_tradition of
architecture, whereby today is functions directly against and in
opposition to these principles, most especially in the area they could
be evaluated and-or acknowledged, within the education system which
instead is ruled by an anti-architecture ideology. against thought,
against action, functioning against truth, grounded reasoning itself.

and then one day recently in trying to remember the above tripartite
concept, the mingling of its present incarnation as Fear, Uncertainty,
Doubt appeared in the fog of my mind, though was rendered as: Fear,
Uncertainty, and Delight, instead. and to me this illuminated this
very closely correlated development, removed of its camouflage, suc
that FUD is the equivalent set of principles by which development
occurs in a context of developing of this insecurity, uncertainty, and
incapacitation of people, most notably through ideology of relativism
and binary views based on biased authority structures and control over
reasoning and feedback.

another sample of wreckage from this same broken brain is that of the
Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, the book and also the excellent movie
(c.1949) with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead_%28film%29

there is controversy over interpretation of the ideas involved, though
i think an accurate grounding of observation neutralizes the beliefs,
when truth is the arbiter of actions and not just ego, as if belief in
superior vision is justification for higher awareness development that
others just cannot understand and thus lone geniuses stand alone in
obscurity, which then is how the corruption of the star system occurs
with celebrity architecture and development of 'aesthetic buildings'
are removed from larger issues of economics, societal, and their
political reliance and extension of given systems of corrupt power,
instead of questioning these, and thus in some sense 'the cathedrals'
built represent these values, as if glossy advertisements for a
culture devoid of culture, just about shiny objects and immediate
sensory experience that no longer connects with larger surrounding
issues or has a larger impact on lives than in an ecological negative,
like playing music on the titanic as it is sinking,  yet not
accounting for this part of the situation, as if heightened experience
when instead blindness. the entire system supporting this development,
all students, interning as peasants to upkeep offices that churn out
cultural pablum as if 'high conceptualization' when devoid of this, in
truth. then the conceit of the architect in this domain, as if
knowledgeable of what is going on as if in continuance of vitrivuian
awareness, or mastery within the built environment, when basic
reasoning and observation long ago failed in order to support the
ruling oppressive ideology.

so here is the contrast, the other way of considering this: that the
architect who removes themselves from the process of development as an
individual (i.e. human), then revolves around the issue of identity,
awareness, self-conception. issues of governance, models of the state
from individual to group, such that a 'shared identity' (humans) could
be this same individual and may have removed themselves from the
existing treachery, allowed this process of devolution to occur, and
thus the absence of architecture, its truth, then can be made evident,
the lack of culture in those 'representing culture' as stand-ins,
mimics, of a false order and false reality and false perspective
sustained and relied upon for the shallow relations based on another
foundation or set of parameters: say, base materialism, money.

further, 'the architect' may be assumed to thus be one person, one
individual, yet in this way a shared identity can compose this person,
such that the person is human, and as others are also human, they too
are involved in this condition, via shared awareness and values. thus,
a networking of realization or shared state as it were, via whatever
conceptual scaffolding or consciousness is sustained as entablature,
such that wave-collapse does not occur, and the post-and-lintel
connections between here and there are sustained between human beings.

likewise and vitally important, that 'architecture' is a
meta-condition as exampled by ancient conception that ranges beyond
the existing modeling, yet is fragmented and not integrated as a total
discipline in this way. naval architecture is one aspect,
traditionally, though also computer architecture and other areas. the
principles or even code, common structures, and programming (such
that, for instance, music and architecture are closely empirically
related, and essentially everything is, in terms of aesthetics in
terms of its truth and intelligence), then a wider range of activity
may be occuring as 'architecture' than is accounted for, and yet it
may be the truth of its condition, as certain principles are or are
not observed and served. for instance, serving public interest by
having safe water and waste disposal infrastructure versus relying on
toxic systems that despoil the environment, or stewardary of wildlife
and landscape and environments as this relates to weather and
ecosystems or denying these or exploiting them, say with engineering
weather for political manevering and strategy, and to enact certain
development patterns via forced desertification and manipulating
demographic and other flow patterns, as this can become an illegal
basis for creating and sustaining power, off the books, because it is
not included in the observations or analysis, unaccounted for.

further, that any 'architecture' is not at the hand and mind just of
the architect, though in its *implementation*, involving all who are
involved in its development, relying upon a shared awareness and value
system (truth) else subverted in its conception, communication, and
construction, by sabotage or other mistakes, errors, or misalignments
that weaken it. and thus the coherence in the group action to build
something upon a foundation, and how this is achieved, from idea to
its actualization (just like circuitry in technological devices that
then can break in or out of warranty via poor manufacturing or
deceitful practices baked-in).

it is this myth of completely independent action, that the individual
achieves something in its entirely -alone- that is a clean-room
conceptualization of a process that involves many who are part of the
larger process of design, construction, and development, and that this
'functioning together as one' is in some sense 'the architect' in its
larger coherent state, of shared awareness, continuum throughout the
various circuitry that establishes and sustains relations in their
truth, in the shared direction, moving together towards the same
goals. each person having an important role, each part having its own
importance in achieving functioning of the larger integerated whole.
not just as a machine, as a culture, as an idea though further- a
living idea, a living truth that is shared, that governs, principles
that are not merely referred to and referenced as if authority, and
instead, awareness and understanding that is based within and upon
knowing, a way of being or competency that develops in each as a
unique vantage of the common situation, another perspective yet
contributing toward a total perspective, allowing error correction and
greater accuracy than any single viewpoint.

in this way the people who create the materials are part of the
building process, part of the vital development of civilization and
culture, those who construct buildings and systems and develop this
order are vital for its implementation and have feedback and insight
to offer as part of this process, for how given approaches could be
improved or made more economical or with greater strength or
durability.

in this way, this coordinated empirical shared effort of many
functioning as one, to include engineers, designers, craftspeople,
tradespeople, workers, manufacturers, technologists, scientists, and
others, including programmers and security developers --- all of these
people are involved in the 'ideas' of architecture, as it is
integrated beyond narrowed boundaries and considered as a larger
conceptual model of how it actually functions, when accounting for its
various and many details and manifestations and dimensions that must
be developed, designed, built, and implemented correctly and
successfully, for the project to have integrity. to be able to endure
over time and function correctly, versus being designed and developed
to fall apart as today via any number of compromises or unshared
goals, lowered principle.

in other words, the potential exists that 'the architect' is in this
larger scale and framework of shared activity amongst many functioning
as one, and that no single person could feasibly be functioning in all
these domains, (unless extraordinary circumstances of all-knowing,
then all truth would be addressed not ignored in the building process,
tending towards utopia).

this is to suggest that 'architecture' could be occurring within a
wide range of realms that are not yet integrated in a larger
conception, conceptualization, or modeling accurately maps to its true
nature and functioning, its inherent interdisciplinary awareness that
integrates into a cohesive understanding spanning these various
domains. and lacking this, the conceit would be that a person could
know more than a tiny fragment of this immensity and alone be able to
shape all of these forces and meld them into a direction as an
individual, because of their truth, instead of having this be an issue
of 'shared identity' of those like who also relate to the situation in
similar dimensions and together can move towards a given direction as
one entity, diverse and multiplicitous yet organized, gaining not
losing coherence- order. and in this way, perhaps a context of entropy
and ideas, likewise, and security issues involved.

(in other words: it is not ungrounded group ego detached from or
ignoring 'truth' that is this shared momentum as development, nor of
an individual that is part of this. such that each pseudo-work is
considered 'the great work' that amounts to mediocrity, if analyzed
further beyond narrowed boundary. instead, of integrity, foundation
common to action, verified and sustained and modeled in its truth, in
service to it, then each point relating to others, lineage from one
structuring to the next, nodes interconnecting within dimensions, this
awareness, then interactions that build upon this stability, this
accurate understanding and modeling, such that it is a common or
shared development, it benefits the whole and the part and each is in
service to the truth of others who are operating within shared
principles, dimensions, and then learning from others, integrating
views, understanding, awareness, evolving a higher capacity and
improving, optimizing functioning, relation, communication, ability to
operate with cohesion yet still error-correct. what are the rules,
logic, truth, reasoning, falsifiability, the ability of debate to lead
to win-win interactions even while in contest because truth benefits
all through its discovery and development, new social dynamics and
understanding and awareness based on this, difficulties faced
betwixt-and-between as the conflict or friction is extreme, working
through the wrong models or moving through the false concepts or
limitations, breaking things down, pain and agony of not knowing or
having limited questioning and then requestioning, losing certainty,
only to regain basic truth and model for any interaction, governance
versus politics, basic versus applied, novice vs. expert, and role of
learning and literacy and basic questions as the place this
functioning occurs, as people move together towards a higher-order or
dimensional integration, over time...)


== sidenote A ==

note: i am not familiar with the indepth reasoning of Rem Koolhaas
related to ~shopping as a cultural activity though to me it cracked a
nut that opens a new universe of analysis about the actual behavior of
people in terms of material culture, social relations, etc. in that it
provides a context for evaluations on par with anthropology and
archeology, of the present situation.

review: The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/16/style/a-harvard-shopping-guide-charge-it.html

so this is meant to provide context for the following ideas... that
is, there is more to gain from a commercial advertisement in its
cultural depth than just a monetary transaction. (this moves into the
business page of daily newspapers as a tally of ongoing applied
philosophy, where business philosophy is the presiding worldview, the
shared communication that most effects the transformation and
development of culture- as ideas. (moreso: ideology though, as many
sacred beliefs are unquestionable and most things occur in such rigid
frameworks, ungrounded from external variables and falsifications, so
essentially protected views that can be and are weak structurally,
though within a bubble civilization seem peak insight).

beyond scaling of unchecked materialism and profit-based onesided
exchange (of beliefs) there can be lots going on in the development of
material artifacts, processes, as these effect social relations,
activities, various detailing of or within culture, in given sets of
parameters.

of the basic situation then of commerce, exchange, things that are
conceived of, invented or extended, -made-, developed into systems
small and large, then of the corresponding ideas attached to them,
that move alongside the movement of artifacts as they located in
culture, and find their place. as if shards of pottery someday to be
unearthed in various geographies that then matches a common culture
across distances and differences, via such evidence.

then to encounter such an advertisement:

SOS review
http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may13/articles/elektron-analog-four.htm

what was remarkable to me, having memory issues, is how research into
a drum machine (a related product on the company site) then led to a
graphic about another music tool that went high concept, into a realm
of big ideas and reminded me of the question i repeatedly wonder about
and then forget, once having known the basic situation....

part of the human nervous system is actually digital and part of it is
analog. and to me this is an important fact about the technological
environment people are living within, especially in terms of sensing
and how coupling with external signals and communications or
exfiltration of biological or physiological information could occur,
if not aspects of remote control over the nervous system via these
same means. and yet as shared view or model of humanity to discuss
ongoing oppressive dynamics in worse-case scenarios- non-existent! not
awareness or understanding except within a field of expertise that is
often politicized, such that there are agendas within professions;
political science -> political medicine -> political neurology and the
next thing you know a drone is flyign overhead and the emg-test you
last had forces a twitch in your arm via EM reflex and you drive off
the cliff. do not need to wait for automated cars to steer you off the
road, it can already happen today, if such systems are 'weaponized'.

what is to prevent such dynamics from existing if they are not
accounted for. and thus this is only one aspect, the danger of not
knowing, yet what may be realized if such a model of the
electromagnetic human was understood or part of the conceptualization
of shared relations, part of the intellectual framework that mediates
the world in a sea of toxic signalling, and what is the limit or
boundary for this happening, (the entire education system for
starters)

so a non EM-worldview and non-EM humans existing in electromagnetic
civilization as shared context yet believing the self 'outside' this
perspective for analysis and evaluation, having rationalized and
accounted for activity only in non-EM terms and conceptualization.
sounds like the wrong mathematics of zero again. what is the structure
of the human nervous system, how does this digital and-or analog
circuitry relate to issues of infrastructure, wireless communication,
potential frameworks for consciousness, embodiment, being.

(note: in exploring basic electronics, the category of sensors
fascinated me, especially in regard to common features they share,
such as strain, and their often ~analog nature, as well as a principle
of reversibility in functioning, as if of a deeper symbiotic
connection involved)

(what then does it mean for an all-digital computer in terms of
'processing' or reasoning, versus a hybrid system that matches
functionality of nervous system in its dynamic range)

signals in an analogue manner, but we also found this could be
perceived by neighbouring nerve cells if located close enough.” The
more closely cells are connected to each other, the more information
can be received from the analogue signal. [unquote]

[video]  IS LIFE ANALOG OR DIGITAL? -- FREEMAN DYSON
http://edge.org/conversation/is-life-analog-or-digital

note: ANALOG IS MORE POWERFUL THAN DIGITAL

(is information that exists outside a computer analog/digital, is a
non-virtual material_artifact and thus matter_itself analog/digital?
is energy analog and-or digital. in what domain is culture occurring
as consciousness, as communication. ideas. where is crypto, only
digital???)

[excerpt]  II. Philosophers' Distinctions - II.1 Von Neumann
http://www.ellieepp.com/theory/analog/analog5.html

       "The nervous system is based on two types of communications:
those which do not involve arithmetical formalisms, and those which
do, i.e. communications of orders (logical ones) and communications of
numbers (arithmetical ones). The former may be described as language
proper, the latter as mathematics. (von Neumann, 1958, 80)"

Von Neumann's The Computer and the Brain, written in 1956 and
published in 1958, made the analog/digital distinction relevant to
philosophy by claiming that the logics and mathematics of the central
nervous system, viewed as representational systems, must "structurally
be essentially different from those languages to which our common
experience refers" (1958, 82). He has in mind here both natural
language and binary mathematics. [...]

as with crypto basics and possibilities, it is my belief that the
basic breadboard circuit in its actual dynamics has not been fully
accounted for, in that the relation of charge (+/-) including neutral
or  'ground' is not adequately modeled in accurate terms of existence
and instead a structural skew exists that sends everything into a
particular direction. also with crypto that becomes about mathematic
equations and 'beliefs' about signage, than of other dynamics that
exist in the same realm yet whose dimensions may be unrecognized,
ignored, or without value in a given methodology or approach, while
inherently relevant to the core ideas and cryptologic processes. i do
not think or believe the basic circuit has been figured out, that it
remains a question. that the analog digital aspects of the circuit may
be wrongly modeled or conceptualized in the actual terms they exist -
because LOGIC. because of a binary (and yes, thus 'digital' ideology)
approach that favors a certain rationalization as if universal
reasoning when it breaks down at a given threshold or boundary yet
continues on as a 'belief system' in certain assumptions and views
that can be inaccurate or illusory, if not deceptive, false. when the
dynamics between a basic circuit and model of the atom and thus
molecules in which the identical charge relations exist and provide
momentum -do not align or match up- in terms of how they are conceived
and what is going on with grounding (mathematics of zero), such that
"infinity" is made or modeled as if finite, removed from dynamics,
then the potential that is in the realm of N-value is also removed,
made 'digital' as it were even with analog modeling. and it would seem
so too crypto, 'quantum' processing itself seemingly more analog in
the range of parallelism as basis for computation, as a natural
process of equilibrium even, perhaps. and how much of the multi- or
non-linearity of circuitry, its ecological or ecosystem based ~complex
dynamics similar exist in this as a foundational, fundamental context,
firstly, before the digital even develops as a simple on/off switch,
then to represent and model _everything in that reductionist
framework, and claim its signage to represent all that is.

(without accurate logical accounting can such modeling be accurate in
its grounded truth, if this truth is unrecognized or unreferenced
beyond binary biasing and distortion (digital worldview?). how much of
observation is contained or trapped within its warping(etc);)

maybe thinking is not up-to-speed with material interactions, a gap
between models and reality, yet beliefs in accurate representations
that are limiting, based on misconceptions. thus, remove logic
(empirical and error-corrected grounded reasoning) and
electromagnetism, and try conceptualizing computers and crypto in that
context and see what happens. this.

computers are based on _logic, yet a particular kind that is warped
and ideological and is in error as a neutral observational viewpoint.
developing this bias as technological worldview is then enshrining a
false empiricism and vault of the 'digital sky' as consciousness when
it acts and functions against actual consciousness in its ungrounded,
unchecked state, as if 'being' itself. exploitation of this condition
(a kind of magic, sorcercy) tending towards evil as it moves further
and further away from truth and serves and extends the false approach,
what is essentially a shared lie if facts and truth are ignored,
censored, etc. total power, control over a developing system that at
its core is based on error. here, morality, ethics, absence of law
that upholds the false framework as it is institutionalized,
"believed" via leap of faith, ignoring the gap, denying the gap, for
all the material rewards it can yield to its developers. unchecked of
course, forbid from error correction. the representation replacing
reality. the sign becoming truth, that detachment, ungrounded
condition. just like circuit & adam.

(also: quantum computer of people, shared consciousness in parallel
empirical evaluation)

1. if prohibition of alcohol = control of speech, as a side-effect,
via behavioral influence, that is, sobriety; what is prohibition of
crypto? control of controversial thoughts and connections, an indirect
form of secondary censorship. Fahrenheit 451 tactics- actual crypto
the fire.

2. if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists
as the basic situation, instead of having private keys the NSA has a
master key per standard, implementation, other. if this was inside a
known legal framework, that perhaps would be tolerable with oversight,
yet without oversight where tyranny takes over, then everything is
pawned/owned by NSA who could forcibly censor without consequence as
part of a hidden political strategy, etc.
(all tools broken so a crypto scheme can function, leading to all
tools remotely breakable?)

3. question of literature as applied cryptography in
linguistic/typographic model, and also cryptology in decryption
approaches to embedded codes and ciphers, yet perhaps not a strategy
for encryption within ordinary bounded means and measures. are there
in this way two or more distinct approaches, only one that finds
itself in the parameters of computer encryption/decryption as modeled,
and the others reside in a realm of data mining and other statistical
correlations that may function in a realm of cryptanalysis and-or
code-breaking though using different tools and approaches than strong
encryption that currently reigns.

4. is there a unified crypto scheme or is it fragmented and does not
recognize itself in the mirror as its own 'whole' self due to a limit
for this structural-conceptual integration. in this way could
cryptography be schizoid in having two or more parallel systems,
disconnected strategies that function outside boundaries of the other,
and may remain unrecognized. that is, literature/language/linguistics
as crypto versus mathematic encrypt/decrypt schemes, each having their
own ecosystems and boundaries, paths that may never cross or meet
within the given parameters or dimensions as evaluated by the other,
or may exist as unbroken ciphers within other ciphers, encrypted code
within decrypted communications that remains unrecognized due to this
unrelated, ungrounded condition between them.

5. in this way could having 'answers' at the ready (GOTO 2) then
provide confirmational bias that a correct decrypt has been achieved
within a limited view that then becomes foundation for a false
perspective, represented by mathematics. and may a particular
rationalization (GOTO 1) that is enforced as if objectivity defined,
then become the basis for an illusion of mastery or control over
limited dimensionality and observational frameworks, themselves
becoming the basis for an insecure crypto framework (see 1). in other
words, without or banning abberations, then leading to a false
condition of certainty by containing what is or may be uncontainable,
making finite the infinite question and potential parameters into a
'small world'(model); ineffective at best in accounting for actual
crypto, operating.

6. does a hybrid crypto approach exist that remains unrecognized,
whereby both a linguistic even 'literature-based' crypto could exist
alongside mathematical encryption techniques yet remain unrecognized
in the "official" institutional model of cryptography, perhaps even
with a missing cryptological foundation or background, that limits a
realm of computer crypto to a narrow investigation of algorithms and
security inside a bounded, finite domain? (see 3/645)

Keeping the lights on: Mechanical engineer
finds a way to predict cascading power outages
http://phys.org/news/2013-12-mechanical-cascading-power-outages.html

"Each individual component does not know what the collective state of
affairs is," said Mezic. Current methods rely on a steady, abundant
supply, producing enough energy to flow through the grid at all times,
regardless of demand, he explained. However, should part of a grid
already operating at capacity fail—say in times of disaster, attack or
malfunction—widespread blackouts all over the system can occur.

"Everybody shuts down," Mezic said. The big surges of power left
unregulated by the malfunctioning component can either overload and
burn out other parts of the grid, or cause them to shut down to avoid
damage, he explained. The result is a massive power outage and
subsequent economic and physical damage. The Northeast Blackout of
2003 was one such event, affecting several U.S. states and part of
Canada, crippling transportation, communication and industry.
