Before the "future of journalism" there is the present and you are failing hard at it. If your future of journalism implies your ignorant opinion, I personally prefer another future, which can be shaped right now by keeping your crazy mind away from anything important.

A bit of structured discourse or grammar studies would be a plus to your chances of getting a job.

Your "ethics" is merely your biased opinions, nothing more. Nobody needs it, sorry.

Crazy people are rather hard to understand. They make nonsensical phrases, they throw childish fits, they invent ethics that only exist in their minds, etc.

Yes, you were just calling bad names and clearly your "know enough" equals to "think crazy like me", which is a stupid argument not worth following. Not everyone is bipolar and depressed in this world.

You fail hard as an agent provocateur.
