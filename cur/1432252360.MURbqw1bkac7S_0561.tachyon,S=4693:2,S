Humm, true. Not Google Drive, but Google Cloud Storage. My bad.

Well, if it's the developer-oriented GCS, not Google Drive, it's just a=
 bit=20
less bad for us.

Thing is, this encryption scheme (in which, from what I read, Google ha=
s=20
access to "master keys" and has the technical ability to decrypt data o=
nce=20
it's subpoenad) brings no additional safety to users. It sounds great (=
"we=20
support encryption! and we're doing it with several keys! that has to b=
e safe,=20
eh?"), but it does effectively nothing to actually protect users and th=
eir=20
data from PRISM and similar programmes.

And that means it will be this harder for us to explain why this is a b=
ad=20
scheme ("wait, you're saying encryption is evil? now I am confused!") a=
nd why=20
people should use other methods of protecting their privacy and their d=
ata.
