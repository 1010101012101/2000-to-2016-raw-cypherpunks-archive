I sampled one of your lengthy list of citations at random, 
(http//www.eh.net/Publications/pathdepend.shtml) and it read as if written 
by an English lit critic trained in postmodernism, rather than someone with 
actual economic qualifications.  This did not encourage me to read any of 
the others.

Nonetheless I doggedly persisted, and read another, taken at random.

And encountered a complete absence of any actual facts or argument, a spew 
of words with the form, but not the substance, of an argument, an emission 
of meaningless fog reminiscent of Chomsky caught in a lie.
