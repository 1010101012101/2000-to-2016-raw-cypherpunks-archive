* Voter locks in choice on touch screen.  

* Paper receipt is printed and
  shown to voter.  
* Voter chooses 'great' -> receipt disappears into ballot box 
  Voter chooses 'nope'  -> receipt disappears into trash bin /
                           can be taken home as a souvenir.

The intention behind requiring receipts is not to get totally secure
voting, but to get oting that is not much more insecure than the current
paper process. I assume the 'take pic, show later' attack is also
possible against the current system.
