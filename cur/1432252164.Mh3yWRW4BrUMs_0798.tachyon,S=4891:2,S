I think you must be mistaking "Wired" for the "Weekly World News".

You know I live about 20-30 miles from a large government/corporate
installation (the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant in South Eastern Iowa). Was
opened in the early 1900's. Thousands of acres, 100's of miles of Railroad,
Bunkers, Warehouses, High Security, built atomic bombs in the 50's and 60's.
It doesn't even show up on most maps.

It just surprises me that I don't see it getting the kind of crap you see
about Area 51 and "Barotouk (sp?)" . Of course it is acknowledged by the
Gov't , and N. Telsa didn't do any
"cloaking/time experiments" there :).

There has been press recently about workers seeking government compensation
for possible radiation contamination while manufacturing nukes there.

(Hey, maybe I should start a web site too ..... I'm "sure" I can find
someone to say that that's REALLY where alien bodies are stored and their
autopsies conducted, and the warehouses I can see from the highway look
"exactly" like the ones where the Ark of Covenant is stored. B>) ).
