Even by then, it was a relatively old idea.  In 1988 or 1989, Richard
Crandall wrote an application called "Godzilla" (later renamed Zilla
after trademark threats) for NeXT computers that did parallel
computation and was configurable. It was remarkably ahead of its
time. I think it even was a screensaver too. NeXT used it at their
corporate HQ in Redwood City (where I worked in 1990) and it was also
available via the usual wustl/etc. FTP sites.
