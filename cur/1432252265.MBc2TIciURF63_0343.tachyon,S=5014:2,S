Most cars don't backfire, essentially it is a sign that the engine
is seriously out of tune. 

Tim is guilty of statistics abuse, because it never happens to
Tim he assumes it can never happen to anyone who is passing
the local Nazi encampment.

What Tim does not explain is why sending a truck full of thugs
off to beat up someone carrying a loaded, recently fired weapon
is a reasonable or even a sensible response.

The problem with the KKK, AN and other groups of thugs isn't 
what they say, it is what they do - beat people up. 

As for being PC, can anyone explain how an organization could
be less tollerant of opposing views than the AN?
