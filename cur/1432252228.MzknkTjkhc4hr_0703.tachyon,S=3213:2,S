Leaving this for pde and/or Seth.

The reality is we won't have the Firefox APIs to actually prevent
content load after certificate inspection any time soon, so it's not
feasible to trust this as your only security measure. Monsterous hacks
might make this possible sooner, though...

On a timescale where we can provide real security rather than just
analysis and post-pwnage notification, we can build multiple databases
to submit to/query, just like Perspectives. 

There's also no real reason why you can't use both Perspectives and
HTTPS-Everywhere. Then you can get both of our half-assed
after-the-fact notifications that you were owned :)
