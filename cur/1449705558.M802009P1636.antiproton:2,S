	AiBnB and Uber are centralized middlemen - though the fact that
	uber goes against the privileges of the taxi mafia is an
	example of a freer market at work - at least in some limited
	fashion.
	
	On the other hand the 'market' is wholly owned by the middleman
	and the potential for abuse (assuming airbnb is not already the
	NSA) is...big. 

	I suppose the anarchist version would exist as a p2p network,
	for starters. Haven't the cypherpunks already coded a bunch of
	those decentralized, censorship resistant, anonymous, bla bla
	bla systems? 


	Anyway, I think couchsurfing is closer to anarchism than uber
	or airbnb (though the platform is just as centralized).

	Well...this is something I wouldn't  say : 

	" companies are stripping away worker protections, pushing down
	wages, and flouting government regulations" 

	While I do think that airbnb and the like are more
	sophisticated forms of corporatism (not a free market), I
	wouldn't suggest that they are the only bad guys in town and
	that 'progressive' statists are the good guys who protect
	'workers' with 'regulations'.
