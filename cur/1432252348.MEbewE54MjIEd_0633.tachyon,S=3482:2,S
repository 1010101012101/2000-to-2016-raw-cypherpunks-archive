Nonsense.  The words "terror" and "terrorism" came to have 
their modern meaning  when they employed to describe the 
policies of the government of France, and later the policies 
of the Paris Commune.

"Terrorism" is something that governments do.  Later the word
came to be extended by as hyperbole to the large scale violent
acts of private organizations and individuals.
