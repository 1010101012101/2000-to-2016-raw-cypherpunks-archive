Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its p|an to

mi|estones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any cel|ular or |andline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2OO,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.
