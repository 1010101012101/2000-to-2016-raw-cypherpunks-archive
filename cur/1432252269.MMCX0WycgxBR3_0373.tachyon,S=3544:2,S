 You are digging up rationales for killing anyone anywhere. 
Why does this not surprise me?

Some people need killing, some people don't.  The difference
is not always clear, but when it comes to imperial soldiers
and trade towers, the difference is clear enough.

And the difference is also clear enough when it comes to
those people who found themselves paying taxes to support an
imperial war they knew nothing of.
