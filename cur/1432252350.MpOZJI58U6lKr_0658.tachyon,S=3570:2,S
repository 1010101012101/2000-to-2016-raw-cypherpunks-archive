Please stop whining and fix the problem at hand given an opportunity to
do so.

PS: If you don't want to FOLLOW an obfuscated URL, you could just
disable XS requests in your browser of choice, or if you wanted to be
really l33t, Europus, netcat to the host and GET the page:

nc bit.ly 80
GET /c8nXVq
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Moved</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Moved</H2>
<A
HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/05/usb-electronic-key-impressioner-coul
d-help-you-be-gone-in-60-mill/">The requested URL has moved here.</A>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT><SMALL><I>AOLserver/4.5.1 on
http://127.0.0.1:7200</I></SMALL></P>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Does that count as "clicking"? Am I not a tr00 cypherpunk anymore?
