That's encouraging, though it doesn't say _that_ much about the sidebar
you read.

Ever hear of a species barrier?  It's a big step, from deer and elk, to
humans.  Here is the most recent Pro-Med update on CWD:

USA -- CWD becoming a threat in the wild
----------------------------------------------------
Chronic wasting disease could devastate Wyoming's wild deer
population, a [US] state biologist has told Saskatchewan hunters.
Terry Kreeger, the manager of a Wyoming state wildlife research farm,
said he not only believes CWD can theoretically pass from farmed deer
to wild deer across the fenceline, but that this has probably already
occurred in his state. Kreeger spoke at the Saskatchewan Wildlife
Federation's annual meeting. He qualified his remarks by noting that
many important aspects of CWD are still not understood or just barely
understood, so few definitive answers about the disease can be given.

CWD exists in the wild in southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado
and the extreme west of Nebraska. It was first spotted in animals in a
Colorado research facility, and then in the Wyoming research farm.
Wild cases were only found later, but researchers believe the disease
was probably brought into the facilities by infected deer. If for
every 5 CWD-infected wild deer or elk another 6 were infected, "in
about 35 to 50 years look at what happens to the population -- they
crash," he said, describing a chart of projections. Only half the deer
population would remain.

Wild elk can carry the disease, but appear not to be as susceptible as
deer. Less than one percent of elk in the CWD hot zone have been found
with the disease. Up to 10 percent of deer in the same area are
infected, he said.

Kreeger said CWD has probably been carried north by elk and deer
wandering from Colorado into Wyoming, but he thinks the first cases
discovered in his state were caused by wild deer coming into contact
with his CWD-infected facility. "They're all focused around our
research facility." Kreeger believes his facility was infected by deer
brought in from the infected Colorado facility.

Canadian cattle, bison killed as safety measure
---------------------------------------------------------
Cattle and bison have been exterminated as part of the chronic wasting
disease cleanup. The animals grazed on the same pasture as elk
infected with chronic wasting disease. But Canadian Food Inspection
Agency officials say there is no evidence those species can contract
the elk disease and the extermination is just an act of supreme
caution. "There is currently no scientific evidence that chronic
wasting disease affects cattle or bison," said CFIA official George
Luterbach. "There may be some people who would like to use this in a
malaligned (sic) way to suggest that chronic wasting disease is a
disease of cattle, or that the other livestock industries have been
put at risk here. That clearly is not our intention here," said
Luterbach during the Saskatchewan Elk Breeders Association convention.

The CFIA has exterminated 259 cattle and 99 bison because they grazed
on pastures that had been used by infected elk on a Lloydminster farm.
That farm is considered the source of the outbreak in Saskatchewan.
The CFIA considers that  land so contaminated that it may permanently
be banned for elk. The cattle and bison were put down, not because the
CFIA thinks there is evidence they could have developed the disease,
but because no one has yet proven cattle can't get the disease.

"Should evidence come out 5 years from now I'm going to stand here and
say that it was a bit of a gamble and it cost a bit of money, but I
think we did the right thing," said Luterbach. The cattle, bison and
elk industries all supported the slaughter.

The CFIA has not yet ruled the CWD outbreak over. As testing expanded,
it found one more infected animal. The 400-head herd that the infected
animal was part of, as well as 32 animals sold from the herd to 10
other farms, will be exterminated and studied to see if any carry the
infection. Luterbach said the outbreak is still limited to animals
connected to one herd that became infected in 1989-90. "There's no
evidence that we have a multi-source situation."

As the traceouts have moved out from the original herd and closer in
time to when animals moved, the number of infected animals discovered
has plummeted. Luterbach doesn't expect to find more infected elk in
so-far uninfected herds. "These animals (now being traced out) one
could almost assume will be negative because their exposure was for a
relatively short period of time."

Clearly we are in an era when surveillance for infectious diseases in
wildlife is an emerging field in itself.  While it is not always clear what
the implications of epidemic infectious diseases in wildlife are for human
populations, it is clear that humans are often "unlucky" victims of
parasites in search of new niches.  For public health officials this
creates the difficult task of deciding which diseases are important and
what to do about them.  Often diseases that have achieved a significant
morbidity and mortality among human or valuable livestock populations are
prioritized for public health intervention.

In the case of chronic wasting disease in elk, it would seem that despite
efforts to understand the epidemiology of this disease, there is quite a
lot that we do not know.  We do know that it is relatively rare, but it
would appear that (at the very least) we are detecting more cases among
domesticated elk herds in recent years.  While there are apparent public
health interventions to educate hunters about consumption of emaciated
animals, is anyone aware of how clearly and how often those messages are
given to hunters?  Obviously there is no direct evidence of
transmissibility to humans.  However, hunters are the most likely consumers
(other than coyotes, wolves, or buzzards) of wild elk.

Are hunters to suspect only animals with overt signs of disease? What would
those signs be?  Emaciation would seem a relatively vague term to a hunter
who just harvested an animal that they had spent thousands of dollars to
pursue.  Could subclinical or unrecognized CWD lead to transmission to humans?

Is information available to hunters at the time of hunter education or
licensure?  Those would seem the most appropriate times to train individual
hunters about what to look for.  Pictures of diseased animals with clear
clinical signs could be offered for reference.  Also, since the hunter
guiding industry is big business, consider requiring guides to obtain some
basic training in recognizing CWD.  Although this may be a difficult task,
educating guides to recognize clear signs of disease would provide
additional aid to the under-funded wildlife health programs.  These seem
like interventions that could have a significant impact on enhancing
surveillance for this disease in wild game.

As an avid hunter and professional in public health, it would be
interesting to know what the experts on CWD have to say.

In response to Dr. Sauders request for information about how hunters are
informed about chronic wasting disease (CWD) we have the following comments:

Both the Colorado Division of Wildlife and the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department provide information to hunters about CWD in a variety of ways,
including press releases and interviews resulting in dissemination of
information about CWD in local newspapers (some of which have been picked
up and posted on-line by ProMED-mail); publication of information about CWD
in
agency magazines and newspapers; local radio spots and programs discussing
CWD; production of a video about CWD which has been shown to hunters at
expositions; posting information about CWD on the web sites of both
agencies; providing information about CWD in hunting license application
packets; individual letters to hunters providing information about CWD and
how to get harvested animals tested; contacts with hunters that harvest CWD
test positive animals; and publications in the scientific literature.

The recommendations to deer and elk hunters in the CWD endemic area
(limited to southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado) are not
dependent upon their recognizing sick animals (though hunters are clearly
encouraged not to harvest animals sick animals -- whether they be in the
CWD endemic area or not).  Recommendations are based on prudence in the
face of some uncertainty and avoiding contact with tissues containing the
potentially infectious agent.  The recommendations include wearing latex or
rubber gloves when dressing harvested deer or elk and washing up
afterwards; avoiding contact with brain and spinal cord; discarding the
head, spine, spleen, and lymph nodes; and boning the meat when cutting and
packaging the venison.

A few additional comments. Chronic wasting disease is actually quite rare
in free-ranging elk (<1 percent of hunter harvested animals surveyed); it
is more
common in deer.  And although coyotes may well consume deer and elk in the
CWD endemic area, wolves are still quite a long way away from southeastern
Wyoming and northeastern Colorado.
