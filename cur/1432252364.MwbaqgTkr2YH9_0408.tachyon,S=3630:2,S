They require the forger to have access to the format used
by the fingerprint storage system, not that that's _too_ hard.
They also require that a minimum-wage security guard
be able to do fingerprint matching, which says that the
system needs to be automated and somewhat error-tolerant.

Besides, run this sort of scam on the public for very long,
and you *will* have a database of fingerprints -
not hard to put on line.

The main thing it accomplishes is that it somewhat reduces theft
of ID cards, and forces people who lose their Internal Passport
to keep getting new ones with their own fingerprints
or use better fake documentation when they reapply.
