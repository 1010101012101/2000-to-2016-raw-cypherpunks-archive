Jim Choate has been in a filter on my mail which dumps all his posts into a
"Junk" folder along with anything containing the words "Get Rich Quick,"
"Miracle Penis Enlargement" or "The Internet Spy" for at least six weeks.
Six wonderfully silent weeks.

Every once in a while I see "Choate" sneak through when someone quotes him
(the last time was this LSAT business he chickened out of).

When I saw this post above I peeked at the "Junk" folder and found a host of
legal commentary by Jim Choate, none of which, of course, shows any sign
that he has bothered to so much as peek at any of the cases involved, or
even bother to read the entirety (or majority) of the content in my posts.

It does reaffirm that Mr. Choate not only has no legal credentials or
expertise whatsoever but has actually strayed into territory I thought could
not possibly exist; specifically: Perfect Legal Anti-Credibility.  That is
to say that the careful reader can get an awful lot of good legal advice out
of Mr. Choate's post by merely reversing all the legal conclusions.  The
result turns out to be pretty good counsel.  Remarkable indeed.

As for Mr. Choate's posts, they are all awfully absent and I generally
consider Mr. Choate the cypherpunks village idiot of the type who
unfortunately lacks any redeeming quality in being amusing enough to provide
entertainment.  These below, however, convince me that Mr. Choate doesn't
really even have any common connection with reality whatsoever:

Mr. Choate levels the kind of accusations that, in academic circles, would
be very severe indeed.  I could get pretty upset about this- that is until I
remember it's just Mr. Choate.  If his credibility credit reports are as
anti-accurate as his legal views I take his posts as high compliment on my
astounding legal skill and acumen.

Mr. Choate insists I have some how "pulled a fast one" by avoiding the
discussion of intent, which is implicit as a requirement in all of these
cases.  This accusation puzzles me intensely.

In another of his posts he pretty much insists that I am intentionally
omitting key facts from the case cites which would show the severity of the
problem is actually far less than what I describe.  To wit:

Had Mr. Choate bothered to look up these cases he would have discovered that
the record "loss" in the medical malpractice case (Bondu v. Gurvich) was in
fact several records which were lost or otherwise misplaced at the same time
of which the plaintiff's were but one.  This is admittedly bit difficult to
discern from the appeals case, but is clear at the trial court level.

With respect to "loss" of the car in Hirsch v. General Motors it is clear to
anyone who has spent 10 minutes with the case that the car was sold, as a
matter of course, and records of the buyer not available or otherwise
"lost."  It also came out that this was the practice of the dealership with
respect to many used car purchases that were on terms other than financing
and that many used cars had been sold under the same circumstances with
respect to records and thus "lost" before and since the car in question.

As to his accusation that I avoided the intent issue I can only quote myself
from the very post which is the subject of his accusation:

I suppose what surprises me the most (and then again, doesn't considering
the source) is that Mr. Choate is (intentionally or unintentionally I'm not
quite sure) committing _precisely_ the kind of academic and intellectual
dishonesty that he accuses me of in the very act of accusing me of it,
specifically outright deleting any reference to my clear (and numerous)
discussions of intent to serve his own ends.  What's curious is how directly
transparent this would be to anyone who bothered to read my posts after
Choate's or those of Ms. Farr.  What can he hope to accomplish?  I suppose
woo the court of the lazy?

I don't know what to make of this in good faith other than that the
medication lapsed at exactly the 3 disparate moments in my post when he
caught a bit of intent discussion in my posts.  (This seems suspicious to
me, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since I believe him to be a
very sick man).

Of course, Mr. Choate is welcome to provide citations to the cases
themselves refuting my interpretations of them if he wishes.  Someone will
have to forward them to me though because after this I intend to forward all
mail with his name on it directly to the trash instead of to the "Junk"
purgatory it currently enjoys.
