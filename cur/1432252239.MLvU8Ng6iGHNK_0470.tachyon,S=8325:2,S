TIBET/CHINA: REPRESSION, HACKERS, AND MONKS Aug 10 2002

Hackers Target Chinese Media Amidst Continued Tibetan Repression

As China tries desperately to remake its image after entry into the WTO, 
the regime continues it's crackdown on Tibetan monasteries and Falun Gong 
hackers.
While China uses an imposter Panchen Lama to spead propaganda, they are 
releasing certain Tibetan political prisoners. Tanag Jigme Zangpo, an 
elderly Tibetan teacher who has spent most of the past 40 years in prison, 
has been allowed to leave Tibet and arrived in Chicago earlier this month.
At the same time, Chinese authorities in Tibet continue the destruction of 
monasteries, they have begun their own "War on Terror" by arresting Tibetan 
lamas on allegations of bomb attacks.
The regime is also battling a ever more sophisticated band of Falun Gong 
hackers and a shadowy group known as the Hong Kong Blondes. In recent 
months, various Chinese state satellite news broadcasts have been hacked 
into and replaced with video explaining to the Chinese people the 
repressive measures used by the government against non-violent Falun Gong 
members.
At the same time, people in Beijing complained of picking up their phones 
and hearing a five-minute recorded message from Falun Gong attacking the 
Chinese regime's attempts to silence the group.
Discuss this story and add more links regarding Tibet, the Falun Gong, and 
repression in China.
