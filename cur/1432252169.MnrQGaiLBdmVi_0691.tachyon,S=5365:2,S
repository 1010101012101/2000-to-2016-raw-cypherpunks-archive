The Institute for Defense Analyses, based in Alexandria, VA,
is a 50-year partner of NSA. It has two Centers for Communications
Research at Princeton, NJ, and La Jolla, CA, both doing cryptological
research for NSA:

La Jolla Covering Repository

A (v,k,t)-covering design is a collection of k-element subsets, 
called blocks, of {1,2,...,v}, such that any t-element subset is 
contained in at least one block.  This site contains a collection of 
good (v,k,t)-coverings. Each of these coverings gives an upper bound 
for the corresponding C(v,k,t), the smallest possible number of 
blocks in such a covering design.

The limit for coverings is v<100, k<=25, and t<=8 just to draw the 
line somewhere. Only coverings with at most 100000 blocks are given, 
except for some which were grandfathered in. Some Steiner systems 
(coverings in which every t-set is covered exactly once) which are 
too big for the database will be included in the link below.

What is "covering" and how does it related to cryptology?
