It has nothing to do with crypto, but a great deal to do with 
traceability.

Usually the transfer of value ultimately results in an 
adjustment in the ledgers of the federal reserve -- the 
receiving bank goes up slightly, the sending bank goes down 
slightly, and the traceability follows from the fact that the 
transaction ultimately goes through the federal reserve.  The 
FRN numbers are a backup system to trace people and banks who 
try to bypass this.

A gold transfer does not go through the federal reserve.

I can rather easily open a pecunix account with a hotmail
address.   Opening a swiss bank account is considerably harder.
