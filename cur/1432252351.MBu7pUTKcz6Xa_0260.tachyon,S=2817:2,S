Here, here!  This change, if widely adopted, would go a long way toward 
reducing war casualties.  Perhaps we may even become as smart as some 
Pacific Islanders whose wars were fought by surrogates, the logic being 
that the death of one man can serve as well as the death of many in 
determining the outcome of a disagreement between heads of tribes, states, 
etc.

It could also reduce the risk of conflict since the heads of state would 
become the first and legit targets by the opposition.   Perhaps the world 
may owe Dubbya and his ilk an unintentional debt of thanks.  Beside better 
him then me. ;-)
