National Scientific Announces Wi-Fi Enabled Version of IBUS Technology to
Track Children on School Buses

 

 

Scottsdale, AZ/June 14, 2004/Business Wire/ -- -- U.S. technology firm
National Scientific Corporation (OTCBB: NSCT) today announced a new Wi-Fi
enabled version to its IBUS school bus passenger authentication system. 
This latest product offering allows school districts to more effectively
track and identify school bus passengers.

 

By adding Wi-Fi capability to National Scientific's IBUS product, school
districts can simply and easily track students who are riding on their
school buses.  This new Wi-Fi enabled GPS data logging unit tracks the
location of buses and logs students boarding or disembarking from the bus. 
A series of strategically located Wi-Fi access points are used to securely
move that data from the school bus back to the school's online student
database.  School districts save time and money while increasing student
safety when they utilize a student tracking system such as IBUS.

 

"Wi-Fi capability significantly lowers deployment and maintenance costs by
reducing the hardware components needed for the system while streamlining
access to student security data," said Graham Clark, National Scientific
Corporation's president.   "We have a number of initiatives aimed at
simplifying Medicaid transportation reimbursement of special needs students
and when combined with our Wi-Fi IBUS technology, we believe we have a very
strong product offering that should generate a significant return on the
investment."

  

IBUS is a student tracking system, which includes an ID card reader and a
GPS module for time and location information.  Additionally this system
interfaces with any standard 802.11x Wi-Fi access points.  Complete
specifications for this product are available on the Company's website at
www.national-scientific.com.

 

National Scientific  Corporation designs and builds versatile wireless
platforms for location-sensitive applications.  The Company is a technology
leader in combining systems for indoor and outdoor positioning.  For more
