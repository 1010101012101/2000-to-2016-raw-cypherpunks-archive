The principle here is that no one should be able to prove how 
the voter voted, not even the voter. 

Yes, votes need to be verified and voters are certainly one party 
that can do it. However, you never want to allow the voter to 
take any kind of "receipt" out of the voting station if that 
receipt can be used to determine how the voter voted, e.g. by 
matching a number or pattern on the ballot, even if to the voter. 
Otherwise, vote selling and coercion cannot be prevented.

Cheers,
Ed Gerck
