The Feds may be in a maze of twisty little press releases, all different,
but if they drop it, I'd bet it's not Adobe 'abandoning" them, but
Adobe *asking* them to drop it, quietly in the back room,
trying to stop bad PR against Adobe.  It doesn't really bother the Feds -
they can get credit for being responsive to urgent requests,
they've gotten publicity for busting yet another hacker copyright thief,
and they don't have to take any heat for backing down because
they can spin it all as "Adobe's Dropping Charges".

If they *do* continue,
it's because they're getting pressure from other DMCA pushers -
they'll need to do a bit more spin, but they can handle it,
and most of the people who would object already didn't respect them.
Won't bother their public image much.  

My guess - a couple more days in custody, and they kick him out of the US.
