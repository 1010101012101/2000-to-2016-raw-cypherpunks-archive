Well, JYA apparently did send them to him :) Apparently by accident.

Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?

I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.

If Mike had uploaded them without full inspection, no problem. But, as I
understand the narrative, he knowingly uploaded them. Yes, he asked JYA
about it first. And yes, he posted to this list too. But in the end,
after getting no help, he went ahead and uploaded them.

And that, in my opinion, was unwarranted.

That is on JYA's tab, for sure ;)

As much as I hate waiting on the team reviewing Snowden's cache, I
generally agree on the importance of redaction to protect innocents.
Wikileaks redacts too. That's the lesson here, in my opinion.

True. We're all responsible for our own OPSEC.

But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?

I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.

I don't quite get what this is such a big deal. I've always assumed that
the Five Eyes etc intercept everything that they can. But there are so
many possible sources. Maybe GCHQ got the data from JYA's ISP. Or maybe
from their ISP. Or maybe from Cryptome archives. Or maybe from a bunch
of sources. Am I missing something here?

So what is the point?
