   No, that would be taxing the WAN, not the LAN. Which, BTW, they already do,
both fed and state. Not by throughput, per se, but there's a tax on the lines,
the T1's or whatever. 
   If they tax the actual LANs, they would either have to mandate a bit meter on
each LAN, or, if they are talking about a property type tax --- hmm, that could
actually be a GoodThing@ -- think about it, a property tax on the LAN would mean
that companies would be reluctant to buy new hardware, and, as their computers
aged, they'd naturally migrate to linux to be able to get decent speed out of
the ancient cpus. 8-)
