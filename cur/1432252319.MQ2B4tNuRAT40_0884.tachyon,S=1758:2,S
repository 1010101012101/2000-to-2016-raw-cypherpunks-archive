Well, of course CNN is showing all of the Iraqis pulling down the Saddam 
Hussein statues.

What they SHOULD do is take the real Saddam (or one of his clones) and throw 
him to the Kurds. CNN could show the Kurds tearing Saddam to shreds like a 
pack of Wolves. A very fitting ending to the turd as well as Grade-A primo 
agit-prop for the masses.
