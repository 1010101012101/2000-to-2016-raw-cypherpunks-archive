The ban on Teddie flying had nothing to do with natsec. Years
ago it was tried due to his being drunk and his stench of piss, vomit
and scotch. Later, it was tried due to his being drunk, stinking, and 
too fat to fit in a single seat, demanding two or more, depending 
on whether he could be propped upright. Nobody from the
Kennedy clan could or would travel with him. Aides had to
go ahead to prepare the way for public "Irish strut-stagger," 
so Kennedy never got refused until he was ready to make a 
federal case about it.

To be sure, members of both parties behave in public as pigs 
at trough, laced with whiskey or dope or tranquilizers or all.

Ban them from public transport, which they use only occasionally
to appear to be a little piggy, pray for frayed wiring on their 
private means of transport.
