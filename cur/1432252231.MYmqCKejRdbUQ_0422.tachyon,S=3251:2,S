Thank you for posting these John.

I am about 1/2 way through them, and I
am struck by how crude the "computer
forensic" examinations are (see part 2, around page 270).  The government
examiners seem to have very little
understanding how a computer actually
works, but instead, rely on "out box" and "in box" and O/S time stamps, etc.

There seems to be no understanding by Leen
either, and I would have thought Bell
would be trying to make him understand
while this persecution was progressing.

Since when is an examination a thourough
one without a sector by sector and bit
by bit combing?  And since when has an O/S time stamp become trustworthy?

While it is obvious from the transcripts
that Tanner was more than a little biased
in favor of the prosecution, it sure looks
like Bell did his fair share to insure a
conviction.
