 CALL FOR PAPERS

 Ninth International Conference
 February 28-March 3, 2005
 Roseau, The Commonwealth Of Dominica

Submissions Due Date: September 10, 2004

Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'05) is the premier
international forum for research, advanced development, education,
exploration, and debate regarding security in the context of finance and
commerce. We have augmented our conference title and expanded our scope to
cover all aspects of securing transactions and systems. These aspects
include a range of technical areas such as: cryptography, payment systems,
secure transaction architectures, software systems and tools, user and
operator interfaces, fraud prevention, payment systems, secure IT
infrastructure, and analysis methodologies. Our focus will also encompass
legal, financial, business and policy aspects. Material both on theoretical
(fundamental) aspects of securing systems and on secure applications and
real-world deployments will be considered.

The conference goal is to bring together top cryptographers, data-security
specialists, and scientists with economists, bankers, implementers, and
policy makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC'05 program will
feature invited talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations,
and panel discussions. This conference is organized annually by the
International Financial Cryptography Association (IFCA).

Original papers and presentations on all aspects of financial and commerce
security are invited. Submissions must have a visible bearing on financial
and commerce security issues, but can be interdisciplinary in nature and
need not be exclusively concerned with cryptography or security. Possible
topics for submission to the various sessions include, but are not limited
to:

* Anonymity and Privacy
 * Auctions
 * Audit and Auditability
 * Authentication and Identification, including Biometrics
 * Certification and Authorization
 * Commercial Cryptographic Applications
 * Commercial Transactions and Contracts
 * Digital Cash and Payment Systems
 * Digital Incentive and Loyalty Systems
 * Digital Rights Management
 * Financial Regulation and Reporting
 * Fraud Detection
 * Game Theoretic Approaches to Security
 * Infrastructure Design
 * Legal and Regulatory Issues
 * Microfinance and Micropayments
 * Monitoring, Management and Operations
 * Reputation Systems
 * RFID-Based and Contactless Payment Systems
 * Risk Assessment and Management
 * Secure Banking
 * Secure Financial Web Services
 * Securing Emerging Computational Paradigms
 * Security and Risk Perceptions and Judgments
 * Security Economics
 * Smart Cards and Secure Tokens
 * Trust Management
 * Trustability and Trustworthiness
 * Underground-Market Economics
 * Usability and Acceptance of Security Systems
 * User and Operator Interfaces



 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
 =======================

FC'05 is inviting submissions in three categories:

 (1) research papers,
 (2) systems and applications presentations,
 (3) panel sessions.

 For all accepted submissions, at least one author must attend the
conference and present the work.

Research Papers
 ===============
 Research papers should describe novel scientific contributions to the
field, and they will be subject to vigorous peer review. Papers can be a
maximum of 15 pages in length (including references and appendices), and
accepted submissions will be published in full in the conference
proceedings. Submission of previously published material and simultaneous
submission of papers to other conferences or workshops with proceedings is
not permitted. Authors of research papers found to be doubly submitted risk
having all their submissions withdrawn from consideration as well as other
appropriate sanctions.

Systems and Application Presentations
 =====================================
 Submissions in this category should describe novel or successful systems
with an emphasis on secure digital commerce applications. Presentations may
concern commercial systems, academic prototypes, or open-source projects
for any of the topics listed above. Where appropriate, software or hardware
demonstrations are encouraged as part of the presentations in these
sessions. Contributions must reflect careful thought and effort and provide
valuable, up-to-date experience that is relevant to practitioners in the
fields of financial cryptography and data security. Submissions in this
category should consist of a short summary of the work (1-6 pages in
length) to be reviewed by the Program Committee, along with a short
biography of the presenters. Accepted submissions will be presented at the
conference (25 minutes per presentation), and a one-page abstract will be
published in the conference proceedings.

Panel Sessions
 ==============
 Proposals for panel sessions are also solicited, and should include a
brief description of the panel as well as prospective participants. Panel
proposals should be submitted via e-mail, in plain ASCII format, to the
Program Chairs. Accepted panel sessions will be presented at the
conference, and each participant will contribute a one-page abstract to be
published in the conference proceedings.

The Rump Session
 ================
 FC'05 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program
of short (5-7 minute), informal presentations on works in progress,
off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any
conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session
Chair (to be announced). This submission should consist of a talk title,
the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract.
Submissions may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person through the
Monday of the conference.

 Preparation Instructions
 ========================
 Submissions to the research papers and systems/application presentation
categories must be received by the due date. Papers must be formatted in
standard PostScript, PDF format, or MS Word. Submissions in other formats
will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to
the instructions and forms found on this web site. (Specific instructions
for electronic submissions will be published in the near future.)

Author names and affiliations on submissions must be explicit. In other
words, submitted papers should not be anonymized. Submissions must include
on the first page the title of the paper, the names and affiliations of all
authors, a brief abstract, and a list of topical keywords. Accepted
submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published
in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series
after the conference, so the submissions must be formatted in the standard
LNCS format. Authors of accepted submissions will be required to complete
and sign an IFCA copyright form. A pre-proceedings volume containing
preliminary versions of the papers will be distributed at the conference.

Questions about all conference submissions should be directed to the
Program Chairs.
