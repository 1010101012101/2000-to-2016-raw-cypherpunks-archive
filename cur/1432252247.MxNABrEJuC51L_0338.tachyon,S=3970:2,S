New ALP Sell-Out Completes Capitulation
on Defence Amendment Bill

'Shoot to Kill Bill' set to pass the Senate with no safeguards

The ALP today completed its capitulation to the Government by accepting new
Government amendments to Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian
Authorities) Bill, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

"The ALP has refused to accept Greens amendments that would guarantee troops
could never be called out against a peaceful protest or industrial dispute,"
Senator Brown said. 

"On top of that they have watered down their already weak amendments.
Previously the ALP amendment had said that once called out the troops could
not be used unless there was 'a direct and immediate threat of death or
serious injury'.  These words have been replaced by "reasonable likelihood
of death or serious injury".

"Now, in a stunning overnight turnaround, the ALP has accepted a new
government amendment that would allow troops to be used against civilians
when there is 'serious damage to property'.  This gives the government and
military free reign to call out the troops because in almost every situation
'serious damage to property' could be envisaged. 

"This is a backflip on sell-out on back-down. Labor has failed to defend a
century of law and convention in Australia which has prevented the Defence
forces from being involved in armed conflict with civilians.

"The bill will now pass into law with no sunset clause, and no real
safeguard that would prevent troops being used on strikers and peaceful
protestors
