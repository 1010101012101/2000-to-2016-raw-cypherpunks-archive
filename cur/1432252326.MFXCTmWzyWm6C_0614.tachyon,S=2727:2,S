I seem to recall a news item which indicated that the arguments for this
case have already been made.  The claim was made by the cops that it was to
protect the fetus' health, to which one SC Justice  (female; don't recall
which one) responded by. in effect, saying that by the time the test was
made (presumably, shortly before birth) the damage, if any, had already been
done.

I think this practice will fail, for the predictable reasons.
