As long as they are honest about where they are coming from.  However,
spammers have a nasty habit of lying about their return address.  (And the
sysadmin of that domain gets to wade through the mountains of shit-mail
and hell caused by pissed off people.)  Either that or they hijack open
relays and cause those servers to crawl to their knees, as well as the
above headaches for the site admins of the effected servers.

I have had to clean up the mess from a couple of spammers doing the above.
(As well as the problems caused by clueless sales people at a company I
once worked for.)  

Not fun.
