Some time back there was a thread
on obtaining DNA samples via
normally shed particles in the
air behind you.

Found this:
FEED: Theres been some talk of using the aura sniffer to do DNA analysis. 

    GS: Yeah. But mitochondrial DNA -- not nuclear DNA. Were releasing skin all the time, so its not like
    being requested to give a DNA sample and having to give consent. You cant keep your skin from coming
    off. So it is possible to sample mitochondrial DNA from the airborne skin flakes. Of course, before this was
    ever done it would have to go through the same rigorous procedure and scrutiny by the ACLU and so forth
    that the other technology does. Im not advocating it. Im just saying that the possibility exists. The
    possibility also exists to sample a wide variety of medical conditions non-obtrusively. And I think that could
    end up being a valuable instrument for medical diagnosis.
