Not sure if it is what you are asking - but a HTTP proxy doesn't handle
the SSL; it simply forwards the packets to the destination site, and
forwards the reply back to you; the SSL encryption is handled by your
machine and the server (the proxy doesn't touch it)
In theory, if your corporate force-included its own root key into your
browser, they could generate their own certificates on the fly and have
it work transparently - but checking who issued the cert would show that
up.
