With the rise of the Internet spying has become as ubiquitous as
motherhood and apple pie, no longer the dark world of official spies.

The Internet has made covert spying available to everyone along
with sanctimonious deniability just like the world of spooks.

Running a mail list is spying. Running a hosting service is spying.
Running a website is spying. Running a blog is sphing. Running a
network is spying. Running an email service is spying. Running a
keyserver is spying. Running an anonymizer is spying. Running
an academic data collector is spying. Offering free apps is spying.
Offering free comsec is spying.

Open source is spying. Lurking on fora is spying. Prowling Twitter,
Facebook, Reddit, Slashdot, SM, chat, OTR, Tor, the surface
net and deepnet gamut, is spying.

Baiting and arguing and flattering to induce dislosure is spying.
Hanging, recording, videoing, texting, at gatherings, conferences,
Blackhats, Defcons, RSAs, protests, squats, mash-ups, is spying.

Leaking and sharing in the public interest is spying.

Defending leakers and hackers and protestors is spying.

Accusing and blaming official spies is counterspying, that
is spying.

Journalism is spying, along with every profession, they all
spy.

Watching porn is spying, and how!

The public is not indifferent about spying, it is the principal
public past-time and often full-time. Thanks to the Internet and
a slew of personal devices spying has become better than
sex, better than gambling, better than drugs and liquor,
done openly and secretly, here there and everywhere.

Damn fine way to boost the digital economy, and if done well
earns a freedom of information award and a place in the
harem of a billionaire.
