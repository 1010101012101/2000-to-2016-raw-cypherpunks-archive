This week's Economist has an article which claims that Canada's cattle 
industry is losing $7.8 million (not sure if this is USD or CAD) per day 
due to the boycott.  Japan has also restricted Canadian imports and has 
told the U.S. that if it starts re-importing Canadian beef it will restrict 
U.S imports as well because there is inadequate tracking of livestock once 
they enter the U.S.  The article claims Canada is getting its just deserts 
for its earlier quick restrictions on Japanese and British BSE.
