Clearly you should make a request for the source code for the the Promis
software as used by the FBI. It's public domain.

</span>reply(appeal):<br>

I reject and demand appeal of your rejection of this request.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, please recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly<br>
USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193), for which this Glomar response<br>
is so named, was a purely military operation, using custom-built<br>
military equipment, on an exceptionally sensitive military mission to<br>
recover military equipment. Observe that the &quot;Vulnerabilities Equities=
<br>
Process&quot; is a public outreach activity communicating with third party<=
br>
partners, acting in the public interest regarding software used by<br>
public citizens and business alike - a scenario at opposite ends and<br>
means from which this denial blindly overreaches.<br>
<br>
Second, observe that existing precedent supports the release of<br>
materials responsive to this request. In American Civil Liberties<br>
Union v. Department of Defense Case No: 04-CV-4151 (ACLU v. DoD) the<br>
courts have affirmed the public interest as compelling argument for<br>
favoring the public interest against clearly military efforts. The<br>
Glomar denial should be well targeted; this targeted falls well<br>
outside of the the &quot;Vulnerabilities Equities Process&quot;, which is a=
<br>
public outreach activity communicating with third party partners,<br>
acting in the public interest, regarding software used by public<br>
citizens and business alike.<br>
<br>
Third, consider that it is a well established technique in the<br>
information security industry to identify the origin and nature of a<br>
defect discovery and disclosure timeline. This information is used for<br>
myriad of secondary research, analysis, and automation efforts<br>
spanning numerous industries. The utility of of disclosure timeline<br>
information and context has decades of rich support and strong<br>
evidence of public interest benefit, particularly regarding long<br>
reported and fixed defects, such as this one, which has patches<br>
available for over a year.<br>
<br>
Fourth, observe that every hour of expert opinion coupled with legal<br>
review amounts to a non-trivial expenditure of hours which are a sunk,<br>
throw away cost of FOIA communication. While as a taxpayer I<br>
appreciate the service of FOIA professionals such as those involved in<br>
this request, who provide tireless effort the all hundreds of millions<br>
of US citizens, my personal cost should be recognized. For this reason<br>
a deference in favor of public interest and disclosure is well<br>
supported for this request regarding the &quot;Vulnerabilities Equities<br>
Process&quot;, which is a public outreach activity communicating with third=
<br>
party partners, acting in the public interest, regarding software used<br>
by public citizens and business alike.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time, and best regards,<br>
