This is helpful, Adam, thanks.

This is good too, Bill.

All right, I can generally understand the purpose here, to make it 
impossible to correlate an old coin with a new one issued in its place. 
  That I can see.  I was starting to get the impression that somehow the 
Chaumian techniques were attempting to address the problem of 
preventing double spends even when doing a long chain of spends without 
contact with a server.  In fact they are trying to address a more 
modest goal than that, and double spends are still something that must 
be detected by contact with the server.

With the Chaumian techniques, the random coin bits are generated on the 
user side:

So naturally the server cannot keep a list of the valid coins because 
their specific bits appear to be invented out there in the wild.  Hence 
keeping the list of spent coins, since keeping a list of unspent coins 
is clearly impossible.

Well hell, that wasn't so hard.
