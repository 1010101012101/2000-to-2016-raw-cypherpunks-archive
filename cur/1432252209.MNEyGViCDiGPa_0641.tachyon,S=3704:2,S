yeah, better than nothing, but how far do you trust a faceless corp
peddling closed source warez?  (same goes for Google, etc.  the recent
announcement to make zPhone open source is a big win IMHO)

i'd love to see a high order analysis of these 256bit nonces used for
keying skype.  use of entropy on windoze has traditionally been pretty
poor.

my favorite example to date: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/newtcp/ -
"Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis"

p.s.  speaking of google, can we all agree they are well on the path
of evil?  logging all chats?  multiple computer search?  glad i only
use gmail for public comms...
