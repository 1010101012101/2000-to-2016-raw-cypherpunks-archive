  Ironically, this comes from one who uses an obvious (but unsigned!) nym.

She/he/it/they criticizes others for "won't sign your name" posts, while 
we have no way of knowing who she/he/it/they is/are.

This entity also claims the list is polluted with pseudonymous and 
anonymous posts.

Ironically, I agree.
