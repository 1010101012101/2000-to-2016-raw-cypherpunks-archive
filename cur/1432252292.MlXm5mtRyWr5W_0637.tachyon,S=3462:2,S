'Unbreakable' quantum cryptography hacked without detection using lasers
Security

Oslo (Norway) - A Norwegian University of Science student named Vadim  
Makarov has discovered a vulnerability in what was previously thought  
to be unbreakable quantum encryption. He is using a form of high  
intensity laser light to intercept the encrypted data stream covertly.  
While quantum encryption is regularly used to secure Swiss bank  
transactions, as well as their much publicized 2007 election results,  
Makarov claims it's easily hacked. He claims to have developed a black  
box device which he says, "turns the equipment into a puppet-box that  
an eavesdropper can control."

Quantum encryption is a complex process wherein a stream of paired  
photons are created at the source. Each has a specific and unique  
quantum signature that can be detected. The sender and receiver both  
obtain a secret key used to encrypt the message, without which the  
message is lost. This form of encryption can be used to determine if  
the message was intercepted en route. It won't tell who intercepted  
it, only that it was intercepted. And this form of encryption is often  
relied upon to insure privacy and security. And now it appears it may  
all be for naught.

According to Makarov, the secret is in the way the sender and receiver  
communicate their secret key. And it is exactly here where the exploit  
can be found.

His team demonstrated that it is possible to allow the entire  
transmission to go from sender to receiver without being altered or an  
intrusion being detected. The intruder simply hooks into what the  
receiver is receiving (which is actually very complex). Then, by  
continuing to monitor the follow-on communications back and forth from  
sender to receiver wherein the secret key is obtained, the intruder is  
able to decode the transmission without ever having been detected.

Makarov and his colleagues say they have developed systems that can  
defeat two out of the three primary forms of quantum encryption used  
today. And their research is continuing on the third.
