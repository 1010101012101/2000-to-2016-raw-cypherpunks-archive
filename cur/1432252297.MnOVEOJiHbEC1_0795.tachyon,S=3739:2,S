I think you just made Satoshi Nakamoto the most well protected person in
history.

Well played psy-ops my friend.

That's almost as good as the hypothetical game big (insert your boogeyman
here) might be playing with Putin to make him think Bitcoin is a NSA/CIA
operation to ruin the ruble.

I'd rather be a Satoshi than a Vladimir right now.
