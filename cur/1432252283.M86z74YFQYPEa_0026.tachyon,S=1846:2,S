It is a fact that those who protest the loudest engage in
what they protest against, which is why they scream for
attention to their inversion.

Saith Sigmund Freud, a pederast, little girls sometimes,
boys will do, but best of all polymorphous perversion.

Freud's insight is amply exhibited here, but also at
DoD, State and Saturday AM radio huzzanahs to the
peaceloving peoples of the world: meaning gold-plated 
CEOs, wealth hoarders, ragers against ill-blamed
inheritors of the plundered planet.

You hear somebody call for birth control among the
heathen, to slaughter the procreaters, grab your wallet, 
chastity belt your cute little daughter for the sonsbitches
who want it all are coming to hurt you and yours as if
a birthright of supremacists.

That's what Santorum is braying of his kind.
