You do a disservice to crypto and our group by implying, even in a
backhanded way, that Bell's "AP" system was or is in any way feasible. 
Where's the true untraceable cash needed? Please explain. --Tim May

After the 'soft drilling' section of AP it becomes an exercise in mass 
civil disobedience(led by a charismatic
community leader?)Also trust, in that untracable digital cash is not 
strictly needed.Merely enough trustworthy
netizens to promise to send their pledge to the 'predictor'who remains 
anonymous.

eg.60 million netizens pledge 1$ each on a newswire somewhere that doesnt 
keep logs.I actually got a pledge
of 1$ to wax rich armitage like a candle,Its a lot of fun.Theres still a 
lot of free range banks out there.
