The New Craft of Intelligence
Robert David Steele
REVIEW Draft

Select quotes:
--------------
o "We are wasting today at least $10 billion a year on secret technical
intelligence collection systems whose fruits cannot be harvested, and we are
about to waste $60 billion over ten years recapitalizing these same secret
technical collection systems, so that we might collect 100 times more
information, and process still less of it."

o "The center of gravity for both national security and national prosperity
lie now in the private sector and its intellectual property as well as its
accumulated knowledge.  The concepts of noosphere (Pierre Tielhard de
Chardin) and "world brain" (H.G. Wells) are now an imminent reality, and the
World Intelligence Center envisioned by Quincy Wright is achievable."

o "Eighth, the President must eliminate export restrictions on encryption
and recognize that the greatest opportunity of all faces us.  We can raise
the Internet's security level to where it can handle Presidential
communications.  The moment we do that, we embrace the world and make it
possible for an extraordinary variety of multilateral relationships to bloom
in cyberspace."
