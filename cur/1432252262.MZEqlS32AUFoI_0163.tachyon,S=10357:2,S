a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any te|ephone, not just

button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of

respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce|lu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
