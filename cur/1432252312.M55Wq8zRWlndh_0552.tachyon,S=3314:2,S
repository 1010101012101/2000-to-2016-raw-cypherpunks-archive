I strongly doubt this. "Fair use" is not about setting up alternate 
publishing schemes, but is about quoting relevant sections, collecting 
material for research purposes, etc.

If it were as broad as you claim, why would _any_ school buy textbooks 
for its students when it could make a photocopy for a fraction of the 
cost? Schools could simply digitize textbooks once and then distribute 
them on CD-ROM.

I'm not a copyright expert, but I strongly doubt what you say above.
