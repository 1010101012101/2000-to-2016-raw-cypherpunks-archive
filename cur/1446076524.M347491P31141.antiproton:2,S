I support and respect your choices.

I say money is not something a sane person should want or not want,
for itself. Money is a tool in our present "reality".

I don't "want any money", but I do want to travel here and there and
connect to the internet to type with you. At the moment I need certain
amounts of money to facilitate achieving these things.

I don't have a TV - stopped watching 30+ years ago as a teenager as I
found so much awesome stuff to read and learn, including the
creativity I felt when learning to program a computer. Doing for the
sake of enjoyment - climbing a tree was as enjoyable as typing in the
next BASIC program, or some years prior, collecting a large pile of
golden treasure grass (hay).

A good thing of course. Perhaps a maker workshop within your travel
capability would appeal to you?

Is the essence of your point to "be mindful" - whether travel, food,
things? It is remotely conceivable to me that being mindful might
possibly contribute to a fuller and more meaningful and relaxed
existence.

Oh, yes, you, would :)
