Nope.  As long as key1 and key2 are independent, this can't make things 
worse if the cipher is any good.

Suppose there is no attack on

blowfish(plaintext,key1),

but there is an attack on

blowfish(blowfish(plaintext,key1),key2)

when the two keys are independent.  As an attacker, you automatically get 
an attack on

blowfish(plaintext,key1)

from this, by just choosing a random key2, encrypting the ciphertext from 
single-blowfish with that key, and then forgetting key2 and applying your 
attack on double-blowfish.
