Cheers,

As all humans, RMS has something to be trolled about.

Besides the GNU stuff, IMHO he is underestimated for GCC.

Without GCC, besides linux, likely neither *BSD nor
Apple would exist in its present form.

<TROLL>
It was fun trolling *BSD fanbois about GCC, like:

Q: Dude/Chick, your BASE still infiltrated by GNU,
do you ship GCC?
A: Errrr, We'll switch to CLANG soon, just testing
Q: What about building ALL ports/packages?
A: (silence)
(repeat next year).

For Apple powerusers, we asked something like: how comes
$grep -r __gnu_ / 2>/dev/null
returns so many hits?

</TROLL>
