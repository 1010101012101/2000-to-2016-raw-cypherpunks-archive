Pneumonia is a symptom, not an infectuous agent, describing an
inflammation (and often accumulation of fluids) in the lungs.  Mortality
is high unless treated, frequently with antibiotics.  Infectious agents
include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  Noninfectious causes include oil
aspiration, radiation, chemicals, vegetable dusts, and silo-filler's
disease (Source:  Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary).=20

Legioniare's disease is caused by a bacterial infection:

    http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/ideas/factsht/legion.htm

    Legionellosis is an acute bacterial disease caused by Legionella
    pneumophila, a poorly staining, Gram-negative bacillus commonly
    found in water. Of the fourteen currently recognized serogroups of
    L. pneumophila bacteria, serogroup 1 is most commonly associated
    with outbreaks and sporadic cases of legionellosis. Legionellosis
    may occur in two primary forms: Legionnaire's disease and Pontiac
    fever. Legionnaire's disease is the most common form of
    legionellosis.

Peace.
