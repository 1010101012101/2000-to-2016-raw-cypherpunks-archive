@OpDeathEatersUS on Twitter says -
https://twitter.com/OpDeathEatersUS/status/619267423749828608 - that
Hacking Team sells child porn evidence fabrication tools, and cites this
code -
https://github.com/hackedteam/rcs-common/blob/master/lib/rcs-common/evidence/file.rb#L17
- in support of the claim.

Can someone more programming-proficient than I look at the code and tell
me 1) what it does overall, and 2) what the highlighted line - which
mentions "childporn.avi" and "pedoporno.mpg" - does in particular?

Here's some background:

http://www.wired.com/2015/07/fbi-spent-775k-hacking-teams-spy-tools-since-2011/

>From the Ars Technica article:

===
According to one spreadsheet first reported by Wired, the FBI paid
Hacking Team more than $773,226.64 since 2011 for services related to
the Hacking Team product known as "Remote Control Service," which is
also marketed under the name "Galileo." One spreadsheet column listed
simply as "Exploit" is marked "yes" for a sale in 2012, an indication
Hacking Group may have bundled some sort of attack code that remotely
hijacked targets' computers or phones. Previously, the FBI has been
known to have wielded a Firefox exploit to decloak child pornography
suspects using Tor.

Security researchers have also scoured leaked Hacking Team source code
for suspicious behavior. Among the findings, the embedding of references
to child porn in code related to the Galileo.

Thanks,

Douglas
