There are a bunch of projects that either work on or have completed
integration of PGP at the MTA-level. A post to the OpenPGP lists should
round up the candidates. Either way, I agree with Eric that turning on
STARTTLS support in MTA's has become so easy that I would be hard
pressed to come up with reasons why one wouldn't. I know that enabling
STARTTLS is trivial in postfix and I am told that STARTTLS ships with
exim and at least the Debian build of sendmail.

Either way, I would recommend to first enable STARTTLS in your MTA and
only after that start looking at PGP integrations. (I fully understand
that STARTTLS and PGP fulfill different needs and address different
thread models).
