No, that was a definition. I made no statement about how users take to
passphrases, and vendors implementing this unwelcome feature.

Works well for me, though.

I agree. It doesn't mean signing (whether in MUA or MTA level) is useless.
Only a tiny fraction of all systems is compromised, and if those systems use
signed mail blocking them is actually easier (generating new keys on an 0wn3d
machine introduces extra degrees of complication, and limits the rate of
mail sent). If this is adopted on a large scale, nonsigned mail would
automatically increase the spam scoring function, further speeding adoption.

Parsing headers is problematic, and signatures work at user, not at IP level
(there are public mail services which serve millions of users with just a few
IPs). You can as well sign at MTA level, if users are authenticated, and each
of
them has a signature.

Every exploitable system will be exploited, if a sufficient incentive is
present. You can't get around the fact that we need to modify the
infrastructure. Specifically for spam, facultative strong authentication is a
part of a solution (there is no single solution, because it's a complex,
adaptive problem).

When I get virus mail from someone who has my email in my address book, it
would be nice if that mail was signed, so I could contact her, and tell her
she has a problem.

Facultative strong authentication doesn't nuke anonynimity. It does shift it
into darker, seedier corners of communication, though. Which is only natural:
trolls thrive on anonymity, giving it a bad rap. Which is why we need a nym
supporting infrastructure.
