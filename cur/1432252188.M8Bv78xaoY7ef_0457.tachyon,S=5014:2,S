yes, this reminded me of another brilliant idea.

Why don't some cars have a little tiny furnace for stash destruction?

If you've got an on-board stash and some Alabama hillbilly with a badge 
pulls you over, you just hit the button and have you're little stashed 
incinerated. Who cares if the badge knows you USED TO have something on 
board? Too late now if any trace of evidence is gone.

What's wrong with this idea?
