Your bigotry got some boost this morning (cypherpunk readers may be amused
to know what nazi methods you advocate for homeless).

You stupid american fuck, ownership is very relative term and enforced by guns,
like you are owned by state of california and USG at the same time, and you
do complain about that, don't you ?

You really whine only because you are not on top - you do not really have
problem with those below you (I understand you live on a farm .. must have some
pigs there) suffering because they don't have guns.
