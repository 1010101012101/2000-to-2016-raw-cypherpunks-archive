About a year ago I got on a plane and flew cross country with an 
empty .22LR case wedged in the cleats of my boots.  I discovered it 
in the hotel while polishing my boots (had a wedding to attend the 
next morning) and was amused.

I guess they'd pick that up now, and I'd spend a few hours in the 
back with nurse ratchet and a box of rubber gloves.
