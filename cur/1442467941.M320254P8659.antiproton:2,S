=C2=A0Not exactly. =C2=A0Generally, ECC with enough correction bits will at=
 least detect all double-bit errors, although it will not correct those err=
ors. =C2=A0And I can't say for sure how generally this is in use, but I thi=
nk a competently-designed ECC system will use the regular refresh cycles to=
 "sweep" for correctable single-bit errors, and correct virtually all of th=
em, before they turn into double-bit errors.

However, the profusion of corrected single-bit can be used to alert, and un=
correctable double-bit errors will probably cause =C2=A0a system exception =
that will inform the system operator that something is going on.
Remember, it is likely that different manufacturer's DRAM designs might dif=
fer in sensitivity to rowhammer (or other deliberate failure mode) by a fac=
tor of 10:1, 100:1, or even 1000:1. =C2=A0 The word can, and will, quickly =
