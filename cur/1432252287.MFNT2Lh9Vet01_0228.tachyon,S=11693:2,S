I refer you to RFC 2440:

    Note that many applications, particularly messaging applications,
    will want more advanced features as described in the OpenPGP-MIME
    document, RFC 2015. An application that implements OpenPGP for
    messaging SHOULD implement OpenPGP-MIME.

RFC 2440 is a low-level standard defining the structure, RFC 2015 is in
some respects a specialized application of same.  Among the advantages
offered by RFC 2015 is that it defines MIME-encoded PGP components as
opaque:  message handling systems should treat these components as
opaque.  The failure to do so by most web archival systems then becomes
a compliance issue with RFC 2015.  

Note that many artifacts of tagging will render signed messages
unverifiable, regardless of whether clearsigned or RFC 2015 signed.
Defining *a* standard and complying with it is the preferred solution.

I'd suggest for reading:

    RFC 3156:  "MIME Security with OpenGPG", M. Elkins, D. Del Torto, R.
    Levien, T. Roessler (August 2001).  Updates RFC 2015.

Thanks.

A few points:

  - It's not that Mutt doesn't play well with others (and yes, I'm aware
    of the curious synchronicity between the authors of mutt and RFC
    2015), it's that (some) others have chosen not to play with Mutt.
    This isn't world+dog playing catchup to a fluid, Redmond-devised,
    monopoly-ensuring "standard".  It's world+dog being afraid to enter
    into the encryption frey.  RFC 2015 is unchanged since 1996.
    Actually, plug-in support for a range of mailers is available for
    most mainstream products and platforms, including both MS Outlook
    and Eudora (two most frequently cited apps).

  - RSA is almost certainly partially to blame for this.  The RSA PKI
    patent only expired in September of 2000.  If this patent hadn't
    existed, widespread use and implementation of crypto support in mail
    tools would be fait acompli, and discussion of legislation such as
    the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 would be largely moot.

  - Backward-compatibility of RFC 2015 would be nice.  OTOH, when
    visiting a (Win2K) using friend recently, I discovered I'd stymied
    him with plain text attachments (copies of mail messages I'd
    forwarded as attachments) the other day.  Without a file extention,
    legacy MS Windows has no idea what to do with the content, and the
    simple precedents of either using a tool like the GNU/Linux "file"
    command (to guess file contents using the compelling heuristic
    of...looking at file contents), or simply throwing the shitheap at a
    (text-capable) pager, are beyond the pale for legacy MS Windows
    users....  <sigh>

  - Backwards-compatibility II:  RFC 2015 renders the message and
    signature components as inline quoted printable, and inline,
    respectively.  Mailer disposition should be to simply render these
    using existing inline text representation.  This is a failure of
    such mailers to provide fundamentally sane handling of MIME.

  - As has been pointed out, RFC 2015 messages are composed of nothing
    but ASCII.  Technically, so are UU encoded messages.  It's how that
    ASCII's handled that's significant.  Still, the raw encoding
    provided by RFC 2015 is transparent to humans.

  - My own philosophy on using signed email is summed up in my standard
    GPG rant:

	http://kmself.home.netcom.com/Download/rant-o-matic.tar.gz

        # install
	$ rant gpg

    In part:
    
      - Your mailer is broken.
      - This is your problem, not mine.
      - File a bug report with your vendor.

      <...>

    So, Why Do You Insist On Signing Your Mail Anyway?

	Fair question.

	Part of the reason is for your benefit, where you are the reader
	of my mail.  It is your responsibility to ensure that what you
	are reading as attributed to me is in fact my own writing[...]


	Why is it your responsibility?  Simple:  you know you've
	received mail from me.  I may or may not know I've sent it.  As
	is well known, email is an insecure, unauthenticated medium.
	It's quite possible that someone is sending something claiming
	to be someone they aren't[....]

	If it's not signed by me, your assumption should be that it
	isn't *from* me.

	A large reason though is to encourage and advocate use and
	adoption of tools that support public key infrastructure (PKI)
	methods, both the ability to create and properly process signed
	and encrypted mail.  I've found myself at several times needing
	to send authenticated or encrypted mail to persons, only to find
	that the recipients did not have a public key, PKI support
	within their mailer, or even, at times, a mailer capable of
	supporting PKI.


	It's been suggested variously that I sign messages inline, or in
	some instances, that mailing lists drop all MIME-encoded
	attachments.  I believe this is the wrong solution for two
	reasons:

	  - It breaks useful behavior.  MIME attachments *can* provide
	    useful information, including support of non-ASCII
	    charactersets, required for basic communications in much of
	    the world[...]

	  - It's not the root problem.  The root problem is mail clients
	    which handle untrusted content in an insecure fashion.  This
	    is like dousing 75% of the population with gasoline, then
	    placing match-confiscating personnel at the doors of all
	    public arenas.  The problem isn't the matches.  It's the
	    gasoline.

	    Palliative measures to reduce the apparent risk without
	    addressing the actual cause mask the problem without fixing
	    it.  If sufficient people feel the pain, we'll eventually
	    see changes either to client behavior or choice.


  - My general suggestion to list maintainers is that policies be set on
    what MIME encoding is or isn't allowed.  Content filtering based on
    such rules would reject malfomred messages.  Likely targets:  HTML
    mail, various binary attachments.  This strikes me as more useful
    than de-miming all messages.  While we're at it, attacking the
    dozen-plus line disclaimers showing up in more and more corporate
    email would be a blessing.  But I believe this constitutes thread
    drift....

  - I'll put in a vote for suggesting the cypherpunks list support
    broader adoption of encryption standards by allowing and supporting
    RFC 2015 signed messages.

Go ahead, laugh.  I sign my mail.  When I have to, I clearsign it, under
protest.

Peace.
