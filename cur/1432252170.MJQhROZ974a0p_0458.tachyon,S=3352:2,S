That was a Fraser Institutute writer btw. But then an Aussie commie might
not make nice distinctions.

The IMF/WTO should hold a get together in one of the US states with
concealed carry laws and then we'd see how commie scum fare.

If capitalists were really up to snuff, they'd organize a counter demo
force armed with the most effective pre-firearms crowd control weapon --
the quarterstaff.  Cut down on the old street demos.
