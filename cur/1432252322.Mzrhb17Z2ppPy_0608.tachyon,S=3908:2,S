Well, after a short conversation with the USPTO's server, I now have 
an application on file for a trademark which I can use to defend my 
business' web address.

Unfortunately, after a short discussion with the California 
Corporation Commission, it appears that I cannot now incorporate 
under the name "Disappearing Inc" because these guys already did. 

As it turns out, all the trademark applications they've filed that 
would interfere with the application I filed are being disputed by 
the USPTO as being too general -- they are mainly just descriptive 
words.  So they don't actually have trademarks they could use to 
kick me off my domain name yet. 

Anyway -- the way it looks now, there's a decent chance of my 
application being approved, and if that happens, then it will 
conflict/interfere with the trademark applications they've filed 
and those applications will have to be refused.  There is also 
a chance that the trademark applications they have filed will 
be approved, and if that happens then mine will be refused as it 
will be found in conflict with theirs. 

And the wheels grind on....

Sigh.  I ordered DSL service so I could put this site up on my 
own server way back in April.  It's scheduled to be installed 
on October 3. Argh, Argh, Argh....
