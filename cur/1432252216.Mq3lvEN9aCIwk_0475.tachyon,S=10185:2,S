Good point. &nbsp;This guy's attempt was humorous&nbsp;http://www.theblaze.=

 several lawyers and EFF staff on that list who might be able to advise on=
 whether there are any suits already pending, and if it's feasible.

That's complete bullshit. &nbsp;We know damn well Yahoo (et al) has backups=
 of backups. &nbsp;I'd try to fight with them a bit before letting the acco=
unt go.
