 >>In conclusion, I leave you with a question: if remailer users are reduced
to a small number of high-paying remailer customers for whom anonymity is
not a game, but a matter of life or death, could a mix-net be made to
provide any sufficient degree of security? "No" is the easy answer. Say
yes, and prove it.

Yes,as long as 'open source' or soft drill' assassination politics protects 
them.They use 'stamps' that float with the dollar so theres an agreed value 
and as they come under almost instant attack from tax collectors and 
terrified govts they'll clearly need a damn hardball protection system.AP 
as operation soft drill.Certainly a matter of life and death.How else would 
they avoid being nuked one way or another.The distributed versions will win 
out eventually,and the possible use of Quantum encryption would certainly 
bring it all on.It just seems to me that its a good time now to crash 
through or crash on this.
Mass civil disobedience,no shying away from horsemen,just calm clear and 
cool."Gentlemen,we're taking over now."
