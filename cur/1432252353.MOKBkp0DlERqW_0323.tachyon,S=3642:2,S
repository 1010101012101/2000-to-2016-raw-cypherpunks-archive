"So of course, society's interest in protecting police officers allows New
Orleans police to search your home or business at any time, for any
reason, or for no reason at all.  As long as the cop mumbles something
about making sure he's safe."

Actually, this is particularly hilarious. The Cops in New Orleans have 
become astoundingly corrupt recently, with shootouts between rival factions 
occuring during Bank Holdups (ie, between the cops robbing the bank and a 
rival group arriving on scene to "uphold the law" and protecting their own 
stake). Apparently the payout for such activities has risen high enough that 
local judges are now in on the action. Next time a government official talks 
about "protecting the public" try to see if he winks into the camera...
