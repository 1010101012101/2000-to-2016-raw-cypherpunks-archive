Heh.  I drove by that one this afternoon after visiting the hot springs.  
As long as there's no major earthquake in the nearby fault before tomorrow, 
I don't expect to be glowing in the dark when I next see you, 
but it was a seriously stupid place to build a big nuke plant,
even if it's not in anybody's backyard (except Vinnie's,
and the few other Cypherpunks in the area, and Cal Poly SLO, and...)
However, without some rate relief, PG&E may be out of business
before the Big One hits, so the difficulty of cleanup won't be
their, um, fault.

		Geothermally yours, 


				Thanks!
