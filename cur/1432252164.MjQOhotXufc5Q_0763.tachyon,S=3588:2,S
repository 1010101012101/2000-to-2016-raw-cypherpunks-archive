Perhaps it is more thetorically satisfying? I can't speak for Tim or
his writing process. But nowhere have I ever seen him support corporate
welfare, and in fact the logical flow of his argument made in the post
to which you replied would condemn that as well.

More importantly, your claims are incorrect. Defense is $379 billion
for FY2003, while social security, income security, medicare, health,
education and other social services, community development, housing
credits, and so on total over $1358 billion. That's not counting
"international affairs" (a category I take to include foreign aid),
agriculture, transportation, and other programs of dubious necessity
that total hundreds of billions more.
