I really really doubt the enzyme responsible for catalysis would survive ten 
seconds of high grade peroxide.  Peroxide I think is a dead end, its a low 
energy fuel, w/ two products, water and oxygen.  The oxygen is high energy, 
perfect for oxidizing another fuel, but you would have to worry about the 
water suppressing that reaction.
