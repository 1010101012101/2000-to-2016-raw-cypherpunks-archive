A claim that presupposes that the west is just as totalitarian 
as its enemies, that well known reality is not to be trusted, 
that newsmen and historians are servants of the vast capitalist 
conspiracy, so in place of obvious truths, we can substitute 
any ridiculous fantasy that we find politically conforting, for 
example  Tyler Durden's fantasy that the US attacked Korea, and 
attacked to impose poverty on Koreans so that the US can be 
rich, or the widely popular fantasy that the CIA trained Osama 
Bin Laden.  Seeing as Bin Laden's contribution to the 
revolutionary war against the Soviets was merely roadbuilding, 
did they train him in roadbuilding?
