Dave,

Please share this with your Interesting-People list. And come if you
can!  We're especially interested in having outsiders...


Title: Data Surveillance and Privacy Protection
Date: Saturday June 3, 2006
Time: 8:30 am - 6:00pm (breakfast and lunch will be served)
Cost: Free
Sponsor: Harvard University's Center for Research on Computation and
Society

(Open to the press and the general public)


Although there has been significant public attention to the civil
liberties issues of data surveillance over the past few years, there
has been little discussion of the actual techniques that could be
employed in any but the most restricted settings. Likewise, there has
been little discussion of methods and technologies for conducting
data surveillance while respecting privacy and preserving civil
liberties.
