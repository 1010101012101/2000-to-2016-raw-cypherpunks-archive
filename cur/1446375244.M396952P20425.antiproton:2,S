I selected Murphy because you mentioned Friedman's hard problem of
privatizing defense without the presence of state actors. Your
solution is crowdfunding assassinations of anybody who is unpopular.
This does fit within the paradigm of Friedman's approach.

I would argue that Murphy's approach of collectives banding together
and entering into private arbitration agreements with private defense
contractors is more reasonable in preserving liberty and security. By
entering into said private arbitration agreement with a private
defense force, you also have aspects of private jurisprudence. The
arbitration clause can have stipulations for certain scenarios and how
they are dealt with (e.g., trials, fines, etc).

Democracy is the tyranny of the majority, and assassination politics
is dangerous in that regard when they are coupled. Private arbitration
agreements with private security forces wherein mobility has
reciprocal agreements (similar to current travel) seems more reasonable.

I would suggest you consider the countereconomics work of SEK (e.g.
agorism) and Vaclav Benda. Benda is an interesting case because he did
his work on parallel structures while under the Soviet Union.

The conclusion was that -- in the presence of an oppressive state -- a
robust solution was an overlay of private and hidden societies as
opposed to direct overt warfare with the state.

I think your assumptions regarding the average American are wrong, but
that is my opinion. Don't underestimate the power of memetic warfare,
neurolinguistic programming, and general propaganda.

 But he may not be aware that it has been estimated that in the 20th
century, about 250 million people DIED, killed by the actions of
governments.

   Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow "okay"?
I very much doubt he'd say that was acceptable, and he probably
couldn't argue much with the numbers themselves.  But suppose those
"average Americans" were FIRST fully informed of this fact, even
simply as an estimate.  THEN, suppose it was explained to him HOW a
functioning AP system wouldn't allow that to happen, if necessary by
killing whatever number of government employees were necessary to stop
this, the "Democide".   If those "average Americans" were reminded
that the death of a government employee is no more unfortunate than
the death of ordinary citizens, then wouldn't it be reasonable to
conclude that to save 250 million ordinary citizens, it would
certainly be acceptable to kill 25 million government employees, and
certainly 2.5 million government employees?

There are arguably technical countermeasures to his argument. E.g. PoC:

^^ you might get a kick out of that ^^
