Naah, that third sentence is wrong.  It's:

  The overwhelming majority of [SSL users] wouldn't know SSL from HTTP with a
  padlock GIF in the corner.

I think the assertion was that SSH is used in places where it matters, while
SSL is used where no-one really cares (or even knows) about it.  Joe Sixpack
will trust any site with a padlock GIF on the page.  Most techies won't access
a Unix box without SSH.  Quantity != quality.

If you could wave a magic wand and make one of the two protocols vanish, I'd
notice the loss of SSH immediately (I couldn't send this message for
starters), but it would take days or weeks before I noticed the loss of SSL.

Peter.
