comment: so here in the Great White North, one year all of the sudden
many people on local television were complaining about the fact that
there is snow in Minnesota. i had never heard anyone in my life
complain about snow in Minnesota, as if it was a negative event. who
are these people? when did the population get replaced? - and it
seemed that another kind of person now existed in the area who was
fundamentally not from here else did not belong, and hopefully finds a
place they like better. rather than stand in snow complaining about
it.

so take an event X that has certain functioning and variables, that
could even be its nature, what makes it what it is (X).  thus, X=snow.
and then consider a place (MN) as being invariably tied to this
condition, such that MN=X within a certain range of parameters, say
'wintertime'.

and for many, as long as they have shelter, warm clothes and boots, it
can be an enjoyable time. if not, you may not survive. though snow and
winter have profound aesthetic value as a transformation from what is
known into another realization and understanding of the same place,
within differing parameters (light, color, temperature, clothing,
transportation, etc). so living in the north can be an education in
itself, knowing about winter, learning from it.

the larger situation is repeated elsewhere. in particular, in
educational contexts that have also migrated online as a type of
disapproval of certain natural functioning and awareness. most
notably, discussion groups online where a given [topic] will then have
limits placed upon its exploration, even though inquiries may fall
squarely within a given domain. and to this my response is similar:
who are these people, where did they come from?

for instance, the basic principles of [disciplines] such as
architecture can be censored in discussion or other areas (cultural,
technological) because it falls outside the artificial lines or
boundaries so conceived by a given ~managing population. such that
'the ideas' cannot be discussed, in their natural habitat, which
instead relies upon a definition of a place such that: place=not-X. or
in other words: topic = not-topic. insofar as it challenges a given
ideological boundary. and this can be as unnatural as believing 'snow
is bad' in Minnesota- fundamentally unnatural as a viewpoint. yet so
too, 'architecture is bad' for architecture, and onward. 'security is
bad for security' etc.

and perhaps this is evident in boundaries that are upheld and
constructed, maintained, such that certain issues and ideas cannot be
discussed due to enforcement of limits, and these may not have
anything to do with secrecy via NDA and instead, of wrong ideas and
thinking that challenge the status quo interpretation and belief
system (religion as state, essentially), yet that substitutes a
condition of truth with another, a pseudo-version that is fake, unreal
by comparison, and yet upheld as the basis for relation and exchange.

in that, having a negative view of snow in Minnesota, at least for me
and those i have known, is going against what makes this place what it
is, in its depth and connection with the area. and viewing 'ideas' as
negative that have this connection with a given topic or
understanding, likewise, unnatural and out-of-place. indicative of
other dissonance, ungrounded relations. to forbid 'ideas' of crypto
within discussion of cryptography, poo-pooing it, for instance, would
be an interesting realm to consider for how deep this disconnection
could go, thus revealing a surface relation or deception reliant upon
the not-X condition to sustain itself, or in this case, the need for
insecurity, obscurity, unknowing, disconnection, as vital to the ruse.
all such betrayels of truth reveal themselves in how truth is related
to, observed or ignored.

consider in this context, then, how might the government ever combat
issues of 'cyberspace' if its relation with electromagnetism was never
allowed to be established; such that:

     cyberspace = not-EM

on NSA interview on 60 minutes: it was stated that the interconnection
between various computer analysis systems (metadata) was needed to get
the 'whole picture', in that it is necessary to engage the situation
at the scale it exists. without this, conceptual blindness due to
limits or boundaries that prevent greater understanding of how things
relate.

now consider an entire university system, education system down to
gradeschool, that is forbidden from uniting its metadata beyond
compartmented views. that is essentially the condition today that
enforces illiteracy and makes it impossible to reason about advanced
situations beyond finite language games:

      culture = not-EM

everything that is connected via electromagnetism, and
interdisciplinary via shared structure and order of truth, is denied
by its lack of inclusion, allowance, and validation by authority - and
get this: on the basis for superior (private) belief based upon what
amounts to religious opinion, that instead censors truth so that this
wider viewpoint cannot be established. leave it up to some girls in
gradeschool to challenge the paradigm on a science project, the very
situation that cannot be addressed through reason otherwise, due to
issues of power.

the NSA gets its integrated metadata. the citizens and education
system does not. this is to include EMF hazards and electropollution
in relation to telecoms and telephony, etc. what about metadata of
[this] connected with contradictory data of [that], working all of it
out.

[quote]  Over the past century, it was labor-saving appliances,

daily drudgery. [unquote]


note: there is a tremendous story in electrification of household
and city that someday should become general knowledge because
there is a lot to learn about technology, social relations, culture
through greater understanding of the daily inhabited environment;
(the book Electrifying America by David E. Nye is one such account)
for instance, you could take any appliance or artifact and map it out,
back to previous dynamics, say a ice box compared to e-refrigerator,
or iron heated on fire to electric iron, its relation to laundry room of
washing machine and dryer. how these effected social roles, etc.

e.g. electrical desk light, radio, computer, home alarm systems.
note also: importance of certain items connected to ecosystems,
say alarm system with external security monitoring and police. the
relations be mapped out via typology: tools, buildings, and systems.
in architecture a big event was the geometric relation in the kitchen
between sink, refrigerator and stove in a triangular arrangement...

Kitchen work triangle
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_work_triangle

it should also be mentioned that this type of 'feedback' is potentially
possible and valuable in any work or routine process, where it could
function in more or less efficient or effective ways. and this can be
connected to individual lives or managerial issues within companies
that either allow for such local perspective or seek a top-down model
where the viewpoint and ideas only originate from a given vantage,
and this could distinguish an intelligent and adaptive organization
from a rigid approach that is stuck in time and ultimately overtaken
by others innovation- thus relation of processes and functioning
with business philosophy, application of principles, their mediation
that can have economic, social, political effects, un-shared beliefs, &c.
(for instance, a worker in a production process has insight into how it
is and is not effective and can offer feedback for tweaks, improvement
or not allowing this and having that inefficiency/ineffectiveness built-in
and then normalized, including as relational ideology, that can limit the
engagement with the situation or force disengagement, detachment.
in other word, testable hypotheses of flow and routine functioning or
are these unquestioned and enforced to uphold given social relation)
likewise, what may appear only commonsense today - having enough
room to maneuver in the kitchen and use appliances effectively - can
extend as a conceptual question into the present and future day, such
as how the pantry, kitchen, and e-commerce in an automated scenario.
this was part of the idea for the Asperger Management System (AMS),
whereby a home computer system (data furnace) would use A.I. to bid
on restocking pantry, perhaps even in a financial market sense, where
'group bids' for a local community could exist to purchase wholesale,
and so an exchange could develop and suppliers to fill the contracts.
this would then integrate the 'intelligent refrigerator' with pantry,
and then have an A.I. data furnace device manage routine orders,
based on patterns that could include weather, past price history.
and of course a dwelling would need a way to store/allow packages
when people are away from home, to allow deliveries at any time.
note here the vital role of both encryption and security protocols.

(this leading to how existing courier/shipping services function, in
that people can wait all day for an e-commerce shipment to arrive
when instead an e-commerce portal or secure drop box could exist,
and before that, wireless updates when a driver is on their way to
a destination, providing a 30 minute window or lead-time vs. 8 hrs
via wi-fi and network-based updates of when a package may arrive)

[*thing is, if you are not a phone talker, a mobile phone makes little sense
especially if main use would be mobile data, which is made so economically
infeasible, so hostile to lookup of data, the hurdles to just sustain massive
locked-in access prior to any data, removes value of info or turns it into an
extreme luxury only elites can access beyond chained to wi-fi providers,
which is yet another service provider reduplicating access, only for mobile
and only in limited zones, at least in this area. then again: EMF POLLUTION.
basically there is tremendous downside to the entire scheme for citizens,
they get irradiated, swamped by harmful EMFs, yet access is uncorrelated

--- crypto email & et al ---

reading of how crypto systems could be implemented for email, perhaps
to include chat and file transfers even, alike with web browser
functionality and perhaps extending it with SSL secure icon that
validates connection status.

anything short of this would appear too complicated for ordinary
users. that is, a simple icon that is pressed or depressed to decrypt
or encrypt/re-encrypt information within a personal computer operating
system slash desktop environment, moving to mobile operating system
and its micro UI likewise.
of anyone who could implement such a simple interface for managing
crypto it would be Apple, Inc. and yet, then again, the problem
remains of 'the keychain' paradigm as a basis for managing keys,
certificates, passwords and other items that has remained a mystery to
me. in that its use is not apparent to the uninitiated, though it
supposedly performs some function or other, though it appears manual,
requiring management and maintenance and knowledge of what to use it
for and how- efficiently and effectively. and that is the missing
information though also an area of non-Mac like roughness in
functionality, in that encryption does not appear to be part of the
seamless experience on par with importing GarageBand files into iTunes
or email or something such- versus protecting identity, privacy,
information, files from illegal snooping and intrusion. as if
essentially leaving the bank vault open for any visitors. though the
entire drive can be encrypted on the fly, data that is sent and
received is not automated this way, as far as could be understood via
the basic feature set and settings.

(it should be said of Apple, of the great hardware innovation since
the 1980s, and nearly no innovation in the operating system itself as
paradigm, remaining file and folder junk drawer and thus stalled out
conceptually in terms of information organization and 'tools for
thinking' beyond ongoing bureaucratization, where the CPU binary
approach itself is determining and limiting functionality, and cannot
be altered from its existing course as solidified, seemingly. in that
a new computer architecture likely needs to be introduced to make
basic changes to the informational paradigm, what can be done vs. what
is done as it continues to be done)

on the Macintosh platform it appears possible that a basic 'icon'
approach could work, such that in any given application a 'lock' or
'secure' status could be engaged/disengaged, when wanting to
send/read/write an encrypted email, or decrypt a file, or communicate
via chat. and that whatever data is involved, archived or store, could
likely be held in a vault that is encrypted outside the normal
whole-disk encryption, whether emails or files, and that this would be
locked by default (apparently this is part of Keychain management
functionality, if not mistaken, at least for passwords).

in other words, a computer user could decide they want to write a
secure message via email and press an icon (aka switch or button) that
changes the visual interface to a new state, a phase change indicating
'secure session' (say a gray striped bar occurs around the perimeter
of the windowpane) and then when the document is either closed and
saved (changing phase again, say black striped bar aside filename) or
sent, that this document is secured automatically by protocol, such
that once the decision for security is made, it is automatically
followed through as a process and thus the email would automatically
lock-down before being transmitted, and upon receipt by another would
need to be unlocked to be read, and when closed would relock itself
via encryption scheme. and any such documents or files would be held
in a secure information  vault and could be accessed via a security
manager interface that would be integrated into various software,
including mobile.

therefore, once logged onto a computer (identity validated via perhaps
advanced measures such as biometrics and-or other) then a person could
just click the icon to access or compose data, and not need to worry
about keys or authentication, though perhaps an additional layer could
exist as a security option (prior to sending or opening) if need be.
say fingerprint scanner beside computer, to unlock files to read or
send via email.

anything less than this - of a computer vender who controls the OS and
hardware and can unify and embed the 'security infrastructure' within
an existing ecosystem - probably could not control enough factors to
make it work in these ecosystem terms. that is, a basic unified
experience from start to finish in the exchange or dynamics of
interaction. Apple can. and if Apple can, within its own OS-iOS
platform, then others can follow up, which would enable cross-platform
functionality within given standards- whatever they may be.

without this self-contained trial of 'icon'-based crypto and working
through the usability issues - so that it is dead simple and effective
- which is what Apple excels at, rolling out such 'solutions' in a
larger realm would likely be met with unmatching interactions and the
problems of fragmentation that limit such cross-platform exchange in
shared standards and-or frameworks and security definitely loses out,
or is non-existent, due to such dynamics. in that if even different
computers cannot trust one another, how can people be expected to.

so how could a 'secure file' be sent to another if the computers
themselves do not have enough trust to establish, manage, or maintain
this connection. it would appear a systematic approach is required
that can then be extended once it is worked out as a security process,
vetted by professionals, to allow a new level or layer of personal
security in response to the issues and problems of ubiquitous
surveillance, to design a private perimeter that extends beyond -bank
transactions online-and involves all data of value that requires
security, more protection and limits from unauthorized and non-legal
snooping, seizure, and manipulation.
