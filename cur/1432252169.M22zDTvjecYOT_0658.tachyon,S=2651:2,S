This Cnet show keeps getting better. The host is now quoting Declan's
article, stating that fortunately Declan's "affectionatos" are not in
charge. And apparently an "An Metet" has emailed him a death thread... The
host, David Lawrence, read the death thread on the air.


This is on the air right now. Call (800) 39-ONLINE. Call if you disagree
that strong crypto should be banned in the US.
