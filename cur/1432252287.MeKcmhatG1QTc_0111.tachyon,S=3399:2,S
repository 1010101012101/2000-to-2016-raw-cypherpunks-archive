I agree that people should stick to ASCII, which is why my messages
are completely made up of plain ASCII text.  I use the content-type
fields only to make it easier for mailers that support MIME to handle
my messages; in this case, it's text/plain, so everyone should display
it the same.  Presumably that includes your mail client, as I've
tested my mutt patch against Eudora Pro, and it seems to work fine.
If it doesn't, please let me know how it misbehaves so that I can fix
it.
