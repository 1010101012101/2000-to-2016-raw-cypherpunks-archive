I don't know about anyone else, but I have a far higher degree of
trust for the DoD and subsidiary agencies acting responsibily and to
protect the interests of US citizens in the US than the CIA.
Certainly NSA and NRO have massive amounts of power, but putting that
power in the hands of the CIA scares me a lot more.

Moving things to the FBI would scare me more, of course.  Mmm, FBI in
direct control of USD 20b/year of high-tech equipment, NSA's
cryptanalytic capabilities...

I wonder what the odds are for this passing?
