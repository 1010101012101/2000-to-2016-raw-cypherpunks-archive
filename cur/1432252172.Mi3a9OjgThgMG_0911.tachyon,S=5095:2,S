All good extended analysis indeed. Perhaps my issue is just
with the words. I read Bamford as indicating attacks against
the crypto itself, not tricks applied downstream or around it
(regardless of how wholesale, specific, successful or profitable a
given applied approach might be in the eyes of the doers or the done).

While recently novel and profitable with centralized services,
borrowing traditional certs [1] or logging the PFS session keys [2]
is vastly different from having a working "cryptanalysis" against the
long term thought to be dependable underlings such as
RSA, AES, ECC, etc.

Surely if the cooperation to achieve [1] is so tight then [2] would
be equally doable. Then again, might as well ship the plaintext
straight off the servers.
