The issue isn't whether jail or just extra charges are the
appropriate remedy for double-spending - it's that the
offline methods generally rely on encoding a user's name
in the coins so you can tell who did the double spending,
which not only adds a lot of administrative overhead but
requires that you have a system of identification of your users.

Some online methods also do the "identify and punish" approach;
others do the far simpler "first one to grab the money wins" approach
to double-spending, which is better for anonymity,
though it imposes different risks on the users.
