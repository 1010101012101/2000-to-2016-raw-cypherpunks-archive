Subvert logical reasoning, disallow it, including freedom of speech and
thinking, censoring and controlling what facts are allowed - controlling
POV - then the opposite occurs:  the viewpoint of B 'overtakes' A such that
an error-reliant pseudo-truth (0) = truth (1)

This is critical to establishing the false perspective, basically a hack by
removing logic from reasoning via faith-based binary ideology as a means to
control 'programming' populations, institutions, the state and world itself
via what amounts to submission and servitude to lies and the grand
deception.

Note: this relies on B=A which leads to B>A and pT=T, which leads to pT(0)
> T(1)
