Smartphone users are already starting to buy into Square (
https://squareup.com/) because the startup cost is free (to get the reader
and app) and the transaction cost is, at this time, a flat 2.75%.

What does Bitcoin have?

easywallet.org, an online Bitcoin wallet which, by being bookmarkable,
means that it's usable a) on iProducts (Apple routinely hunts down and
kills any Bitcoin apps in the Appstore) and b) means that you don't have to
install anything if you don't want to:

https://easywallet.org/en/bitcoin_for_iphone

Coinapult, which lets you send Bitcoins via text messages:

https://coinapult.com/sms-wallet

blockchain.info, which not only has an excellent Android app but also has
what seem to be fairly easy to use web-based APIs for transactions:

https://blockchain.info/api

There are very easy to use apps out there.  Not many people seem to have
any interest in using Bitcoins.  Yet.
