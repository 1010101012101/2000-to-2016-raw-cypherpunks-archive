	I'm sorry Declan, I just can't take the cypherpunks list
seriously anymore. After you testified for Federal government
prosecutors, helping to put members in jail - not once, but twice -
and anyone still respected you, I just lost all ability to regard that
zeitgeist as other than a joke.

	There was indeed a time I could deal with Liberbabble. That
was before a certain journalist, who I helped a lot, did many things
to raise my legal risks, and justified some of it in the name of
Libertarianism (other parts were just his "character").

	I said this to you at CFP 2001, and I'll say it again:
This is not a game we're playing. People are going to jail.

	I'd be overjoyed if you didn't take me seriously. It's the
backstabbing I worry about. I don't ever want to find you playing
Federal Witness #1 against me too.
