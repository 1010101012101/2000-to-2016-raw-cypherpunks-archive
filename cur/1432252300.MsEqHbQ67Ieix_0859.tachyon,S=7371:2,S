If you claim to know about it, how do you actually know so _little_ about it?

Yes, I have your post filtered into my Trash folder. Sometimes I 
look, sometimes I don't.

For someone who presumably graduated from a real law school and 
passes a real bar exam, you have a demonstrated tendency to ramble 
and just "ditz" your way through arguments. Do you ever write in 
complete sentences, in complete paragraphs, arguing complete points?

"A twist of legitimacy"? Some kind of appeal to authority/

As it happens, I've known Robert Steele since his first got invited 
to the Hackers Conference...must have been around 1993-4 or so. 
Talked to him at length. Several other list members know him, too.

He's been pushing this Del Torto-esque "hackers will be our real 
agents" project for a while. Nothing wrong with the "open 
intelligence" idea...except that it's not his idea. The intelligence 
agencies of the world have been vacuum sweeping the Net since its 
earliest days. I don't mean in some paranoid sense, but in the sense 
of what is readily known.

The "Analyst" project at the CIA, for example, has been going on 
since at least the early 80s, monitoring publically visible (and 
perhaps less visible stuff gotten from the NSA, DIA, NRO, etc.) 
material.

We knew by 1993 that the NSA and CIA had folks reading our list...I 
talked to a couple of these readers at the Hackers Conference in Lake 
Tahoe and at a conference at Asilomar.

"Open source intelligence" is just his buzz phrase for "observe 
what's happening."

Read the hundreds of articles on these matters. Read "The Enterprise 
of Law: Justice without the State," by Bruce Benson. Read David 
Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom," and his other books. Read...

The point is, Aimee, _read the background material_.

Then you can ask specific questions, instead of just throwing a dozen 
or two dozen points of confusion you have against the wall and asking 
me to make it all clear to you.


As it is, you have yet to contribute anything interesting, at least 
that I have seen. I admit I don't see most of your contributions 
these days, but the lack of follow-up from others tells me that 
others are also not finding much of substance.

Given that you write in a confusing, ditzy way, perhaps they just 
can't extract the nuggets from the mud.
