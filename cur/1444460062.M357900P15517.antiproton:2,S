The main question is:

1. Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers?

Related questions:

2. Did they do it on purpose?
3. Did LEAs already had the logs via sniffing (at that time cryptome.org
didn't have SSL AFAIK)?
4. Is it likely that the web server (and likely all internet connected
machines of cryptome operators) was compromised?
