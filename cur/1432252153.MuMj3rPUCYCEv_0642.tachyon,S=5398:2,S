mattd is still a newbie to this list. He will eventually learn that the
title of
the list: 'cypherpunks' tells nothing about the views of list subscribers,
which
range widely. In particular, he will learn that participation in the list
does not
imply acceptance of any particular stance, attitude, or agenda towards 
crypto,  stego, or government or lack thereof. 

The only thing which can really be said about subscribers in general is that
they think crypto is worth discussing.

You are not my fellow.
I am not a punk. 
Since no one here even agrees what anarchy is, it's incorrect for you
to assume that anyone agrees on that, either.
