True.  But it beats the snot out of guessing keys.

Offhand, I'd estimate that if three US remops were taken down 
forcefully, and the federal law looked as though any other could 
be, all but two or three hardcases would cease operating remailers 
in the USA.  That would wipe out well over 70% of the remailers, 
leaving a very small universe indeed to monitor.
