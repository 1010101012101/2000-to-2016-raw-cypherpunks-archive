I should have been clearer. I was speaking for his specific case, but as

The US is one of the few countries that I know of (or about) that do not

Well, going back to his specific case. His options are slim. He already
holds a green card, that makes him a US citizen as far as tax laws are
concerned. (note that you cannot legally keep a green card and not meet
the tax residency requirements)

This applies wether he is a US citizen or not, green card holder or not,
Sealand citizen or not. Once the IRS sinkstheir claws into you, you're
screwed. Even if you give up your green card, you are still subject to
them for awhile. (A friend in Switzerland had a great deal of fun after
giving up his green card and still being contacted by the IRS)

More so now than ever, I do have a tendency to agree with you. But, as
someone whose passport is not the pretty blue book that yours is, I
disagree. "Protection" is a relative term, show up in Russia and you're
kinda screwed one way or another, but show up in Genneva, Switzerland
and get stopped by the police, (or any other first world country) and
start speaking something other than English (or the local language) and
you will have a hard time. Specially in Europe, they have massive
profiling of foreigners and even if US Citizens may get a hard time just
fr being American, by far and alot, that blue passport will most
certainly get you out of a jam or keep you from being thrust into it.
Like it or not, the US passport is well respected throughout the world
("respect" also being very relative.) I have had a few occasions where I
would have been very screwed as a Brazillian, but got off well because
people thought I was American. It matters, even if the .gov won't come
to your rescue lance ablaze sitting on a white horse.
