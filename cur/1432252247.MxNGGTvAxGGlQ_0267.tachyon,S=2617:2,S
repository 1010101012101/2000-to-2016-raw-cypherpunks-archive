Most players cannot be hacked.  And many hacks do not operate properly.  How about just rent or borrow DVDs, reprocess to remove the region controls and reburn to a DVD-R?  DVD-Rs are only about $1.25 or less each.  Test burn on a DVD-RW to help prevent expensive coasters. See http://mpucoder.dynodns.net/derrow/copy.html
