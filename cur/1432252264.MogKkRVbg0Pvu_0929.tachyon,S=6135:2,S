"Dodging" may be important for motorcycles (yes, I have one, a BMW 
R1100R), but not for any of the accidents I have seen or been in. These 
usually happen when someone makes a sudden lane change, turns in front 
of another, runs a red light, fails to negotiate a curve, fails to 
stop/merge/etc., and so on.

The laws of physics are what they are. A 3500-pound vehicle colliding 
with a 2000-lb vehicle will have the expected effects, all other things 
being equal. They are not, of course, but even in the "other things" 
the larger vehicle usually has advantages. My 300 SE has a long hood, 
with lots of crush length, lots of steel to absorb energy. And a 
steering column safely ahead of me. And dual airbags. The roof is 
strongly reinforced. The Volvo folks got most of their know-how in 
building strong cars from the Mercedes-Benz data "open sourced" in the 
late 50s, early 60s, and later.

I have witnessed three accidents, but only have been in one. This was a 
motorcyclist running a red light and smashing into the front of my 
compact car, a 1972 Mazda RX-2.  It did substantial damage to my engine 
compartment. Either my Mercedes or my Explorer would have absorbed the 
impact better.

So, just one accident in my 51 years, not caused by me,  compared to 
your 3 or more, caused by you. So I suppose you have earned the right 
to explain to me why I should squeeze myself into a Honda Lupo so I can 
"save the planet."

I didn't speak of absolute safety, only relative safety. A 3500-pound 
steel Mercedes sedan is going to withstand a collision with a truck 
better than a carbon fiber golf cart riding no more than a meter high.
