And their attempt to bomb USA-controlled gas and oil pipelines through
Afganistan, Turkey and Syria, are now a no go, evidently. So we can be
pretty sure the USA banking ponzi is close to resetting (the
diplomatic way to say collapsing), as happened in the Great
Depression/ 1929.

Real estate outside your present country, gold stash and bitcoins etc
just don't make sense to me. Property? Buy a farm with plenty of water
storage on it - get out of the city if you think prepping will be
important - stash some simple dry food (eg a tonne of mixed rice and
lentils, so you can even feed your neighbours for a year) and make
sure you have water and access to wood for boiling the water and
cooking the food, and at least you will survive.

There are plenty of websites promoting 'hard core' prepping. For a
historical perspective, check out what happened in 1929 and
thereafter.

Good luck,
Zenaan
