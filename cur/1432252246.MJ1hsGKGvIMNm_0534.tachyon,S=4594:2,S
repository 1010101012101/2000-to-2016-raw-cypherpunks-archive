Abstract : No frontier lasts forever, and no freely occupied global
commons extends endlessly where human societies are involved. Sooner or
later, good fences are erected to make good neighbors, and so it must be
with cyberspace. Today we are seeing the beginnings of the border-making
process across the world's nations. From the Chinese intent to create
their own controlled internal Internet, to increasingly controlled
access to the Internet in less-democratic states, to the rise of
Internet filters and rules in Western democracies, states are
establishing the bounds of their sovereign control in the virtual world
in the name of security and economic sustainability. The topology of the
Internet, like the prairie of the 1800s' American Midwest is about to be
changed forever -rationally, conflictually, or collaterally- by the
decisions of states.
