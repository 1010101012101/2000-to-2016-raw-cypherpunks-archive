Hanssen. If his FBI colleagues had been asked to rate him by your above 
criteria, he probably would have been in the high 200s all across the 
board. And maybe deservedly so. But since those factors weren't in any way, 
shape, or form relevant to the fact that he was also the kind of person who 
could sell out his country for the sheer pleasure of the game of it, he got 
away with murder for years until he got careless and his shitty tradecraft 
finally caught up with him."

His tradecraft was rather good I thought,especially in not trusting his 
handlers with direct contact.Possibly he was done in by sex addiction 
common to many repressed septic tanks(yanks) W.Reichs,mass psychology of 
facism describes syndrome.Also wanted on some level to get caught,much like 
Ted special K.(and USAma bin laden?)

Did he really get away with murder? Feh.Aldrich ames did and his rep 
survived polygraphs so reputations are bollocks unless panocoptincons and 
regular stings/tests are done.Hanssen didnt tell the russkies anything they 
couldnt have worked out them selves.
