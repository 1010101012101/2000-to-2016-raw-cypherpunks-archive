	Oh, all of them believe in murdering anybody who doesn't
	recognize their divine authority. You know, the one and only
	'argument' behind government : obey or die.

	Sure.

	Sure.   How does it feel to be a brain-dead americunt? Well, I
	guess at least it's not painful. You'd need some kind of
	functioning brain to feel pain.

	No sonny. You are. What, you wouldn't like to be treated the way
	your marines treat other people? Tsk tsk.

	You are either out of your mind, trolling, or both. 

	Or you mean that final coming of the americunt police state is
	speeding up?

	Yep, that's the only thing you are throwing up. Actually it's
	propaganda but it's so fucking stupid that "nonsense" describes
	it as well.


	So yeah. Google and the cloud. 

	Maybe you got 'cypherpunk'  and 'neocunt' mixed up.
