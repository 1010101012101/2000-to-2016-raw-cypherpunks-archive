What am I missing here?  Was the prospective passenger carrying 
weapons or anything which could be judged as a weapon.?  Was 
the prospective passenger deemed a threat to any of the other 
passengers or the completion of the flight to its destination?  If the 
answers to any of the above questions were yes then the person 
should have been arrested, charged and dealt with in a court of law.

Otherwise the passenger should have been allowed on the flight 
regardless of political belief or profile of ticket purchase.  The ticket 
purchaser has suffered discrimation and should be able to seek 
damages.  Or, has ther hassling of citizens become a normal event?

If you start to agree to this type of decision you are no different than 
the Muslims who claim all non-believers to be an enemy.  Think 
about it!
