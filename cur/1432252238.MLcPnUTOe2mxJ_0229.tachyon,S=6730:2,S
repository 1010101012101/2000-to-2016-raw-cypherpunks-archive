In my limited experience with the spook agencies, this understates the
case. The left hand refuses to share a thing, making the smug claim "We're
listeners, not talkers."

The right hand is working to stab the left in the back and take control of
the two fingers it thinks are doing anything useful. The left hand is doing
the same to the right.

I could go on, but I think the analogy is starting to fall apart. Eugen
Leitl pasted up an article recently, describing the delusions,
incompetence, dirty dealing, and dirty characters involved in Britain's
MI5. That matched pretty well what I know of my own knowledge of US
operations.


Please note that my experience was entirely on the US Army side of things,
as a low-ranking officer. I was mostly insulated from political
considerations except for budget battles. However, I dealt with other
groups and I kept my eyes and ears open and couldn't help noticing things.
