First of all I'd like to say hello, since it's the first time I write  
in this mailing list. Now to the matter at hand.

Do you remember the project Pond?
https://github.com/agl/pond

I actually never used it, but when back in the day I read the design  
it seemed like a new approach to mail, encrypted and careful with  
metadata. Now the project sees unmaintained, and it seems Adam Langley  
deleted the webpage of the project (pond.imperialviolet.org) from its  
personal webpage (imperialviolet.org)

An old post about the project for those who doesn't know it.
