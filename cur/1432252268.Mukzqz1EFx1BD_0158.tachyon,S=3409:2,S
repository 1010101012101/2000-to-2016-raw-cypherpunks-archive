I understand your point, however, we aren't talking about just any old 
system, we are discussing the most critical parts of electronic 
infrastructure here.  When you've got a computer controlling fission, or 
power distribution {$your critical infrastructure of choice}, this is 
simply a Best Practice.  Hell, if we can do this for crap like public 
Internet carriers[1], why is it unreasonable to do this for actual 
critical systems?

[1] I have worked for or with several internet carriers who enforced this 
kind of security around their core systems: the smallest was a very small 
regional carrier, while the largest was a multinational NSP.  The only 
potential losses were dollars - painful but not necessarily fatal, or with 
any national security interest.  If a dipshit regional carrier can do 
this, a power company failing to do so is simply negligent.

And yes, I know that power companies are notoriously casual with their 
SCADA systems: it makes me crazy to think about it.
