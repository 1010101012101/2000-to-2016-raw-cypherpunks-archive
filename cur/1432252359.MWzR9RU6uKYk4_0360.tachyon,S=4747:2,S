But the idea that people who exchange ideas on the list hold physical meetings
all over the world (attended by non-posters) and choose to come together under
the word "Cypherpunks" really calls to mind the phrase "autonomous
decentralized network". Which, if you can believe the RAND Corporation, is
apparently where it's at...


Networks and Netwars:
The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy
John Arquilla, David Ronfeldt (editors)
free online pdf: http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1382/

Summary:

"The fight for the future is not between the armies of leading states, nor are
its weapons those of traditional armed forces. Rather, the combatants come from
bomb-making terrorist groups like Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda, or drug smuggling
cartels like those in Colombia and Mexico. On the positive side are civil
- -society activists fighting for the environment, democracy and human rights.
What all have in common is that they operate in small, dispersed units that can
deploy anywhere, anytime to penetrate and disrupt. They all feature network
forms of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the
information age. And, from the Intifadah to the drug war, they are proving very
hard to beat."

Note their interesting (and vital) distinction between criminal networks and
those "on the positive side". God knows I don't speak for anyone here but
myself, but in the best of all (im?)possible worlds, those interested in
protecting privacy and freedom through cryptography belong right at the heart
of that side of the continuum.

Whether or not any of us individually can be successful at being perceived that
way remains to be seen. There's a lot more that ought to be said on this, any
thoughts? Something to keep in mind, at any rate.

~Faustine.
