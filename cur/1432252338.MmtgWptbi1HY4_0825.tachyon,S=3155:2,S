      Yes, it sounded pretty good up until that point. And it must be a
windoz
thingy anyway -- if your using a linux box, you have your own sendmail
server, so,
of course, all linux boxes can send email peer-to-peer. But unless
they're encrypted
at the origin, however, they can still fall prey to Carnivore upstream. A
really nice thing
would be a mail client that did automagic crypt, plus a mixmaster
component to hide the
true name of the sender or receiver running on linux.  A netscape plugin
that did this would be
very, very nice, if NS ever became truly opensource. Or some other client
that handled
html mail well.
