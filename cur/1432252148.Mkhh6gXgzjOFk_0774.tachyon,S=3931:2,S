Expert labs is a "Government 2.0 initiative that aims to connect United 
States government projects with citizens who want to become more 
involved in the political discussion".

In other words, he is a political commissar.  Expert labs is an NGO. 
NGO is code for GO, for when NGOs advertise jobs, they generally 
advertise those jobs as government employment.

NGOs are government organizations that do stuff that is too embarrassing 
for the government to do, or which is illegal for the government to do.
