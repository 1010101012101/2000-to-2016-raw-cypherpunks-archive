  Recovery programme for email addicts

  By Sarah Womack, Social Affairs Correspondent

  Last Updated: 2:32am GMT 21/02/2007


  Alcoholics have a 12-step programme to tackle their addiction, drug addicts
  too, and now there is one for those addicted to email.

  Forget the mantra "I am so and so and I am an alcoholic", the new programme
  will have people admitting that email is managing them rather than the
  other way round, and will help them to tackle their obsession for reading
  or replying to emails on holiday, in the car and even in the bathroom.

  A life coach for business executives in America devised the plan for cases
  such as a golfer who checked his BlackBerry after every shot and lost a
  potential client who thought he was a socially-inept obsessive. Marsha Egan
  said email misuse could cost businesses millions of pounds in lost
  productivity.

  One of her clients could not walk by a computer - her own or anyone else's
  - without checking for messages. Another had 3,600 emails in his inbox.

  Others wait for emails and send themselves a message if one hasn't shown up
  for several minutes, she claimed.

  Research by King's College London says addiction to email is doubly
  worrying because such technology depletes cognitive abilities more rapidly
  than drugs.

  Email users suffered a 10 per cent drop in IQ scores, more than twice the
  fall recorded by marijuana users.
