So the property you own is really(!) owned by the state and you pay the 
initial payments for title transfer and the taxes during occupation (sounds 
like rent doesn't it?) unless you default in which case they take their 
property back... Seems to me the ideal strategy is to not own anything of 
significant value.

A lot of barristers have gone bankrupt lately,It hasn't cramped their 
billing style though.This threads veering into socialistic territory,Im 
telling jamesd!
Also AP comes out of tax revolt,dont try and separate it out,declan.Start a 
new thread on property taxes.Im taxing the land
where the cato institute stands,btw.If I dont get 100,000 k per annum I 
send in my new OSD black helicopters.
