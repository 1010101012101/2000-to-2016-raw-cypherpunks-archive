Sheriff, Mail Tribune to face off in court

Newspaper requests list of concealed handgun licenses, Sheriff's officials
refuse

By Paris Achen

Mail Tribune

October 15, 2007 6:00 AM

MEDFORD - The Mail Tribune filed suit Friday against Jackson County Sheriff
Mike Winters, seeking a list of concealed handgun licenses as part of an
effort to count how many license holders are teachers.

The question of teachers' rights as license holders to bring guns to
schools and how that affects school security are at the center of Mail
Tribune reports on a lawsuit between the Medford School District and
Shirley Katz, an English teacher at South Medford High School.

Winters, who as sheriff is in charge of the county's concealed hand gun
licenses under state law, denied the newspaper's written request for the
list, saying the information should be kept private.

The newspaper argued Winters' refusal to hand over the documents is
unlawful, as the licenses are public records under state law and have been
released by other sheriff's offices.

"A sheriff should enforce all laws without personal preference, and we feel
Sheriff Winters is allowing his personal feelings to interfere with his
duty to enforce the law," said Mail Tribune Editor Bob Hunter. "This is
information bought and paid for by the public, and the public has a right
to it."

The newspaper does not plan to publish the names of license holders, Hunter
said. It wants the information for research about how far-reaching a ruling
on the Katz lawsuit could be.

Obtaining a license to carry a concealed handgun in Oregon involves a
criminal background check, completing a gun safety course and signing an
application that specifically states that the license is public record.

There are about 6,500 license holders in Jackson County, according to the
sheriff's office.

Multnomah County Sheriff's Office recently released the names, dates of
birth and license numbers of license holders to the Oregonian and the
Willamette Week newspapers but withheld addresses, phone numbers and Social
Security numbers.

"We were reluctant to hand over the names because we don't want to make it
easier for anybody who would use the information for harm in terms of
credit card fraud or identity theft," said Multnomah County sheriff's
Deputy Travis Gullberg, public information officer, "but you can't get away
from the fact that it's a public record. The application form spells it
out."

The Mail Tribune first requested the licenses from the Jackson County
sheriff more than a month ago.

Before filing suit, it sought an opinion from Jackson County District
Attorney Mark Huddleston. Huddleston declined to consider the matter,
citing a state law that bars the state attorney general or county district
attorney from interfering once an elected official such as a sheriff claims
the right to withhold disclosure of a public record.

"It's important for news media to take a stand on something like this
because if public information is withheld in this way it will diminish the
amount of public information the public is allowed to see," Hunter said.

Winters said the sheriff's office would oppose the Mail Tribune's request
in court.

For both privacy and safety reasons, "I don't believe it's anyone's
business who possesses a concealed handgun license," Winters said.

The director of the gun rights group financing Katz's lawsuit challenging
the Medford School District's policy banning employees from bringing guns
on campus said as a matter of law, handgun licenses are a public record.

"Obviously, I'd like to see those people's privacy protected, but I doubt
(Sheriff Winters) has any legal justification for withholding what is a
public record," said Kevin Starrett, director of the Oregon Firearms
Education Foundation.

Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Philip Arnold heard oral arguments
Thursday on Katz's challenge of the Medford School District's policy
banning employees from taking guns on campus.

It's unclear when he'll issue a decision on the case, which will likely
have repercussions for other school districts around the state.
