Not to mention intentional Electro-Magnetic Pulse exposure of bills to 
thwart the system.

A cheaper and more robust solution would embed random length and oriented 
glass/plastic fibers in the paper.  When exposed to a line illuminator as 
it is passed through a verifier, each bill would have a unique "illuminate 
here" - "light comes out there" signature that can be read out and matched 
to a DB generated at the mint.  Because of the fiber's resilience it will 
be more difficult to damage or thwart than RFIDs.
