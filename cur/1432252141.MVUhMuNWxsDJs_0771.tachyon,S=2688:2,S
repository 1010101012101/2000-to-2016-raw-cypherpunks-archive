This reminds me of a time a buddy and I were presenting to a group at a
rather large company that had offices scattered about the country. The
presentation was going to be video conferenced across multiple offices, and
one of the people was teaching us how to control the various cameras at the
remote offices. During this tutorial, a rather attractive member of the
opposite sex was setting up one of the remote offices, so the person
conducting the demonstration decided zoom would be a good thing for us to
learn at that moment and zoomed in on certain parts of this remote person's
anatomy. I could only imagine the amount of money that rather large company
had spent on "appropriate conduct training" for that person, and it all went
right out the window in an instant.

Kinda makes you think about the ways in which these cameras will be abused
by those intended to use them.
