No, though this would be a good first step.

The obvious issue is that those in the suburbs were more careful to 
schedule their voting period to match the preannounced poll hours.

The "get out the vote" last-minute calls to the welfare chiselers, 
the addicts, the crack hoes, etc., produced a last-minute surge.

I say fuck them and fuck any court officers who pull off this 
last-minute vote grab.


"In a last-minute development, polling places in Newport Beach, La 
Jolla, and Pebble Beach will remain open for two additional hours, 
following legal calls by the California Republican Party. Democrats 
are furious, and are demanding that polling places in Watts, 
South-Central LA, and Oakland be kept open _three_ additional hours."


Rules are rules. People should plan according to those rules. 
Last-minute surges as precinct captainst call on their troops should 
not be rewarded by keeping the polls open longer.
