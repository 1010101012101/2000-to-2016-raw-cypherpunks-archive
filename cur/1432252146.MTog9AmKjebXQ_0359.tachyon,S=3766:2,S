In Iowa, it is illegal to tint your windshield, and side and rear windows
can only be tinted to a certain percent (They police have devices to measure
opacity).

The reasoning is that cops need to be able to see the driver's face for
identification and when stopping a car to see if you are pulling a gun on
them.
