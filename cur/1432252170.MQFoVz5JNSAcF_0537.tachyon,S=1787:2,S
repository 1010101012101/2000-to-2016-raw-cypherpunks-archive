Slsahdot reports that MSNBC reports http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6549265/
that there's a new video game "JFK Reloaded" http://www.jfkreloaded.com/start/
that lets you explore the Kennedy assassination
from Lee Harvey Oswald's perspective.
Neither the article nor the website indicates whether you can
also take shots from the Grassy Knoll or other locations,
or whether you get +3 Magic Bullets as opposed to regular bullets.

The authors claim that they're trying to let people see that the
Lone Gunman theory is plausible by letting them try it out.
Ted Kennedy's staff put out a highly negative statement,
but didn't call for censorship.
