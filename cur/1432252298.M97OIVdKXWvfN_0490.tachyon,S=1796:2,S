Ken Adleman and his wife photographed the entire California coastline
from their helicopter and put it on line free to the public.
Barbara Streisand, ostensible environmentalist, sued because it might let
gawking fans figure out how to get near her Malibu estate.
The suit was against Adleman and his ISPs.
The court agreed that free speech wins and that this was a SLAPP suit,
and dinged her for legal fees.
