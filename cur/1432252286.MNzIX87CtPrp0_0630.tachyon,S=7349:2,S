The fact that it's not the insuree's fault does _not_ mean that it's
the insurer's fault.  Said another way, the insurance company has no
additional responsibility to (WLOG) me because I have a genetic
defect.  However, you're proposing that the insurance company endeavor
to waste money on those who are known to be "losers" as far as
insurance goes.  You as a smoker should be the most outraged in such a
situation; the strict standards that keep you from getting insurance
at a good rate do not apply to me because my elevated risk for
e.g. heart disease has a different source.

It's not the cause of the risk that concerns the insurance companies,
it's the existance of the risk.  That's all they need judge upon, and
any interference by the government saying otherwise is an unreasonable
burden on private enterprise.

"It won't hurt them _that_much_ to lose a little money on these
people; thus, they should be forced to do so."  Preposterous.

Still not the insurance company's fault.  They're not there to save my
sorry, genetically defective ass, they're there to make money.

Right.  And if they're forced to insure people who are money sinks for
them, everyone's rates go up, because the total amount of risk the
insurance company takes (expressed as the amount of money they pay out
as claims) plus their profit must equal the amount of money they make
on premiums.
