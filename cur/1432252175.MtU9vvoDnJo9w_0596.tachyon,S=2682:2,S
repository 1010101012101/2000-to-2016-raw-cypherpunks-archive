Of course you can.  That's what living wills and powers of attorney, etc. 
are for.  But because we cannot assure that our nominees will do our 
bidding, what's really needed is assurance policies in which you contract 
for your demise.  The 'payout' is triggered if you fail to contact your 
agent at regular intervals.  Miss two appointments and a 'wet worker' is 
dispatched
