What is pleasurable to us unimaginatives trapped east
of the limits of decency is getting hands on ersatz chick
things, and the other marvelous west coast entertainments
gone stale years ago.

We get ersatz ersatz chick things by the planeloads but
not the real patooty grown in backyard agriponte sheds
all along the Pacific Coast.

Coming back from the Bell trial in April my chick thing and
I ran across a museum of old time ersatz chick things, ersatz
of the ersatz era long generated by Hollywood, and was told 
there used to be a major grower of nubile young ersatz,
film star forever virgins, in the region but now all you could 
get were the pitiful fake ersatz chicks on the corporate campuses, 
bisexuals, polysexuals, polymorphous sexuals, kaliedescopic
deviants, tree humpers, auto fetishists, vulture capital putas,
animal rights for horrific practices, and the perdurable
ersatz coprophiliacs all across the ersatz golden west,
the last dregs of ersatz America where men used to be
men in military and western gun-shooting drag and women 
were indescribable if not innocent whores like momma
and baby sister.

Somewhere western novels took over western imagination
and horses asses became ersatz heroes unable to appreciate
the real chick thing so obessesed were they at dreaming of
being motherfucked.
