I would hope that content that does not interest you, is so
interesting that you cannot skip over it and instead avidly read in
detail. I'm going back to mutt soon, and it has a wonderful keyboard
shortcut I'm so jealous of in these unfortunate for me gmail days,
"d", which I really do miss. Also, I don't want to learn how to make
gmail "as good as possible", since I'd rather put up with the pain to
encourage me to clean house.

Re topics, I have been reading enormous number of political articles
in the last months, and I make a best effort to post only the cream of
the crop. That is of course very subjective.

Here is one you might like to watch - may give an insight into "why"
Gaddafi "had to be killed" (the clip is about 9 minutes and 23.04MiB):
http://russia-insider.com/en/bowing-silly-us-propaganda/ri10791

I feel very strongly that there are great political and "disrespect
for human life" problems going on on our little planet. Tor was very
inspiring for me when I first learned about it a few years back for
example, but I do not believe that TBB by itself can cause the
political shifts we need. I think only the collapse of oppressive
illegal regimes such as USA gov and the turmoil J S Pack might
experience from that, will be enough to wake Joe up sufficiently to
the degradation of the current global political reality.

For me, the evil perpetrated by USA is a great sadness to me. Sadly,
in the face of the relative comfort of enough JSPacks, and in the face
of the domination and abuse by the government, without societal
collapse the people, the Joes and Janes, DO NOT defend their
constitution in its spirit, and FAIL to change the game from within
the borders of experiment America.

This current global hegemon therefore absolutely must end. Yesterday
Obama removed USAgov's debt ceiling - there is no longer a statutory
debt ceiling, and therefore no more "extraordinary measures". Yes, the
upper limit for tax collection vs interest payments is still 2023, yes
it will still collapse way before then, and this is the good news -
the next reset is a mathematical certainty.

My hope is that the average Joe lifts his game when (and if I guess)
turmoil erupts.

Good luck,
Zenaan
