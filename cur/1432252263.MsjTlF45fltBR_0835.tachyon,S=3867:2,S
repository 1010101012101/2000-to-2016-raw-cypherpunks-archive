If it was a dept. of commerce gathering, it could also mean NOOS Ukraine, a
computer manufacturer in the Ukraine.  DOC sponsors events that connect,
say, computer manufacturers from around the world.

if not that, it could be a network operations badge.  I don't think they
have round badges though (but I've only seen the US PTO badges and they're
not round).
