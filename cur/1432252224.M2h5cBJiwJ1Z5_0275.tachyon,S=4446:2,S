A meaningless question.  As Eric correctly points out, true
random input simply cannot be compressed, it doesn't matter
how clever you are or how much time and computing power you
have access to.  Converseley, if you're just intereted in 
"compressing"  the results of your own pseudo-random number
generator, it's trivial to do it instantly, just store the seed
and the desired file size.
