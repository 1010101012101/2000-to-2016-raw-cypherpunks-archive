The title of this post is misleading:  The protest is anti 
government, and pro property rights.

For example:
> [...] "People can see how corrupt the government is while they 
> barely have enough to eat," said Mr. Yu, reflecting on the 
> uprising that made him an instant proletarian hero 

If he was a "proletarian" hero, he would say "the capitalists".  
Instead he said "the government".

> [...]
>
> Last month, as many as 100,000 farmers in Sichuan Province, 
> frustrated by months of fruitless appeals against a dam

> hands. [...]

Gee.  They took the defense of their own property rights into their 
own hands. 

> "I work like this so that my daughter and son can dress 
> better than I do, so don't look down on me,"

They are rioting for economic mobility, not for a classless society, 
but for a society where classes are not hereditary.

The bad guys are not the rich, but those who obtain wealth through 
poliical power.

The bad deeds of the bad guys are economic regulation

The bad deeds of the bad guys are violation of property rights 
without fair compensation.

Again, the call for social mobility, equality of opportunity, not 
equality.

A riot against the state, not against the rich.
