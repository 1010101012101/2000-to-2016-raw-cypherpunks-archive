Tim - I've been off the list for a long time but return to find that I actually agree with a bunch of your posts.  What the fuck happened?  Aimee you have done wonders for love.

Feds here put my bits into the vacuumed up collection of the day for later style and word adjacency analysis and detect the level of threat and stress in my writing, correlate it with other postings to determine the level of sympathy with listcrime freedom mongers and tag it with the unique ID of my processor put it in a vault for seven years.

Meanwhile overhead drone aircraft videotape my town, then downtown they perform automated object trajectory analysis which spits out the outliers of Bayesian determiners of normalcy, flagging them as possible threatening activities while identifying the gait, odors, and timesequence behaviors of individuals who thought or did something not sanctioned by the Corporate Masters.

So my Big Brethren, hey - I'm thinking of just how one might devastate a regional economy with just a minor disruption in its transportation capabilities.  I don't wear Nike Shoes. So sue me. Arrest me. Fuck me.

Some day some time Tim May may have writ:

"There seems to be a feeding frenzy of these "you're going to get in

advance of a any charges being filed or orders issued, would be 
"taunting Happy Fun Court." Apparently the First, Fourth, Fifth, and 
Sixth Amendments are made moot when Mr. Happy Fun Court decides he is ..."
