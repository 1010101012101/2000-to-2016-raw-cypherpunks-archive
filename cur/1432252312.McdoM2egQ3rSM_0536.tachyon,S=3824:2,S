                      Why would I need the Aimster Pig Encoder?

                           As of Sunday March 4, 2001, at midnight,
Napster began
                           monitoring the file names that its users put
into the Napster
                           database, for the purpose of blocking certain
file names. This is a serious invasion of
                           your privacy as a Napster user. The file
names on your hard drive are your personal
                           property and should not be monitored by
anyone without your permission. The Aimster
                           Pig Encoder makes it more difficult for
anyone to monitor the file names on your
                           computer.


                      What does the Aimster Pig Encoder do?

                           The Aimster Pig Encoder is very simple but
effective. It takes each of the file names of
                           the mp3 files in your Napster directory and
encodes the file names so that the name
                           cannot be easily monitored.


                      What does it mean to "Encode" the file names?

                           The Aimster Pig Encoder encodes the file
names by simply changing the words in the file
                           name very slightly. For example, "Music"
becomes "usicM", "Hello" becomes "elloH",
                           and you can guess what becomes "uckF ouY, ouY
pyS astardsB".
