>
>   Gullibility is the principal cause of bubbles.  Investors and the general
public get snared by a "beautiful illusion" and throw caution to the wind.
Attempts to identify and control bubbles are complicated by the fact that the
authorities who might naturally be expected to take action have often
(especially in recent years) been among the most gullible, and were
cheerleaders for the exuberant behavior.  Hence what is needed is an objective
measure of gullibility.
>
>   This paper argues that it should be possible to develop such a measure.
Examples demonstrate, contrary to the efficient market dogma, that in some
manias, even top-level business and technology leaders do fall prey to
collective hallucinations and become irrational in objective terms.  During
the Internet bubble, for example, large classes of them first became unable to
comprehend compound interest, and then lost even the ability to do simple
arithmetic, to the point of not being able to distinguish 2 from 10.  This
phenomenon, together with advances in analysis of social networks and related
areas, points to possible ways to develop objective and quantitative tools for
measuring gullibility and other aspects of human behavior implicated in
bubbles.  It cannot be expected to infallibly detect all destructive bubbles,
and may trigger false alarms, but it ought to alert observers to periods where
collective investment behavior is becoming irrational.
>
>   The proposed gullibility index might help in developing realistic economic
models.  It should also assist in illuminating and guiding decision making.
