actually, as with most laws, the basic idea behind the "moral rights"
isn't that bad, it just got perverted.

if used differently, the "morale rights" part could well be used to put
a limit on the corporate abuse of copyright. for example, I could
envision an argument that an artist sues the RIAA for abusing his
copyrighted works for bogus lawsuits against P2P systems.
