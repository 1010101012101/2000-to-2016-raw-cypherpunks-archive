   Why wouldn't you keep loaded guns in the house? Guns should always be 
loaded, and everyone made aware of it. My kids were raised knowing they
were always loaded, and they were never "hidden" or locked up. They also
were allowed to shoot them, and often. They also had guns of their own
which they could shoot and were allowed to play with under supervision.
  I've never, in all my life, as far as I know, ever lived in a house 
without loaded guns in it. At least as far back as I can remember, my
Daddy's guns were loaded, at least the pistols. Mine always have been,
and always will be. If you raise your kids to be stupid about loaded
guns, or any other dangerous tool -- well, I guess Darwin had a point.
