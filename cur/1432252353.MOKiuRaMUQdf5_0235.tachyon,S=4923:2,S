Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520

TURKMENISTAN

November 6, 2001

The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Turkmenistan
at this time.  While the Department of State has authorized the return of
embassy personnel in non-emergency positions and family members of embassy
personnel effective November 6, 2001, the September 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States and the proximity of Turkmenistan to Afghanistan have
raised ongoing concerns for the safety of American citizens in Turkmenistan.
Afghanistan is the site of military operations and continues to harbor
international terrorist Usama bin Laden.  The U.S. Embassy in Ashgabat will
continue to employ heightened security precautions.

All American citizens in Turkmenistan are urged to review their personal
security situations and to take those measures they deem appropriate to
ensure their well-being.  The Government of Turkmenistan has taken steps to
increase security throughout the country.  Nevertheless, the current
situation in the region requires that all Americans in or traveling through
Turkmenistan evaluate carefully the implications for their security and
safety.

Americans who decide to remain in or visit Turkmenistan should exercise
caution and take all appropriate measures to ensure their personal safety
and monitor the local news.

U.S. citizens in Turkmenistan are strongly urged to register and obtain
updated security information at the American Embassy in Ashgabat.  The U.S.
Embassy is located at 9 Pushkin Street, off
Maqtymquly Street.  The telephone number is 993-12-35-00-45, fax number
993-12-51-13-05.

For further general information regardinq travel to Turkmenistan, U.S.
citizens should consult the Department of State's Consular Information Sheet
on Turkmenistan, available via the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.

This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning of September 19, 2001 and
alerts Americans to ongoing security concerns in Turkmenistan and to the
discontinuation of the authorized (voluntary) departure status of
non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. Embassy personnel.
