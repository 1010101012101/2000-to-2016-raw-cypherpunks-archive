well, stamp speed is method of rate limiting.  This equation/formula 
gives you the ratio of performance degradation.  So,

Given d=15, b=49152 (aka 384kbps) and s=1000

the slowdown ratio or factor is 737.28 times over what an unimpeded 
spammer can send.  But as you increase spam size, the slowdown factor 
declines.

actually, it would take 15 but only because you can be sending one 
stamped piece of spam at the same time as you're generating the next 
stamp.  But using your spam size, , the slowdown factor becomes roughly 
73 times.  So they would need 73 machines running full tilt all the time 
to regain their old throughput.  It's entirely possible that one 
evolutionary response to stamps would be to generate larger pieces of 
spam but that would also slow them down so we still win, kind of, sort of...

actually, I'm hearing that there are roughly one billion addresses but 
unfortunately have lost the source.  The numbers for spam I'm hearing 
are on the order of 76 billion to 2 trillion
(
2 tril spams /day

)

If you have a better source (and I am sure there are some), I would like 
to hear it.

unfortunately, I think you making some assumptions that are not fully 
warranted.  I will try to do some research and figure out the number of 
machines compromised.  The best No. I had seen to date was about 350,000.

well, that might be the case but I must have a who cares attitude about 
that.  For the most part I rarely send mail to strangers and the stamp 
generation process is in background.  So if it take several minutes to 
queue up and send a piece of mail a few times a month.  What's the 
problem? (yes, I know I'm being cavalier)

wrong unit of costs.  The stamps still take 15 seconds (give or take) 
which means approximately 5760 stamps per day.  Hardware acceleration is 
an attack against stamps by using dedicated hardware to shrink the cost 
in time of a given size stamp.  so, if and evil someone can build an 
ASIC to shrink the cost of a stamped by 100 times, then mercenary 
somebody else can build the same functionality and performance as well. 
  Plop it onto a USB interface chip, sell for $15 and balance is restored
