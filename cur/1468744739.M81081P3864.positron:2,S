People should learn those concepts. A lot of success is tied to them.

Bid systems can reduce costs to the buyers, and can even include
insurance on contractual performance of obligations by bidders.
Performance incentives could take many forms.

That's something a lot of people read AP haven't yet grown beyond...

The potential application isn't just assassinations, or dark predictions...
but democratically produced outcomes, and VC funded side expeditions.
As with existing systems today, the procurement needs of general
populations will end up greatly outweighing the minor background noise
of things like murder for hire.

Want that road from A to B repaired... write a contract for it.
A new fire truck or cop on the street... wager a prediction.
Basic health / elder care...
Terraforming Mars...


Now offering 1:2 farmer's commodity that, if not wholesale reformed,
a certain global power will have difficulty surviving under its current
ways past the 32 bit epoch, certainly not past 2076.
