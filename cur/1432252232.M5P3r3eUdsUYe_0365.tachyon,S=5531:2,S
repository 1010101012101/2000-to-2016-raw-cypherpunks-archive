I once heard a European pundit observe that Americans seem 
normal most of the time, but every now and then something surfaces
to make it clear just how alien they actually are.

The example he gave was the American obsession with weather. In
Europe,  talk about the weather is just conversational padding; 
noise of no serious consequence to fill an otherwise awkward
silences.

Americans, on the other hand, MEAN IT when they talk about the
weather. They sit up and pay attention when forecasts appear. 
All US cable systems carry a channel which broadcasts
nothing except weather reports, 24x7 - a notion which seems as
bizarre to Europeans as would a channel for watching the grass
grow. 

He surmised that this is due to the fact that in the US, unlike
Europe, bad weather can kill you. 

[And even if it doesn't kill you, it can sure as hell play havoc
with your day. I've had over 2 feet of snow overnight at my house,
while 10 miles away there was just rain. 

Mark Twain once gave a speech about the New England weather:

It's worth a look.
