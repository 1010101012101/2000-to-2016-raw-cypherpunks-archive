'Smart Park' Is Keeping Watch
Surveillance cameras, infrared sensors and other high-tech gadgets help
monitor facilities.


To civic planners in Glendale, Palmer Park has everything a recreation
area
needs  kiddie swings, walking trails and infrared sensors concealed in
the
shrubbery.

If someone scales the fence after the park closes at 10 p.m., more than
a
dozen electronic sentries whirl into action.

One foot on the manicured lawn triggers the sprinklers, while the
sensors set
off alarms at the park rangers' headquarters.

Of course, tripping the sensors without going inside the park would be
entertaining...
