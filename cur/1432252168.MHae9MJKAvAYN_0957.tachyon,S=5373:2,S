Nonsense. I have known what a 91 and a 93 (and a 94) were for many 
years. Almost bought a 91 in 1975, _did_ buy a clone.

You still haven't responded to what I sent out after my own search of 
the archives:

This speaks for itself, especially:

"Your wording above would indicate the
91 was .308 while the 93 was a different caliber, this is incorrect"


In fact, the 91 *is* a .308 and the 93 *is* a different caliber.

Do you still dispute this?

I said no such thing. Please produce the message.

Actually, many of us have wasted far more time on your crankish ideas 
than they deserve.

For example, your claim: "Beside, it's the 93/G3 not the 91 (thought 
they do share a lot of commen base pieces) that is the sniper rifle."

The 93 is a .223, not a .308, and it is _not_ the sniper rifle. 
Further, your phrase "G3 not the 91" shows your basic confusion. The 
G3 is the military version of the 91, not of the 93.

Trivial points, in some sense, but deeply illustrative of your mania 
for stating something that is incorrect and then never admitting your 
mistake, even years later.

Which is why even your co-workers acknowledge your crankishness.
