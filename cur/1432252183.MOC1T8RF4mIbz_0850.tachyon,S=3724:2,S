Bloodhounds were for a long time considered admissible in cases 
involving scent tracking, and may still be in some jurisdictions -- 
but I don't know whether they counted as "witnesses" or "evidence". 

Note that courtroom procedure calls for witnesses to be sworn in, 
and unless someone could convince a judge that the animal understood 
the concept of an oath and what was being sworn, that could probably 
be used to disqualify any animal "witness". 

Other than that though, the question is not interesting except 
in the case of language-using animals -- presently limited to apes 
and chimps trained to use sign language, and a few african Gray 
Parrots that seem to use speech in a symbolic rather than mimicking 
way.  

(Possibly also Dolphins and Orcas, but we're not sure yet and 
 translation efforts have yielded limited results at best.)

I've never heard of anyone attempting to call a language-using 
animal as a witness.  When it happens, there will probably be 
a ruling.
