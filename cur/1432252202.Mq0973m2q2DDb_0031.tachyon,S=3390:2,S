It does however, enable the state to control what OS one can boot 
if one wishes to access the internet.

It does not seem to me that the TPM is likely to give hollywood 
what it wants, unless it is backed by such state enforcement.

Furthermore, since the TPM gets first whack at boot up, a simple
code download to the TPM could change the meaning of the
signature, so that the machine will not boot unless running a
state authorized operating system.

It could well happen that TPM machines become required to go on
the internet, and then later only certain operating systems are
permitted on the internet, and then later the required operating
system upgrades the TPM software so that only authorized operating
systems boot at all.
