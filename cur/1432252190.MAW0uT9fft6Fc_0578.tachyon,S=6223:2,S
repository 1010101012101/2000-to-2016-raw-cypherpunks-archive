You know I really enjoyed George Orwells Popcorn. Maybe that was
Redenbockers' Popcorn while reading George Orwell...hehe...

Here is my dumb question for the day, but can someone show me where my logic
has run aloof?

The NSA's claim is not to have listened to the content, just collected it.
"Assuming" their telling the truth on this, I thought they may be trying to
create a bell-curve type application that scans the messages for content
based on predetermined criteria (similar to content filters I assume).

However, the flaw I see is similar to the idea behind changing speed limits
on residential streets. Public safety sets up the electronic signs to
monitor speed limits, and flashes if you travel above the posted limit.
Except the data can be ruined (for lack of a better word) if the drivers
sneak up on the sign and gun-it past it, repeatedly!

How this applies to the NSA model: If normal citizens are polluting their
data by using more vulgar or "terror driven" speech. How will they know
legitimate traffic from crank-yankers?

"The knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and
miss."
"He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes
wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it."
"He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way
down it..."
"We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!"
"I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by."
