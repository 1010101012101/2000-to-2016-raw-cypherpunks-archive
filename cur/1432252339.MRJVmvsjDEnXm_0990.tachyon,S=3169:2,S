Of course I know.  Just point your browser at adultfriendfinder.com, 
pull out your credit card, and follow the links that say "open an 
account".  Fill out the little form that comes up with your name, 
age, and credit card info, and then you can copy down the password 
that will appear on your browser. 

glad to help,
