Yeah. The sequence went as follows, starting at 9 pm:
1. Feingold introduced amendment to the USA Act
2. Feingold, Wellstone, Cantwell spoke in favor of it
3. Just about everyone else led by Hatch, Leahy, Daschle opposed it
4. Daschle moved to table
5. Everyone voted to table
6. Goto Line 1

The votes were:
83-13 to table the trespasser snooping amendment
90-7 to table roving wiretap limits
89-8 to table subpoena limits

Feingold did a reasonable enough job, but he did wimp out and not introduce 
the "secret search ban" amendment. Would have been good to have some debate 
on that. Debate ended around midnight.
