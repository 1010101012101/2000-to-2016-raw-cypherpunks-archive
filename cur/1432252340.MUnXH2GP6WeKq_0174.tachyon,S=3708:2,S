I've read the pgp-integration man page, and tried to implement
the sample codes using the system calls. The encryption example
was ok, but the decryption sample code I wasn't able to make it work
well. Whenever I ran the program I got a core file, when the program try to 
open the second stream to stdout or stdin.
I don't know if you have a tip for me.

thanks

eduardo
