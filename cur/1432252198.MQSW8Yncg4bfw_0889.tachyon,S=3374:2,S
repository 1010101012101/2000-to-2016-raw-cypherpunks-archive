I've been getting your "special mailings" (i.e., I'm on some list you 
have separate from Cypherpunks) for a few months now.

Whatever contributions you might have made several years ago (I forget), 
your weird writings of the last several months mark you as a loon.

Please remove me from your "special mailings" and please seek 
professional help.

(If in fact you are even the "Wilfred Guerin" of several years ago, as 
opposed to being the Oz-dweller who used to bombard us with so many of 
his similar rants.)
