The statement
[sent to the Arabic language daily al-Hayat, the Abu Hafs al-Masri
Brigades, which claimed responsibility for the Madrid bombings that
killed 201 people,]
said it supported President Bush in his reelection campaign, and would
prefer him to win in November rather than the Democratic candidate John
Kerry, as it was not possible to find a leader "more foolish than you
(Bush), who deals with matters by force rather than with wisdom."

..........

Nice to see that someone understands psyops, and how supporting
other-than-Bush
would be abused by Bush.

.........

Explosives for a barracks-bomb in Lebanon, $30,000
SAMs for Somalia 144 x $12,000
Spanish bombs, 10 x $8,000
Watching Bush allies lose their elections: priceless.
Some things money can't buy.
For everything else there's Hawala
