Relevance?

1. Nigeria and Sierra Leone are in other nations, beyond the 
jurisdiction of U.S. laws. If gullible Americans send money to the 
Minister of Oil Development in Nigeria, hoping to win the stupidity 
lottery, this is beyond the reach of U.S. law.

2. Look into polycentric, or market-centered, law. Those of us who are 
not as stupid as the gullible Americans caught up in these Nigerian 
scams don't wish our tax monies going to save the stupid from themselves.

3. Relevance to this list? Why talks about government enforcement on 
_this_ list in the first place/
