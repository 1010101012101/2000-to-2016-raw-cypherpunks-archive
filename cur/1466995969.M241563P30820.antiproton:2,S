Why not just killfile people who post stuff that you don't want to read?

It's not my call. This is an unmoderated, uncensored list. I like that.
If you don't like it, unsubscribe.

When would that have been? I've been subscribed off and on to various
versions of this list for about 20 years, and there's always been
garbage. Some of the garbage has been very entertaining :) Back in the

version, to conserve bandwidth. And even that had loads of garbage.
