David, use this link when sharing the Project Exile Condemnation 
Coalition's statement:
http://www.KeepAndBearArms.com/exile2
...so it doesn't wrap to a second line.

I am intrigued by the fact that NRA's Board of Coalition Builders has 
yet to respond to that statement; considering how many longtime 
dedicated leaders and proven patriots have signed it, one would think 
they'd have at least said "something."  I guess the fact that gun rights 
groups whose memberships collectively represent a large segment of 
their own membership aren't important.  Kinda reminds me of those 
who say we're wrong but have never taken direct exerpts and 
challenged them in a ready-for-publication article so they can be 
converted by KABAnators in private emails and then come back to us 
with gratitude for being patient with them while they were busy being 
right.

By the way, Lao Tzu said, "Brevity is the root of all grace."
