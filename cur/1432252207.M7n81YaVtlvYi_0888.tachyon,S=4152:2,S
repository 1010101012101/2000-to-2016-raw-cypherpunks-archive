Don't let the doorknob hit you in the ass on the way out.

That being said, you make some points worth addressing.

True, both parts. However, it seems that the majority of the regular
posters are American, and naturally are concerned about American
issues. Also, like it or not, the US is the behemoth of today's world,
and American regulations on crypto or the Internet will have an impact
on the rest of the world.

Uh, ok, thanks for sharing.

Most unmoderated Usenet groups and mailing lists have a sizeable share
of "chatting" between participants. It's a fact of life. You can put
up with it, address it intelligently with filters or other means,
whine about it, or leave.

Coderpunks is a mailing list devoted to programming issues around
crypto. It has much less chatting and other cruft. See the archive at
http://www.mail-archive.com/coderpunks%40toad.com/
Subscribe to the list via a "subscribe coderpunks" message to
majordomo@toad.com

By the way, I don't recall having seen any on-topic posts from you.
Did you do anything to improve the signal-to-noise ratio on c-punks,
or did you just complain about it?

That annoys many of the regular participants, too, as you might note
from reading the traffic regularly.

You might try reading c-punks on http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks
That'll let you read the traffic on threads that interest you without
being bothered by threads that don't.
