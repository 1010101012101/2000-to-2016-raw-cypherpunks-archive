Apple's fix of its devices to prevent access by outsiders surely is 
not like CryptoAG in which gov entry was secretly implanted. How to 
verify this has not been done? Political and technical challenge is 
that few users care about security and privacy, they just want 
convenience and latest style as Apple has become richer than Croseus 
exploiting. And Apple is hardly the only com-gov-org promising group 
identity and solidarity, with illusory security while primarily 
securing the benefits of the promiser.

Apple and govs are more similar than different and bound by loyal 
opposition, the very stance most beneficial to security and privacy 
offerers. Insecurity is the product.
