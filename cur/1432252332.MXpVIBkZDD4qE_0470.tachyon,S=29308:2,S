On a warm summer night last year, a 19-year-old woman sat in a crowded bar, 
engaged in a rite of passage familiar to countless college-age teens: 
persuading a bartender to break the law and sell her a drink. This was no 
ordinary teenager, though. She was Jenna Bush, the daughter of President 
George W. and first lady Laura Bush. The bartender was amenable to serving 
the young woman–until he spotted two agents from her Secret Service detail. 
Nervous, he approached the agents and asked what he should do. Use your 
best judgment, the agents shrugged. The bartender promptly asked Jenna Bush 
to leave. She was furious. A Secret Service agent familiar with the 
incident told U.S. News that Jenna berated her agents, then fled the bar 
into a dark alley. Sources say one of the agents chased Jenna, and she 
taunted him. "You know if anything happens to me," she said, "my dad would 
have your ass."

Not quite. After she called her father to complain about the incident, 
which is still widely recounted among agents, President Bush declined to 
side with Jenna. Laura Bush, however, was concerned about what Jenna and 
her twin sister, Barbara, view as repeated intrusions into their privacy. 
As a result, sources say, agents assigned to the protective details of the 
Bush twins have been ordered to pull back from traditional methods of 
coverage. Many agents say they regard this as a serious security risk. 
"They have no concept," says one source who has protected members of the 
Bush family. ". . . They act like they don't have any concept of world 
events and how vulnerable they are or can be."



Protecting the lives of families of top government officials has never been 
easy. By the same token, living under the controlling, intrusive, often 
overbearing, and seemingly omnipotent presence of agents can be stifling 
for political leaders and their families, especially for children. 
Presidents do what they can to strike a balance between protecting 
themselves and their families by acceding to the demands of agents, at the 
same time fighting for the right to have some semblance of a normal life. 
Some family members unused to the constant presence of armed law 
enforcement officers seek restrictions on agents' activities and guarantees 
of privacy. Others, more hostile, rebel and try to give their minders the 
slip, as Jenna's sister, Barbara, has done. Last April, Barbara's agents 
were lampooned by the Yale University magazine Rumpus after the car she was 
in sped through an E-ZPass lane as Barbara and her friends drove from New 
Haven, Conn., to a World Wrestling Federation match in New York. Members of 
her security detail had to wait in the toll lane on a bridge into 
Manhattan, then weave through traffic at high speeds to catch up. In Texas, 
Jenna evaded her Secret Service agents following class last fall, after the 
September 11 attacks, sources say. When she finally surfaced after several 
hours, a supervisor on her protective detail lectured the young woman and 
warned against repeating such behavior.

The Bush twins aren't alone. Secret Service sources tell U.S. News that 
shortly after 9/11, President Bush sought expanded coverage for other Bush 
family members through an executive order. But this June, President Bush 
changed his mind and ordered the Secret Service to discontinue the security 
details he had authorized for several family members. "They are dictating 
coverage," says a Secret Service agent. "And what's worse is we're letting 
them."

"Protective methodology." After September 11, Secret Service executives 
made significant additions to President Bush's security arrangements. But 
some agents worry that Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, with its vast, open 
spaces, poses serious staffing and logistical challenges, difficulties that 
give pause to even the toughest military-trained tactical teams in the 
service. Providing security for its protectees in remote locations like the 
president's ranch is regarded as among the most difficult challenges by 
Secret Service executives, agents, and officers.

How to best guarantee the safety of the president, the vice president, and 
their families is just one element of a larger debate among line agents, 
uniformed officers, and Secret Service executives about the agency's 
changing role and responsibilities. In the past year, Director Brian 
Stafford has implemented a broad new security theory known as "protective 
methodology." Many agents and officers say this plan goes against the grain 
of time-tested Secret Service methods and practices and could expose 
protectees and their bodyguards to possible attack by reducing customary 
layers of protective "insulation." The changes include cutting the number 
of posts where agents and officers stand guard, eliminating some technical 
assets like magnetometers, ballistic glass, and armored plating, and 
withdrawing Counter Sniper, Counter Surveillance, Counter Assault, and 
other tactical teams. "Basically, what we are doing now and what we were 
trained to do are at different ends of the spectrum," says a veteran agent. 
"It doesn't make sense."

Director Stafford declined to respond to an interview request. Paul Irving, 
who heads the Office of Government Liaison and Public Affairs, also failed 
to reply to a detailed list of questions for this article. A senior White 
House official who works closely with the Secret Service said he believes 
the service is doing a "terrific" job protecting President Bush and other 
top government officials and their families. Scott McClellan, a White House 
spokesman, also declined to respond to specific questions, saying, "We do 
not discuss security issues. The president and Mrs. Bush are grateful and 
appreciative for the outstanding job the Secret Service does in protecting 
the first family and others."

Traditionally, the Secret Service has relied on a guarantee of 360-degree 
coverage of its protectees. The approach calls for a team of agents 
enveloping the person under protection in a kind of moving box, covering 
him or her from all angles. The new protective methodology, by contrast, is 
based on an evaluation of "threat assessments," calculating different 
levels of risk confronting protectees like the vice president, his wife, 
and their children, the president's children, and the first lady. Using 
current intelligence information and historic precedents like past 
assassination attempts, Secret Service executives determine how many agents 
and what kinds of special teams and capabilities to assign individual 
protectees. For instance, vice presidents have been considered a relatively 
low assassination risk. Vice President Cheney, as a result, under the 
protective methodology approach, like other VPs, has received fewer assets 
and tactical support teams than the president.

Some Secret Service agents say that a protective theory based so heavily on 
intelligence analysis may be dangerously flawed, especially in light of the 
intelligence failures that occurred prior to the September 11 attacks on 
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. These individuals say that Secret 
Service executives have sometimes ignored or discounted security 
recommendations more heavily weighted to intelligence analysis, despite the 
fact that such analysis has been so heavily emphasized by Director Stafford 
and other proponents of the protective-methodology theory. Shortly after 
September 11, Cheney's security was beefed up. Then in December, Stafford 
and his deputy, Danny Spriggs, met with Secret Service agents and Uniformed 
Division officers at the Naval Observatory, Cheney's official residence. 
Sources say the meeting was intended as a morale booster. Stafford told the 
agents and officers that though they were not assigned to the elite 
presidential protective detail, they were doing a vitally important job. 
Intelligence analysts rated Cheney as a higher security risk than President 
Bush, Stafford continued, because of his having served as the first 
President Bush's secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf War a decade 
ago. The war, and the presence of thousands of American troops in Saudi 
Arabia before, during and after it, have been cited as a principal source 
of grievance by Osama bin Laden and others in his al Qaeda terrorist 
organization. Shortly after the meeting, however, several sources tell U.S. 
News, Secret Service executives reduced the level of Cheney's protection. 
"You say this guy is the biggest threat? They started cutting," says one 
former officer. "They were short of manpower for the Olympics. They cut 
posts everywhere." By Christmas, several Secret Service officials say, the 
special Counter Assault, Counter Sniper, and Emergency Response teams 
assigned to Cheney immediately after September 11 were phased out. For 
months, the Secret Service also rejected recommendations for magnetometers, 
or X-ray machines, to screen attendees at public events where Cheney 
appeared. These same sources say the service began assigning more Mag 
officers, as they are called, to Cheney's detail after U.S. News reported 
(June 17, 2002) on the agency's recent cost-cutting measures and personnel 
difficulties. The Treasury Department's inspector general initiated an 
investigation of each of the allegations cited in the magazine's earlier 
story. That inquiry is continuing, sources say. The department's top law 
enforcement official, Under Secretary for Law Enforcement Jimmy Gurulé, 
sources say, has also begun interviewing officers to gauge the extent of 
problems documented by the magazine in the Secret Service's Uniformed 
Division.

"Brokenhearted." The agents who spoke to U.S. News for this account are all 
currently employed by the Secret Service and have held a variety of 
high-profile assignments, including protecting the president and vice 
president, the first lady, Lynne Cheney, and other members of the Bush and 
Cheney families. They spoke on condition of strict anonymity. In addition, 
U.S. News spoke to many former Uniformed Division officers who have guarded 
the White House complex and foreign embassies in and around Washington, 
D.C. The agents and officers declined to discuss sensitive protective 
techniques and methods so as not to compromise protectees' safety or the 
security of the White House complex. Many of the agents and officers told 
the magazine that they decided to come forward after the earlier U.S. News 
article because of growing concerns about their ability to ensure the 
safety of some protectees–family members who typically receive little or no 
protective coverage. More than a dozen agents who have served on protective 
details for a particular family member at various times over the past year 
have expressed concern that security measures the Secret Service has 
implemented on that individual's behalf were dangerously inadequate. U.S. 
News has refrained from publishing certain security information obtained 
during the reporting and research for this article and is withholding the 
name, location, and other details about the individual cited by these 
agents for security reasons. "If something happens to this protectee," says 
one agent, "it would cause great embarrassment. Not to mention the family; 
they would be brokenhearted."

In addition to the merits of the new protective-methodology plan, some 
agents question the timing of its implementation. The Secret Service budget 
has increased 75 percent since 1999, to $1.05 billion today. At the same 
time, though, the service has suffered a debilitating loss of manpower 
while the scope of its protective and investigative missions has increased 
significantly. After the September 11 attacks, President Bush increased the 
number of protectees from 17 to 38. The number is now down to 22, but 
that's still a significant increase for a relatively small force of nearly 
3,000 agents and roughly 1,000 Uniformed Division officers. The service has 
butted heads with other agencies like the FBI as it has sought to expand 
the original mission for which it was created–combating counterfeiting–to 
take on new responsibilities like investigating cybercrimes and 
international financial crimes. The service has also been given primary 
responsibility for providing security at what it calls national security 
special events like the Super Bowl and the recent Winter Olympics Games in 
Salt Lake City.

The new missions come at the same time the departures of agents and 
officers are accelerating. In the past year, more than 100 plainclothes 
agents have retired, quit, or taken jobs with the newly created 
Transportation Security Administration, internal Secret Service records 
show. In the past two months alone, the service has lost special 
agents-in-charge of its field offices in Cincinnati, Oklahoma City, 
Orlando, St. Louis, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Mo. Many agents 
say they are leaving because they are fed up and want better pay and more 
humane working conditions, including less travel. These agents are 
averaging 81 hours overtime per month. A unique Secret Service pension plan 
allows retirement-age agents to rejoin the federal government at other 
agencies at elevated pay grades. Even elite Counter Sniper technicians from 
the Uniformed Division, who fill some of the most-sought-after and 
prestigious positions in the service, are leaving. CS marksmen guard the 
roof of the White House and travel on presidential and vice presidential 
advance trips to identify and assess possible security risks. Sometimes, 
Secret Service executives have had so few CS technicians that they have 
been forced to resort to what one source describes as "pseudo protection," 
for presidential or vice presidential events, shining powerful floodlights, 
hanging huge drapes, or erecting special barriers in lieu of posting 
Counter Snipers at vulnerable location. In recent months, the shortage of 
CS technicians has been so acute that on several occasions, only one 
officer has been assigned to plan advance security for an event involving 
the president or vice president. "They were cutting down power to do basic 
assessments," says a veteran Secret Service official. "CS advance is very 
difficult. You could see [the technician] running around like a madman."

Double standard. Morale in the service is plummeting, many agents say, in 
part because of a widely perceived double standard. Agents who enjoy close 
relationships with Secret Service executives in Washington are given more 
favorable assignments and other treatment than those who don't, many in the 
service say. In the sometimes arcane parlance of the Secret Service, these 
agents have what is known as a "hook" with headquarters. The Secret Service 
has also had long-standing management difficulties with its Uniformed 
Division, the officers and technicians who are at the front line of defense 
at the White House and at foreign missions. They include members of the 
elite Counter Sniper teams, the Emergency Response Team, and the K-9 bomb 
squad units. Many of these officers complain of being treated as 
second-class citizens. Plainclothes agents sometimes refer to uniformed 
officers as "box creatures," because they stand watch in the little white 
booths around the White House grounds. Sources say that some officers who 
transferred and became plainclothes agents found anonymous notes soon after 
taking up their new duties saying, "once a guard, always a guard." Many of 
the uniformed officers are overworked, with even supervisors forced to put 
in an enormous amount of overtime. Since last October, the Secret Service 
has lost more than 256 Uniformed Division officers, according to internal 
statistics provided to U.S. News; if current trends continue, the total 
could rise as high as 400 by year's end, nearly a third of the Uniformed 
Division's workforce. The personnel drain throughout the service has led to 
a decrease in the number of officers and agents available to protect the 
White House. "They cut posts around the White House before 9/11," says one 
source. Secret Service executives have had to shift officers who train 
cadets at the Beltsville, Md., academy to the White House complex. Officers 
assigned to guard foreign missions around Washington have also been shifted 
to stand post at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Valued members of the Secret 
Service's technical staff are also departing in significant numbers, 
including telephone and computer experts and highly trained encryption 
specialists.

Pressure cooker. The numbers alone are alarming, many inside the Secret 
Service say, but they also translate into a worrisome loss of experience 
among those who remain. When veteran trainers and supervisors leave, they 
take with them years of institutional knowledge and practical, hands-on 
experience that often cannot be taught by less experienced personnel. 
Agents and former Uniformed Division officers tell U.S. News that they fear 
that the enormous pressure to quickly hire and train new agents, combined 
with the lower hiring standards that were implemented in recent years, may 
further compromise security, if the wrong people are brought on board. In 
the past, Secret Service job applicants who had used any drugs, including 
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, were automatically disqualified and sent on 
their way. But now, sources say, an applicant who has stayed clear of 
marijuana for just 36 months and smoked it only 10 times can still qualify. 
And the Secret Service will consider candidates with cocaine or heroin 
use–as long as it was before their 21st birthday. The service now 
classifies such activity as a "youthful indiscretion."

In meetings with members of Congress, Treasury Department overseers, and 
White House officials, Secret Service executives have sought to downplay 
the extent of personnel problems. But they have also had little to say 
publicly about their new approach to guarding high government officials and 
their families. Director Stafford and his deputies have committed very 
little information about the new protective-methology procedures to paper, 
several agents say. These agents worry that there has not been the kind of 
rigorous training, testing, and lesson planning based on the new protective 
theory, as has been the case with traditional protective methods. Agents 
and officers interviewed for this article expressed concern that if 
something goes wrong, there is so little on paper about the 
protective-methodology procedures that line agents and officers may be held 
accountable for decisions made by higher-ups. "Congress," says one veteran 
agent, "is going to grill our behinds, barbecue our backsides when, not if, 
but when–something happens." Adds another agent: "All you're doing is 
counting the days and hours you've been lucky."

Some key causes of concern:

The Secret Service is so hard pressed to find trained Mag officers to 
screen people attending public functions with the president, vice 
president, and other top officials that it has had to reduce the number of 
such officers at some events. When heads of Secret Service details request 
Mag officers, they are often told that none is available; when they turn in 
security advance plans to headquarters, approved plans often come back with 
the number of Mag officers reduced, even for the president's detail, 
sources say. Detail heads have been forced on some occasions to pull agents 
from other posts to fill in near X-ray machines to scan crowds or even to 
use hand-held devices to screen attendees. One source says agents assigned 
to Cheney always make sure they are "vested up," have their bulletproof 
vests on, when they don't get magnetometer support and worry that a 
terrorist or a deranged person might sneak a gun into an event.

Because of concerns in part over excessive cost, Secret Service officials 
have declined to install ballistic glass in front of windows of hotels or 
other venues where key protectees have been scheduled to appear. "They 
won't put up ballistic glass," says an agent, "because they have to pay 
money to bring in a truck with a hydraulic lift to roll the glass in." 
Supervisors also frequently nix requests from agents for camouflaged 
armored sheets of steel used at outdoor events or in hotels to guard 
against sniper fire.

Agents say the Secret Service has failed to adjust its post-9/11 security 
procedures to address the potential threat of an aerial attack. The 
service, sources say, must demand more aggressive vetting of small aircraft 
by local police and other government agencies in advance of public events 
involving the president and vice president. Agents say they are especially 
worried about charter planes, because they receive virtually no security 
screening and their flight paths are typically not monitored. "It raises 
concerns," says one agent, "about how to reassure those who are under our 
protection about their safety, when really, we can't."

Security precautions taken for the first lady, some agents say, are often 
dangerously inadequate. In Washington, Laura Bush's motorcade does not even 
get the benefit of "intersection control"–coordinated traffic lights, a 
basic security measure accorded many high-risk visiting foreign 
dignitaries. And agents say they are concerned about the security of the 
vice president's wife, Lynne.

When her father was president, Chelsea Clinton was regularly assigned a 
two-man Counter Assault Team, in addition to her regular detail, after she 
received threats when she was a Stanford University student. The Bush 
daughters briefly were assigned similar teams after September 11, sources 
say, but they have since been pulled back.

Added to the loss of experienced agents and officers, many in the Secret 
Service believe executives remain skeptical of the value of some elite 
special units like Counter Assault, Counter Surveillance, and Emergency 
Response teams–the Pentagon-trained Uniformed Division officers who protect 
the White House. These sources say that many senior supervisory agents in 
the field and officials at headquarters are philosophically at odds with 
using these techniques. "They think we are cowboys," says a former veteran 
Emergency Response Team member, "and that it's overkill." This former 
officer and other sources say there's a kind of generation gap, due in part 
to the fact that many senior officials never went through the specialized 
training now required of the Secret Service's most elite units. Training is 
a key measurement. Many agents and officers describe the training of new 
recruits as excellent, but others say the Secret Service is behind the 
curve. "These guys think old school," says one former officer who came to 
the Secret Service from the military. The specialized teams train to 
respond to multiple threats, like the September 11 attacks, and to rocket, 
chemical, and biological assaults. But most officers not on the elite teams 
and nonspecial team agents are still trained on a "single cycle" threat, 
such as that posed by a lone gunman. Some of these agents believe that 
after 9/11, the service should have modified its training curriculum to 
focus more on responding to multipronged attacks.

"Standing down." Paramount among the Secret Service's high-priority 
protective missions, of course, is the White House and its inhabitants. 
Despite the agency's ability to scramble and redeploy agents and officers 
from other responsibilities over the past year, the challenge is only 
likely to grow, agents and officers say. More than five years ago, special 
operations experts from the elite military counterterrorism unit Delta 
Force conducted a threat assessment of the White House and found numerous 
vulnerabilities. Secret Service executives have implemented only a few 
minor changes since that study, sources say. The threats are varied and not 
easy, in some cases, to counter. Veteran Secret Service officers worry, for 
example, about the long-standing custom of "standing down" when members of 
Congress come to call at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. One former officer says 
he requested a congressman's voting card to double-check the member's 
identification and was "reamed out" by his supervisor after the congressman 
complained. Officers who spoke with U.S. News for this article say they 
have been forced time and again to allow members of Congress to enter the 
White House complex without identification because they have complained 
loudly when challenged. The worries, these sources say, are not misplaced. 
In April 1994, at the funeral reception for former President Richard Nixon 
at his library in Yorba Linda, Calif., a middle-aged man using fake 
identification papers sauntered through the VIP-congressional area and 
approached then President Clinton and former President George Bush. He 
attempted to engage them in conversation before he was finally detained, 
arrested, and charged with trespassing. "There's no way we can know even a 
quarter of these people," says one officer. "Yet we are supposed to allow 
them onto the ground without a picture ID. You can buy congressional pins 
or congressional license plates off eBay."

The Secret Service has a long and proud history of meeting difficult 
challenges and beating them. Many agents and officers, still intensely 
loyal to the agency, say they believe that with the right leadership and an 
influx of new blood, the service can handle whatever new demands it is 
required to meet. But others worry that the double whammy of personnel 
losses and increased responsibilities may be impeding the ability of the 
agency to function at the high levels expected of it. For some in the 
Secret Service, that challenge comes down to a decidedly personal level. "I 
hate to say this, but I couldn't have cared less," says one officer who has 
left the service. "If someone tried something, I probably would have missed 
it, because I just did not care."
