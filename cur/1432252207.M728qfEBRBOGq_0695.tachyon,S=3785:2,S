Which is a good reason to use a shielded cable, of the lowest practical
length..  (check the resistance from one cable-end-housing  to the other.
If it's open it's NOT properly shielded.  If it's shorted it MAY be properly
shielded.)   Further, whether or not the cable is shielded, putting one of
those snap-on ferrite core filters at each end of the video cable, plus one
each foot or so, does an excellent job preventing RF from propagating along
the cable shield and radiating.
