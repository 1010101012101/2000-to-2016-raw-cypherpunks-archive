Hello,

Is this the right time to talk to you about a 2nd income?

Do you have leadership skills? 

Are you looking for the right Business opportunity to work those
leadership skills with?

If you answered YES to the above question then we may be looking for
you.

We represent a 15 year old membership catalogue shopping company 
with over 500,000 members in the USA & Canada. Last year we did 
just over 400 million dollars in product sales. Over 90% of our members 
order from their catalogue for their own personal use on a month to 
month basis....a real testimonial to the quality of our products.

We are now looking for a few motivated entrepreneurial individuals in 
your market area. If you qualify we will teach you our marketing 
strategies [including our unique Internet lead generation program] and 
help you develop a residual income that will last a lifetime.

For your FREE information, click on or copy and paste the below URL 
into your browser, and find out how one former West Virginia High 
School Principal in less then 7 years, turned a $29.00 start up fee, 
into a $25,000.00 a month plus RESIDUAL income.

.......To realize a Dream....you must have a Dream to realize...... 



------------------------------------------------
"All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream 
by night in the dusty recesses of their minds
wake in the day to find it was vanity, but the 
dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they 
may act on their dream with open eyes, to make
it possible."
~ T. E. Lawrence - Seven Pillars of Wisdom ~
