The implied asumption above, of course, is that Safeweb narcs to their
investor, the
CIA, and so on to the US Government.

Actually, depending on your threat model, Safeweb can provide a very useful
service.

One of the things a Safeweb proxy does is SSL all your traffic between your
browser
and Safeweb. Even URLs are encrypted. The upshot of this is that if your
worry is not
a TLA, but rather, a snoopy employer watching the firewall to see who visits

monster.com, safeweb provides a good shield. If you're asked why you use it,
you 
can point out that it allows you to research competitors without tipping
them off. 

[For those curious, I've just survived the current round of layoffs at RSA.
I'm curious
as to whether other RSA employees on the list have (you know who you are).
