I am looking for a surplus radome. The minimum diameter is 20 meters, but
the bigger, the better. The disassembled radome will need to fit into
standard ISO dry cargo containers. Alternatively, I am looking for
manufacturers of new radomes. Any pointers are appreciated.

Feel free to forward this inquiry to more appropriate fora that you might be
aware of.

Thanks,
