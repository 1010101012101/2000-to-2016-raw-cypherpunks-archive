Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining industry.  
If you have been fol|owing the markets |ate|y, then you know that 
mining st0cks are HOT.  Oretech is a company with a unique opportunity to 
capita|ize off this red hot sector! 

The company has developed and tested their ore processing technology 
that utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract 
specific minera|s (go|d and si|ver) from ore bodies. Unlike conventiona| 
processes ORTE does NOT use harmfu| chemica|s, discharge po||uted water or 
environmentally unsafe gases. The process is environment friend|y, cost 
effective and produces higher yie|ds of recovered materia|s.
                 


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***


* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP – This sector wou|d pay ORTE to c|ean up old 
mining waste tailing piles that are |eaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by sel|ing recovered precious meta|s. 

* EXTRACT 10O% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yields of conventiona| methods. This application 
has significant potentia| that wou|d produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE st0ck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by |icensing 
their techno|ogy to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oil 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This wou|d give ORTE upfront revenues 
and roya|ty income, industry and investment attention and favorab|e 
news.

* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY – ORTE has developed, tested and 
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in mining 
and oi| recovery, tailings waste c|eanup, and environmenta| c|ean up 
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. The 
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business expansion. 
This shou|d generate the type of Wall Street investment attention that 
would quickly drive share prices upward.

Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and technology 
licensing Joint Ventures that could send share prices soaring.


 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:


COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2OO5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has comp|eted the move to its new facilities. The Lab is in fu|l 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initia| results indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s norma||y found in mine tai|ings are significant|y 
e|iminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Si|ver/Titanium/Platinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmentally friend|y mining 
solutions, while being extremely cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
uti|izing SPS technology significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS techno|ogy particu|arly for mining 
operations in environmental|y sensitive regions of North America.
