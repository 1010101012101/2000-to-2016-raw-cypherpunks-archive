Somehow it seemed to me that this was all about a big brother type of state,
where provision of anonymity services would hardly go unpunished. Bear
argued, more or less, that if AP should ever come true, the courts would let
the end justify the means. The viewpoint is not entirely consistent with the
assumptions behind AP.

If anonymity is available. AP assumes that. I'm not entirely sure Bear did.

Multiple hosts. What's the difference besides the number of Men needed to
take them *all* down?

Of course, given anonymity, everything you say makes perfect sense.
