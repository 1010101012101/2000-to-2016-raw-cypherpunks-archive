To say the same thing in different words, the spammer's
unattended computer costs 0.0016cents per second, the non
spammer's computer is worth about 0.5cents per second, because
there is an impatient user sitting there waiting for the mail
to complete.

Thus the non spammer's computer time costs approximately four
hundred times as much as the spammer's computer time.

We have to use a form of cash that is similarly valuable for
spammers and non spammers.
