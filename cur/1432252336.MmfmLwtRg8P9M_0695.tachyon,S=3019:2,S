Totally agree, its just a question of time. I have a friend who is a 
musician/composer her intent is to publish on the Net, me I'll do the 
technical stuff for her. In the past the music houses distributed the 
music, now they are not needed, the marketing they do is less and less 
and worse and worse. I think the musicians  pay for such stuff anyway, 
so why precisely do we need the likes of Sony? They are just churning 
out the same stuff, while new musicians struggle and are ignored. 
Cutting out the middle men who offer smoke and mirrors means we as 
consumers pay less and the creators get a fairer return, I cant wait for 
it.  

While all this DRM , Palladium is fine for the US, I dont see it being 
saleable anywhere else, and I suspect the "youngsters" will avoid such 
crippled kit like its the plague in the US. Some of the suits seem to 
forget we have choice or think they have removed that choice, I very 
much want to prove them wrong.

Thing
