which is, btw, not really correct.

I was one of those panelists, and I explicitely stated that
authentication is only the first step, but an important step, which 
requires a second step (literally in my slides). So the
first statement seems to be a quote of my talk.

But my statement about the second step was that "reputation" does not
work on an international scale, this works in the U.S. only. It might
even be unlawful in Europe. My proposal was to do the second step
individually for each country.
