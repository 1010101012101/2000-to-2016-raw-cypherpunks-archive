Not MY phone, which is an Android. =C2=A0I have detested Apple ever since t=
he very early 1980s, when they had a nasty legal habit of suing anybody who=
 tried to make an add-on card for the Apple II computer. =C2=A0(Which didn'=
t have a SHIFT key, which is why for a long time you could tell a person on=
 the BBS's had an Apple BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TYPED IN ALL CAPS!!!). =C2=A0 W=
ho forgets to add a shift key?
The one really great thing Apple ever did was to choose the Motorola 68000 =
microprocessor for their Macintosh computer, which had a 24-bit linear memo=
ry address space =C2=A0(later increased to 32 bits), unlike the foolish 80X=
86 series, which had a botch called "segmentation". =C2=A0(Although, I have=
 long maintained that there would be nothing wrong with segmentation, as lo=
ng as the individual segments could be made as large as any program and/or =
data that you could ever want to use. =C2=A0The 8086/88 only allowed segmen=
ts 64Kbytes in length. =C2=A0Sure, later iterations allowed larger segment =
