David Petraeus would disagree - particularly as he got nailed for using 
email from an inappropriate location, not for web browsing from an 
inappropriate location.  Notice while your link piously gives an 
innocent explanation for what Firefox is doing with a list of nearby 
wifi points, your link does not discuss what the hell Thunderbird is 
doing with a list of nearby wifi points.

The document you cite says that if you OK a website knowing where you 
are, your browser then sends that website (not Google) your location, 
which can indeed happen if you fiddle with the settings.  What, however, 
happens in the default setting, is that if you OK a website knowing 
where you are, your browser does not send them a list of your nearby 
wifi points, but instead tells them to request your location from 
Google.  There seems to be no technological reason why they cannot 
request your location from Google without waiting for your browser to 
tell them to do so, though I suppose Google might be displeased.

Which procedure implies that Google already has a list of your nearby 
wifi points, from which it has already deduced your location.
