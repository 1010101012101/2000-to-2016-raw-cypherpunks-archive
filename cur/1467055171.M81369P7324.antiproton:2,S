Didn't bother reading past your "truth about Stalin" line, tbh... he killed all the old Bolsheviks in show trials, consolidated his power, and created the template for fucking North Korea.  Or is there a vicious smear campaign against the Kims going on too ? ;)

I won't bother to defend any politician or state. The US is built on slavery and genocide. That doesn't make Stalin a good guy.
