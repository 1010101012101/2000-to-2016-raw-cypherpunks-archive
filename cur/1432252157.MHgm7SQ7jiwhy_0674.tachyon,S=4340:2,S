Well, you have it completely within your power to do experiments 
yourself, right now, at your own site. Visit a site like 
www.junkbusters.com and download their filters and then apply them 
against your own site. Everything you need to experiment with 
blocking their cookie-blocking tools is right there.

(I just visited this site, and your own site, www.algebra.com, to see 
what it is you're so worried about people filtering out. Frankly, 
your ads were not nearly as obtrusive as some are, e.g., those ads 
running across the top, the bottom, and on both _sides_. Why you are 
worried that ads for "Gel Mouse Pads" will get blocked is beyond 
me...most clueless high school students trying to get your site to do 
their algebra homework for them will not be bothering with ad-busting 
proxies and other such filters.)
