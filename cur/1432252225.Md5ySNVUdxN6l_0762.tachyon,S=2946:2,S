> Center for Disease Control Investigating Second Anthrax Case
> By Chris Dolmetsch

Very interesting, I can't find this story _anywhere_ other than the
URL you posted.  It should be white-hot news, because two airborne
anthrax infections in the same region, where the terrorists trained,
is either an enormous, outrageous coincidence, or a biological
attack.  Too bad that, like the smallpox vaccine, the anthrax vaccine
isn't available to civilians.  "We won't vaccinate you!" seems like
not the optimal way to fight bioterrorism.  Maybe if enough people die
from it, there will be a black market in vaccines to meet the obvious
demand.  Maybe people will go to jail for having the wrong antibodies.

FORTUNATELY, this stuff is not contagious.  Either you have it or you
don't.  If there was an attack, it's too late to do anything about it,
as far as I can tell from reading on the 'net.
