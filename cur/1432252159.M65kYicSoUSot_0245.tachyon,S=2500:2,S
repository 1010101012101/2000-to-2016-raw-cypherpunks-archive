Right. But there's still a difference between:

* I trust that my computer has not been black-bagged (because I've
checked, or have steps to prevent that, or it would require more effort
from my adversary than I'm worth)
* I trust that the current state of the art in terms of factoring in
the public literature is within several orders of magnitude of what's
in the classified literature.

And:

* I trust Paypal or Microsoft Hotmail to guard my privacy at all costs
when faced with an urgent, secret request from John Aschroft.
