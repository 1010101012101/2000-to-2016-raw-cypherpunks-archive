Hi Davis,

Thank you very much for this awesome feedback, having constructives=20
criticizes like this helps me a lot :) I'll try to explain my choices=20
for some of them.

I agree with your first comment, there's clearly a lack of=20
communication. But, I'm currently working on the 0.8 release and on a=20
fundraising (on Kickstarter) before the end of summer. I'll create a=20
thread on Reddit and talk about it theses next couple of weeks ;)

For the video, I don't have skills to do a nice looking one. But if you=20
have tips, do not hesitate to share them with me.

For PHP, the choice was made a couple of years ago and the aim was to=20
install Movim on quite all the servers (I love Ruby on Rails but=20
deploying a RoR application can be quite difficult for some=20
administrators). We also tried to built Movim on top of differents PHP=20
frameworks (Zend, Symfony and more recently Laravel).
The thing is that Movim works in a really special way (the connexion is=20
kept open with the XMPP server using BOSH threw long polling requests=20
so I have to do session synchronisation en prevent session-lock=E2=80=A6 al=
l=20
in PHP) so it cannot be ported easily on a "classical MVC" framework.=20
We also use our own internal widget system with event handling (when a=20
specific XMPP stanza is handled).

I'll take a look at the sanitizer.rb file and try to find a proper way=20
to sanitize the strings, maybe use an external library for that ;)

Having a public/ folder is also planned for the 1.0 version but I need=20
to refactor a couple of stuffs in the app to make it works properly.

I'm also using the PSR standard (http://www.php-fig.org/) especially=20
for the library loading (using composer) and the logger. I've already=20
moved parts of Movim to independant libraries to modularize the project=20
;)

I'm trying to move from Bazaar to Git but I mave a couple of issues=20
when I convert the commit-history tree. Also I'm looking for a proper=20
way to handle the internationalisation (Launchpad has a ship-in system=20
for that).

We are also one of the most advanced XMPP client, with a really nice=20
implementation of the standard (all the currently implemented XEP are=20
listed here : http://wiki.movim.eu/en:dev:protocol_implementations).=20
I'm working with the XMPP Standard Fundation to standardise and improve=20
the XMPP protocol.

Thanks again !

edhelas

</div>Well, there's the Diaspora protocol:<br>
<a href=3D"https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol_overview=
" target=3D"_blank">https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol=
_overview</a><br>
<br>
And... StatusNet/OStatus, PumpIO, TentIO, ActivityStreams, BuddyCloud (XMPP=
-<br>
based, I guess), and quite a few others I don't really remember. Some of th=
em<br>
are related, all are incompatible. And all the devs are showing strong<br>
symptoms of the NIH syndrome.<br>
<br>
Which is absurd.<br>

one have solved it yet... for social=20
network or basically any IM/chat/etc to be usable it must have majority=20
of people (eg. your friends) users there, otherwise without people they=20
are totally useless so currently we're stuck with no-so-great=20
applications/protocols only because everyone already are on them like=20
Facebook and Skype. On that mailing list there were discussion about a<span=

 could support all networks so users wouldn't be forced to migrate which
 I think is essential because a lot of people won't bother. There was=20
mention to</span> <a href=3D"http://sockethub.org/" target=3D"_blank">Socke=
thub </a>which seems quite cool, only for a bit different use case I would =
say.<br>Another thing I would like to mention is <a href=3D"http://bitlbee.=

 it is a gateway between various IM/chat networks and IRC so you can=20
chat with friends on Facebook using your favorite IRC client, or post a=20
tweet on your Twitter and use various other protocols. It even supports=20
OTR.</span><br><br></div></div></div>
</blockquote></div></div></blockquote></div>okay so I've quickly reviewed M=
ovim, idea is really good and it seems to
 be nice, but I haven't yet tried to run it, will do that someday. It=20
looks like you haven't really marketed it good enough because this is=20
first time I hear about it despite it being an somewhat old project. For
 example Tox is pretty new but it's already quite popular and I keep=20
hearing about it every few months. I would suggest to post more on=20
various social sites, forums and just let people know it exists (eg. post t=
o Reddit) Another thing I would suggest is add a video to=20
website of example usage so people could see how it is actually used, expla=
in various features and such as users might not immediately discover some f=
eatures.<br><br>Now I'll tell a few things, but that's only my personal opi=
nion and=20
most likely a lot of people won't agree with it. So anyway firstly I'm=20
not a fan of PHP, it's just generally awful language (see <a href=3D"http:/=
/phpsadness.com/">http://phpsadness.com/</a>
 and look at PHP src :D), I know it because I've been writing it for=20
like 7+ years but now 2-3 years I'm PHP-less and happy about it :)=20
Next it looks like you aren't using any PHP framework but self-developed
 one which gives you more work than is needed and obviously it's less battl=
etested. But overall code itself is nice and pretty, correctly uses MVC pat=
tern. Bad things are that you don't have separate public directory for fron=
tend and anyone can access PHP files directly, view templates for example (=
<a href=3D"https://pod.movim.eu/app/views/admin.tpl">https://pod.movim.eu/a=
pp/views/admin.tpl</a>) it's not a big deal, but still not good idea (runni=
ng version <a href=3D"https://pod.movim.eu/VERSION">https://pod.movim.eu/VE=
RSION</a>). Then in some places HTML tags and entities are used directly ra=
ther than proper Unicode which isn't a good idea and it means that string i=
sn't later escaped and if it gets mixed together with user-input or transla=
tion strings there's a place for XSS. The worse thing probably is that sani=
tization is based on regexp blacklists/filters, I'm talking about <span><sp=
an class=3D"">StringHelper.php, I didn't look how it's actually used, but s=
till even w</span></span>ithout trying I'm pretty sure it would be possible=
 to find XSS there, why? because Rails framework over 5 years have had ~20 =
XSS vulnerabilities and it's extremely good framework used by dozens of pro=
jects and reviewed regularly, and it's even based on whitelists, but still =
uses regexps for that which isn't good and I wonder why no one does proper =
SGML parsing which they should. Just take a look at <a href=3D"https://gith=
ub.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionview/lib/action_view/vendor/html-scann=
er/html/sanitizer.rb#L72">sanitizer.rb</a> to see how non-trivial it is. An=
yway the whole idea of sanitization is wrong, you should just escape all te=
xt and don't try to guess which tags you should render. I suggest any web d=
eveloper to read <a href=3D"https://www.owasp.org">OWASP</a> from A to Z it=
's a must for any web developer. Then there's `?&gt;` PHP end tags used at =
end of various files which are useless and can introduce problems like famo=
us "headers already sent" warning. So seems that's about it with my quick l=
ook, but I might have forgotten to mention some things. Another thing I don=
't like is that AGPL is used, I really dislike all GPL family, but that's j=
ust me and I rather prefer <a href=3D"http://copyfree.org">copyfree</a> so =
if there's similar projects then I'll rather contribute to MIT than any GPL=
 variant :P And I'm not a fan of Bazaar nor LaunchPad but that's not the wo=
rst thing (someone should ban CVS and SVN :D)<br>
