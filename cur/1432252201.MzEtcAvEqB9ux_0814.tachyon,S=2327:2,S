Observe the subtle balance of the moment

 

Be aware of danger in short term bias, hyberbolic discounting and 
cognitive priming.

Understand that each and every thing we know  is framed by others 
expectations and fears

 

 

We are, each of us,in our diversity and self doubts

only stuff that matters. Our view from the nexus

of personal tangles and the social alienation in which we become ourselves

cannot be generalized away.There is no average, no scalar at all

We are all, each single one of us, much more than words

and more many, than one

 

Be kind to yourself, but never forget you're kind

 

Other people are the only reason for anything

So give not into the temptation of abstract authority

For the rule following consequence

 is misery and death

Cooperation is always needful work

For as surly as civilization trumps ideology,

the top down view is mortally flawed

Not only is the illusion deceiving

it degrades us all

 

Always know when to resort to chaos

To keep the rules dynamic

 

Our competency is orthodox

But our freedom is escape

>From the tyranny of rules

 

Methodology enables Analysis

Abstractions enable Truth

But the beauty of life

Is the immediate exception
