  This is totally misleading.  It would of course violate the First
  Amendment to have a law that stops you or me communicating over the
  internet, even if it's to date foreigners.

  What the law actually does is regulate MAIL ORDER BRIDE SERVICES and
  IMMIGRATION PETITIONS FOR FOREIGN FIANCESS AND SPOUSES.  Not amorous
  internet users.

  Repeat: this isn't about internet messages by regular people.

  It's about (1) sales pitches to foreigners by mail order bride
  companies and about whether they can disclose US client info to
  foreign clients without the foreign client's "informed consent" --
  which is defined to include doing a check for sex offendere
  convictions of the US client and reporting any found to the foreign
  client.

  AND it's about

  (2) what you have to do to get papers for your foreign spouse/fiance
  ("IMBRA requires a U.S. petitioner applying to sponsor a foreign
  fiancie or spouse to report certain arrests and/or criminal
  convictions for violent crimes, including domestic violence, sexual
  assault, and child abuse.")

  So this isn't "a sad day" for the Internet, and you remain free to
  say "hello" to anyone you like.  But it does mean that it's going to
  be harder for sex offenders to trick unspecting women into becoming
  their slaves (because if they come here on a fiance visa, and then
  divorce in the first 2 years, they get deported -- think of the power
  that gives the abusing husband....),
