(now i realize i likely misread, strange-read/reply-functioned your post,
not quite or completely grokking the distinction between crypt.crypto
and implementation, separation or distancing of these though still the
relation to nature itself as example appears retained, as if providing
proof-of-concept and demonstration models for how to go about it,w
watching various creatures, ecosystems, crystals, particle dynamics)
