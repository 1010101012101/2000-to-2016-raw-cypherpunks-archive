Only if they offer comparable services.  Which they won't
be able to, see below.

The govt has a monopoly on certain tools of the trade.  Now
while a private army (Wal-Marmy?) can get some of these toys on
the black (free) market, they either can't get the best stuff,
XOR the USG has a problem since that means anyone can
get it.  Everything from surveillance to weapons.

And crypto-wise, reputation will clearly be important here.

But yes, obviously, easy communication leads to more optimal
markets, for both goods and services.
