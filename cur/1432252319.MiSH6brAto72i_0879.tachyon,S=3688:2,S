"My what big ears you have."
Last weekend in Monterey, Calif.
Zimmerman, who is known as one of the true pioneers of sports photography 
and recognized by everyone as one of the greatest sports photographers of 
all time grew up in Los Angeles. He got his start in the business after 
leaving the Navy in the late 1940's. Zimmerman then took odd jobs working 
for International News and the LIFE Los Angeles bureau. When a job opened 
up as a LIFE darkroom technician in Washington D.C. Zimmerman headed 
east.Before finally heading South.
I hear Declan is available to serve if called upon,in the interests of 
national security.
