[forking the DNA discussion slightly] 

On giving blood samples to police: I believe the supremes are going to
hear a case about a hospital taking blood samples after delivery
of a baby, running drug checks, and turning her over to the police
immediately for child abuse.  

In a case within the last year,  some local woman had her baby taken
immediately after birth because they drug tested her and found a sedative
that her doctor had given her, but wasn't recorded so they figured
it was recreational.  She should be suing their asses off
but only wanted an apology in the broadcast I intercepted.
Maybe her kid will sue in 18 years, one hopes.

.....

[back to DNA] 

Recently read about a website where you can offer to donate your 
blood for a disease-oriented DNA bank.  [No, I am not mixing this with the
donate-cat-hair-for-feline-DNA-bank story of a month ago.]
They are interested in a list of diseases you or your immediate
family have had.

Some scandanavian countries have complete health records on all
their citizens and some are working on national DNA banks.  Some of
these will be made available for research after some form
of anonymization.
