of ANY fax machine, then following the voice prompts they <BR>
hear, enters a 3 digit Document number they want <BR>
(YOUR Document number) and, within seconds of them <BR>
pressing &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Start&quot; on the fax machine, out comes <BR>
between 1-11 pages of whatever information you want them <BR>
to have! <BR>
