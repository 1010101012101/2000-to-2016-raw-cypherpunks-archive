I'm forwarding this just because it's the first time I've seen a commercial
spam-blocker program that implements sender-pays, so it seemed topical.
I don't know if any of their customers have actually implemented that feature
(it's got other alternatives like a Bayesian filter and Turing auto-responder)
or if anybody has actually bothered to send them mail if they use it.

(Their email for it looks like semi-spammy drivel, but they've got permission,
because I was once interested in getting updates about one of their
other packages and haven't bothered unsubscribing.)

This is probably the 10th e-mail message you've received telling you how
you can get rid of junk e-mail messages. But, I found a sweet software
package that you might find a little more useful than all of the other
anti-spam programs you've heard about. The program is called Spam
Sleuth, and it just so happens that Blue Squirrel released an updated
version, 2.0.10, last week.

How does Spam Sleuth defeat spam? The program uses a Point System.

Spam Sleuth has analyzers, and each analyzer: Friends, Spammers,To,
Goodwords, Badwords, Profanity, Subject, Attachments, Charsets, HTML
Volume, etc. looks at an e- mail a different way and assigns points. The
more points an e-mail message receives the more likely it is to be
deemed as spam. The less points an e-mail message receives the more
likely it is a real gem. Think of it as though it was a contest, and
each Analyzer is a different judge, and the messages are the
contestants, and Spam Sleuth is the scorekeeper. Every judge looks at
the e-mail message and assigns points based on specific criteria. Then
all of the points are added together to create an overall total. More
points is bad, and less points is good.

The point system is clever, and works wonderfully, but the heart of Spam
Sleuth has some killer features:

Turing Test: If Spam Sleuth accidentally catches a message as spam, it
lets the sender type some special letters to show that the message
wasn't sent by a mindless machine, and the message is allowed through to
your InBox. (Great way to know if you're dealing with a real human on
the other end.)  This is my favorite because I can be much more
aggressive with my settings without worrying I'll miss an important
e-mail.

E-Mail Stamps: Allows you to charge senders a fee to let an e-mail
message through to your inbox. Spam Sleuth sends an email back to the
sender and requires them to make a payment via PayPal before the program
will allow the message through to your inbox. You configure and decide
how much your time is worth, whether it's 5 cents, or a buck. (That's
right, you make the spammers pay you to send junk e-mail messages.)

Bayesian Analysis: Looks at your previous e-mail and learns the
characteristics of spam and good e-mail. Just like a baby, it needs to
be taught right from wrong. By marking your messages as Good or Spam,
and then Training the Bayesian Analyzer, you can teach it right from
wrong. Then it can contribute to the decision of whether a new e-mail is
spam or not. (Now that's what I call cloning.)
