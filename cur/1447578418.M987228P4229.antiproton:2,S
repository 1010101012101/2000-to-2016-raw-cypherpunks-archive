I think we need to decide what we're trying to fix first.
People were talking about GPG being difficult to use and so adoption is
poor.
What I suggested fixes the GPG is difficult issue - which ppl were
accusing me of straw-manning and instead I should do something positive.
So I did, I gave you the answer to GPG is hard.

If you want to fix the lack of privacy with email as a whole then as I
said a few emails back, a new protocol is required.
Decentralisation is good. Some sort of mix network is good.
I've heard people mention Pond as an alternative to email which I have
no experience of but might be worth more investigation.
