the proposal in the past has been that ISPs filter spam at ingress from 
their customers. the counter-argument has been that there are lots of ISPs 
that can't be trusted to do it.

So it is much easier for ISPs to have lists of other trusted &/or untrusted 
ISPs that they will accept email from.

It is orders of magnitude easier (and more efficient) for ISPs to do 
ingress filtering for SPAM and effectively ISP blacklists than it is to 
populate the whole consumer infrastructure.

There are still some ways to slip thru the cracks with small amounts .... 
but it isn't the 40-80% volume of all email that is seen today.

It does have an analogous downside to the individual privacy issues ... 
which are that the big ISPs could use blacklisting for other purposes than 
addressing SPAM issues.

Some of the ingress filtering pushback may be similar to the early 
counter-arguments for packet ingress filtering related to ip-address 
spoofing. however, that seemed to be more a case of disparity among the 
router vendors in which could & could not implement ingress filtering. as 
majority of the router vendors achieved such capability ... the push-back 
significantly reduced.

Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ 
IP Source Address Spoofing, Ferguson P., Senie D., 1998/01/23 (10pp) 
(.txt=21032) (Obsoleted by 2827)

there already are logs relating ingress email to originating ISP customer 
id. that could be made available via some sort of legal action. the only 
issue then is the strength of authentication that is performed on customer 
connection to the ISP ... rather than some sort of origin authentication 
for every email.
