Yes yes, here we go.  A cutesy technical argument about why this that or
another doesn't fit the strict definition of this that or the other offense.
I'm sure the prosecutor, the judge and the jury will be eager to listen.

Therefore murder, if not witnessed, never happened.  If a body falls in the
forest...?

Please.

The fact that party X commits a crime without being witnessed does not
eliminate the crime.  It merely makes prosecution a bit harder.

Good luck finding a currency that is not "state-money."  The state does a
wonderful thing.  It provides legitimacy to investment vehicles.  It does so
through imposing (or eliminating) liability for transactions failures of
various sorts.  If you don't recognize the importance of that (or propose a
private solution that does a similar thing) then you aren't worth listening
to.  Remember that multiple-issuer currencies have been tried before in just
about any economy you choose to name.  There is a reason none exist anymore.
(Bad money displaces good, or any other of 15 college or early graduate
level economics courses will enlighten you if you choose to pursue them with
anything like interest).

Not new?  Name 5 prominent reputation brokers.  Reputation services?
Reputation clearing agents?  What manner of reputation do they measure?
Trustworthiness?  Identity?  Creditworthiness?  One?  None?  All?  (I can
only think of two, neither of which approach the level of sophistication you
propose here).

You want work too hard to stay out of the state's sight.

Tell me a bit more about how wonderful the world would be without economies
of scale.

Uh... sure.

(Incidentally, it's "Illusory Delusions."  "Ilusional" isn't a word.  It's
also "Imbalance" not "Disbalance").  I'm prone to typo occasionally too, but
try not to make words up unless your in uncharted waters, eh?
