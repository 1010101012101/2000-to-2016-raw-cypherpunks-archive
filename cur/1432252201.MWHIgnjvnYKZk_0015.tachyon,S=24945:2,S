     Ass Bomber



Nobody tell the TSA, but last month someone tried to assassinate a Saudi 
prince by exploding a bomb stuffed in his rectum.  He pretended to be a 
repentant militant, when in fact he was a Trojan horse:  "The resulting 
explosion ripped al-Asiri to shreds but only lightly injured the shocked 
prince -- the target of al-Asiri's unsuccessful assassination attempt."

For years, I have made the joke about Richard Reid: "Just be glad that 
he wasn't the underwear bomber."  Now, sadly, we have an example of one.

Lewis Page, an "improvised-device disposal operator tasked in support of 
the UK mainland police from 2001-2004," pointed out that this isn't much 
of a threat for three reasons: 1) you can't stuff a lot of explosives 
into a body cavity, 2) detonation is, um, problematic, and 3) the human 
body can stifle an explosion pretty effectively (think of someone 
throwing himself on a grenade to save his friends).

But who ever accused the TSA of being rational?

This is a good thing: "An Illinois district court has allowed a couple 
to sue their bank on the novel grounds that it may have failed to 
sufficiently secure their account, after an unidentified hacker obtained 
a $26,500 loan on the account using the customers' user name and 
password."  As I've previously written, this is the only way to mitigate 
this kind of fraud.  It's an important security principle: ensure that 
the person who has the ability to mitigate the risk is responsible for 
the risk.  In this case, the account holders had nothing to do with the 
security of their account.  They could not audit it.  They could not 
improve it.  The bank, on the other hand, has the ability to improve 
security and mitigate the risk, but because they pass the cost on to 
their customers, they have no incentive to do so.  Litigation like this 
has the potential to fix the externality and improve security.

     Unauthentication



In computer security, a lot of effort is spent on the authentication 
problem.  Whether it's passwords, secure tokens, secret questions, image 
mnemonics, or something else, engineers are continually coming up with 
more complicated -- and hopefully more secure -- ways for you to prove 
you are who you say you are over the Internet.

This is important stuff, as anyone with an online bank account or remote 
corporate network knows. But a lot less thought and work have gone into 
the other end of the problem: how do you tell the system on the other 
end of the line that you're no longer there? How do you unauthenticate 
yourself?

My home computer requires me to log out or turn my computer off when I 
want to unauthenticate. This works for me because I know enough to do 
it, but lots of people just leave their computers on and running when 
they walk away. As a result, many office computers are left logged in 
when people go to lunch, or when they go home for the night. This, 
obviously, is a security vulnerability.

The most common way to combat this is by having the system time out. I 
could have my computer log me out automatically after a certain period 
of inactivity -- five minutes, for example. Getting it right requires 
some fine tuning, though. Log the person out too quickly, and he gets 
annoyed; wait too long before logging him out, and the system could be 
vulnerable during that time. My corporate e-mail server logs me out 
after 10 minutes or so, and I regularly get annoyed at my corporate 
e-mail system.

Some systems have experimented with a token: a USB authentication token 
that has to be plugged in for the computer to operate, or an RFID token 
that logs people out automatically when the token moves more than a 
certain distance from the computer.  Of course, people will be prone to 
just leave the token plugged in to their computer all the time; but if 
you attach it to their car keys or the badge they have to wear at all 
times when walking around the office, the risk is minimized.

That's expensive, though. A research project used a Bluetooth device, 
like a cell phone, and measured its proximity to a computer. The system 
could be programmed to lock the computer if the Bluetooth device moved 
out of range.

Some systems log people out after every transaction.  This wouldn't work 
for computers, but it can work for ATMs.  The machine spits my card out 
before it gives me my cash, or just requires a card swipe, and makes 
sure I take it out of the machine.  If I want to perform another 
transaction, I have to reinsert my card and enter my PIN a second time.

There's a physical analogue that everyone can explain: door locks.  Does 
your door lock behind you when you close the door, or does it remain 
unlocked until you lock it?  The first instance is a system that 
automatically logs you out, and the second requires you to log out 
manually.  Both types of locks are sold and used, and which one you 
choose depends on both how you use the door and who you expect to try to 
break in.

Designing systems for usability is hard, especially when security is 
involved.  Almost by definition, making something secure makes it less 
usable. Choosing an unauthentication method depends a lot on how the 
system is used as well as the threat model.  You have to balance 
increasing security with pissing the users off, and getting that balance 
right takes time and testing, and is much more an art than a science.

     The Futility of Defending the Targets



This is just silly:

    Beaver Stadium is a terrorist target. It is most likely the No. 1
    target in the region. As such, it deserves security measures
    commensurate with such a designation, but is the stadium getting
    such security?

    [..]

    When the stadium is not in use it does not mean it is not a
    target. It must be watched constantly. An easy solution is to
    assign police officers there 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
    This is how a plot to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge was thwarted --
    police presence. Although there are significant costs to this, the
    costs pale in comparison if the stadium is destroyed or damaged.

    The idea is to create omnipresence, which is a belief in
    everyone's minds (terrorists and pranksters included) that the
    stadium is constantly being watched so that any attempt would be
    futile.

Actually, the Brooklyn Bridge plot failed because the plotters were 
idiots and the plot -- cutting through cables with blowtorches -- was 
dumb.  That, and the all-too-common police informant who egged the 
plotters on.

But never mind that.  Beaver Stadium is Pennsylvania State University's 
football stadium, and this article argues that it's a potential 
terrorist target that needs 24/7 police protection.

The problem with that kind of reasoning is that it makes no sense.  As I 
said in an article that will appear in "New Internationalist":

    To be sure, reasonable arguments can be made that some terrorist
    targets are more attractive than others: aeroplanes because a
    small bomb can result in the death of everyone aboard, monuments
    because of their national significance, national events because of
    television coverage, and transportation because of the numbers of
    people who commute daily. But there are literally millions of
    potential targets in any large country (there are five million
    commercial buildings alone in the US), and hundreds of potential
    terrorist tactics; it's impossible to defend every place against
    everything, and it's impossible to predict which tactic and target
    terrorists will try next.

Defending individual targets only makes sense if the number of potential 
targets is few.  If there are seven terrorist targets and you defend 
five of them, you seriously reduce the terrorists' ability to do damage. 
 But if there are a million terrorist targets and you defend five of 
them, the terrorists won't even notice.  I tend to dislike security 
measures that merely cause the bad guys to make a minor change in their 
plans.

And the expense would be enormous.  Add up these secondary terrorist 
targets -- stadiums, theaters, churches, schools, malls, office 
buildings, anyplace where a lot of people are packed together -- and the 
number is probably around 200,000, including Beaver Stadium.  Full-time 
police protection requires people, so that's 1,000,000 policemen.  At an 
encumbered cost of $100,000 per policeman per year, probably a low 
estimate, that's a total annual cost of $100B.  (That's about what we're 
spending each year in Iraq.)  On the other hand, hiring one out of every 
300 Americans to guard our nation's infrastructure would solve our 
unemployment problem.  And since policemen get health care, our health 
care problem as well.  Just make sure you don't accidentally hire a 
terrorist to guard against terrorists -- that would be embarrassing.

The whole idea is nonsense.  As I've been saying for years, what works 
is investigation, intelligence, and emergency response:

    We need to defend against the broad threat of terrorism, not
    against specific movie plots. Security is most effective when it
    doesn't make arbitrary assumptions about the next terrorist act.
    We need to spend more money on intelligence and investigation:
    identifying the terrorists themselves, cutting off their funding,
    and stopping them regardless of what their plans are. We need to
    spend more money on emergency response: lessening the impact of a
    terrorist attack, regardless of what it is. And we need to face
    the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy and how it
    helps or hinders terrorism.

     Texas Instruments Signing Keys Broken



Texas Instruments' calculators use RSA digital signatures to 
authenticate any updates to their operating system.  Unfortunately, 
their signing keys are too short: 512 bits.  Earlier this month, a 
collaborative effort factored the moduli and published the private keys. 
 Texas Instruments responded by threatening websites that published the 
keys with the DMCA, but it's too late.

So far, we have the operating-system signing keys for the TI-92+, TI-73, 
TI-89, TI-83+/TI-83+ Silver Edition, Voyage 200, TI-89 Titanium, and the 
TI-84+/TI-84 Silver Edition, and the date-stamp signing key for the 
TI-73, Explorer, TI-83 Plus, TI-83 Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus, TI-84 
Silver Edition, TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92 Plus, and the Voyage 200.

Moral: Don't assume that if your application is obscure, or if there's 
no obvious financial incentive for doing so, that your cryptography 
won't be broken if you use too-short keys.

things written by people from different backgrounds, and with different 
degrees of clue, in different decades."
