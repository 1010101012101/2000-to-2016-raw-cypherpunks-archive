That is interesting. One wonders if in certain circles of Russia people are 
much more careful with their data and encrypting it. Who knows? A country 
like that might evolve some fairly rigorous privacy procedures. Here in the 
US it's, "Our data is safe because people will go to jail if they hack it 
and sell it."
