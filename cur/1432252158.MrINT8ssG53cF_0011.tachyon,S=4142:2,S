This Bush bit may sound positive but I expect increasingly draconian
legitimate access legislation from both parties. Neither of them can be
trusted and they will settle for nothing less than an absolute right to
gather information and force key disclosure when they can't read it. If
they can't have what they want today they will work towards tomorrow.
Nonstop, like ants or termites.
