[For all the good it will do, one of the few Senators to stingingly rebuff 
the Administration's Iraq position and demand for tribute to support their 
further misadventures.  However, there are equally large lies and tribute 
being supported by Byrd and others upon which they are silent.  Besides its 
easy to be clamorous when you're vote isn't the key vote denying someone as 
powerful as the President.  Just more political rhetoric.]
