What good is this TCPA stuff anyway?

I haven't read anything, pro or con or
ambivilent that shows me some clear
advandage. It isn't going to fix anything
near as I can tell, and with all other
technology which has a primary purpose
of restricting access, it will undoubtably
cause some trouble. 

So, what's the point? 

Seems like a grand waste of effort to
me.
