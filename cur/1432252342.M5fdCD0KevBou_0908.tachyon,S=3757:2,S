Its a nice theory, but doesn't cover first-visit scenarios, nor the
yearly rekey grind of giving CAs (large amounts of) money for the
results of a fairly easy math problem.

What I would prefer is some parallel system where person 'x', who I
trust, may or may not have visited site 'y', and may or may not have
signed the then certificate, the signature for which (with its date of
providence) is then stored *on the site* for me to access though a
well-known url. That way, I can look with suspicion at sites which do
not have such a certificate, investigate myself if they are serving the
certificate I am expecting to see (and how do I do that? I have tried in
the past phoning companies to obtain their website public key for
independent verification; most don't know what one is, a few have even
said they can't disclose that as it is *priviledged information*....)

But, who do I trust for that, who do *you* trust for that, and will
those people be wiling to give up a significant slice of time every year
revisiting websites after their certificates are renewed, and facing the
same hurdles I did (the complete ignorance of most companies as to how
their websites' certificate works and unwillingness to supply an
accurate fingerprint over the phone).
