In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.

But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.

Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)

Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
Democracy.

I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.

Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
/even/ in a hierarchal system, if it is small enough to permit the
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.

Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.

One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."

To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.

I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."

A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.

Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.

War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.

My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)

As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
syndicates.

When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.

This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:

http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/james-burke-connections/

I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.

Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."

Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
out?"

In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:

https://tinyurl.com/geophysics-ftw

The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.

Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."

Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy
misfits got me started tracking geophysical issues way back then.

Today, alas:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcREKdqfOVQ
