That's just as inaccurate as condeming everyone who ever worked for 
Microsoft as clueless because of their corporate propensity for security 
lapses. You wouldn't go that far, would you? Didn't think so... LOL

I know of an old-school NSA red teamer who's been teaching programming and 
engineering since before either one of us was born. An honest-to-god 
mathematical genius. Some of those old wizards could teach us all a thing 
or two. But whether the donut-chomping incompetents have the upper hand is 
anyone's guess. I wouldn't bet on it in the long run.

Maybe, but I have more of an issue with the "cook the books to support my 
policy" angle than anything else. There's a great article by James 
Worthen, "The Gates Hearings: Politicization and Soviet Analysis at CIA" 
from Studies in Intelligence (Vol. 38, No.1, Spring 1994). I wish I had a 
pdf (or whatever the "correct" format is in light of the Adobe boycott), 
lots of relevant quotes to pull.
