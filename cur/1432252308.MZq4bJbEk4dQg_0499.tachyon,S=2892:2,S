Britain To Put CCTV Cameras Inside Private Homes

    * By Charlie Sorrel * August 3, 2009  | * 8:36 am  | 

As an ex-Brit, Ibm well aware of the authoritiesb love of surveillance and
snooping, but even I, a pessimistic cynic, am amazed by the governments
latest plan: to install Orwellbs telescreens in 20,000 homes.

B#400 million ($668 million) will be spend on installing and monitoring CCTV
cameras in the homes of private citizens. Why? To make sure the kids are
doing their homework, going to bed early and eating their vegetables. The
scheme has, astonishingly, already been running in 2,000 family homes. The
governmentbs bchildrenbs secretaryb Ed Balls is behind the plan, which is
aimed at problem, antisocial families. The idea is that, if a child has a
more stable home life, he or she will be less likely to stray into crime and
drugs.

It gets worse. The government is also maintaining a private army, incredibly
not called bThought Policeb, which will bbe sent round to carry out home
checks,b according to the Sunday Express. And in a scheme which firmly
cements the nationbs reputation as a bnanny stateb, the kids and their
families will be forced to sign bbehavior contractsb which will bset out
parentsb duties to ensure children behave and do their homework.b

And remember, this is the left-wing government. The Shadow Home Secretary
Chris Grayling, batting for the conservatives, thinks these plans are btoo
little, and too late,b implying that even more obtrusive work needs to be
done. Rumors that a new detention center, named Room 101, is being
constructed inside the Ministry of Love are unconfirmed.
