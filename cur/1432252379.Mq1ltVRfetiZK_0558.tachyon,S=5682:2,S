Oh, then you'd be reformed cypherpunk.  The orthodoxy is that the
group has no head (an arch).  I think of it as a grad student lounge
with open doors, and a few conversations going on at once.   Anyone
can pop in (wearing a mask or not) and make a fool of himself,
or enlighten others, or ask questions (as long as they're not homework),

or even forward nominally relevent articles, or flame others for doing
so.

Of course, others

Or it will seem a petty schism like the Sierras or Athiests or Amerikan
Xians etc..

The only coherence is an interest in crypto and society.  This
reasonably
extends to privacy, opsec, surveillance and reverse-surveillance,
OS bugs, hardware, censorship, finance, etc.
Read the fatwa --er, the cyphernomicon :-)   Read the Bill of Rights,
(now a quaint obsolete historical document) and think about technology.

The useful statement is May's Cyphernomicon (ie an outline) and the bulk

of the discussions of the last 12 years (better get a few reams of paper
for
the printout, Mr. Fed).   PKZ's rant is also good introductory material
IMHO.

Even with my addenda your statement is too restrictive.  E.g., some
here, I have
gathered, worry about corporations (but not LLCs) too.

......and now, some quotes for Tom Ridge to ponder.....

Forget turbans, real terrorists wear neckties.

"Stop shedding our blood to save your own and the solution to this
simple
 but complex equation is in your hands. You know matters will escalate
the more you
delay and then do not blame us but blame yourselves. Rational people do
not risk their
security, money and sons to appease the White House liar."

"Naturally the common people don't want war...But, after all, it is the
leaders of a country who determine policy, and it is always a simple
matter
to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist
dictatorship, or parliament or a communist dictatorship. All you have to
do
is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for
lack of
patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in
every
country."
--Hermann Goering, (1893-1946) Nazi Reichsmarschall, at the Nuremberg
Trials, 4/18/46. From _Nuremberg Diary_ by Gustave Gilbert.

The risks posed by ignorant politicians may
yet be far more dangerous that the odd virus and software mistake.....
Prof. Dr. Debora Weber-Wulff

Additional case studies are needed, however, to determine which traits
of chemical and biological terrorists might help identify them
because charisma, paranoia, and grandiosity are alo found to varying
degreees among, for example, leaders of political parties, large
corporations, and academic depts. --John T Finn, _Science_ v 289 1
