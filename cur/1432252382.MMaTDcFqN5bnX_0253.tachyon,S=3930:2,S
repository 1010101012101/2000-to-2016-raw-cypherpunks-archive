I was right the first time around, you're off in the tall grass, can't
see where you're headed and seriously mistaken. I'm not a .coN web page
author. I am getting very.seriously.pissed though. You've run square
into the libel laws. I think my father-in-law still has Fed LE contacts
in the US. I'll find you.

Not my PC, besides, what does it matter which insecure OS runs Netscape?
Are you an elite genius because you put Linux or BSD on a PC? Golly,

how to do that!
