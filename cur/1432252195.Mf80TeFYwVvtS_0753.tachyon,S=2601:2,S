     So what's the deal with smallpox anyway? When I was a
kid we all got innoculated against it, and it was supposed
to be a lifetime thing. In fact, my wife, whose a RN, had to
get it again some years ago for work, but it didn't take,
proving that the antibodies were still active.
     Did they stop vaccinating everyone for smallpox at some
point?
