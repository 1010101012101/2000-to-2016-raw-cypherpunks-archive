There are probably two major hurdles: reverse engineering the firmware and 
getting the new code into the device.

The second is probably the hardest.  Because of high volume production 
techniques the processor-memory chips are probably not field 
programmable.  Even if they were or field programmable equivalents were 
available they are likely mounted using BGA (Ball Grid Array) 
techniques.  Very difficult to remove and re-insert without expensive 
equipment.
