Heh. Yeah, parents don't even need to try to find a 5$ wrench.

There are smartphone-spying stuff, also, though. (*cough-mSpy-cough*
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/mobile-spy-software-maker-mspy-hacked-customer-data-leaked/
)
Are there any strategies to detecting that?

Also, money/resources is a major issue in this threat model -- I don't see
it likely that a child/teenager will feel like 35$/year for a little more
security is worth it. I'm not even sure if I wanna assume they'll be able
to put down 50$ for a Raspberry Pi and USB mouse and Keyboard.

Using some sort of VM sounds like the best solution, because it allows for
just minimizing when parents come to look. Unless, again, there is
screenshotting going on -- in which case, how would you detect that, maybe
running Tails as a VM and doing something that would definitely draw the
parents but not compromise much in terms of online friendgroup,
gender/sexual orientation they might be hiding, etc. Maybe looking at porn?
That would have to take into account the consequences of that vs. the value
of knowing that parents aren't looking.

But "VMs require specific drivers", I didn't know that. Shoot.

I wonder how well you could avoid problems by just using something like a
Tails LiveUSB at night...
