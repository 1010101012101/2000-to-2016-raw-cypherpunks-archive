128Kby/sec is 10 messages/sec.  That's a lot for a 'commodity'
home connection.  10 messages/sec because many remailers are 
text-only, no attachments.  Few messages exceed 10Kby.

The real issue IMHO is that, despite the boxes and pipes, the
tech is not sufficiently deployed yet.  We are hyping phone
scramblers when telegraphs are more common.
