POLICE ABUSE ALLEGED IN THE ARREST OF A ROLLERBLADING POLITICAL ACTIVIST
Bandana protection from Code Red smog in D.C. becomes an excuse for a 
brutal arrest and violation of rights
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- D.C. Statehood Green Party member and community 
activist Chris Otten will represent himself in court on Thursday, September 
5, when he faces charges after an incident in which D.C. police reportedly 
violated his privacy and used needless force.
On July 25, Otten was rollerblading on U Street NW, wearing a bandana over 
his nose and mouth due to Code Red smog. A sergeant of the Metropolitan 
Police Department (MPD) approached Otten near the U Street Metro Station, 
wielding his baton and demanding identification. Otten refused, citing 
privacy rights, upon which police backup was summoned and Otten was tackled 
to the ground by several MPD officers. He was arrested on the charges of 
"failure to show identification" and "disorderly conduct," denied medical 
attention for eight hours, and spent 20 hours in jail.
Otten called his arrest and brutal treatment typical of a larger assault on 
American civil liberties. "Everyday citizens need to concern themselves 
when the police show up to harass their fellow neighbors. I encourage all 
people to read up on our rights and watch the police carefully when the 
situation calls so to witness and testify against any police brutality that 
may, and in D.C., most likely will occur."
"What happened to me is nothing new in DC," Otten added. "I met lots of 
people during my experience in the D.C. criminal justice system who are 
subjected to police abuse regularly -- to the point where this system has 
become a culture, a way of life for many D.C. residents."
"As a candidate Ward One member of City Council, I am outraged that 
[incumbent candidate] Jim Graham and his campaign staff would stand by idly 
while a young man who was trying to protect himself from the smog found 
himself attacked and abused by police," said Edward Chico Troy, noting that 
the incident took place in Ward One. "The police should be held accountable 
to standards of professional law enforcemet behavior. We should never allow 
or condone the abuse of law-abidng citizens."
Chris Otten will appear in D.C. Superior Court, 500 Indiana Avenue NW, 
courtroom 120 on September 5 at 9 a.m., after an 8 a.m. rally in his 
defense in front of the courthouse. For periodic updates during the day, 
call Mintwood Media at (202) 986-6186.
"We must take a stand against police abuse of power and the criminal 
injustice system," said Otten. "This is especially true when U.S. 
government cronies like John Ashcroft have pounced on people's true fears 
stemming from 9-11 and he has used them to attack Americans' civil 
liberties through the USA PATRIOT Act and the Homeland Defense Department, 
both of which are reminiscent of McCarthy era policies from the 1950s."
