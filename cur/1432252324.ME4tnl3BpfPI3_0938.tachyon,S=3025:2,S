Excerpt:

  U.S. Wants to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet
  By CHARLIE SAVAGE
  Published: September 27, 2010

  WASHINGTON b Federal law enforcement and national security officials
  are preparing to seek sweeping new regulations for the Internet,
  arguing that their ability to wiretap criminal and terrorism
  suspects is bgoing darkb as people increasingly communicate online
  instead of by telephone.

  Essentially, officials want Congress to require all services that
  enable communications b including encrypted e-mail transmitters like
  BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook and software
  that allows direct bpeer to peerb messaging like Skype b to be
  technically capable of complying if served with a wiretap order. The
  mandate would include being able to intercept and unscramble
  encrypted messages.
