ZKS and Anonymizer have the wrong business model in terms
of what consumers want. They're too techie. What people
(as opposed to cypherpunks ;-) want is privacy AND the
ability to make purchases without spreading their CC#
all over.

This is the hottest area of privacy services, and
competition is starting to heat up, with more and
more firms deciding to provide such services.

Card issuers would seem to have an advantage here.

An early "release" (can you say 'vaporware') is
being promoted in TV commercials by American Express.

The commercial shows the narrator/consumer talking
about wanting Internet privacy, while his face is
obscured the entire commercial. The ending has him
claiming complete Internet privacy, including for
purchases, and shows a symbolic AmEx card with the name X'd out.
("I'm finally getting the recognition I deserve.")

AmEx signed an agreement on 9/7/2000 with Privada to
provide the proxying Internet access, and AmEx says
it will roll out Privacy Payments within the next month.

First Product in Series Provides Innovative Way to Pay Online: Unique, 
Random Number Safeguards Customers and Helps Reduce Fraud


NEW YORK, September 7, 2000 -- Addressing consumer concerns about online 
privacy and security, American Express Company today announced a new 
series of products that provides customers with greater choice and 
protection when browsing and shopping online. The first product, known 
as Private PaymentsSM, is an industry breakthrough that offers a more 
secure way to pay online using a random, unique number for each online 
purchase. Private Payments enables customers to purchase online without 
transmitting their actual card account numbers over the Internet. 
Private Payments will be available free within the next month to 
American Express consumer and small business cardmembers in the United 
States.

The company has also signed an agreement with and made a minority 
investment in Privada Inc., a digital privacy infrastructure provider, 
to deliver a second product that will enable customers to choose how 
much of their information is shared when they browse any site on the 
Web. This private browsing product will allow customers to select from 
settings that range from sharing their full identity to anonymity. 
This service will be introduced later this year. Additional offerings 
in the new suite of American Express products will be announced next 
year.

"While the Internet has dramatically eased the way consumers research 
and purchase products, it also has increased concern for protecting 
privacy and security," said Alfred F. Kelly, Jr., group president of 
U.S. Consumer and Small Business Services at American Express.

How Private Payments Works

Using Private Payments to shop online is quick and easy. Interested 
cardmembers can register for the free service here. When cardmembers 
are ready to purchase online, they can access the service by going 
to the Private Payments home page at americanexpress.com or by clicking 
on the Private Payments icon on their desktop. This launches the 
service, which then prompts them for username and password, and to 
select the American Express. Card they want linked to the Private 
Payments number. A unique Private Payments number with expiration date 
is then randomly created by American Express. The cardmember transfers 
this information into the merchant order form to complete the purchase. 
The cardmember's actual card account number is not sent over the 
Internet, thus keeping this information secure. The item purchased 
is charged to the cardmember's selected American Express Card and 
appears on the monthly billing statement, as usual.

Further safeguarding the online purchase, the Private Payments number 
is designed to be used for a single purchase and to expire after the 
merchant authorization process is completed. Upon expiration, the 
Private Payments number cannot be used again if stolen.
