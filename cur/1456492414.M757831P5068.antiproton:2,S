Hmmm... so, a technocratic elite won't be affected, other than
perhaps to the extent of minor inconveniences, when the
exponential growth of industrialization, resource extraction and
human population exceeds geophysical limits?  And this, because
those limits are not real and the only people who will be
adversely affected are those who have incorrect beliefs?

That sounds almost like the narrative of commercialized Conspiracy
Theory, from a viewpoint that identifies with the "bad guys" in
that scenario.  The "good vs. evil" issue really is just a matter
of human beliefs, but the laws o' physics part is what most
interests me.  Topsoil, water, phosphates and fuel can't be wished
into existence, nor can industrial pollution, extreme weather and
a couple of billion hungry neighbors be wished out of existence.
