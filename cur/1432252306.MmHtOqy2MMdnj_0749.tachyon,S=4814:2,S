The inet-one.com archives show a Sircam offering which is just too
humorous to ignore, and which lne.com folks won't see:
a file called "animal farm novel report.doc.com"
(which is, of course, infected).  But the deadly hacker tool known
as emacs reveals the following summary (the copyright still belongs
to someone known to "Eleanor D. Mantanona"<bejon@ite.net>).

 Money and power is what this story is based on with animals who are
very diverse and the same. Animal Farm is based on animals who want to
become independent, so they start a rebellion which was put together by
Old Major who is a prize winning boar whose vision of a socialist utopia
serves as the inspiration for the rebellion. Three days after describing
the vision and teaching the animals the song Beast Of England, Major
dies leaving Snowball and Napoleon to fight for control. Later on
Napoleon the pig who emerges as the leader of Animal Farm after Old
Major dies. Napoleon uses military force (his nine loyal attack dogs),
to intimidate other animals and consolidate his power. Snowball the pig
who challenged Napoleon for control of Animal Farm which he had lost,
Snowball is an Intelligent, Passionate, and Eloquent pig. But Snowball
seemed to win the loyalty of the other animals and cement his powers,
but that all changed when Napoleon sent his attack dogs after Snowball
and drove him out of Animal Farm. There is only one animal on the farm
who would not whine about the work he has to do for Napoleon his name is
Boxer the great cart-horse whose incredible strength, dedication, and
loyalty play a key role in the early prosperity of Animal Farm and later
the completion of the windmill. Boxer shows much devotion to Animal
Farms ideals but little ability to think about them independently. He
counted on the pigs to make his decisions for him. His two mottoes are 
I will work harder  and  Napoleon is always right . One of the
commandments were All animals are equal  but that later changed in the
story because some animals were more privileged than others some animals
had to work twice as hard as others and Napoleon got to sit back and
demand animals to do work while he made profit off of them by taking
many eggs from hens and selling them or selling cows milk. If I recall
Old Major saying that they will not sell their goods to people. Napoleon
was becoming one of the farmers himself by taking the milk and drinking
it himself, but the other animals obeyed the pigs hoping for a better
future but as of now their future is not insight. Animal farm is a book
that can show what power, money, and dictatorship can do to a person or
animal
