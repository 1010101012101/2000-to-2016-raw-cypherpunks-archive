-----Original Message-----
That so many millions of children are programmed to mutter about how 
"bigotry is our most important problem" and "terrorism comes from our 
hearts" shows how far we've sunk into the miasma of political 
correctness.

I hope if nothing else good comes from recent events, at least we see 
the death of crap like this.


--Tim May


In addition to destroying Pop Culture (at least temporarily) the attack has put a lot of nonsense into perspective.

As I said to some one the other day,  "If this is war no smoking regulations.  SWmoke 'em if nyou've got 'em."
