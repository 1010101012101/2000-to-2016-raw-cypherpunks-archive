FBI expands hunt on warez scene

Posted by me101 on 07:51 EST on 18 Dec 2001 - 12:51 GMT | 25 comments

Found this over on GeekNews, pointing to a story over on New Order,
regarding some additional information in relation to the FBI's ongoing warez
raids.

The FBI has, in the past week, been involved in raids against WAREZ groups,
including 90+ scene group senior members and leaders in US, Canada, Britain,
Australia, Norway, 2 cracking groups in Poland. New raids are expected in
the next days or so..

Now We've got confirmed insider information, that four major efnet servers
are currently running in debug mode, which enables them to see ALL private
traffic, like private chat, passwords sent to channel protection bots,
messages, etc. and the information is being filtered and sent to the FBI,
which requested this. Currently, a big EDU server, and .ORG server.
