Evil state sponsored conspiracy.  The Cathedral. I thought everyone knew 
this.

Thunderbird/tools/options/advanced/config editor/geo.enabled.

Set to disabled.

Who on this list has not done so?

Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which 
generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. 
Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .

When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby 
wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against 
the data collected by google during street view surveys.

Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the 
authorities with the closest street address to where you are using 
Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that 
address.  Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being 
sent in the clear has no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of 
building that you are sitting in when sending the email.
