I've done my share of shoveling dirt on the CGN coffin, but in the interest
of fact-based
decision-making: nobody is going to create a separate log entry for every
session/flow.
You do bulk port assignment or deterministic NAT, so whenever you assign an
address,
you know what ports you'll be mapping that address to.  One entry per
Lease_Time.

Doesn't matter, because the servers aren't logging port number, so nobody
will ever need
to see those logs.

* Unless Geoff Huston's wackiness finds support, and somebody will pay you
to keep
that kind of log.  Although if somebody would pay, I'd expect them to be
paying for
DPI deployment already.
