Fire Breaks Out at St. John the Divine, Largest Church in United States
               By Alan ClendenningAssociated Press Writer
                         Published: Dec 18, 2001
NEW YORK (AP) - Fire broke out Tuesday morning at the historic Cathedral
of St. John the Divine, with flames shooting from the Episcopal church
that has been under construction for more than a century.

Part of the roof of an adjoining three-story gift shop caved in but no
injuries were reported.

The Christmastime fire, which was brought under control within 2 1/2
hours, was largely contained in the main cathedral area, according to
fire officials, who said they expected widespread smoke and water
damage. The cause of the blaze was under investigation.

Up to 200 firefighters were called to the scene at about 7 a.m., an hour
before the first Mass of the day at the world's largest gothic
cathedral. Smoke poured from the gift shop, and scores of onlookers
stood by.

"There were clouds of black smoke 40 feet high. The winds were blowing
it all over the place," said Juan Cruz, a mechanic who saw the fire on
his way to work at nearby Columbia University.

Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
