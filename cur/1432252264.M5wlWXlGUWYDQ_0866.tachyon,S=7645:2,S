INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!

A new issue of Insight on the News is now online

http://www.insightmag.com

...............................................

Folks, Zoli Simon dug deep for you this week to find the story of how the Bush 
Administration continues the Clinton policy of handing over sensitive technology 
to China. Be prepared to “get your ears back” over this one 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/257504.html. And Hans Nichols will bring you up 
to date on the rise of the latest Democratic presidential darling—North 
Carolina’s John Edwards. It seems he’s being taken seriously in all the right 
places. Keep your eyes on him http://www.insightmag.com/news/257503.html. As you 
can see below, we have new hard-hitting articles to satisfy every appetite. 
Well, that’s it for this time. I remain your newsman in the D.C. Bunker.

SAME OLD SONG—BUSH CONTINUES HIGH-TECH TRANSFERS TO CHINA

U.S. technology still is being exported to the People's Republic, where it is 
being used to build better weapons.

DEMOCRAT RISING SON

CATHOLIC SEX ABUSE SCANDAL—ONLY THE LAWYERS WIN

prosecuting – or defending – the church.

               Is Bin-Laden the pawn of China?

On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded "red alert" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a "worst case scenario" -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:
