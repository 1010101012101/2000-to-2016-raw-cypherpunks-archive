Dang kids. Get offa my lawn.


It=92s been interesting, I=92ll say that much. I have people on their =
honeymoon here in .ai asking to see me, buy me and Mrs. RAH $30 =
hamburgers at Viceroy, etc.

Or =93prove=94, =93stylometrically", on various Bitcoin fora, that I'm =
Satoshi. Heh. I=92ll never get tired of braggin=92 about *that* one. :-) =
I expect others here know where the stylistic clues came from, but I =
think Grigg has the right approach to that question. Leave well enough =
alone.


Being, even now, generally optimistic about the future, if not my own in =
particular, I can=92t help thinking there=92s a pony in there somewhere. =
I *do* find it annoying that the only time people wanna talk to me about =
this stuff is at the top of a bubble. I expect that it may be a hint =
from the Almighty I should pay attention to.=20


At the moment, PayPal, which we all looked down the nose at back then, =
is still, um, printing money, and a cypherpunk gave me some BTC a little =
while ago, a kind of eating-the-dog food exercise for old time=92s sake. =
Or something. The price has since fallen 40%, but it=92s bouncing back, =
and will probably be fine. =93You have to be *this* tall to take this =
ride=94, as another friend said about Bitcoin prices last week. =
Meanwhile I can=92t think of anything I want to spend it on anyway.

Even in its current form, Bitcoin makes rather short work of those speed =
bumps Mr. May used to tell us about, which *may* be the real point to =
the exercise.

Having to file several kinds of forms to get paid for a small consulting =
job as US citizen outside the US was enough to make me foreswear getting =
paid for much of anything anymore, anything small at least, and BTC =
solves several problems there quite handily, push ever came to shove. =
Besides, my passport is stamped =93Employment Prohibited=94, which, =
apparently, I=92m evidently honoring even in the breach.


So, I think BTC, or something like it, would make a nice numeraire, =
temporary or otherwise, having gnawed at the edges of *that* problem =
when most of the Bitcoinners were, as Marc notes, in short-pants. Yes, =
even in its current volatile state. And contrary to the opinions of =
people who know better than I do about these things.


It wasn't quite what Dr. Fama got the Nobel for, but New Monetary =
Economics might be as good once as it ever was, and Bitcoin might be the =
camel=92s nose under that particular tent, and given that it is the =
ultimate fiat currency that=92s quite an assertion.

As someone whose stated goal, back in the day, was to securitize =
*everything*, debt, equity, cash, services, title to assets in storage, =
transit, or just sitting there with a house on it, cats, dogs, mass =
hysteria -- and all derivatives thereof -- using bearer-transaction =
financial cryptography protocols on a ubiquitous geodesic public =
internetwork, Bitcoin *is* a bit, oh, please let me say it, =
self-referent as a solution. I saw it blow by here on this list, said, =
=93meh=94, shortly had the magic smoke go out of most of my internet =
presence by a power-spike in a hurricane, and never got around to paying =
attention to either Bitcoin, or the internet, very much at all until =
various people frog-marched my attention back into focus recently with =
me muttering variously about being too old for this shit anymore...


So, Bitcoin, if it survives, makes a *nice* hack, by solving, what =
Barnes, and ultimately everyone else, called the =93loading problem=94. =
And, so far at least, it solves the =93and then you go to jail=94 part =
of the book-entry transaction error-handler, something Barnes was also =
noted for saying. That, too, only if Bitcoin survives.=20

"...any [network] architecture that can survive a nuclear attack can =
survive withdrawal of government subsidy...=94 Godwin said on Cyberia, =
long ago. I=92ve jokingly called it his Second Law. I suppose the Strong =
Form of that hypothesis, speaking of Dr. Fama, is surviving not mere =
withdrawal of the implicit subsidy of monopolistic contract enforcement, =
and all transfer-priced assets and =93externalities=94 appertaining =
thereto, but also active attack from the ostensible contract enforcer =
itself.


I hear of others, well, gnawing around the edges, actually, of =
securitizing other stuff with variants of the Bitcoin protocol, but, =
like predicting the end of the world, expanding the blockchain to other =
assets "has not been found agreeable to experience.=94 So far as I can =
see.

Meanwhile, Chris Odom, aka, =93Fellow Traveller=94, aka, =93Lovedrop=94 =
(yes, *that* =93Lovedrop=94), is banging away on something called Open =
Transactions, which inserts an actual transaction protocol, among other =
much more interesting things, into the works to glue Bitcoin and other =
stuff onto, for starters, Wagner Blinding, using, for starters, Ben =
Laurie=92s lucre code. I haven=92t seen a code-stoke like the one I see =
Chris with, well, since the old days. Which is nice. Very nice. Big =
grins all around, down here in the elbow of the Caribbean. Apparently, =
like me, he noticed that he was delivering instantly-usable product now, =
and getting paid later, too much later usually. I discovered cypherpunks =
in late spring of 1994 looking for a solution to something Barnes =
(again) called the =93latency=94 problem. Chriss bumped into the =
gold-silver-crypto list, I think, about 10 years later.

Mr. Odom has been been kind enough to involve me in testing OT a bit, =
and, ultimately, I=92ve more-or-less bailed on iterative =
break-it-and-fix-it. Mostly because I don=92t have the patience for =
testing =97 much less writing =97 code, if I ever really did.=20

But here=92s the rub, I also I have no *idea* what I, personally, would =
do with Open Transactions these days even if I could get it running in =
production.

I have lots of ideas in *general*, you understand, but they=92re mostly =
of the =93let=92s you and him fight=94 variety.=20

Many more people than *I* would have to be involved, they, and I, would =
risk much more than money, and, ultimately, I=92m not sure any of it =
would work. It=92s a drag to think that most of what I=92m interested in =
doing requires the dissolution, or at least dissipation, of The World=92s =
Only Remaining Superpower to happen. As someone who still, barely, calls =
himself mostly an anarcho-capitalist but still a patriot, that=92s about =
the only thing worse than only being interesting to other people during =
the top of a bubble. Yup. A Mass of Contradictions, as usual.


"Let=92s you and him fight" is only two or three steps removed from Mr. =
Briceno=92s original observation, I figure.

Hell, even =93set here next to the rockin' chair, sonny, and I=92ll tell =
ya a story=94, is, ultimately, not much more help than =93get off my =
lawn=94, when you get right down to it...

Cheers,
RAH
