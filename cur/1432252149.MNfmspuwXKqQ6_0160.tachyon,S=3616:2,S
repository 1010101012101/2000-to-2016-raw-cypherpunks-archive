I would be astonished if these were not logging keystrokes and 
complete recordings of screen video.  I wouldn't be surprised if 
there were live COMINT people on site analyzing everything in 
real time for any potential threats. Maybe from another country 
if you have pesky laws about local COMINT people monitoring their 
own citizens, but they're going to be there and they're going to 
be working closely with local authorities.

If you are anywhere near the Olympics, expect every telephone 
call to be listened to in real time and every internet connection 
to be monitored in real time.

Thinking about the "prank" value of connecting a Blum-Blum-Shub 
generator on some old 386 to a packet modem and setting it to 
broadcast occasionally from some obscure spot near the olympics 
to simulate encrypted traffic.  But pretty sure that he would 
be charged with something if he did.
