EBONICS 

A slang dialect used by certain groups of the African-American community. 

Yo, Big Daddy upstairs, 
You be chillin 
So be yo hood 
You be sayin' it, I be doin' it 
In this here hood and yo's 
Gimme some eats 
And cut me some slack, Blood 
Sos I be doin' it to dem dat diss me 
Don't be pushing me into no jive 
Ang keep dem crips away 
Cause you always be da man, G 
Straight up. 
Aa-men.
