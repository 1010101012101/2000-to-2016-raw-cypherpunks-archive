Jim, 

You have a seriously wide definition of tyranny here! Try as I might, I
have trouble seeing how arguing  in public against a proposal you
disagree with is "trying to impose".  If Declan went round to .xxx
people and locked them in jail till they gave up - *that* might be
incompatible with being a proponent of individual freedom. But speaking
to some people in a bar?
