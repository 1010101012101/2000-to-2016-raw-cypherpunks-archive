I found the Bloomberg reference to the MSNBC report and posted it here 
Friday night.

I don't know what you mean about saying "i tried telling people here..."

A few people reported problems pasting the URL in, but others found it 
to work.

The events of today just confirmed what came out on Friday: the second 
case, and the fact that the cases are within a few miles of where the 
Jihad warriors trained, is mighty suspicious. The cover story, that 
Edwards must have gotten it during a trip to North Carolina, is now "no 
longer operative."
