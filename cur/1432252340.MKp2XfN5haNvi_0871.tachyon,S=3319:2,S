Here's the original story in the Houston Chronicle:

http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3101557
"During the arrest, they discovered that the woman had stored sexually
explicit photos of herself in her cell phone, and Green downloaded the
images onto his personal digital assistant, according to the search
request."

Not sure if this is of interest for Politech, but it sure seems beyond the
pale of unreasonable search and seizure (small pun).  Hypothetically, what
if the phone had a picture of the woman in question standing over a dead
person in back of her home?  Is this a warrantless search and if they find
the body in her home is this fruit from a poisoned tree?  Do the police
have
a right to search through all the "data" a person has in thier
possession at
the time of arrest?  What about a USB flash drive?

Encrypt, encrypt, encrypt.
