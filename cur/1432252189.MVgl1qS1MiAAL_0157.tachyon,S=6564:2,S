Tor is funded by the US government, not the US military per se. The same US
gov is funding research and efforts of breaking it. It's funding it to
saveguard free speech and all that good stuff, and it's funding the attack
to safeguard American supremacy (and maybe something about terrorism and
crime).

Somehow it seems as wonderfully inefficient as it seems perfectly
reasonable. And if you don't think it's reasonable, doesn't that just make
more sense? It's the USA!

Is Tor imperfect? Yeah, probably. But it's the best tool out there atm. Is
Tor intentionally imperfect? No evidence of it. Is reality a strange place
to be? Definitely. Are Tor people completely untrustworthy? What's trust
got to do with good code and crypto?
