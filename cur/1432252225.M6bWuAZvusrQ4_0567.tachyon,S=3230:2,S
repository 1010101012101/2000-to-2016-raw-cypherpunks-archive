Jeez.  One problem here is that there's not a damn thing else 
she could have done.  Once she got through boot camp, responding 
to a physical attack by *AT LEAST* incapacitating the attacker 
is nothing but a reflex action.  Not hitting soldiers is basic 
survival instincts, almost no matter who trained them. 

Of course, the saudi probably couldn't wrap his brain around the 
combination of "female" and "soldier", so didn't understand what 
the hell he was doing.
