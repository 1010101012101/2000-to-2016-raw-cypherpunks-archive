Portable SCIFs have been around for decades, tent-size and desk-top:

http://cryptome.org/bema-se.htm

More compact and emanation-resistant now. Carry your own.

Entrepreneurs would offer curb-side service, like food carts, or larger
like waste shredders and blood test labs. Yarping and texting on cellphones
in the open, believing privacy policies, faith in crypto, wi-fi, ISPs, VPNs,
HTTPS, Tor, clouds, IoT, is day-dreaming, making sellers rich.

Anything that encourages and supports self-security instead of products,
standards, official protectors, is the right direction.

Quietly clumsy beats drum-beating authorities ever compromising their
users for cohorts.

SCIFs leak, sure, rig fixes, test, retest, minimize use of EMR devices,
don't bet your life on any security, homebrew or top 10.

Have a nice day.
