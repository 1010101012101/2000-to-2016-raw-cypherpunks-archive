And yet, if in a union, I am posed a similar question as the
sweatshop worker. Do I dare go against the union and risk being a
pariah, or do i simply follow the herd and fuck over the businessman
whose hand feeds me? There is only asymetry if you presume the
employee to be ignorant, or uneducated or plain outright stupid. If
the exchange is totally voluntary, the owner will present a wage
that the employee may or may not accept along with terms and
conditions, which the employee is also free to accept or decline. 
Granted, in the world of unskilled labor, this doesnt seem as evident, 
but that goes back around the circle on why the work is unskilled and 
why the worker is there. Life handed him a shittier set of choices than
the guy whose hobby was network security and has more bargaining
power at the negotiation table with an employer. I firmly disagree
with the suppression of unions, but by that same token I firmly
disagree that an employer should be mandated to keep an employee who
is a part of a union. It is the employees choice to unioniye, it
should sure as hell be the employers choice to say as Tim so
galantly put it "Fuck Off!".
