Or, I am just using a figure of speech.

I could have used "once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away I have=20=

apparently signed up for"; or "I must've been drunk, as I don't remembe=
r=20
signing-up, but it must've sounded like a good idea back then"; or "as =
a=20
strong supporter of Avaaz I look forward to each and every single one o=
f their=20
magnificent mailings".

For no particular reason I have happened to chose this particular figur=
e of=20
speech, however.

Or, I'm just asking on a pretty technical mailing list if anybody has a=
ny=20
contact to an organisation that brushes shoulders with techies on a reg=
ular=20
basis, which I would like to contact.

I found many, many times that such a strategy is not problematic to oth=
er list=20
members while offering decent probability of success. If it has caused =
you any=20
distress or anguish, I apologise with utmost sincerity.

Please note that the "contact info" question was just "by the way", and=
 had I=20
not gotten the idea to ask that question I would have sent ("I would ha=
ve=20
happened to send"?) my e-mail either way (granted, with a bit different=
=20
ending).
