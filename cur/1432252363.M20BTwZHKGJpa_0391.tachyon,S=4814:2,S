Uh...dunno.

Sure, you might be able to make that argument. While you're thinking about 
it, looking out over the rolling hills of NoCal, someone in Iraq (well, he 
may be on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border!) is bound to notice that these 
blue-suited Troops have clearly been directed (to some extent) by the same 
entity that directs the Green-suited troops. As you strap 17 pounds of 
exblo-sieves to the back of a 17-year-old, you're probably not going to 
bother trying to differentiate between the two groups...you'll notice that 
both batches work for the Americans and speak English, and shoot at you and 
other Iraqis that try to drive them out.

Well, sure you MIGHT notice that there's a greater concentration of the 
blue-suited variety around oil rigs and stuff, but I'm not convinced that's 
going to matter. Hell, I'm not smart enough to be convinced it DOES matter 
in this case.
