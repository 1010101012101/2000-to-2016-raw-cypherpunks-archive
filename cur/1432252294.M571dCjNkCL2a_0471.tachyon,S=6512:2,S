Ok ... so we are now splitting hairs on language.  Fine.  Have
it your way.

My statement that every voter actually knew was improper.

However, you are just going off on a tangent ...

I am sure that months or years after JFK was assasinated, you
can find someone who didn't even know he was in office.  There
is just no way to deal with this level of cluelessness.

In these days of mass media, Internet, etc ...  If you didn't
know the guy was dead, and his wife was to take his place, you
aren't trying.  I don't care.  It's not my state.  I still had
no choice but to be bombarded with that news.

Sorry.  My point still stands.

Ern

As a working journalist writing about politics, I get lots of feedback from 
voters. Many are, sadly, clueless.

But it is a stretch to assert, as you blithely do, that every voter knew 
that the guy was dead. My own experience shows otherwise.
