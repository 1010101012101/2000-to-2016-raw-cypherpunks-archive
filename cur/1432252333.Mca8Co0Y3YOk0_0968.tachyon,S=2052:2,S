More recently, and closer to Hanson's point in the article, both of
Lincoln's elections were very close. But, after Lincoln's second
inauguration, Grant took charge of the Union Army and began killing
Confederates (and Union soldiers) in a series of horrific battles
culminating in the end of the Civil War.

Expect more carnage than culture when Bush is elected.

Cheers,
RAH
