I've just advised the sheik of two attack on America tactics,anything to 
keep him away from us.
1) Fire missiles into satellite level orbits designed to blow up and spread 
space junk.
Those GPS dirty birds are shitting all over you.
2) Build mini-subs,infect rats with various diseases and send them in.This 
is an old jap idea that should be ergonomic and with a good foot and mouth 
outbreak,devastating.
Those seppo's love their rancid fatburgers.(eat your heart out jeff.)
Summer jihadi's should get out in the woods with their firelighters 
again,The world is for warming and shrubs are for burning.
