--- overview ---

pile-on. the following are a wide range of examples of everyday situations
that could have crypto relevance, in one way or another. the purpose is to
share a view of how large the fundamental questions are, beyond a
software/hardware and computer model to perhaps question the assumptions of
where the boundaries are, especially as it is decided upon in a fixed set
of [signs] via code and programs, versus what i propose is to deconstruct
to the most minimal structures, circuits and models and hypotheses that
become the code, in a diagrammatic pattern language versus linear
sign-based system. thus more like molecular sculpture, programming,  in
testing and evaluating ideas from the period table, via logical reasoning,
than an issue of rationalization of a private finite bounded binaristically
determined view that is detached from actual reality, separated from it,
substituting for it. this is a problem of language and meaning and the
limits of linearization both in terms of writing/reading though also
computationally, in serial processing of, what amounts to a false singular
perspective made up of fragments of relativism yet not rigorous enough to
achieve grounded empiricism due to error reliance. thus, the gap in
questioning and interpretation as it may relate to fields and ideas beyond
the ordinary consideration. also: it is to assume cryptographers in their
natural state may actually think in these terms (dimensionally) though it
may not have a place in code as code or analogous encryption approaches due
to a particular technical approach, if over-focussed on subjective
mathematics and out of balance with the larger questioning of signs and
their relation to reality, this as language based on logical reasoning,
both mathematical and 'cultural'. in the way crypto may reference books via
hidden patterns, to decipher messages, it is presumed this is more the
foundation of the discipline than flawed technology. and thus more a
reminder of its depth and range of operation, than  finiteness.

--- aesthetics ---

the false perspective can be tricky, images deceive- who figures the
effortless grace of a Cary Grant presidency would front for an illegal
crypto dictatorship, another hidden order plotting against citizens behind
the iconic, oversaturated stars and stripes of the US flag, emblem of
patriotic ideology that all are safe, there is nothing to worry about,
while people are actively being ground into dust.

the image can lie. it can misrepresent. [signs] that are pattern matched
can be subverted, appearing to be one thing while functioning as another.
this is why testing hypotheses versus blind faith in theories is a required
for vigilance. [sign.A] can transform into [sign.B] yet appear still as if
the [sign] itself, unchanging, yet if the context or dynamics shift, its
meaning and purpose can also. it is as if there is no awareness of what
observation is, a pre-literate condition whereby populations are not
educated enough to distinguish their or others ideas in a grounded
framework. and critical to this is the concept of perspective, the physical
relationships that establish viewpoints and boundaries.

for instance, if a neighbor listens at the wall to monitor another person,
who is simply typing at a computer and not making any disturbance that
could effect them,  yet this neighbor knows what they are typing is 'wrong'
and disturbing and could in turn retaliate to stop the activity. this also
is an issue of perspective and boundaries, where the right of privacy of a
tenant is disregarded by a neighbor who instead surveils and exploits this
as a means of political harassment. a line or boundary has been crossed,
the law disregarded, and this can also happen with government, if it too
monitors and disallows legal activity that seeks to shut down activity it
deems 'wrong' to its particular limited agenda and viewpoint, and in this
way ignoring the constitutional rights of other citizens as the default.

meaning of words and concepts and symbols demarcate 'the lines' or
trajectories of logical reasoning, they need to be validated and
error-corrected and watched over to maintain a proper relationship, yet if
this oversight fails, an all-seeing perspective that is actually very
limited and based in false and biased views can become 'the public'
framework, yet function against this public via corruption of these same
frameworks and processes needed to maintain a shared public state.

The Republic by Plato describes various forms of government as one type
leads to another and in this, democracy is said to lead to dictatorship. of
various other forms of governance, say aristocracy or communism, it is
proposed in a context of empirical truth, that if 'truth' were the basis
for governance of human citizens in a human state, that these various
stages of governance could all function on the 'same side' of truth, even
while configured differently. and if truth were the basis for relations,
and its error correction, then perhaps these various forms of governance
could error-correct known failures in these same systems. in this way it is
hypothesized that the truth in European nations is not against truth in
other areas, and the truth in Russia and truth in China is not inherently
against or opposed to the truth in the US or Canada. and thus so too issues
of crypto.

in that, 'shared awareness' and 'shared truth' may have a different
boundary than the nation-state and each state could function with 'shared
lies' as a challenge which is common across borders as well, and maps into
another framework than the state is organized around in its traditional
terms. thus doubling of function, potentially, inside and outside, to deal
with these dynamics both near and far. it would seem that human identity is
the basis for this assumption that such shared empirical observation could
occur in a human framework, to resolve discrepancies occurring internally
and externally and provide a means of accurate feedback in regards to
shared principles and the ability to evaluate and correct errors in a
common framework based in shared truth, tested and retested against the
evidence.

what is particularly of interest in this is the role of symbolism that
spans all states of the world, especially in a realm of flags and other
representations of a people or culture, potentially as signaling systems
referencing common elements. for instance, colors or stars or birds, as
these structural /signs/ may change country to country yet reference or
communicate via similar symbolic elements.

likewise, each country or region may relate in particular frameworks for
cuisine and local customs, including clothing and zeitgeist, as modern and
traditional influences may be mediated uniquely in a given context which
can also heavily depend upon geography and connectivity, which can lead to
routes unchanged over millennia, more closely connected to the ancient past
than the unfolding future. and that there is truth everywhere and truth to
be learned from these various people and perspectives about existence and
the nature of being and perception. that perhaps they know things that are
beyond another's limited boundary and thus listening and considering the
ideas is an important process in human relations, as it relates to truth
and evidence and what exists versus what is believed to exist. and that
deep human connections are possible in opening up and allowing for this
dialogue and evaluation of hypotheses in a shared framework based on and
guided by truth itself. where each perspective counts in the truth it
exists within. and that 'higher truth' as a principle must be accounted for
likewise, fundamentally. that some truth is hierarchical and its structural
capacity must be recognized and respected, versus deferring to lesser truth
and less accurate interpretations. in this way, truth establishes actual
power. its corruption weakens and dilutes it.

it is something to consider then, when a national dish or symbolic [sign]
are corrupted or subverted -- say the main ingredient in hotdish of a given
culture is being poisoned somehow as part of a hidden agenda. or that an
apple is so loaded with chemicals and various drugs as to be sickening, yet
remains a symbol of health ('an apple a day keeps insurance and healthcare
in perpetual play'). what if the kielbasa is spiked at the factory. or the
water is loaded with unfiltered psychiatric run-off and windshield wiper
fluid. or mothers breasts transit Zoloft to newborns. at what point of
disjuncture may these dynamics be considered corrupt in their pre-existing
interpretations and requiring of new evaluations to get at what has changed
and what is going on behind the curtain of hidden, secret state and its
antihuman agenda. how can an appearance remain unchecked which has been
subverted so that it stands against itself as its own [anti-sign]. yet this
a=3Db condition becomes an issue of allegiance and ideological alliance, as
if litmus to separate the canaries into the psychiatric system while
funneling the rest into the awaiting cattle chutes. silent, passive, easily
controlled, compliant, ready to be led to their demise while helping the
process along and getting paid for it.

what are the security issues involved and secrecy required for such events
to occur yet be off the cultural and communications radar. where is the
feedback or critical evaluation in a larger human context, versus
fragmented relativisms that focus here or there in specificities, yet
cannot seem to make tangible a standing conspiracy to overtake the world
and turn the earth into a slave prison-planet.

in that sense of civilian world war, it is curious what individuals might
think about in terms of the stakes involved, life and death scenarios as
the situation becomes increasingly clear. what happens when people are set
against one another in barbarian-like mindsets and pre-literate and
illiterate frameworks. might not issues like tattoos become areas of
populist contention, where those of differing natures seek to regain the
meaning of their signs, no longer observing boundaries of respect for
unlike others, whose tattoos by comparison may be their devaluing, or seek
to signify what they really are not- and thus a stand-off could occur in
such strange realms. or, those with piercings as a security issue, if say
there is a sudden appearance of torturers in the population, against the
opposition, where having battery hookups on various body parts is inviting
such exploitations. would you walk around in a thunderstorm in a large
field with a metal antenna strapped to your head? what about walking around
with 'security exploits' in times of war, inviting the oppositional
imagination to consider the worst, given the specifics.

and so too, the increasing primativisation as a cultural trend, whereby ear
plugs and flesh tubes seemingly emulate villagers of particular cultural
traditions as if a style or extension of a fashion or aesthetic movement.
the issue involved is also of a potential security exploit- what might
someone do with that, against a person, as a weakness or if they relate to
it as a threat of profanation of the shared values. and there is nothing to
stop the stand-off between these people. i cannot help but think of college
hazing gone wrong, where a U-Lock could easily capture a person against a
pole via their earlobes and there could be no way of escape in a given
scenario than ripping your own ears open and having flaps from the
stretched condition. and yet- there are vast many people who despise these
kinds of transgressions, in cultural terms, for signifying a devolving
culture. what if such aesthetic choices are security choices. what if they
could lead to other interactions eventually in a changing context, and the
'shared awareness' is simply the result of an absence of error-correction
for the group, and that such a group may have limits on some issues, which
could align with certain principles.

in that, it is highly likely many are in these contexts and require
adaptation to cultural dynamics, and so may be self-aware about the deeper
divisions this may involve in 'shared awareness' in terms of aesthetics, or
as aesthetics divide groups and individuals from one another. as if a stage
play and costumes for different characters and their roles. and that this
must be acknowledged. and yet so too there could be ideology involved,
beliefs that could be fundamentally false or wicked or antihuman even,
associated with similar signage and associated or related practices, given
the particular individuals and groups so aligned. and in this way, like a
freeway sign or marker offering direction, these iconic [signs] and the
observational processing of symbols establishes certain relations and is
involved in establishing and maintaining specific limits, boundaries, and
rites.

the rock-opera film Quadrophenia is an interesting contrast between the
aesthetics of mods on vespa scooters and leather-clad rockers on
motorcycles in the UK 1960s. the contrast between the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones likewise, in some way. it involves aesthetic communications
and symbolic language of artifacts, actions, and ideas, cultural practices
that can eventually run in parallel or even against one another, say if
biker gangs go to war over territory. graffiti or [signs] can be part of
this infrastructure of hidden communication that may otherwise be missed by
those outside the shared boundary or framework of interrelational awareness=
.

so an issue such as hairstyles, such as the mohawk from the punk era,
versus in the present day, where it may be a different sign, potentially of
conformance if the spirit of rebellion is only shallow, versus visceral
challenging of order. and as language, how this may relate historically to
earlier eras, peoples, and ideas. that there is depth to signs and
symbolism, and thus literacy involves awareness and the ability and
capacity to read and interpret these events in their depth, or to the depth
available. and thus experience or knowledge can help in observation.

in other words, there could be authentic signs and symbols, retaining an
integrity and others that are mimicking this, emulating, or simulating the
[signage] while potentially even standing against its depth, as an
anti-sign, camouflage or label wearing, as status symbols or markers, these
relations hollowed out of meaning and made superficial yet still
potentially functioning and treated as if originals and not copies of
copies which devolve via noise, and dissolve into greater falsity. what is
a sign that only references itself? or self-aware self-referencing. what if
to some extent it is a form of advertisement, marketing, instead of ideas
it is about consumerism, for instance, replacing cultural depth with its
commodification as a result of increasing development of illiteracy in a
context of mass populism. such that the TV extra or stand-in or "bit part"
becomes a kind of vocation, just like a person can decide to become a
heroine user and make a living as an addict, because the clinics and
programs need them to justify their own existence and thus a lifestyle can
be sustained by various choices, say versus another line of work. such as
focusing on human problems beyond the self and making huge sacrifices on
behalf of the group, and taking beating after beating in doing so. maybe it
is an issue of broken people again, yet at some point there is also a
choice and again a boundary issue- a critical moment, and making the wrong
choices distinguishes one group from another, and it is proposed The Moment
of Truth is this demarcation.

whose to say that if a government falls and functions in its worst vices
against its own citizens, that those on the inside of its internal
organization are also not the same group protected in corrupt society -
such that surveillers and those going after people, setting them up or
gathering evidence to take them down, are not themselves the pedophile
networks and child abusers and misogynists who most benefit from this
devolved condition, seemingly of a shared political agenda even. and so
what if the [signs] are not accurate for what may actually be involved or
the network of signs are not allowed to be established or referenced for
shared navigation because this territory is already encrypted and under
control, via these same hidden and hostile forces, operating beyond the
existing boundaries. what if there is a plague or epidemic of moral
collapse that is the rotten core of the rogue state and its antihuman
agenda and that at its center is a concentrated network that is organized
around principles against citizens, education, law, freedom, human
development, family, marriage, nature, as part of a conspiracy. and yet
this very situation could also have been devised as a trap, with a dual
plan that both allows for this maldevelopment in order to annihilate it
within society, and thus complex and contradictory cryptography also exists
in this same context.

--- further note on aesthetics ---

regarding issues of individual style, the film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,
released in the past few years, was an interesting evaluation of the dress
of those whose business it is to operate in the realm of secrets and
national security issues. it is almost that dress is occurs thoroughly at
the midpoint range, in an ambiguous realm that is neither completely common
nor singularly identifiably unique. and thus blending into a surrounding
population, nondescript perhaps, not standing out as a benefit for those
moving between realms amongst others of different domains.

what is interesting is that there is value to camouflage yet also the
potential for small details, that establish identity in a minimal or
traditional framework than needing to establish this as extreme
individualism or group activity, though that likely has its place equally
so, given different context. though it would appear an issue connected with
identity and shared or unshared awareness, if the focus is on maintaining
costuming or being removed of its additional requirements. perhaps for some
the tradeoff is necessary or critical, yet for others it could be that
their anonymity is part of their security and safety protocol. as a [sign]
they may become ambiguous and unnoticed in a particular context, in that
their extreme sport is bloodsport and yet no one may be the wiser of such
activity.

another film, The Company (2007) with Michael Keaton as the head of a
mole-hunting counterintelligence unit, an orchid lover known as "mother",
conveys this symbolic dimension likewise in a larger symbolic framework
that cultural communication inherently exists within, as the context for
shared meaning via language. and thus if [signs] are mediated in this way
as a way of conveying stories, why would they be limited in this same depth
in a realm of computation involving such [signs], unless of course this is
not the case and other approaches exist within crypto.

this has been a futile attempt to reference the [signage] of self as
signifying a certain algorithm reading by others, in a surrounding culture,
as the boundary for shared or unshared awareness. it may be a haircut, a
suit, color or style of clothing, shoes, tattoos or body piercings, though
at some point these are patterns that are matched against others, such that
a 'hacker' is represented by a particular style or school of thought, and
defined aesthetically. or programmer, or covert operative, or
cryptographer, or technocrat, or artist, or activist.

and there seems to be a corrolaly here, potentially, between these same
issues of superficial crypto where a BIG SIGN is put up saying: HERE IS THE
HIDDEN SECRET!!! and so sometimes a style can develop that begins to
represent a hacker, say, with stickers all over their laptop, and the
ability to run scripts and vandalize and steal passwords, and yet they may
be operating in a different realm from those of the 60s onward, who are
part of a different language, and 'hacking' could have become a popular
group activity, normalized, not radicalized in the same way, in that it is
thoroughly profitable and aligned with policies of development say, and so
the 'alternative may have become the mainstream' yet view itself as
standing apart in some critical way, which is signified by ritual
practices, conferences, clothing or hairstyles or music, etc. an
anthropological study probably would be needed of the subculture versus a
naive guess at what may be involved. excepting that 'popular signs' of
hacking appear to coincide with existing politics, where exploitation of
other citizens may be occurring by script kiddies and others who are
benefiting from this societal breakdown, versus goals of a higher purpose
that may remain in the underground, and those who are not craving to be up
on stage.

it is just that, a particular shallowness and hollowness to certain
disciplines appears to exist - including with other realms such as
architecture concerned with increasing heights of skyscrapers versus
questioning, changing, or challenging city planning principles to address
economic, social, or governance issues within building design - and yet in
this superficiality, the [architect] is equated with those who before them
did explore these dimensions and served higher principles that today seem
absent in the development process, as if culture itself has been subverted,
hacked, rooted, taken over and sent in another antihuman direction. and so
someone may stand-in as an [architect] and look the iconic part, yet serve
other principles and effectively function in masquerade, hiding another
agenda.

and so in a 'landscape of difference', of wildly diverging styles as if
freedoms of people to be who they really are, conglomerate around computer
monitors and there is a class of programmers who can manipulate computers
and develop software and maintain systems -- and yet the gap is only
widening at the same time these same types are playing foosball or raving
with friends and eating expensive food, while operating in a realm
potentially associated with 'hackers' or those who are standing-in for an
idea that tended towards human liberation via technology, and not its
confinement, whereby these same technologists in their lifestyles and their
stylistic code of hair, jewelry, clothing, and tribal customs appear to
actually represent the [anti-sign] of the previous hacking ethos in its
larger purpose and calling. such as the potential of the internet, versus
monetization. as if the very idea and imagination of this online context
has collapsed into a trapdoor beneath center stage, where advertisement and
marketing rule everything in a no-exist dungeon scenario, and these of
simulated radicalism and emulated individualism are actually ~Garden of
Earthly Delights minions, an occupying force that is developing an
antihuman agenda via hardware and software as an unchecked business model,
with no greater expectation of individuals in their capacity.

so a [sign] can look like something or have appearance or claim to be
equivalent to some defined meaning, and this may be pattern matched even
-against itself-, and yet if it does not correlate or ground to a larger
context of truth this same 'naming' could be superficial or subverted, and
instead be [anti-sign] instead, whereby pseudo-truth moves to falsity in an
unshared perspective, beyond the protected boundary where skew and
distortion, bias and warping are unaccounted for and allow belief to
function as truth, a bubbled interior realm, potentially that of unchecked
egotism and narcissism in place of substance of the claimed signs. in this
way, issues of language-- it confuses what the sign references with the
sign (its attributes) itself, as if wearing the costume equates with the
role, acting versus being. knowing versus pretending or mimicking to some
extent or another. it is like comparing a programmer who knows 50 computer
languages and has designed their own, versus someone who has done some C++
and can run malware scripts and do bug exploits, where both reference the
same [sign], in a context of shared truth. and if this is unaccounted for,
then a vast bubble culture may exist, which is then extended into code, as
an illusion is sustained about the basic nature of things, technological,
ideological, institutional, computational, philosophical, though most
especially political. the power dynamics operating in these domains and the
active high-voltage structural circuits relied upon for day-to-day
operation of this exploitation, versus other parallel plans remaining
hidden. the potential for the greater truth, discharging the covert
super-capacitors in each discipline as the motherboard of state rewires and
reprograms its territory.

--- trading the paperclip ---

an artifact can function as language. its relation to its context is
important, as this establishes or changes meaning. an item can be placed in
a museum and the way it is observed can be transformed, such as Duchamp and
the Fountain urinal, signed by the artist, thus recontextualizing it,
establishing a new context, meaning, way of relating and interpreting the
artifact within new dimensionality. (reframing)

a particular artifact i find especially interesting is the ACCO Ideal
butterfly paper clamp, it is an innovative, functional, highly aesthetic
style of paperclip that has always reminded me of electric transmission
towers. those giant metal armatures crossing continental landscapes,
carrying the AC powerlines that deliver high voltage power from its area of
generation to its areas of consumption. in many ways representative of the
federal level of the state in its civic quality. thus there is a potential
transference of the icon of the transmission tower into the smaller scaled
context of a similarity or likeness in a type of paperclip, which may or
may not be recognized by an observer who readily uses the artifact.

and this is to suggest that, like a business card or a calling card, such
an artifact could function as a token in its symbolism, if valued, and also
as [signage] that is recontextualized by its surroundings. in other words,
it could function as a cryptographic key potentially, or shared key, or
cipher system, depending on whether or not these encounters with 'networks
of power' are noticed by an observer who can relate to their meaning, or
who is bounded in awareness.

in other words, the paperclip can have a kind of currency, both as a
material object and "informationally" as a form or basis for data exchange,
of ideas, as it relates to shared awareness or as a basis for
communications. and this could and does occur already with other artifacts
in the realm of symbolic communication that as a practice is perhaps best
zoned in paracrypto relations, non-verbal, rich with meaning, adept in
language, yet likely unnoticed by those outside its limits.

so there is a famous instance of a paperclip as money, where a single
paperclip is exchanged and the person eventually ends up with a 2-story
farmhouse...

One Red Paperclip
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip

this is not the same idea, though it gets at the current involved in
transactions around a common object in terms of shared value and exchange.
yet this can occur informationally, where the paperclip instead is a symbol
or sign of language, and can establish communication and transmit ideas,
potentially. and thus transfer data or awareness or provide insight. it is
like a silver bullet placed at a crime scene as this relates to its
perpetrator. or an assassin who puts pennies on the eyes of their victim.
yet also not of this same deathly realm necessarily, it could instead
belong to a realm of networking or connection between peoples or indicate
certain parameters which may or may not be valid, given its source. so such
an artifact could be used for communication and carry insight in its use
and application, whereas a mimic or subverter may attempt the same yet it
could be hollow or shallow or misleading, and in a sense, 'collapse the
wave that carries the signal', thus indicating an ungrounded relation or
compromised instance.

in this way, the paperclip of ordinary design can represent this
tradeability as language, by its use as exampled in the url above. and yet
in another mundane environment it may be just like another penny on the
ground, so infinitesimal that it is beyond notice, as if worthless and
subconscious unless needed for use.

and yet another style of paperclip, the butterfly paper clamp, has a
symbolism that goes beyond itself as an icon and maps into another
structure (electric transmissions pylons) and in some sense can represent
these as language, and in a sense, symbolic currency even. in that to share
the artifact could function both by itself as a symbol, though also in a
context of surrounding environment that may function in and reference an
embedded context, as a [sign] in relation to other [signs], and this is how
sentences or more in-depth meaning can be formed beyond the singular event
of 'the symbol' (pylon!) and into statements involving or extending its
meaning, to some threshold of what is possible to communicate in an
abstract realm, given surrounding structures and frameworks of an observer.

in this way an errant paperclip or other symbol strangely located in a
context could call attention to itself through its uniqueness or
out-of-placeness, and in questioning its existence, strange or covert
communication could take place in hidden channels of awareness, beyond the
boundary of others. and in this way, who placed the paperclip or how it got
there could remain a mystery, it could even involve a hidden hand with root
access to establish such scenarios, and this can be a way that
crypto-communciations occur in what can be a paranormal realm, as
statistically unlikely events stack up one after another and establish an
entire universe of non-verbal communication via symbols and signs, in
precisely this way.

there is magic involved, and this connectivity transcends the limits of
computers and hardware and software devices and is primary in establishing
human relations, and advancing shared awareness via referencing truth
within empirical frameworks, using fundamental principles and concepts of
language, via this hidden calculus.

this is the same idea involved in transmuting the word 'cipher' into
'cigar', it is of a similar process of the actualization of these concepts
in the everyday environment as an artifact functions as a cryptographic key
or message yet may remain unnoticed in these dimensions by others.

it is proposed that this Strange Read/Reply Function (SRF) could be a way
of annotating such extra-dimensionality via reinterpretation, misreading,
errors, mistakes, misunderstandings, or other mutations of meaning that
recontextualize yet expand or alter the original condition and perhaps
provide additional insight or bring into question its meaning, via this
d=C5=BDtournement. optimized plagiary or [recoding] or [overcoding] or a wa=
y of
accessing subtext via another method of deconstruction. thus opening up
interpretation of the text beyond the limit of its referenced [sign] to its
potential or range of [signage], so to evaluate ideas and allow relations
beyond the preconceived boundaries, to access hidden dimensions embedded
within the deep structure of the code, its intersign armature. in this way
at the intersection or juncture of architecture and archaeology, past and
future meeting in the present. do observers relate, and in what structures,
frameworks, dynamics. what is the potential, the boundary, the limit. how
to access the greater truth of N-dimensionality, the nonlinear in linear
context. and thus a conceptual tool to potentially reassign the sign to say
more about it, as this may relate to sets and multisets as parallel,
co-existing computations. perspectives or frames that potentially have a
lot to offer traditional views, such that the ephemera and errata could be
critical in establishing grounding where the assumptions of normative
practices related to sign-based communication (as linear calculation) and
correct interpretation may make it off limits, by default of being wrong or
breaking rules of grammar and-or syntax, versus to acknowledge and allow
the potential for meaning where it exists, unearthed.

--- on randomness ---

it has not adequately been conveyed that artists and artworks can be expert
at this signaling and data exchange via symbolic communication. and this
extends into the entire ecosystem of gallerists and museums and auctioning
of paintings during critical periods, where for instance The Scream will
suddenly dominate the global news cycle -- this becomes a form of widely
distributed communication -- not only in terms of 'selling the paperclip'
and instead the other parallel aspect of using this artifact as a shared
reference, a world line by which other dynamics may be aligned or effected
by its force fields. including art heists likewise. or newly discovered
painting, such as the recent Van Gogh painting of a pot farm.

previously introduced to the ideas of John Cage regarding his use of the I
Ching to generate randomness, i was unable to appreciate its value as a way
to mediate questions of architecture instead of engaging social issues
within design ideas. and i probably am still too limited to understand its
actual relevance in that domain. and yet in a context of cryptography this
same technique could seemingly allow another RNG approach and thus is
mentioned here for those it may interest.

similarly yet differently, in relation to this, graphic symbols could
potentially also be used in a roulette approach for randomness,

<div dir=3D"ltr"><br>--- overview ---<br><br>pile-on. the following are a w=
ide range of examples of everyday situations that could have crypto relevan=
ce, in one way or another. the purpose is to share a view of how large the =
fundamental questions are, beyond a software/hardware and computer model to=
 perhaps question the assumptions of where the boundaries are, especially a=
s it is decided upon in a fixed set of [signs] via code and programs, versu=
s what i propose is to deconstruct to the most minimal structures, circuits=
 and models and hypotheses that become the code, in a diagrammatic pattern =
language versus linear sign-based system. thus more like molecular sculptur=
e, programming,=C2=A0 in testing and evaluating ideas from the period table=
, via logical reasoning, than an issue of rationalization of a private fini=
te bounded binaristically determined view that is detached from actual real=
ity, separated from it, substituting for it. this is a problem of language =
and meaning and the limits of linearization both in terms of writing/readin=
g though also computationally, in serial processing of, what amounts to a f=
alse singular perspective made up of fragments of relativism yet not rigoro=
us enough to achieve grounded empiricism due to error reliance. thus, the g=
ap in questioning and interpretation as it may relate to fields and ideas b=
eyond the ordinary consideration. also: it is to assume cryptographers in t=
heir natural state may actually think in these terms (dimensionally) though=
 it may not have a place in code as code or analogous encryption approaches=
 due to a particular technical approach, if over-focussed on subjective mat=
hematics and out of balance with the larger questioning of signs and their =
relation to reality, this as language based on logical reasoning, both math=
ematical and &#39;cultural&#39;. in the way crypto may reference books via =
hidden patterns, to decipher messages, it is presumed this is more the foun=
dation of the discipline than flawed technology. and thus more a reminder o=
f its depth and range of operation, than=C2=A0 finiteness.<br>
<br>--- aesthetics ---<br><br>the false perspective can be tricky, images d=
eceive- who figures the effortless grace of a Cary Grant presidency would f=
ront for an illegal crypto dictatorship, another hidden order plotting agai=
nst citizens behind the iconic, oversaturated stars and stripes of the US f=
lag, emblem of patriotic ideology that all are safe, there is nothing to wo=
rry about, while people are actively being ground into dust.<br>
<br>the image can lie. it can misrepresent. [signs] that are pattern matche=
d can be subverted, appearing to be one thing while functioning as another.=
 this is why testing hypotheses versus blind faith in theories is a require=
d for vigilance. [sign.A] can transform into [sign.B] yet appear still as i=
f the [sign] itself, unchanging, yet if the context or dynamics shift, its =
meaning and purpose can also. it is as if there is no awareness of what obs=
ervation is, a pre-literate condition whereby populations are not educated =
enough to distinguish their or others ideas in a grounded framework. and cr=
itical to this is the concept of perspective, the physical relationships th=
at establish viewpoints and boundaries.<br>
<br>for instance, if a neighbor listens at the wall to monitor another pers=
on, who is simply typing at a computer and not making any disturbance that =
could effect them,=C2=A0 yet this neighbor knows what they are typing is &#=
39;wrong&#39; and disturbing and could in turn retaliate to stop the activi=
ty. this also is an issue of perspective and boundaries, where the right of=
 privacy of a tenant is disregarded by a neighbor who instead surveils and =
exploits this as a means of political harassment. a line or boundary has be=
en crossed, the law disregarded, and this can also happen with government, =
if it too monitors and disallows legal activity that seeks to shut down act=
ivity it deems &#39;wrong&#39; to its particular limited agenda and viewpoi=
nt, and in this way ignoring the constitutional rights of other citizens as=
 the default.<br>
<br>meaning of words and concepts and symbols demarcate &#39;the lines&#39;=
 or trajectories of logical reasoning, they need to be validated and error-=
corrected and watched over to maintain a proper relationship, yet if this o=
versight fails, an all-seeing perspective that is actually very limited and=
 based in false and biased views can become &#39;the public&#39; framework,=
 yet function against this public via corruption of these same frameworks a=
nd processes needed to maintain a shared public state.<br>
<br>The Republic by Plato describes various forms of government as one type=
 leads to another and in this, democracy is said to lead to dictatorship. o=
f various other forms of governance, say aristocracy or communism, it is pr=
oposed in a context of empirical truth, that if &#39;truth&#39; were the ba=
sis for governance of human citizens in a human state, that these various s=
tages of governance could all function on the &#39;same side&#39; of truth,=
 even while configured differently. and if truth were the basis for relatio=
ns, and its error correction, then perhaps these various forms of governanc=
e could error-correct known failures in these same systems. in this way it =
is hypothesized that the truth in European nations is not against truth in =
other areas, and the truth in Russia and truth in China is not inherently a=
gainst or opposed to the truth in the US or Canada. and thus so too issues =
of crypto.<br>
<br>in that, &#39;shared awareness&#39; and &#39;shared truth&#39; may have=
 a different boundary than the nation-state and each state could function w=
ith &#39;shared lies&#39; as a challenge which is common across borders as =
well, and maps into another framework than the state is organized around in=
 its traditional terms. thus doubling of function, potentially, inside and =
outside, to deal with these dynamics both near and far. it would seem that =
human identity is the basis for this assumption that such shared empirical =
observation could occur in a human framework, to resolve discrepancies occu=
rring internally and externally and provide a means of accurate feedback in=
 regards to shared principles and the ability to evaluate and correct error=
s in a common framework based in shared truth, tested and retested against =
the evidence.<br>
<br>what is particularly of interest in this is the role of symbolism that =
spans all states of the world, especially in a realm of flags and other rep=
resentations of a people or culture, potentially as signaling systems refer=
encing common elements. for instance, colors or stars or birds, as these st=
ructural /signs/ may change country to country yet reference or communicate=
 via similar symbolic elements.<br>
<br>likewise, each country or region may relate in particular frameworks fo=
r cuisine and local customs, including clothing and zeitgeist, as modern an=
d traditional influences may be mediated uniquely in a given context which =
can also heavily depend upon geography and connectivity, which can lead to =
routes unchanged over millennia, more closely connected to the ancient past=
 than the unfolding future. and that there is truth everywhere and truth to=
 be learned from these various people and perspectives about existence and =
the nature of being and perception. that perhaps they know things that are =
beyond another&#39;s limited boundary and thus listening and considering th=
e ideas is an important process in human relations, as it relates to truth =
and evidence and what exists versus what is believed to exist. and that dee=
p human connections are possible in opening up and allowing for this dialog=
ue and evaluation of hypotheses in a shared framework based on and guided b=
y truth itself. where each perspective counts in the truth it exists within=
. and that &#39;higher truth&#39; as a principle must be accounted for like=
wise, fundamentally. that some truth is hierarchical and its structural cap=
acity must be recognized and respected, versus deferring to lesser truth an=
d less accurate interpretations. in this way, truth establishes actual powe=
r. its corruption weakens and dilutes it.<br>
<br>it is something to consider then, when a national dish or symbolic [sig=
n] are corrupted or subverted -- say the main ingredient in hotdish of a gi=
ven culture is being poisoned somehow as part of a hidden agenda. or that a=
n apple is so loaded with chemicals and various drugs as to be sickening, y=
et remains a symbol of health (&#39;an apple a day keeps insurance and heal=
thcare in perpetual play&#39;). what if the kielbasa is spiked at the facto=
ry. or the water is loaded with unfiltered psychiatric run-off and windshie=
ld wiper fluid. or mothers breasts transit Zoloft to newborns. at what poin=
t of disjuncture may these dynamics be considered corrupt in their pre-exis=
ting interpretations and requiring of new evaluations to get at what has ch=
anged and what is going on behind the curtain of hidden, secret state and i=
ts antihuman agenda. how can an appearance remain unchecked which has been =
subverted so that it stands against itself as its own [anti-sign]. yet this=
 a=3Db condition becomes an issue of allegiance and ideological alliance, a=
s if litmus to separate the canaries into the psychiatric system while funn=
eling the rest into the awaiting cattle chutes. silent, passive, easily con=
trolled, compliant, ready to be led to their demise while helping the proce=
ss along and getting paid for it.<br>
<br>what are the security issues involved and secrecy required for such eve=
nts to occur yet be off the cultural and communications radar. where is the=
 feedback or critical evaluation in a larger human context, versus fragment=
ed relativisms that focus here or there in specificities, yet cannot seem t=
o make tangible a standing conspiracy to overtake the world and turn the ea=
rth into a slave prison-planet. <br>
<br>in that sense of civilian world war, it is curious what individuals mig=
ht think about in terms of the stakes involved, life and death scenarios as=
 the situation becomes increasingly clear. what happens when people are set=
 against one another in barbarian-like mindsets and pre-literate and illite=
rate frameworks. might not issues like tattoos become areas of populist con=
tention, where those of differing natures seek to regain the meaning of the=
ir signs, no longer observing boundaries of respect for unlike others, whos=
e tattoos by comparison may be their devaluing, or seek to signify what the=
y really are not- and thus a stand-off could occur in such strange realms. =
or, those with piercings as a security issue, if say there is a sudden appe=
arance of torturers in the population, against the opposition, where having=
 battery hookups on various body parts is inviting such exploitations. woul=
d you walk around in a thunderstorm in a large field with a metal antenna s=
trapped to your head? what about walking around with &#39;security exploits=
&#39; in times of war, inviting the oppositional imagination to consider th=
e worst, given the specifics. <br>
<br>and so too, the increasing primativisation as a cultural trend, whereby=
 ear plugs and flesh tubes seemingly emulate villagers of particular cultur=
al traditions as if a style or extension of a fashion or aesthetic movement=
. the issue involved is also of a potential security exploit- what might so=
meone do with that, against a person, as a weakness or if they relate to it=
 as a threat of profanation of the shared values. and there is nothing to s=
top the stand-off between these people. i cannot help but think of college =
hazing gone wrong, where a U-Lock could easily capture a person against a p=
ole via their earlobes and there could be no way of escape in a given scena=
rio than ripping your own ears open and having flaps from the stretched con=
dition. and yet- there are vast many people who despise these kinds of tran=
sgressions, in cultural terms, for signifying a devolving culture. what if =
such aesthetic choices are security choices. what if they could lead to oth=
er interactions eventually in a changing context, and the &#39;shared aware=
ness&#39; is simply the result of an absence of error-correction for the gr=
oup, and that such a group may have limits on some issues, which could alig=
n with certain principles. <br>
<br>in that, it is highly likely many are in these contexts and require ada=
ptation to cultural dynamics, and so may be self-aware about the deeper div=
isions this may involve in &#39;shared awareness&#39; in terms of aesthetic=
s, or as aesthetics divide groups and individuals from one another. as if a=
 stage play and costumes for different characters and their roles. and that=
 this must be acknowledged. and yet so too there could be ideology involved=
, beliefs that could be fundamentally false or wicked or antihuman even, as=
sociated with similar signage and associated or related practices, given th=
e particular individuals and groups so aligned. and in this way, like a fre=
eway sign or marker offering direction, these iconic [signs] and the observ=
ational processing of symbols establishes certain relations and is involved=
 in establishing and maintaining specific limits, boundaries, and rites.<br=
>
<br>the rock-opera film Quadrophenia is an interesting contrast between the=
 aesthetics of mods on vespa scooters and leather-clad rockers on motorcycl=
es in the UK 1960s. the contrast between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones=
 likewise, in some way. it involves aesthetic communications and symbolic l=
anguage of artifacts, actions, and ideas, cultural practices that can event=
ually run in parallel or even against one another, say if biker gangs go to=
 war over territory. graffiti or [signs] can be part of this infrastructure=
 of hidden communication that may otherwise be missed by those outside the =
shared boundary or framework of interrelational awareness.<br>
<br>so an issue such as hairstyles, such as the mohawk from the punk era, v=
ersus in the present day, where it may be a different sign, potentially of =
conformance if the spirit of rebellion is only shallow, versus visceral cha=
llenging of order. and as language, how this may relate historically to ear=
lier eras, peoples, and ideas. that there is depth to signs and symbolism, =
and thus literacy involves awareness and the ability and capacity to read a=
nd interpret these events in their depth, or to the depth available. and th=
us experience or knowledge can help in observation. <br>
<br>in other words, there could be authentic signs and symbols, retaining a=
n integrity and others that are mimicking this, emulating, or simulating th=
e [signage] while potentially even standing against its depth, as an anti-s=
ign, camouflage or label wearing, as status symbols or markers, these relat=
ions hollowed out of meaning and made superficial yet still potentially fun=
ctioning and treated as if originals and not copies of copies which devolve=
 via noise, and dissolve into greater falsity. what is a sign that only ref=
erences itself? or self-aware self-referencing. what if to some extent it i=
s a form of advertisement, marketing, instead of ideas it is about consumer=
ism, for instance, replacing cultural depth with its commodification as a r=
esult of increasing development of illiteracy in a context of mass populism=
. such that the TV extra or stand-in or &quot;bit part&quot; becomes a kind=
 of vocation, just like a person can decide to become a heroine user and ma=
ke a living as an addict, because the clinics and programs need them to jus=
tify their own existence and thus a lifestyle can be sustained by various c=
hoices, say versus another line of work. such as focusing on human problems=
 beyond the self and making huge sacrifices on behalf of the group, and tak=
ing beating after beating in doing so. maybe it is an issue of broken peopl=
e again, yet at some point there is also a choice and again a boundary issu=
e- a critical moment, and making the wrong choices distinguishes one group =
from another, and it is proposed The Moment of Truth is this demarcation.<b=
r>
<br>whose to say that if a government falls and functions in its worst vice=
s against its own citizens, that those on the inside of its internal organi=
zation are also not the same group protected in corrupt society - such that=
 surveillers and those going after people, setting them up or gathering evi=
dence to take them down, are not themselves the pedophile networks and chil=
d abusers and misogynists who most benefit from this devolved condition, se=
emingly of a shared political agenda even. and so what if the [signs] are n=
ot accurate for what may actually be involved or the network of signs are n=
ot allowed to be established or referenced for shared navigation because th=
is territory is already encrypted and under control, via these same hidden =
and hostile forces, operating beyond the existing boundaries. what if there=
 is a plague or epidemic of moral collapse that is the rotten core of the r=
ogue state and its antihuman agenda and that at its center is a concentrate=
d network that is organized around principles against citizens, education, =
law, freedom, human development, family, marriage, nature, as part of a con=
spiracy. and yet this very situation could also have been devised as a trap=
, with a dual plan that both allows for this maldevelopment in order to ann=
ihilate it within society, and thus complex and contradictory cryptography =
also exists in this same context.<br>
<br>--- further note on aesthetics ---<br><br>regarding issues of individua=
l style, the film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, released in the past few years=
, was an interesting evaluation of the dress of those whose business it is =
to operate in the realm of secrets and national security issues. it is almo=
st that dress is occurs thoroughly at the midpoint range, in an ambiguous r=
ealm that is neither completely common nor singularly identifiably unique. =
and thus blending into a surrounding population, nondescript perhaps, not s=
tanding out as a benefit for those moving between realms amongst others of =
different domains. <br>
<br>what is interesting is that there is value to camouflage yet also the p=
otential for small details, that establish identity in a minimal or traditi=
onal framework than needing to establish this as extreme individualism or g=
roup activity, though that likely has its place equally so, given different=
 context. though it would appear an issue connected with identity and share=
d or unshared awareness, if the focus is on maintaining costuming or being =
removed of its additional requirements. perhaps for some the tradeoff is ne=
cessary or critical, yet for others it could be that their anonymity is par=
t of their security and safety protocol. as a [sign] they may become ambigu=
ous and unnoticed in a particular context, in that their extreme sport is b=
loodsport and yet no one may be the wiser of such activity.<br>
<br>another film, The Company (2007) with Michael Keaton as the head of a m=
ole-hunting counterintelligence unit, an orchid lover known as &quot;mother=
&quot;, conveys this symbolic dimension likewise in a larger symbolic frame=
work that cultural communication inherently exists within, as the context f=
or shared meaning via language. and thus if [signs] are mediated in this wa=
y as a way of conveying stories, why would they be limited in this same dep=
th in a realm of computation involving such [signs], unless of course this =
is not the case and other approaches exist within crypto.<br>
<br>this has been a futile attempt to reference the [signage] of self as si=
gnifying a certain algorithm reading by others, in a surrounding culture, a=
s the boundary for shared or unshared awareness. it may be a haircut, a sui=
t, color or style of clothing, shoes, tattoos or body piercings, though at =
some point these are patterns that are matched against others, such that a =
&#39;hacker&#39; is represented by a particular style or school of thought,=
 and defined aesthetically. or programmer, or covert operative, or cryptogr=
apher, or technocrat, or artist, or activist.<br>
<br>and there seems to be a corrolaly here, potentially, between these same=
 issues of superficial crypto where a BIG SIGN is put up saying: HERE IS TH=
E HIDDEN SECRET!!! and so sometimes a style can develop that begins to repr=
esent a hacker, say, with stickers all over their laptop, and the ability t=
o run scripts and vandalize and steal passwords, and yet they may be operat=
ing in a different realm from those of the 60s onward, who are part of a di=
fferent language, and &#39;hacking&#39; could have become a popular group a=
ctivity, normalized, not radicalized in the same way, in that it is thoroug=
hly profitable and aligned with policies of development say, and so the &#3=
9;alternative may have become the mainstream&#39; yet view itself as standi=
ng apart in some critical way, which is signified by ritual practices, conf=
erences, clothing or hairstyles or music, etc. an anthropological study pro=
bably would be needed of the subculture versus a naive guess at what may be=
 involved. excepting that &#39;popular signs&#39; of hacking appear to coin=
cide with existing politics, where exploitation of other citizens may be oc=
curring by script kiddies and others who are benefiting from this societal =
breakdown, versus goals of a higher purpose that may remain in the undergro=
und, and those who are not craving to be up on stage.<br>
<br>it is just that, a particular shallowness and hollowness to certain dis=
ciplines appears to exist - including with other realms such as architectur=
e concerned with increasing heights of skyscrapers versus questioning, chan=
ging, or challenging city planning principles to address economic, social, =
or governance issues within building design - and yet in this superficialit=
y, the [architect] is equated with those who before them did explore these =
dimensions and served higher principles that today seem absent in the devel=
opment process, as if culture itself has been subverted, hacked, rooted, ta=
ken over and sent in another antihuman direction. and so someone may stand-=
in as an [architect] and look the iconic part, yet serve other principles a=
nd effectively function in masquerade, hiding another agenda.<br>
<br>and so in a &#39;landscape of difference&#39;, of wildly diverging styl=
es as if freedoms of people to be who they really are, conglomerate around =
computer monitors and there is a class of programmers who can manipulate co=
mputers and develop software and maintain systems -- and yet the gap is onl=
y widening at the same time these same types are playing foosball or raving=
 with friends and eating expensive food, while operating in a realm potenti=
ally associated with &#39;hackers&#39; or those who are standing-in for an =
idea that tended towards human liberation via technology, and not its confi=
nement, whereby these same technologists in their lifestyles and their styl=
istic code of hair, jewelry, clothing, and tribal customs appear to actuall=
y represent the [anti-sign] of the previous hacking ethos in its larger pur=
pose and calling. such as the potential of the internet, versus monetizatio=
n. as if the very idea and imagination of this online context has collapsed=
 into a trapdoor beneath center stage, where advertisement and marketing ru=
le everything in a no-exist dungeon scenario, and these of simulated radica=
lism and emulated individualism are actually ~Garden of Earthly Delights mi=
nions, an occupying force that is developing an antihuman agenda via hardwa=
re and software as an unchecked business model, with no greater expectation=
 of individuals in their capacity.<br>
<br>so a [sign] can look like something or have appearance or claim to be e=
quivalent to some defined meaning, and this may be pattern matched even -ag=
ainst itself-, and yet if it does not correlate or ground to a larger conte=
xt of truth this same &#39;naming&#39; could be superficial or subverted, a=
nd instead be [anti-sign] instead, whereby pseudo-truth moves to falsity in=
 an unshared perspective, beyond the protected boundary where skew and dist=
ortion, bias and warping are unaccounted for and allow belief to function a=
s truth, a bubbled interior realm, potentially that of unchecked egotism an=
d narcissism in place of substance of the claimed signs. in this way, issue=
s of language-- it confuses what the sign references with the sign (its att=
ributes) itself, as if wearing the costume equates with the role, acting ve=
rsus being. knowing versus pretending or mimicking to some extent or anothe=
r. it is like comparing a programmer who knows 50 computer languages and ha=
s designed their own, versus someone who has done some C++ and can run malw=
are scripts and do bug exploits, where both reference the same [sign], in a=
 context of shared truth. and if this is unaccounted for, then a vast bubbl=
e culture may exist, which is then extended into code, as an illusion is su=
stained about the basic nature of things, technological, ideological, insti=
tutional, computational, philosophical, though most especially political. t=
he power dynamics operating in these domains and the active high-voltage st=
ructural circuits relied upon for day-to-day operation of this exploitation=
, versus other parallel plans remaining hidden. the potential for the great=
er truth, discharging the covert super-capacitors in each discipline as the=
 motherboard of state rewires and reprograms its territory. <br>
<br>--- trading the paperclip ---<br><br>an artifact can function as langua=
ge. its relation to its context is important, as this establishes or change=
s meaning. an item can be placed in a museum and the way it is observed can=
 be transformed, such as Duchamp and the Fountain urinal, signed by the art=
ist, thus recontextualizing it, establishing a new context, meaning, way of=
 relating and interpreting the artifact within new dimensionality. (reframi=
ng)<br>
<br>a particular artifact i find especially interesting is the ACCO Ideal b=
utterfly paper clamp, it is an innovative, functional, highly aesthetic sty=
le of paperclip that has always reminded me of electric transmission towers=
. those giant metal armatures crossing continental landscapes, carrying the=
 AC powerlines that deliver high voltage power from its area of generation =
to its areas of consumption. in many ways representative of the federal lev=
el of the state in its civic quality. thus there is a potential transferenc=
e of the icon of the transmission tower into the smaller scaled context of =
a similarity or likeness in a type of paperclip, which may or may not be re=
cognized by an observer who readily uses the artifact.=C2=A0 <br>
<br>and this is to suggest that, like a business card or a calling card, su=
ch an artifact could function as a token in its symbolism, if valued, and a=
lso as [signage] that is recontextualized by its surroundings. in other wor=
ds, it could function as a cryptographic key potentially, or shared key, or=
 cipher system, depending on whether or not these encounters with &#39;netw=
orks of power&#39; are noticed by an observer who can relate to their meani=
ng, or who is bounded in awareness.<br>
<br>in other words, the paperclip can have a kind of currency, both as a ma=
terial object and &quot;informationally&quot; as a form or basis for data e=
xchange, of ideas, as it relates to shared awareness or as a basis for comm=
unications. and this could and does occur already with other artifacts in t=
he realm of symbolic communication that as a practice is perhaps best zoned=
 in paracrypto relations, non-verbal, rich with meaning, adept in language,=
 yet likely unnoticed by those outside its limits.<br>
<br>so there is a famous instance of a paperclip as money, where a single p=
aperclip is exchanged and the person eventually ends up with a 2-story farm=
house...<br><br>One Red Paperclip <br><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wi=
ki/One_red_paperclip">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip</a><br=

<br>this is not the same idea, though it gets at the current involved in tr=
ansactions around a common object in terms of shared value and exchange. ye=
t this can occur informationally, where the paperclip instead is a symbol o=
r sign of language, and can establish communication and transmit ideas, pot=
entially. and thus transfer data or awareness or provide insight. it is lik=
e a silver bullet placed at a crime scene as this relates to its perpetrato=
r. or an assassin who puts pennies on the eyes of their victim. yet also no=
t of this same deathly realm necessarily, it could instead belong to a real=
m of networking or connection between peoples or indicate certain parameter=
s which may or may not be valid, given its source. so such an artifact coul=
d be used for communication and carry insight in its use and application, w=
hereas a mimic or subverter may attempt the same yet it could be hollow or =
shallow or misleading, and in a sense, &#39;collapse the wave that carries =
the signal&#39;, thus indicating an ungrounded relation or compromised inst=
ance.<br>
<br>in this way, the paperclip of ordinary design can represent this tradea=
bility as language, by its use as exampled in the url above. and yet in ano=
ther mundane environment it may be just like another penny on the ground, s=
o infinitesimal that it is beyond notice, as if worthless and subconscious =
unless needed for use.<br>
<br>and yet another style of paperclip, the butterfly paper clamp, has a sy=
mbolism that goes beyond itself as an icon and maps into another structure =
(electric transmissions pylons) and in some sense can represent these as la=
nguage, and in a sense, symbolic currency even. in that to share the artifa=
ct could function both by itself as a symbol, though also in a context of s=
urrounding environment that may function in and reference an embedded conte=
xt, as a [sign] in relation to other [signs], and this is how sentences or =
more in-depth meaning can be formed beyond the singular event of &#39;the s=
ymbol&#39; (pylon!) and into statements involving or extending its meaning,=
 to some threshold of what is possible to communicate in an abstract realm,=
 given surrounding structures and frameworks of an observer.<br>
<br>in this way an errant paperclip or other symbol strangely located in a =
context could call attention to itself through its uniqueness or out-of-pla=
ceness, and in questioning its existence, strange or covert communication c=
ould take place in hidden channels of awareness, beyond the boundary of oth=
ers. and in this way, who placed the paperclip or how it got there could re=
main a mystery, it could even involve a hidden hand with root access to est=
ablish such scenarios, and this can be a way that crypto-communciations occ=
ur in what can be a paranormal realm, as statistically unlikely events stac=
k up one after another and establish an entire universe of non-verbal commu=
nication via symbols and signs, in precisely this way.<br>
<br>there is magic involved, and this connectivity transcends the limits of=
 computers and hardware and software devices and is primary in establishing=
 human relations, and advancing shared awareness via referencing truth with=
in empirical frameworks, using fundamental principles and concepts of langu=
age, via this hidden calculus.<br>
<br>this is the same idea involved in transmuting the word &#39;cipher&#39;=
 into &#39;cigar&#39;, it is of a similar process of the actualization of t=
hese concepts in the everyday environment as an artifact functions as a cry=
ptographic key or message yet may remain unnoticed in these dimensions by o=
thers. <br>
<br>it is proposed that this Strange Read/Reply Function (SRF) could be a w=
ay of annotating such extra-dimensionality via reinterpretation, misreading=
, errors, mistakes, misunderstandings, or other mutations of meaning that r=
econtextualize yet expand or alter the original condition and perhaps provi=
de additional insight or bring into question its meaning, via this d=C5=BDt=
ournement. optimized plagiary or [recoding] or [overcoding] or a way of acc=
essing subtext via another method of deconstruction. thus opening up interp=
retation of the text beyond the limit of its referenced [sign] to its poten=
tial or range of [signage], so to evaluate ideas and allow relations beyond=
 the preconceived boundaries, to access hidden dimensions embedded within t=
he deep structure of the code, its intersign armature. in this way at the i=
ntersection or juncture of architecture and archaeology, past and future me=
eting in the present. do observers relate, and in what structures, framewor=
ks, dynamics. what is the potential, the boundary, the limit. how to access=
 the greater truth of N-dimensionality, the nonlinear in linear context. an=
d thus a conceptual tool to potentially reassign the sign to say more about=
 it, as this may relate to sets and multisets as parallel, co-existing comp=
utations. perspectives or frames that potentially have a lot to offer tradi=
tional views, such that the ephemera and errata could be critical in establ=
ishing grounding where the assumptions of normative practices related to si=
gn-based communication (as linear calculation) and correct interpretation m=
ay make it off limits, by default of being wrong or breaking rules of gramm=
ar and-or syntax, versus to acknowledge and allow the potential for meaning=
 where it exists, unearthed.<br>
<br>--- on randomness ---<br><br>it has not adequately been conveyed that a=
rtists and artworks can be expert at this signaling and data exchange via s=
ymbolic communication. and this extends into the entire ecosystem of galler=
ists and museums and auctioning of paintings during critical periods, where=
 for instance The Scream will suddenly dominate the global news cycle -- th=
is becomes a form of widely distributed communication -- not only in terms =
of &#39;selling the paperclip&#39; and instead the other parallel aspect of=
 using this artifact as a shared reference, a world line by which other dyn=
amics may be aligned or effected by its force fields. including art heists =
likewise. or newly discovered painting, such as the recent Van Gogh paintin=
g of a pot farm.<br>
<br>previously introduced to the ideas of John Cage regarding his use of th=
e I Ching to generate randomness, i was unable to appreciate its value as a=
 way to mediate questions of architecture instead of engaging social issues=
 within design ideas. and i probably am still too limited to understand its=
 actual relevance in that domain. and yet in a context of cryptography this=
 same technique could seemingly allow another RNG approach and thus is ment=
ioned here for those it may interest.<br>
