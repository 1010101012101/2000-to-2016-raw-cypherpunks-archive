The Russians?  Bwah hah hah.  Yeah, they (and the French, and the Krauts)
can get all the Saddam-faced bills they want.  Can you spell default?
I knew you could. 

Still, 32 years at current prices, perhaps, but in 30 years the price
of oil will have risen.  And also, the financial biz has no problem
with 30 year ROI, see the home-mortgage industry.

Besides, after we hang the Saudis, and liberate Venezuala (sp), the USG 
will be able to set
the price of oil for the US-external market.  Ka-ching.
