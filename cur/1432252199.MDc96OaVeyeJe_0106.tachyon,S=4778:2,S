Subject: Re: [INFO] Keep tuned: Script-Kiddie and ilk against Frog

On 28 Mar 2001 15:05:28 -0000, Frog-Admin threw some more dry wood on
his funeral pyre when he wrote:

>There is more from "Erwan David" <Erwan.David@teaser.fr> ,

(No doubt some innocent schmuck who made the mistake of sending to
Frog/Frog2 without chaining first.)

>who belongs to my "short list" of people I suspect to be
>the single or collective entity called "Script-Kiddie"

Why fret over TLAs,folks? We have our own internal law enforcement:
Sheriff Frog-Admin.

>HISTORY
>"Erwan David" has a long history of terrorizing newbies,
>bullying them on NG for whatever reason.
>He has a passion to contact abuse departments and try to shut down accounts.
>He also likes to propagate false information,
>  like Frog stopping last Summer because I was bankrupt.
>He is very exactly the ilk I was thinking of when I wrote my policy,
>and *explicitly* excluded remailer-haters from the benefit of privacy.

Disgraceful.

Frog-Admin protects only himself. He has a resolute intolerance of
unpopular speech. He cannot tolerate the very thing a remailer is
meant to protect!

In contrast, I urge you to read the words of a trustworthy and
honorable remop, Randseed Admin Len Sassaman:
http://lexx.shinn.net/pipermail/remops/2001-March/000962.html

Frog-Admin, Your arrogance will be your downfall. I take comfort in
knowing that.

Saddle
(who now will be added to Frog-Admin's "short-list"
if I'm not on it already)
