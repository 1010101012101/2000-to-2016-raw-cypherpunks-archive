We're being more fundamental and will achieve better and more modular
results because of it.

The protocol has a different aim than XMPP.

Concentrated pessimism? Why not both? Just make an XMPP bridge. Facebook
does that, Google might be doing that (or proprietary extensions), who
doesn't?

Why didn't XMPP do that? What do you mean widely used? IRC is widely used.
XMPP is not normally used with the user knowing it is XMPP. It's under the
hood technology.

Which is because of a lack of "polymorphic protocols".

Nobody ever said it will be efficient. But aside from that, there's scale
to worry about. You're also missing how people usually send data in binary
to hotmail or gmail, then they perform whatever voodoo they perform. So,
actually, most people send their e-mail attachments in binary.

The rest would probably really want to, but nobody is making the standard
any better. Why would they? They can do whatever they want without worrying
about compatibility because they own so much market share. A new standard
may have been used inside and between the mayor e-mail providers, would you
know?

There is no masses using XMPP. Masses of coders, maybe, and they will use
the best tool for the job.

All the extensions have succeeded in making any XMPP app lacking in
usability. I sure haven't found any nice XMPP clients, nice enough to
compare with native clients.

In fact I'm willing to bet everyone in the western world uses FB, Google
chat and MSN (slackers and slowpokes). They all have limited XMPP
implementations, they native clients do more. And there's no good app for
interacting with XMPP.

Pidgin really isn't good, it's just the only one out there. And it is still
in the MSN era. I've switched to Office 2013 from Libre/OpenOffice and it
really is in a different league all together. And it sucks that it is. But
what can we do?
