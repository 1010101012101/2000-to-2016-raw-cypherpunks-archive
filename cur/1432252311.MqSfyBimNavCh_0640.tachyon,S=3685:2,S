Look, I was discussing the meaning of "need" and pointlessness of attaching
moral qualifications to that.

But I'll have to oink to be understood. Prayers to the Godess of Semantics
didn't help.

Do you have any idea how much it costs to get a decent escort ? Between $750
and $2500 for the night. At $1500 average, once per week comes to $78K per
year, and that is not tax-deductible. State-sponsored whores are cheaper.

No, I am NOT taking offers on competitive services.

Most people are perfectly happy to go through the motions. And they are not
asking to be saved.

You are again disbursing qualifications on the false assumption that anyone
shares common grounds with you. And you are even not consistent, since here you
seem to favour conformity. 'Some people' are 'better off', no shit ? Who gets
to decide what is destructive ? The majority, you imply.

You are a bigot.
