John, this is hardly worth mentioning and looks just like a smoke cloud
to divert attention from the good old echeloning.

Why a smoke cloud ? Because this lawless monitoring can be "rectified",
banished, and then everything will be OK, right ?

Make no mistake, usg has been sucking *all* the bits from MAE{west,east,*}
for years. The only thing they may need now is justification for collected
information. Decoys a la carnivore and what not.
