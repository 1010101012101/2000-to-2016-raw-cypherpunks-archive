I tend to agree...  I don't think "zero-configuration" networking has
a real possibility to create any safety zones beyond the immediate
physical machine.  After all, if you can plug it into any network and
it just works, you can plug it into an insecure or subverted network
and it'll just work.

At the very least you've got to have a file of keys.
