"...libertarian vs. socialist .."From Tims epistle to the faithful.9-11 
certainly shook a few authoritarians out of the woodpile in both the 
libertarian and the socialist scenes.Nasty stuff.
What happened to libertarian socialist? An R.Crumb cartoon for the 
noughties,"Im a libertarian socialist!"

Assassination Politics
Convicted tax evader Jim Bell proposes a system of anonymous ecash awards 
for the murder of "aggressors", such as IRS agents. See also Crypto-Convict 
Won't Recant. What he misses is that his system, if tolerated, would merely 
force government to operate secretly rather than openly.
They can do that?
