There ain't any, at least in the US.

When I first setup SSZ on the net I spoke to a couple of lawyers about
'records retention' and system operation with respect to potential future 
prosecution. It had more to do with customer litigation than something
like cpunks, but after (peripheraly) going through the SJG thing why take
chances?

Bottom line, there ain't none, so I don't keep none. The fact that one of
these reasons is so that I'm not collecting potential evidence for my
prosecution is not condeming nor is it relevant in and of itself to future
prosecutions.
