Yes, I'm squeamish about the word k*lling due to that USA USA 
thing, the citizen k*lling Act and the official-patriotic k*llings 
raging overseas and vengeful biowar retribution starting at 
home.

K*lling mobs k*ll for insane reasons. So I'm doing my best not to 
offend itchy fingers unnecessarily, especially not yours Tim. 

Trash talk their beliefs, sure, but not at a time when murder is 
officially sanctioned and payback passion arising.

Sir, I say, to those who yearn to k*ll.

So?
