Hehehe, no, but that is a funny thought!  I can use my fuzzy text to
exclude robots from a site, but maybe I should also include a little
IQ test to exclude inferior minds.  That is a very good idea.  I'll
try to write up a little server that does that.

Here in my yurt in Antartica, obviously, I don't have a basement, and,
following energy-saving sugestions on this list, I am heating the
place with inner infolded electromagnetic free energy vacuum motors,
and oh boy, if you don't adjust the thermostat right on those things,
it can get pretty hot in here!  Someone open a window!  Oh wait, yurts
don't have windows.  Let's see, if I were writing the SAT analogy
test, I would put:

Inner infolded electromagnetic free energy :: Dilithium crystals as

a) Cold fusion :: Heisenburg compensator

b) Splitfire sparkplugs :: Female condom

c) Thighmaster :: Tiger penis virility pills

d) Miracle grow :: Miracle whip

e) French :: Greek

That's right, the SAT is a Scholastic Aptitude Test, and is not by any
means a cross-cultural IQ test.  You need a certain IQ to do well in
college, but good work habits, concentration and a good memory may be
more important.  I am currently working on a phd here at Antarctica U.
