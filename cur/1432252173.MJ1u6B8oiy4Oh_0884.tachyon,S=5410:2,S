Tim - you have to understand that Esther is trying to remain relevant in a
world that increasingly sees her as last years meat rack.  Ester knowns
me, in fact she spent most of her last trip to Cairo trying to convence
lawyers that I should be sued for something.  She blames me for scaring
off president Mubarak from the ICANN show.  The woman is unfortunately
paranoid and suffers from persecution dementia.

Someday someone may wright a comedy on the lady, I consider it more
tragedy.  I think Ester would of been happier in life being a common
housewife - or dominatrix.  Unfortunately she was born into the Dyson clan
and as a result has always been pushed to excell.  But that has not been
the case.  On a technological front she is all show - no substance.

And that show started early in life.  She herself can confirm that her
schooling at harvard was for no other purpose then socialization.  I think
meeting the right people was her angle for attendance.

I understand her venture capital positions have mainly failed, her
chairmanship of ICANN has been an absolute disaster.  She's being disposed
as the chair this november - that does not mean ICANN will be a better
place - just less blond.  She's not a blond you know - but she certainly
has disposition of one.

But alas Tim - I like her.  I think she's sexy in her own special way.  Ol
gals ya know have some of the softtest skin ;-)
