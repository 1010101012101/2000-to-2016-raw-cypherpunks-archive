I know I am not alone in this. If you read Slashdot regularly, you'll see a 
recurring theme in the arguments made by Linux proponents: While Linux is 
more complex than some other operating systems, it provides a great deal of 
power and customizability. Many Linux users, including me, actually take 
pride in the ability to use the system.
While I have had some good experiences with operating systems that are more 
conventionally intuitive, the operating systems that present the greatest 
challenge intrigue me the most. And the payoff is a great deal of 
satisfaction in the ability to fine tune and customize the interface and 
the work environment.
Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) operating systems are a different story 
altogether. While I typically detest the company's innovation strategies, I 
have actually, in some deranged way, found a certain measure of fulfillment 
in being able to accomplish difficult tasks on Windows.

Each new crash or system glitch presents new challenges, new routes to 
explore, new techniques to learn. Because I have a tendency to fetishsize 
the tool -- whether it be a new development tool, an operating system or 
even a new graphics card -- my means to the computing end is often just as 
pleasurable for me as the end itself.
