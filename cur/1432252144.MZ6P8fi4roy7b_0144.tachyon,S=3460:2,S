			 Although ChoicePoint says it has records
                     on nearly every American with a credit card,
                     it doesn’t always provide access to that data.
                     The company’s Autotrack service is popular
                     with many agencies and businesses and is
                     also used by reporters at The Wall Street
                     Journal. But entering the name of FBI
                     Director Louis Freeh into the Autotrack
                     database produces an error message. A
                     company spokesman says ChoicePoint
                     intentionally blocks Mr. Freeh’s records as
                     an act of good corporate citizenship.
