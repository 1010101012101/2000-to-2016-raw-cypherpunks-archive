: i'm curious how you use them.  care to share?
: 
: my two main uses for the C5P systems are loop-aes w/padlock and key
: scrubbing for file storage and IPsec endpoints.

I use them for pretty much the same thing: IPSec endpoints, entropy, and
Freenet (though that only really benefits from the entropy, IIRC).  I have
to admit, I don't make much use of the AES stuff on a daily basis.

: wow, i didn't think these were going to be ready till Q3.  did they

EPIA-N8000E, EPIA-NL8000E, and EPIA-NL10000:

    <http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/nano_itx/epia_nl/index.jsp>

They're running somewhere around USD$300/per.

If you're looking at them, where does the 'Luke CoreFusion processor' fit
in?  I remember them saying they'd be using Luke in the C7, but I'm hesitant
to believe the C7 is already viable.

(Actually, something else I'd like to see: A C7 with >4 on-board NICs, or a
full-size ATX C7.  They make great little routers.)

: yeah, i've been lusting after a dual proc board since they were
: revealed back in Q2 '04.  perhaps the market just isn't there?  other
: products announced later have made it into production before these SMP
: boards...

VIA has a reputation for taking their time to bring products to market,
after they've been announced.  I'd love to be a fly on their walls to see
just what the holdup is.

: i'm wondering if the Balance systems will be updated with a C7 when

Geez, I had no idea!

Hopefully, as there's a C7 line dedicated to mobile computing, someone will
pick these up.  If not, it's back to the drawing board to make a home-brew
laptop (assuming the chips -- and ideally even a DP configuration --
actually show up on the market).
