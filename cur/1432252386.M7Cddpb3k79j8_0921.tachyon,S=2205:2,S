When Walker announced SF's EOL he mentioned lack of successor developers
capable
of filling his shoes.
Since then, unsurprisingly http://sourceforge.net/projects/speak-freely-u
only shows one developer, namely, John Walker.

SF is small enough to fit into an embedded Linux firewall (some
of which have DynDNS clients embedded, e.g. Allnet's), and can
be trivially patched to use gpg to set up session keys. The NAT
traversal does not occur in the NAT device itself, obviously. Maybe
somebody here has connections to hardware manufacturers who would
be able to add a POTS jack to a firewall, and produces worthwhile
quantities.

Sounds like a business plan that might work.
