Most of those now posting (and maybe most of those subscribed, but I am 
only speculating) are various eurotrash lefties and anti-globalist 
activists who decided that "crypto is cool" after their anti-corporate, 
anti-choice rallies in Seattle, Milano, and other cities shut down by 
the Yippie marches and barricades. I assume they figured that since 
they were using PGP to communicate with their fellow anti-capitalists, 
that crypto must be cool (I'm not sure if they favor the negro term, 
"bad," or the traditional term, "good," so I'll use the term of my 
generation, "cool.")

Are they confused? Yep.

Welcome to the Gen X and Gen Y (and soon) the Gen Z world. Crypto be 
bad, dog! This nigga be bouncin'!

I'm actually glad to see that Cypherpunks nodes are winding down, that 
we no longer have monthly meetings, and that the Movement is ending. 
Better that than to see it hijacked by the eurotrash lefties, New York 
collectivists, and anti-globalist warriors against free trade.
