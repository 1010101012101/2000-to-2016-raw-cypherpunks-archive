	Oh, OK. So I don't need to bother with patently false theories.
	Because that's what 'absurd' implies.

	I don't follow. I don't think absurd ideas are 'fascinating'.
	And at any rate it should be obvious that absurd ideas have no
	place in rational discourse, or 'science'.

	A sensible remark, if you take out the god bullshit. And as I
	think you know, there are many so called 'interpretations' of
	QM and not all of them are absurd (i.e. patently false).

	So says one faction of the 'scientific' establishment. Just like
	statists say that the state is legitimate.

	It can't be infinite, but it certainly can be faster than
	light. So somebody actually did the measurements?

	If you know that 'something' was transmitted, then al least one
	bit of information was transmitted, no? 

	Again, either information is being transmitted at FTL speed or
	not. So, what is being claimed here?

	And if at least one bit can be transmitted, then I wouldn't be
	surprised if more than one bit could be sent too.
