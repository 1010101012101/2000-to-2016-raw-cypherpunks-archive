this gets to the more actual situation with ideological short-circuiting
of mass surveillance: the search for terrorists comparable to the hunt
for Bigfoot, Yetis, Nessie in the collective, Chupacabra and others

how much is the data dragnet comparable to evaluating populations
in these fuzzy terms, as if any aberration or anomaly will snap-to-fit
in some framework of illegality to be used for biased prosecutions

how much of the technology infrastructure functions as a toy versus
tool, allowing wild theories to be explored and mapped onto citizenry,
everyone a suspect, an unidentified type that hovers around categories
due to demographics, statistics or other affiliations, awaiting exploits

in other words- the hunt for terrorists is like a hunt for cryptid beings,
yet in the total surveillance, instead of the pinpointing and tracking
of such, it appears the entire society is held within this mindframe,
everyone a threat to someone who is surveilling behind the curtain,
credit ratings, coupon users, shoppers who return faulty goods,
people requesting warranty service - as if cheaters and stealers

in that- instead of many distributed spotters saying they located
an anomaly in the northwest sector, this spotting and informing
instead is ubiquitous, a flurry of such calculations of potential
and known infractions, from someones warped self-interest view
not accounting for the larger balanced evaluation, hidden tallying

for awhile now have considered how a Bigfoot would exist in the
surveillance society, especially urban areas, such as those who
try to drop-out of change identities - how far could you get with
biometrics or facial recognition and forged documents until the
alarms start activating and you are tracked and then cornered

yet what if this is every single person, potentially, given the one-
way politics involved, the oppressive aim of domination of those
hidden and beyond public accountability as they hold the public
to account in terms they do not recognize or themselves obey

in this way, a population of bigfoots, a hidden network of those
spotting, tracking, and surveilling, the short-circuiting of this as
if in the public interest and involving democratic aims of citizens,
instead a massive setup, ungrounded interpretations giving way
to orchestration of near-term centralization of dictatorial power,
feedback loop somewhere outside of representation anymore

what if the cryptid ID is the Dictator running the works behind
all this, and requires other spotters and tracking to corner the
illegal activities that continue, despite all the tools available,
seemingly used instead for playpen antics first and foremost,
in that babbel allows this situation to remain undocumented
in its conceptual terms and actual dimensions of existence
