Just wait until MS unleashes a brood of lobbyists when nobody buys the new 
Palladium-ed operating systems.

State control is one thing. State control that will do absolutely nothing is 
another. This cat's already out of the bag. As far as I'm concerned, the 
coming collapse of the music industry will be one of the few convincing 
pieces of evidence that God exists.
