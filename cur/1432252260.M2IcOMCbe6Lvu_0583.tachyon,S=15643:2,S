Computer hunt for terrorists
October 2, 2003
By Charles Piller and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Times Staff Writers


A secret computer program detected something suspicious about the
middle-aged passenger heading to Eugene, Ore.

He traveled often, usually taking one-way flights on short notice. In
the months following the Sept. 11 attacks, every time he tried to board
a flight in Portland, he was pulled out of line and searched as a
possible terrorist threat.







The passenger was Peter A. DeFazio  congressman from Oregon, former Air
Force officer and ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee overseeing
airline security.

"My constituents found it very amusing," DeFazio said.

It soon became less humorous when he learned he could stop triggering
the security checks by simply joining a frequent flier program, a trick
that in the computer's mind transformed him from a suspect into a
trusted customer.

"A terrorist can't figure that out?" DeFazio asked.

Since the Sept. 11 attacks, creating an effective system to screen out
both known terrorists and would-be hijackers  plotters with spotless
records but nefarious intent  from millions of airline passengers has
become a top priority in the war against terrorism.

But as DeFazio's experience showed, even the most elaborate current
computer systems stumble when trying to decipher human motivations, and,
like any security scheme, have been perpetually vulnerable to being
gamed.

In the face of such challenges, the federal government has embarked on a
costly program to create a second-generation profiling system designed
to verify the identity of every passenger and analyze their lives
through a "black box" of government intelligence and law enforcement
databases. Though details of the system are secret, security experts
believe that more than 100 factors will be used to sniff out terrorists
based on telephone records, travel patterns, law enforcement files and
other sources.

The system will turn the new federal Transportation Security
Administration into one of the most intrusive government agencies,
perhaps second only to the Internal Revenue Service  investigating
about 70 million passengers who take 675 million trips by air annually.

And possibly, all for an illusion of security.

"The U.S. is so much oriented toward a technology [solution] that the
people are serving the technology," said Offer Einav, former director of
security for Israel's national airline, El Al, widely considered the
world's most secure carrier. Like other aviation security experts, he
views computer profiling as beneficial only if paired with seasoned
security officials who exercise common sense and conduct their own
psychological assessments of passengers  not part of the U.S. program.

"They are dealing with enemies who are human beings. Human beings will
always beat the technology," Einav said.

Mixed Success

No computer-based system has ever verifiably thwarted a hijacking or
bombing, according to federal and private security experts. But given
the enormousness of the task, the airline industry's current system 
the Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening system, or CAPPS  has
occasionally shown flashes of brilliance.

Its greatest success may have been on Sept. 11, 2001. In the 24 hours
leading up to the hijackings, CAPPS would have checked more than 1.8
million passengers. It actually flagged six of the 19 terrorists later
involved in the hijackings, according to the national commission on the
Sept. 11 attacks. About 92,000 innocent travelers were also singled out.

Unfortunately, only a brief luggage check for explosives and weapons was
required. The hijackers  and the then-legal box cutters several were
carrying  were all welcomed aboard their flights.

CAPPS was deployed in 1998, following the crash of TWA Flight 800 off
Long Island two years earlier. It was part of a package of
anti-terrorism measures put in place  including baggage X-rays and
bomb-sniffing dogs  even though mechanical failure was later blamed for
the crash.

The system largely relies on government watch lists and passenger travel
histories. It provides a relatively rudimentary check that the industry
designed as a compromise between maintaining efficiency in boarding
passengers and finding possible terrorists, said consultant Douglas
Laird, former security director for Northwest Airlines, who helped
develop CAPPS.

Laird praised CAPPS for targeting nearly a third of the Sept. 11
hijackers. "What failed on 9/11 was the follow-up," he said.

After the events of Sept. 11 exposed CAPPS' weaknesses, the airlines and
the government tried to compensate by hedging their bets  flagging 15%
to 20% of travelers  an estimated 370,000 per day  for hand luggage
searches and extra security checks. That is an increase from 5% in 2001,
according to the TSA.

But casting such a wide net can overwhelm the system, resulting in long
delays at the airport. The government believes the best way to increase
security and efficiency is to create a more advanced computer system.

CAPPS II, an upgrade expected to cost more than $105 million, is
designed to transform a few simple database searches into an omniscient
eye on terrorism. The TSA, which will operate the system, plans to
introduce it next year. "I don't think there is a single project that
will do more potential good for aviation security," said Adm. James M.
Loy, head of the TSA. CAPPS II will have "an astonishing capability" to
trace would-be terrorists, even if they lead apparently unremarkable
lives, he added.

In addition to checking travel records, CAPPS II would require each
passenger to provide his name, birth date, home address and phone number
when making a reservation. Commercial database companies would check the
information against billions of public records and issue an identity
rating, handicapping the likelihood that the passenger is lying and
judging how "rooted" the person is in a community, rating such factors
as local family connections and the amount of time in the same home.

The government would then check the information against national
security and law enforcement watch lists of more than 100,000 suspects.
It would mine CIA, FBI and other intelligence databases to pluck the
rare unknown terrorist from an ocean of innocents with a kind of
technological mind-reading.

The government estimates that no more than 4% of passengers  about
74,000 people a day  would be rated "unknown risk/yellow light" by
CAPPS II and get closer screening, such as shoe checks and physical
searches of carry-on items.

An average of only one or two people per day would be rated "high
risk/red light" and be barred from flying or even arrested.

Those are the theoretical projections. Reality could be far different.

"Systems that involve wholesale surveillance of innocents tend not to
work," said Bruce Schneier, a leading cryptographer and chief technical
officer of Counterpane Internet Security, a cyber-security firm. "It's
not feasible to catch the bad guys without also catching too many good
guys."

Innocent Victim

Consider the experience of Joe Adams of Cottage Grove, Minn., an
unassuming, 71-year-old scholar of British literature, who travels for
pleasure and his part-time job grading college entrance exams.

Adams was flagged by CAPPS more than a dozen times between April 2002
and this August. At first he was perplexed, then frustrated and finally
angered at being treated like a national security threat for up to two
hours every time he flew.

Adams eventually learned the reason: His name, like hundreds of other
Joe Adamses nationwide, resembled an alias of an alleged Al Qaeda
operative.

"I appreciate what they are trying to do security-wise," Adams said.
"What I don't appreciate is what they are trying to do to someone like
me," someone improbably old for such a mission. "I could be [a
terrorist's] grandpa."

Adams' problem eventually disappeared without explanation. Many others
simply put up with such treatment. Calls to seven random Joseph Adamses
around the country turned up five who fly regularly and share the
literature scholar's plight.

One Massachusetts grandmother of 12, whose husband is named Joseph
Adams, was told by an airport screener that she was flagged as not just
a regular security risk, but a high security risk.

By design, computer profiling systems flag millions of people for such
common reasons as moving often, visiting the Middle East or being
unlucky enough to share a name with someone on the watch list. The
result is an enormous error rate that can overwhelm screeners.

At the same time, the systems are necessarily blinded from considering
some factors. For example, ethnic, religious or racial designations are
excluded from today's CAPPS and CAPPS II to avoid discrimination.

Linking those factors to terrorism may be an application of crude
stereotypes, but from a security standpoint, barring such identifiers
doesn't make sense, Einav said.

"As far as I remember, none of the Al Qaeda members was a citizen of the
state of Switzerland or was a Catholic priest," Einav said.
"Unfortunately, cells of Al Qaeda are existing in Islamic states."

The Sept. 11 terrorists understood that a successful hijacking depended
on exploiting precisely these types of holes in the computer profiling
system.

In the months leading up to the attacks, they tried several dry runs to
see if their efforts to remain invisible to the security system had paid
off, according to the joint House-Senate intelligence report on the
attacks, issued last December.

"Transparency is the Achilles' heel" of CAPPS, letting attackers
"reverse engineer" the system, wrote Samidh Chakrabarti and Aaron
Strauss, students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University, whose computer science class paper raised eyebrows
in the airline industry last year.

Passengers know where they stand  whether they have been placed in a
separate line, interrogated or searched.

Chakrabarti and Strauss concluded that if a terrorist made six trial
flights and got the green light every time, that person could
confidently assume that he or she would not be stopped by the system on
a real hijack mission.

Schneier suggested an even simpler approach.

"You want a good identity? Steal it," he said. A recent report from the
Federal Trade Commission found that 27 million Americans have been
victimized by this type of fraud in the last five years.

MIT professor Arnold Barnett, a consultant to the government on aviation
safety and security issues, said no computer program is immune to such
methods.

"The belief that penetrating people's minds is the key to stopping
airline terror could be an illusion that, if taken seriously, might
someday be shattered at great cost," he wrote in an upcoming article in
the journal Risk Analysis. "In the worst-case scenario, [CAPPS II] could
be reminiscent of the Maginot line."

The TSA's Loy said his agency can foil the terrorists' efforts. "We will
be counter-gaming the gaming," he said.

One way to do that is to conduct random security checks, which flag
passengers regardless of their threat rating.

Random checks were increased after the Sept. 11 attacks, but proved
endlessly irritating to the millions of innocent travelers who resent
security guards rummaging through their underwear and other personal
effects. They have since been "radically" reduced, and would remain at
current levels under CAPPS II, Loy said.

CAPPS II would also constantly update its data and adjust its analysis
to keep terrorists off balance, Loy said.

But Stanford University computer scientist Jeffrey D. Ullman said that
building a prescient computer system capable of seeing through simple
human ruses would require an effort comparable to the Manhattan Project
during World War II to build the atomic bomb.

Short of that unlikely prospect, the other option is to engulf ever
greater amounts of data in hopes of bolstering the computer system.

Privacy Concerns

In its initial plan, the government proposed keeping CAPPS II dossiers
of air travelers on file for 50 years, but the idea was dropped after a
public outcry.

Privacy advocates still worry that, as with any large database, there is
an inevitable tendency to use the information for more and more
purposes. Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge, for example, has already
approved the use of CAPPS II to identify fugitives wanted for violent
crimes.

Even before the deployment of CAPPS II, a major data-security lapse has
jolted the traveling public. JetBlue Airways Corp. admitted recently
that in a deliberate violation of its own rules, it had secretly
delivered detailed passenger data to a military contractor working on a
separate airline security project. Outraged customers have filed suit
against the company, and the Homeland Security Department has initiated
an investigation.

The TSA acknowledged that some mishaps involving accuracy and disclosure
of CAPPS II data are inevitable. The agency will have a passenger
advocate and appeals process, but has yet to spell out what rights
passengers will have. Congress has asked the General Accounting Office
to investigate if CAPPS II can identify suspicious travelers without
trampling the rights of innocents; lawmakers are awaiting the GAO's
verdict before approving deployment of the system.

"We here at the Department of Homeland Security are also citizens, and
we are also very concerned about our rights, about our privacy and about
our civil liberties," said Nuala O'Connor Kelly, the department's chief
privacy officer.

But privacy advocates say that because CAPPS II information would be
classified, travelers would never be certain why they were flagged. It's
a Catch-22 that would present enormous challenges for clearing their
names  and an enormous temptation for misuse, said David Sobel, general
counsel of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"People are going to want to know, 'Why am I pulled aside every time I
take a flight?' " he said. "The answer is going to be, 'Sorry, we can't
tell you.' "
