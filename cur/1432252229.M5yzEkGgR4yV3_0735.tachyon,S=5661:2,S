  OpenSSL version 0.9.8 Beta 6 (FINAL!)
  =====================================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The sixth beta is now
  released.  The beta release is available for download via HTTP and
  FTP from the following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you
  can find under http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  PLEASE TEST THIS RELEASE!  This is a final beta.  The final release
  is due very soon, and we would like your help to make this as good a
  release as ever possible.  Among others, base64 decoding needs extra
  attention (see below).

  The file names of the beta are:

    o openssl-0.9.8-beta6.tar.gz
      MD5 checksum: e6771df5621169ae616adb3475aac71a
      SHA1 checksum: d5aad452a4a192780ff1990b5c75513eb8408fe2

  The checksums were calculated using the following command:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.8-beta6.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 < openssl-0.9.8-beta6.tar.gz

  Please download and test them as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL
  version incorporates 104 documented changes and bugfixes to the
  toolkit (for a complete list see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES
  and http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/NEWS).

  Since the fifth beta, the following has happened:

    - Change the DJGPP setup so it's DEVRANDOM is defined in e_os.h
      instead of in the build command line.
    - Worked around a DJGPP command line bug during installation of
      docs.
    - Worked out better target selections for BSD ELF.
    - Corrected the CPUid code for x86_64.
    - Made the base64 decoder a bit more robust.
    - We made sure crypto/bn/bn_prime.h is properly built during an
      update.
    - Enhanced the documentation on id_function in threads.pod.
    - Added a fallback to software in the CSwift engine.
    - Other bug fixes...

  Reports and patches should be sent to openssl-bugs@openssl.org.
  Discussions around the development of OpenSSL should be sent to
  openssl-dev@openssl.org.  Anything else should go to
  openssl-users@openssl.org.

  The best way, at least on Unix, to create a report is to do the
  following after configuration:

      make report

  That will do a few basic checks of the compiler and bc, then build
  and run the tests.  The result will appear on screen and in the file
  "testlog".  Please read the report before sending it to us.  There
  may be problems that we can't solve for you, like missing programs.

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team...
