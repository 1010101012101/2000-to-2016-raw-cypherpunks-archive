 That is because Loom is a generic site, and there is nothing special
 about "loom gold" or any other asset type, except for usage tokens.

 I trust you enough to discuss that with you.

 Yes, someone has verified that, though it happened over a year ago.  You
 and I can discuss that too.

 I recommend that you only use asset types issued by people you trust,
 for example yourself and perhaps some close associates.  If you choose
 to use an asset type issued by someone you do not fully trust, you
 should discount its value accordingly to account for the risk.

 Moreover, if you do not trust a particular Loom server, do not use it.
 Use a different one, or run one of your own.  If you choose to use a
 Loom server run by someone you do not fully trust, you should discount
 the value of any assets hosted on that server to account for the risk.
