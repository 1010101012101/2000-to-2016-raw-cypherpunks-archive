Ah! There's a reason stronger than "because they can." Yes, I recognize
that the overhead is minimal, etc., etc. But without some compelling
reason (making it partitionable for resale, making it harder to disrupt,
etc.) I would not expect the botnet controllers to introduce another area
of possible failure -- one that not only increases CPU time, but
bandwidth, and makes maintaining and upgrading the code and compatibility
between instances more difficult.

I'm not sure that this *does* make it harder to disrupt the botnet,
though, does it? Does anyone have example traffic dumps of these encrypted
payloads? It should be possible to identify and block this traffic; it's
going to follow some unique pattern.
