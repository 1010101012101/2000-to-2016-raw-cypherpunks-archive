We offer an HTML version of the Carnivore technical 
review report released yesterday by DoJ (without appendices):

   http://cryptome.org/carnivore.rev.htm  (164KB text, 8 images)

The original PDF report is 9.4MB, 121 pages. 

One notable conclusion about Carnivore's shortcomings
and why its code should not be released to the public:

  Carnivore can be countered with simple, public-domain 
  encryption.

But it can snarf everything done by a targeted Web user, 
e-mail, FTP, HTTP, and you name it.
