How do you figure? If I could lie about my age, seems to me I could lie
about just about anything else, with the possible exception of sex. If I
were going for a commission, or got roped into a high-security program
that required background investigation, then I would need better
backstopping than just a set of lies on an enlistment form, but as a
plain old grunt nobody need ever know my name was NOT Michael J.
McGillicuddy.
