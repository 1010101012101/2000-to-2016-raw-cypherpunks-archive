Not even _close_ to being true.

Yes, there are many people. "Too many" is an esthetic judgment. The 
water coming off of the Sierras is more than enough for twice the 
current population, providing they all don't try to have large green 
grass yards (cf. xeriscaping).

The market solution for water, as it is for power, computers, 
frisbees, and anything else, is to let the market price goods. If 
someone wants to pay $3000 a year to keep their lawn green, their 
choice.

As for food production, food is fungible and is shipped where markets 
want it. Vastly more food, of certain types, is grown in the Central 
Valley, and in the Salinas Valley (near me), than is consumed locally.

California houses have almost _never_ had basements. Check it out. 
Check the history of houses built throughout the state, going back a 
century or more.

The main "reason" for basements is to put a foundation below the 
frost line. Mainly for structural reasons: a house built on top of 
the heave line is subject to thermal heave, cracking the foundation. 
(Houses can of course be built without basements or partial basements 
even in cold climes, via careful sinking of foundations. But digging 
out to below the frost line and then building on top of that was the 
most common approach.)

John Young, as an architect, can no doubt say more about why 
basements are common in cold climes but much less common in temperate 
climes.

(I lived in coasta France, on the Riviera, for a year. Virtually no 
houses had basements. Ditto for Italy. Ditto for Greece. Move north, 
however, and houses start to be built with basements.)

By the way, most of the 34 million current California residents live 
in the coastal strip, from San Diego to LA to Santa Barbara to San 
Luis Obispo to San Jose to San Francisco and the other Bay Area 
cities. Most of them don't use air conditioning.

(I lived for 5 years in San Diego--no A/C. Lived for 4 years in Santa 
Barbara--no A/C. Lived for 12 years in Santa Clara--A/C in one of my 
apartments, which I only used half a dozen times. Lived in Santa Cruz 
for 14 years--no A/C.)

My siblings live in California: no A/C. I can't think of a single 
person I know who has air conditioning...they may exist,  I just 
can't think of who they might be.

Earth to Ray: Adobe and other thick-walled structures are 
"deprecated," as the current lingo would have it. I'll let you figure 
out why.

Do you simply invent this stuff?

Cypherpunks has become a dumping ground for half-baked social theorists.
