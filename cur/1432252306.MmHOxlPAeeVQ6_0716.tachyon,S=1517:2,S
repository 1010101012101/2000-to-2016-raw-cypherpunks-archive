    Most people will be coded green and sail through. But up to 8
percent of passengers who board the nation's 26,000 daily flights will
be coded "yellow" and will undergo additional screening at the
checkpoint, according to people familiar with the program. An estimated
1 to 2 percent will be labeled "red" and will be prohibited from
boarding. These passengers also will face police questioning and may be
arrested.
