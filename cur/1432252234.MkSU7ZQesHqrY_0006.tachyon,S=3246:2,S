Or, simply have a remailer client that randomly generates dummy traffic, 
and be sure to chain through multiple remailers. You don't need to accept 
incoming remailer traffic from other live people -- this is sufficient to 
hide when, if ever, you are using the remailer network.

You still stick out as a remailer user, though. 

(A while ago, someone posted a physics question usnig a remailer, and Tim 
mused that they were probably a troll, since they were using a remailer to 
pose this question. I found that remark surprising, for precisely this 
reason. Everyone should use remailers from time to time to ask innocent 
questions, in case of being asked by The Authorities to provide an example 
of one's correspondence using such technology.)
