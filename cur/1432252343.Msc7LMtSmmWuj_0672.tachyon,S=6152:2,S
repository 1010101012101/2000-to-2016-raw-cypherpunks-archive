ISRAEL VOTES TO BAN BROADCAST PORN
TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli lawmakers have voted to ban the broadcasting of 
pornography, almost a year after they voted to black out specially 
designated sex channels.
Infringement of the new law, which is to take effect in 30 days, can result 
in as many as three years' imprisonment.
An amendment to the July 2001 Communications Law introduced by 
ultra-Orthodox legislators outlawed such sex channels as Playboy, Spice and 
the locally produced Blue, which were introduced by satellite broadcaster 
YES when it launched broadcasts in 2000.
The channels were so popular that cable rivals Golden Channels, Tevel and 
Matav followed suit. Cable operators, who were forced to remove the adult 
channels beginning in September, exploited a loophole to offer sex content 
on an expanded pay-per-view basis instead. The law passed late Tuesday 
closes that loophole.
An amendment was rejected that would have permitted erotic broadcasts if 
devices like smart cards were used to prevent minors from watching. About 
50% of subscribers to YES and digital cable channels order adult content, 
and the cable industry claims that removing such material will cost it 
about $50 million annually.
And if you live in the US of A,LISTEN UP!
"Just know that there are some mean, evil motherfuckers running the country 
right now where if we don't go out and vote, they're really going to fuck 
us up. So get out there in November and show them that we're going to stay."
Tom Byron, getting out the vote.
