The NRC is very prestigious. It is part of the even more prestigious
National Academies, which includes the Nataional Academy of Sciences,
the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.

It's not really the NRC's fault; Congress made them do it in a
recently-enacted law. NRC staffers are trying to make the most of it
(though quitting is also an option). The real story here is the risks
of having a government-funded "science" center tasked with
"investigating" political issues like Net porn. Private research
institutions don't have the same problem.

I found it in a used bookstore yesterday on 18th st NW. Maybe I can
offload mine there too.
