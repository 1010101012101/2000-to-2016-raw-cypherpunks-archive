It also takes some intelligence to write clearly and concisely.  "So what?"
in either case.  If you're PERSONAL preference is intellectual obscurantism,
more power to you.  But the Cypherpunks list is about getting things done
more than it's about cutesy vanity.

I'm a wordsmith by trade.  People pay me to put words in a row.  When you
can get that sort of real-world praise for your writing, then I might be
more inclined to listen to your whining.

And perhaps you are just projecting.  The audience I was talking about is
the Cypherpunks list--a long way from "complete idiots."  I relish
beautiful, expressive language.  That's not the same thing as intentionally,
self-indulgent, narcissistic obfuscation.  You seem to be stuck in some
elitist artsy-fartsy mode where the more rococo and Byzantine the language,
the more you praise it.

Why thank you!  (Just ONE of my areas of expertise, of course.)

Now you can go back to playing with yourself, which I understand is YOUR
expertise.  :-D
