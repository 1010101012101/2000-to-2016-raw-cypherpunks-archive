Reading back over my collection of cypherpunk list mail from 1994, I came 
across this in a message from Tim May:


"(I don't often dwell on [the benefits of crypto-anarchy] on this list,
partly because I already have in the past, and in the "Crypto-Anarchist
Manifesto" and other rants at the soda.berkeley.edu archive site, and
partly because the Cypherpunks list is somewhat apolitical...apolitical in
the sense that we have libertarians, anarcho-syndicalists,
anarcho-capitalists, Neo-Pagans, Christian Fundamentalists, and maybe even
a few unreconstructed Communists on the List, and espousing some
particular set of beliefs is discouraged by common agreement.)

Ah, how things have changed.
