This is simple.

There is a HUGE unknown about the actual number of remailer users. Many otherwise intelligent discussions hinge on this number being small or big.

Unreliable as it will be, could you please provide an estimate of monthly number of human-generated messages that enter your system (excluding those from other remailers.)
