We run the main MTA for my university this way (of course it will relay
without authentication if the client source address is within the
university IP ranges), using sendmail and cyrus-sasl.  It's my impression
that many US universities are starting to do this.  We started it as a
one-off MTA handling submission of mail for travelers, then realized that
the regular MTA could just provide this service.  It also does Kerberos
authentication, which I use (though not many MUAs support it).

The obvious port is 587, the "submission" port (see RFC 2476), which in
fact is the one that MUAs "should" use, rather than 25 (we support it, I'm
submitting this mail using it, via my home ISP).  Of course if it actually
becomes popular those misguided ISPs will block it too ...
