I realize I'm somewhat naive in that I expect things to make sense,
but isn't this just utterly nuts?  I mean,  imagine an LEO gets an
anonymous tip saying.  "I broke into this guy's house and found
child porn there".  Check out the house and,  sure enough,  the 
window has been broken into,  and right by the broken window
is a pile of child porn.  Wouldn't ANY sensible person conclude that
more likely than not it was planted there?

By the way,  has this JD lawyer ever READ the constitution?
The 4th clearly states and I quote "no Warrants shall issue,  but
upon probable cause SUPPORTED BY OATH OR AFFIRMATION".
(emphasis mine).  Clearly computer generated spam
doesn't meet this criterion.
