And if we do nothing, we are also blamed for making things 
worse:  Observe, for example

1.  the French assist the Hutus to commit genocide against the 
Tutsis.  Capitalism and America get blamed.

2. The Indonesians massacre infidels.  Capitalism, Americans 
and America get blamed.

3.  Saddam massacres his people.  The CIA, Americans and 
America get blamed.

4.  Syria invades Lebanon.  America and Israel get blamed.

5.  Africans massacre each other in the Congo.  America gets 
blamed.  (Oddly, for once, the CIA, capitalism, and Jews, are 
not involved.)

The dogs bark and the caravan moves on.

They would like that also.  Fortunately all the oil is Kurds, 
or Shiites - the first areas to be secured once the civil war 
burns down a bit.

But it is easy and cheap to remove people.  It is installing 
people that is hard, bloody, and expensive.

If the dice turn out badly, just roll them again.

Nobody teaches soldiers nation building in basic training. They
do however, teach them nation smashing.
