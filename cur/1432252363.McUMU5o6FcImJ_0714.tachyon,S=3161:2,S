      [...]

Each time a more sensitive detector is discoverd, it's used  by
disk manufacturers to increase storage density. The tracks get finer,
the bits and the magnetic forces they generate smaller. I expect this at 
least partially cancels out the advantage that a more sensitive detector 
gives the spy.

Of course, some sensitive techniques (SQUIDs, etal) are not economic for
casual use.
