Looks like an AgitProp writer in training. Guess he's looking for feedback 
to hone his skills.

Hey! Glad to hear everything's going so well over there. You would never 
have known watching the US media and mounting casualty numbers. Sounds like 
you boys have things locked down tight over there. Keep up the good work! I 
know I'll be asking my local congressman to give the big thumbs up to more 
support over there.

>common over there and even torso hits cant be reliably counted on to put
>the enemy down. Fun fact: Random autopsies on dead insurgents shows a
>high level of opiate use.
>
>2) The M243 SAW (squad assault weapon): .223 cal. Drum fed light machine
>gun. Big thumbs down. Universally considered a piece of ****. Chronic
>jamming problems, most of which require partial disassembly. (that fun
>in the middle of a firefight).
>
>3) The M9 Beretta 9mm: Mixed bag. Good gun, performs well in desert
>environment; but they all hate the 9mm cartridge. The use of handguns
>for self-defense is actually fairly common. Same old story on the 9mm:
>Bad guys hit multiple times and still in the fight.
>
>4) Mossberg 12ga. Military shotgun: Works well, used frequently for
>clearing houses to good effect.
>
>5) The M240 Machine Gun: 7.62 Nato (.308) cal. belt fed machine gun,
>developed to replace the old M-60 (what a beautiful weapon that was!!).
>Thumbs up. Accurate, reliable, and the 7.62 round puts em down.
>Originally developed as a vehicle mounted weapon, more and more are
>being dismounted and taken into the field by infantry. The 7.62 round
>chews up the structure over there.
>
>6) The M2 .50 cal heavy machine gun: Thumbs way, way up. Ma deuce is
>still worth her considerable weight in gold. The ultimate fight stopper,
>puts their dicks in the dirt every time. The most coveted weapon
>in-theater.
>
>7) The .45 pistol: Thumbs up. Still the best pistol round out there.
>Everybody authorized to carry a sidearm is trying to get their hands on
>one. With few exceptions, can reliably be expected to put em down with a
>torso hit. The special ops guys (who are doing most of the pistol work)
>use the HK military model and supposedly love it. The old government
>model .45s are being re-issued en masse.
>
>8) The M-14: Thumbs up. They are being re-issued in bulk, mostly in a
>modified version to special ops guys. Modifications include lightweight
>Kevlar stocks and low power red dot or ACOG sights. Very reliable in the
>sandy environment, and they love the 7.62 round.
>
>9) The Barrett .50 cal sniper rifle: Thumbs way up. Spectacular range
>and accuracy and hits like a freight train. Used frequently to take out
>vehicle suicide bombers ( we actually stop a lot of them) and barricaded
>enemy. Definitely here to stay.
>
>10) The M24 sniper rifle: Thumbs up. Mostly in .308 but some in 300 win
>mag. Heavily modified Remington 700s. Great performance. Snipers have
>been used heavily to great effect. Rumor has it that a marine sniper on
>his third tour in Anbar province has actually exceeded Carlos Hathcocks
>record for confirmed kills with OVER 100.
>
>11) The new body armor: Thumbs up. Relatively light at approx. 6 lbs.
>and can reliably be expected to soak up small shrapnel and even will
>stop an AK-47 round. The bad news: Hot as **** to wear, almost
>unbearable in the summer heat (which averages over 120 degrees). Also,
>the enemy now goes for head shots whenever possible. All the bull****
>about the old body armor making our guys vulnerable to the IEDs was a
>non-starter. The IED explosions are enormous and body armor doesn't make
>any difference at all in most cases.
>
>12) Night Vision and Infrared Equipment: Thumbs way up. Spectacular
>performance. Our guys see in the dark and own the night, period. Very
>little enemy action after evening prayers. More and more enemy being
>whacked at night during movement by our hunter-killer teams. Weve all
>seen the videos.
>
>13) Lights: Thumbs up. Most of the weapon mounted and personal lights
>are Surefires, and the troops love em. Invaluable for night urban
>operations. Jordan carried a $34 Surefire G2 on a neck lanyard and loved
>it.
>
>I cant help but notice that most of the good fighting weapons and
>ordnance are 50 or more years old!!!!!!!!! With all our technology, its
>the WWII and Vietnam era weapons that everybody wants!!!! The infantry
>fighting is frequent, up close and brutal. No quarter is given or shown.
>
>Bad guy weapons:
>
>1) Mostly AK47s . The entire country is an arsenal. Works better in the
>desert than the M16 and the .308 Russian round kills reliably. PKM belt
>fed light machine guns are also common and effective. Luckily, the enemy
>mostly shoots like ****. Undisciplined spray and pray type fire.
>However, they are seeing more and more precision weapons, especially
>sniper rifles. (Iran, again) Fun fact: Captured enemy have apparently
>marveled at the marksmanship of our guys and how hard they fight. They
>are apparently told in Jihad school that the Americans rely solely on
>technology, and can be easily beaten in close quarters combat for their
>lack of toughness. Lets just say they know better now.
>
>2) The RPG: Probably the infantry weapon most feared by our guys.
>Simple, reliable and as common as dog****. The enemy responded to our
>up-armored humvees by aiming at the windshields, often at point blank
>range. Still killing a lot of our guys.
>
>3) The IED: The biggest killer of all. Can be anything from old Soviet
>anti-armor mines to jury rigged artillery shells. A lot found in Jordans
>area were in abandoned cars. The enemy would take 2 or 3 155mm artillery
>shells and wire them together. Most were detonated by cell phone, and
>the explosions are enormous. You're not safe in any vehicle, even an M1
>tank. Driving is by far the most dangerous thing our guys do over there.
>Lately, they are much more sophisticated shape charges (Iranian)
>specifically designed to penetrate armor. Fact: Most of the ready made
>IEDs are supplied by Iran, who is also providing terrorists (Hezbollah
>types) to train the insurgents in their use and tactics. Thats why the
>attacks have been so deadly lately. Their concealment methods are
>ingenious, the latest being shape charges in Styrofoam containers spray
>painted to look like the cinderblocks that litter all Iraqi roads. We
>find about 40% before they detonate, and the bomb disposal guys are
>unsung heroes of this war.
>
>4) Mortars and rockets: Very prevalent. The soviet era 122mm rockets
>(with an 18km range) are becoming more prevalent. One of Jordans NCOs
>lost a leg to one. These weapons cause a lot of damage inside the wire.
>Jordans base was hit almost daily his entire time there by mortar and
>rocket fire, often at night to disrupt sleep patterns and cause fatigue
>(It did). More of a psychological weapon than anything else. The enemy
>mortar teams would jump out of vehicles, fire a few rounds, and then
>haul ass in a matter of seconds.
>
>5) Bad guy technology: Simple yet effective. Most communication is by
>cell and satellite phones, and also by email on laptops. They use
>handheld GPS units for navigation and Google earth for overhead views of
>our positions. Their weapons are good, if not fancy, and prevalent.
>Their explosives and bomb technology is TOP OF THE LINE. Night vision is
>rare. They are very careless with their equipment and the captured GPS
>units and laptops are treasure troves of Intel when captured.
>
>Bad Guy Tactics:
>
>When they are engaged on an infantry level they get their asses kicked
>every time. Brave, but stupid. Suicidal Banzai-type charges were very
>common earlier in the war and still occur. They will literally sacrifice
>8-10 man teams in suicide squads by sending them screaming and firing
>Aks and RPGs directly at our bases just to probe the defenses. They get
>mowed down like grass every time. ( see the M2 and M240 above). Jordans
>base was hit like this often. When engaged, they have a tendency to flee
>to the same building, probably for what they think will be a glorious
>last stand. Instead, we call in air and thats the end of that more often
>than not. These hole-ups are referred to as Alpha Whiskey Romeos (Allahs
>Waiting Room). We have the laser guided ground-air thing down to a
>science. The fast movers, mostly Marine F-18s, are taking an ever
>increasing toll on the enemy. When caught out in the open, the
>helicopter gunships and AC-130 Spectre gunships cut them to ribbons with
>cannon and rocket fire, especially at night. Interestingly, artillery is
>hardly used at all. Fun fact: The enemy death toll is supposedly between
>45-50 thousand. That is why were seeing less and less infantry attacks
>and more IED, suicide bomber ****. The new strategy is simple:
>attrition.
>
>The insurgent tactic most frustrating is their use of civilian
>non-combatants as cover. They know we do all we can to avoid civilian
>casualties and therefore schools, hospitals and (especially) Mosques are
>locations where they meet, stage for attacks, cache weapons and ammo and
>flee to when engaged. They have absolutely no regard whatsoever for
>civilian casualties. They will terrorize locals and murder without
>hesitation anyone believed to be sympathetic to the Americans or the new
>Iraqi govt. Kidnapping of family members (especially children) is common
>to influence people they are trying to influence but cant reach, such as
>local govt. officials, clerics, tribal leaders, etc.).
>
>The first thing our guys are told is don't get captured. They know that
>if captured they will be tortured and beheaded on the internet. Zarqawi
>openly offers bounties for anyone who brings him a live American
