Plain BS. Please quote one Austrian school economist that agrees with you.

You're simply insane. You have no right to someone else's products. It's HIS
products, and he's free to refuse to sell them to you, or to only want to
sell them on HIS terms. Anything else means he's your slave.

More BS. By what contract do they have this responsibility?
