Sure, people will have computers. However, if we merrily slide down the
slippery slope the authentication might move into the network layer
eventually. You will be on the network, yet you will be not on the
network. 

One might be able to fab computers at small scale (FPGA, organic
transistors via inkjet, whatever), but it will be tough to create global
networks using just overlapping patches of wireless. Especially, if rogue
wireless will be rather illegal.
