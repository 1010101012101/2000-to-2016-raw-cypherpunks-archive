Prove identity to surf net in Bangalore

Press Trust of India
Bangalore, November 15

Internet surfers in over 50,000 cyber cafis across Karnataka now need to
show an identity proof before browsing the web. With an aim to prevent
misuse of the Internet by criminals, the state government has made it
mandatory for all such cafes to have a record of net users, failing which
the police can impound their licenses.

"We are introducing this law to check anti-social elements and
anti-national activities. Internet is a great medium for communication, but
people can also carry out a lot of such (illegal) activities through it,"
state IT secretary K.N. Shankaralinge Gowda told here.

According to the new norms, a surfer needs to display his/her identity card
at the cyber cafi or be photographed by a web camera by the attendant
before logging on.
