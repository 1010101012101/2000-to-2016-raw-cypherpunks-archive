Rhizome doesn't route. It just floods, one hop at a time. Though now
that we have a rhizome transport built on MDP it would be possible to
transfer content directly over a number of hops.

Just because we have a novel tool doesn't make it a good fit for every
problem. Just because you have a good hammer, doesn't make every
problem a nail.
