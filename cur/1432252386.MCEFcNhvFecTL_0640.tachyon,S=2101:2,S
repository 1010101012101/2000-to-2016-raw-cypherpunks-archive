That depends on quality of the passphrase; it makes dictionary attacks
easier.

No.  The protection of the private key is is independent of the key.
They are in no way related.  The key is based on a random string and
only the protection of this key is based on the passphrase.  This
protection only helps against a lost (but protected) private key.
