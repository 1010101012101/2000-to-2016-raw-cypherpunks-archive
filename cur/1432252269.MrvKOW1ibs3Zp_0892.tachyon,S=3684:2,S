Sorry I didn't see the other responses, who pointed out the same 
things I pointed out, basically. I was away for a couple of days and 
was catching up on a lot of mail.

I'm just amazed that "New Scientist" or anyone else would not know 
that making paper transparent is trivial. I may take their "What if 
atoms don't actually exist?" sorts of cover stories (quantum 
weirdness, stuff from nothingness, etc.) less seriously.

It wasn't "snide shit."

Reread what I wrote.

But, since you are apparently so willing to be offended, and have 
more than several times brought up some notion that we have some sort 
of truce, let me disabuse you of this by saying "Fuck off."
