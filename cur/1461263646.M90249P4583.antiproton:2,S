What Juan said (minus the Satoshi nonsense). ZeroHedge are notorious gold
bugs. There's no freakin' way China is going to give up its ability to
manipulate exchange rates to promote whatever level of exports its central
planners think its businesses need. They are acquiring gold only in order
to diversify their reserves away from dollars, to reduce their dependency
on the United States in case the shit hits the fan in the Pacific. Making
the RMB "gold-backed" would mean letting people exchange it for the
government's gold, exactly counter to their goals.
