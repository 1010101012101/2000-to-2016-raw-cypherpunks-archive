The New York Times carried a detailed article about the case on August 
12, 2003.  There are many more articles in major sources like it.

As I understand it, the jury found that Kuglin was not criminally 
liable for tax evasion because the IRS ignored her letters asking what 
law required her to pay her taxes.  In the absence of any response, the 
jury found that she had acted reasonably and in good faith.  She was 
not a tax evader beyond a reasonable doubt.

She may still be found civilly liable when the IRS sues her for the 
money.  If I'm not mistaken, that requires only a preponderance of the 
evidence.
