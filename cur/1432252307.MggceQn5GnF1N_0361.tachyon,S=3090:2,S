Lincoln's fundamental law of nations?

*sigh*.  I'm personally of the opinion that the total amount of 
damage the human race has been able to do to itself as a percentage 
of the population has remained essentially constant.  Let me rephrase 
that... The total amount of damage the human race is doing to itself 
as a percentage of the population has remained constant.  Any 
increase in destructive potential has been met with a commensurate 
increase in population and a decline in our willingness to use those 
tools.  We may be able to kill millions today but 10,000 years ago 
that wasn't much less than the world population.
