Muslim behind bars, despite a judge's order

A Turkish Muslim from White Plains, N.Y., held in a New Jersey jail
for more than two weeks, remains behind bars, despite a judge's
order that he be released.

Atila Kula, a 27-year-old former computer student, was picked up
by the FBI on Nov. 20, and questioned about the September 11
terrorist attacks.

Kula's lawyer Kerry Bretz insists his client has no knowledge of the
incidents. Bretz, who is based in New York, says Kula was likely
singled out when the Immigration and Naturalization Service
conducted a review of soon-to-expire student visas. Kula finished
classes at Baruch College on October 17.

Unlike other foreign nationals detained by the government, Bretz
says, Kula was legally in America. Students are permitted to stay
60 days after classes end.

Kula's wedding--which was to have been December 1--would have
made him eligible for a work permit.

                      This week, in a hearing closed to the public, an
immigration judge
                      ordered Kula immediately released. But when
immigration lawyers
                      said they intended to appeal the decision, the
judge's order was
                      automatically stayed, and Kula was sent back to
jail.

                      Immigration officials say they cannot discuss the
specifics of Kula's
                      case; they will say only that they have not picked
up people
                      randomly and do not appeal cases without good
reason.

                      Russ Bergeron, an INS spokesman, says that
detainees' rights
                      have not been abridged. He also noted that Kula
could get
                      married in jail. Last week, Denise Cordovano,
Kula's fiancee,
                      asked for just such a ceremony. The local sheriff
turned her down.
