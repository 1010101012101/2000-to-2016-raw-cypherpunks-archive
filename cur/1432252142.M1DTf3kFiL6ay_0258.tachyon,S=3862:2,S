Let me be clear about something: I wasn't predicting a significant 
"boycott" against Adobe products. Most corporate purchasers pick 
their tools based on what they need, not based on ideology. If they 
need InDesign or Photoshop, that's what they'll buy.

My comments were about Adobe's _recruiting_ efforts. I expect 
lingering effects of this episode to affect their ability to recruit.

I stand by that prediction.
