	Different government agencies are...just that. Different facets of the
same organization.

	There may be some 'competition' in the sense that they have to somehow
divide the spoils 'fairly', but there's isn't any real competition in a
monolithic criminal organization where all people agree on the core statist
philosophy. Including the fucktards who pretend to be 'libertarians' and
advocate 'limited' murder, I mean, 'government'.

	They are partners. Furthermore, while companies, *in theory* exist only to
serve customers, governments *in theory and practice* exist only to steal,
extort, kidnap, murder, etc.

	no...

	I don't. Politicians and 'business leaders' should be both hanged by their
balls.
