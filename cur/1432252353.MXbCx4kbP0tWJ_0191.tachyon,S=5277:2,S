And they seem to be significantly less efficient in hardware than SHA-2.

Gee, it's almost as if the NSA knows a thing or two about designing and  
implementing hash functions! :-)

Honest question: why should we think they can do it?

Everyone was invited to take part in the SHA-3 competition, and many  
international teams did. In fact, most of the finalists aren't US teams.

Of all the hundreds of entrants there are 5 left. It seems that most were 
weeded out because they were less-that-maximally efficient or had attacks 
on their security.

Beating SHA-2-256 or SHA-2-512/256 is turning out to be harder than anyone 
expected.

No one spends more money on info systems than the US Government. Vendors  
can implement whatever they want in the own (or extensible) protocols, but 
if USG requires SHA-3, it's going to be implemented in gear designed for 
sale in N. America.

Still, China is an increasing market too and their rulers are not afraid  
of "intelligent design". We have them to thank for killing off proprietary 
incompatible cellphone chargers. They simply mandated that all mobiles 
charge via mini-USB.

We may be seeing signs of a fork in data security protocols too.

Alternatively, NIST could say "we've learned so much about hash functions 
over the past few years that we're going to allow designers another round 
of submissions."
