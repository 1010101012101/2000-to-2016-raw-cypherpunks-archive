stop telling me what I'm implying, will you? I'm quite confident that I
know that better than you do.

only if you change the subject, as you did above. all along we've been
talking about "evil". suddenly, in your two examples above, the word
doesn't appear anymore. pointing out a potential danger is NOT the same
as putting a moral label on something.

that's why the "say" is there. it's an example, one possibility, a
counter-point to the ethical argument. it's not all-inclusive.

but the point is that the one point can be settled, the other not. it's
hard to maintain that iron is copper in face of all evidence. it seems
to be very easy to continue believing that "only a dead
indian/jew/arab/american/nip/whatever is a good one" even if the whole
world is convinced otherwise.

if dying for your belief proves you wrong, xianity has been wrong from
the start. (not that I wouldn't agree on that point)

but you're playing bait&switch again. you're moving from evil to wrong
to murderous as it pleases your argument. try to stick to the one term
we're discussing. we can talk about "wrong and right" afterwards, it's
no less interesting, but it IS a different point.

so? I don't understand why you're arguing at length for something that's
never been questioned. the point is that calling this "evil" is a
subjective point and that there is no such thing as "objective evil".

I don't care for right and wrong at this point. I don't care for murder
or not, or for 1 mio., 10 mio. or 50 mio. dead. it's not that I'm
indifferent to those questions, it's just that they simply aren't the
topic.

interesting. I've been labeled nazi in german newsgroups pretty much
immediatly for pointing out a few real factual errors in someone's
argument. maybe the anti-nazi groups over here are much more touchy than
yours.

please not start an argument about "the people of X are so stupid that
we, the enlightened people of Y have to save them from themselves". I
dare to say that permutations of that argument have killed more people
in history than any other reason has.

it's always those who believe they are the good ones who cause the most
evil. feeling yourself divine just pulls out the stops.
