While personal violence is an essential part of operating in a black
market, nonetheless participants tend to think in terms of "people like
me", and people who are trash.  If a deal goes bad with someone who is
trash, one breaks some part of him, or arrange to have it broken.  If a
deal goes bad with someone like oneself, one has a talk with him.  If the
talk is unsatisfactory, one lets it be known he is not really one of us.
