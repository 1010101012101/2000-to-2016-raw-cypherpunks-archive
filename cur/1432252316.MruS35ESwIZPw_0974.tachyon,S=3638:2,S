Due to proliferation of Bitcoin, there are now very efficient SHA-256
generators for off-the-shelf GPUs. The numbers at [1] suggest
performance that's at least two orders of magnitude faster than your
laptop b and for double-SHA-256 instead of a single SHA-1 (which I
assume can be done by the same software after some simple adaptation).

Not necessarily b you can generate the hash first, and then check
whether the public key is legal. I.e., generate a 512-bit prime p, and
then go on with producing a completely random 512-bit e, and checking
whether SHA-1(ASN.1-RSAPublicKey(modulus=p*e, exponent=65537)) (which
is how Tor computes the .onion address) produces the desired result.
If it does, check whether e is prime. Density of primes in the range
of e is ~1/512, so that's just 9 bits more of search space, and
primality checking efficiency doesn't matter much.
