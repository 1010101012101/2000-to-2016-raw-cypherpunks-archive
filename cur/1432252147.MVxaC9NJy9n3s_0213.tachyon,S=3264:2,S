I assume you mean Salvia Divinorum?

I've actually given this one some prior thought, and what worried me was
that the delivery system (some type of water gun) would not likely be
reliable enough to not get the crap all over the user as well as the
target.

And to tell you the truth, in the concentrations you would want to use as
a weapon, you better be goddamn *certain* you don't get any of it on you
while you're busy spraying the bad guys...

====================================================================

   Yes, that's the problem isn't it. A common squirt gun wouldn't work, 
especially since DMSO is the universal solvent. A high-tec squirt gun
could be built, pressurized by CO2 perhaps. Or paintball guns could be
adapted with thin glass balls.
