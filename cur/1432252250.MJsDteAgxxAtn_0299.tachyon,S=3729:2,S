I made no claims, you did, rather I asked you sarcastically to validate
your claims, after which you further assumed on top of other mistaken
assumptions, that I made claims countering yours, which I did not.

Perhaps you should examine your own words.

IMHO, you are a misguided armchair general who sees yourself as equal to 
those scumbags that have risen in power to lead or enslave nations since 
you seem to constantly say "they should have done X, and not Y" and are 
constantly seeking to go against with reality with "W should be the case, 
not X" even though W cannot happen while X does.  Yes, that is my 
unprofessional opinion.  And yet, while impotent to achive your views of 
reality, you insist on sharing it, as if anyone gives a rats ass.

It was entertaining, but it's getting old.


I doubt that it would be long before you'll be sporting a tin foil hat.
