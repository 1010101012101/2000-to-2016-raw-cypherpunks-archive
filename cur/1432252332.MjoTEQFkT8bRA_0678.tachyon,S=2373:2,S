Bullshit line of reasoning (actually your whole line is pretty much tits
up but why waste precious time). It's not a matter of 'proof'. It -is- a
matter of interfering with others. Note they are not saying you can't
smoke, they -are- saying that you can't make them smoke along with you.
There is this concept called 'consent'. You seem to be missing it.

You can do what you want until it interferes with what another wants. If
they want to breath unpolluted air and drink clean water then there is
nothing that gives you the right to pollute either outside of -your-
immediate vicinity.
