The detection would often occur with a scrub type of
routine maintenance check or automatically depending
on the system.

And unfortunately there are many critical repos that
essentially refuse to move to a revcontrol system that
employs signable hashes/merkle such that a cracked
repo or even bitrot could be detected. Often out of such
non claims [1] as workflow and effort to switch. FreeBSD
is an example of such a key repo.

[1] Considering potential the core-outwards architectural
integrity benefits, among others.
