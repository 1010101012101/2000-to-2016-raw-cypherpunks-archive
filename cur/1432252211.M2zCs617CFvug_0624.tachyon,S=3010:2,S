Oh shit.  It really is the empire.

According to http://www.techvisas.com/taxation.htm
	Taxation of Aliens who Have Departed - Anti-Expatriation
	Rules.

	Aliens who live in the U.S. as residents, irrespective of
	visa status, face special anti-expatriation rules. Such
	rules were formerly applied only to U.S. citizens who
	cancelled their U.S. citizenship in order to be free of
	U.S. gift and estate taxes. As a result, termination of
	lawful permanent resident status after several years will
	result in continuing liability of the foreigners gifts
	and patrimony (assets) to U.S. probate and estate taxes
	for 10 years after such termination
