So please tell us, oh enlightened one, what is the threat model?

Because I would say the exact same thing about those who badmouth privacy 
advocates and privacy itself: obviously those in power have vested interests 
in violating privacy, be it for monetary, or political gain.

They have vested interests in convincing the unwashed masses that either 
"privacy is dead", "privacy is not needed" or "privacy is impossible". So that 
they can more easily spy upon us all, and so that it gets that harder for 
privacy-conscious people to maintain their privacy (as that is an ecology, if 
you do not maintain your privacy, information about you might help somebody to 
deduce information about me).

I would say that the vested interest is more clear in the above than in what 
you stated. So please tell me, what do I not see, or (if I am "working for the 
man"), where's the cash that I must've gotten for my services over the 
years?..
