There is a easily-available kind of architectural glass  called "Azurelite"
(PPG Industries) (read:  "Cheap") which would transmit less than 2% (single
pass) of 900nm infrared in a 45 degree "brewster window" configuration.  For
two passes, that's 0.03% reflection even if the underlying scope optics
reflected 100%.  In other words, vastly less reflection than even a black
piece of paper.
