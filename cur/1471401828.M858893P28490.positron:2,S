Anthropogenic climate change is what we are talking about. At least, it's what im talking about. Not normal natural climate change or even climate change related to non human events e.g. a large asteroid hitting the earth.... Humanity has been and continues to accelerate the rate of change dramatically, and dangerously. 

All that "scientific research" is anything but meaningless. Since when do you put science in quotation marks like it's a big fucking joke?
