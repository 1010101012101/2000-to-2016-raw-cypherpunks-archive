France and Switzerland Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman

May 28, 2003

This Public Announcement is being issued to alert U.S. citizens to the
potential for large-scale anti-globalization protests on or near the
French/Swiss border during the G-8 Summit scheduled for June 1-3, 2003, in
Evian, France. American citizens traveling in or out of France during this
period should be prepared for greater security checks and should have their
U.S. passports available at all border crossing points. This Public
Announcement expires on June 9, 2003.

The Summit of the Group of 8 (G-8) is expected to attract as many as 300,000
anti-globalization protestors, most of who will gather outside Evian in
Annemasse, France, and Geneva, Switzerland.  Protests will also take place
in Lausanne and other cities on the Swiss shore of Lake Geneva.  Large-scale
anti-globalization protests are planned beginning May 29 in Annemasse.
Large rallies are planned for June 1 in Geneva and Annemasse, and other
demonstrations are expected to take place in the region throughout the
summit.

Americans traveling in the area should avoid the demonstrations, bearing in
mind that in the past, similar demonstrations have sometimes turned violent
and that traffic and public transportation in the vicinity of demonstrations
are likely to be affected.

Additionally, to enhance security measures already in place for the Summit,
the government of France will increase passport and security checks at all
of its land borders.  Enhanced controls will begin immediately at some
borders to eventually include all land border crossings throughout the
period of the Summit.  Those entering or exiting France - whether by car,
boat or train - may be required to produce valid travel documents.  American
citizens traveling in or out of France during this period should be prepared
for greater security checks and should have their valid U.S. passports
available at all border crossing points.

American citizens can register and obtain updated information on travel and
security at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, the Consulate General in Marseille,
the Consulate General in Strasbourg, or the U.S. Embassy in Bern.

The U.S. Consular Agency in Geneva will be closed from Monday, May 26,
through Tuesday, June 4, 2003.
Travelers should also consult the Department of State's latest Consular
Information Sheets for France and Switzerland and the Worldwide Caution
Public announcement at travel.state.gov.
American citizens may also obtain up-to-date information on security
conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States or
Canada, and 317-472-2328 from overseas.
