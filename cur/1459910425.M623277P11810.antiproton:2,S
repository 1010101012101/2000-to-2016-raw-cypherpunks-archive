The solution to the problems of state is not better cyptography.
Those are nice techniques which will be useful for other things.  The
solution to the problems of State is to fix the State.   Because the
scenario of overthrowing the government and instating a
socialists/anarchist/whatever state is not going to be a welcome
solution to the existing populace.  Absent that, you only have hiding
from the State or other minor changes which aren't ultimately
effective.

The solution for fixing the State of America (which is the first
domino in the chain) is to remember that the American Revolution
fought for the same ideals as us and USE THE LAW.  It is unambiguously
in the hands of the People.  There's no way a Court, hanging a US flag
can ignore principles of that the nation was founded on.

See <http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hack_the_Law> for several cracks in
the behemoth/ juggernaut of what is now "America".
