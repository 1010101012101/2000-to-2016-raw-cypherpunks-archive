This hit to Cryptome today must be the rapid response to Ashcroft's 
openly sicking the FBI on the net:

  http://home.leo.gov/rollcall/internet_tips/2002/tip_060302.htm

Leo.gov is an FBI domain, though its use is not limited to that
agency.

Our posting aerial views of nuclear submarine bases is probably 
what led to this tip, but the surveillance may be more wide-ranging.

DoJ/FBI has been grabbing all of the views which are taken
from MapQuest and TerraServer. But all the bases featured
are eagerly downloading the appreciation too.

NSA and CIA have stepped up their visits. And their foreign
emulators. As hearings begin on the uneyeballed wonderlands.
