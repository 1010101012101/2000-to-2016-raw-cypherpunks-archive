Au contraire, Monsieur, beaucoup d'argent.

Thinking out loud, if Quality Software Services was selected
for this most visible effort, then they must have a track
record with Federal agencies.

And they do (read, they're wired).  One (only) example:

  Quality Software Services, Inc. Wins $109.93 Million Federal Contract
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services
  Jun 20 12

  Quality Software Services, Inc. won a federal contract valued at
  up to $109,926,956 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore,
  for enterprise identity management services under the American
  Recovery and Reinvestment Act.


So they are in the identity management services game, which
means that they already have your number, so to speak.  And
are pre-existing contractors to Health & Human Services.
Yet more searching discovers that all the key management
personnel have TS clearances, but the firm seems to never
have had TS contracts, so one can argue that the clearances
were gifts for friends.

This is a rat hole...
