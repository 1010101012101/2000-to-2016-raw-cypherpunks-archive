Hilarious that the author of "fuck these guys" pretended to
be shocked that spies break laws and operate outside of,
above and below law, just like religions, banks, corporations,
non-profits, and very rich individuals.

NSA, ODNI and allies proclaiming that everything they do is
according to law while also proclaiming that law allows them
to break the law to fulfill their mission, should establish how
malleable law is to fit whatever mold is created by lawmakers.
Such crimes are legal rules the FISA court and its versions
elsewhere.

That is not the worst of the scams. Worst is perpetrated here.

Public crypto's well-established weaknesses has not dissuaded
early adopters and promoters, nor those who by now know
better to continue to practice comsec voodoo on the various
crypto reinvention and recycling engines at universities,
corporate labs, bountifully government-funded.

Lavabit and Silent Circle, apparently shutdown for advertising
purposes, then shazamm, joined in a new ever better product
certified by early adopters and aging promoters with not much
else to while away their time spending their opportunistic revenue,
along with a thousand other start-ups and desperate media
cashing in on mil-gov-com-edu-org promoters' 9/11, Manning's
and Snowden's terrific marketing windfalls -- white market far
exceeded by the black market of their bounty.

That the coders were and are full of manure and venality
guarantees marketing will prevail over quality, that is the
very essence of security, as with intelligence and military
prowess. Faith-based can't be beat for gullling the people.

Faith-based protection is ancient, whether paganism,
astrology, alchemy, scientism, and modern: rationalism,
espionage, the major and minor religions, the stock market,
communism, capitalism, the national security state, Ayn
Rand and Mises, higher education,  and more recently:
Silicon Valley and Alley, anonymizing, cybersecurity,so
why not exploit fashionable crypto before it returns to
the underground, the deep web where the majestic
criminality is occurring, as ever camouflaged by
sanctimony and publicity of doing good.

Amen, brothers and sisters of the crypto Mafia braying
bribe the cops with after office lucrative positions.
