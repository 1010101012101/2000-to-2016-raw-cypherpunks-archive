I hadn't heard about a driver signed with a "stolen Microsoft certificate. 
I suspect it's imperfect reporting.

That article links to
http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/new-duqu-sample-found-wild
Which says: "Another difference is the old driver file was signed with a  
stolen certificateband this one is not."

Right. The legitimate Windows Update system application won't recognize  
certs from random CAs like DigiNotar. (Code signing PKI appears good  
enough for everyone except the vendors themselves.)

But it might be possible to silently pwn MSIE users who checked the box  
"Always trust ActiveX controls from microsoft.com" and the sky's the limit 
on how you might use something like that for social engineering.

Anyone can sign up to get a code signing cert for basic driver signing,  
there is no test of purity of heart involved. Probably the only reason the 
bad guys used a stolen one is that it was easier to steal or buy a private 
key than to set up a temporary identity and pay a few hundred bucks for an 
official one.
