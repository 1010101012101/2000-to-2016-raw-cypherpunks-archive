      Scotland Yard Gets More Time to Questions Terrorism Suspect
                          The Associated Press
                         Published: Oct 29, 2001
LONDON (AP) - Scotland Yard said Monday it has gained court permission
to continue questioning an Egyptian man suspected of involvement in
terrorism.

The 38-year-old man, identified in press reports as Yasser al-Sirri, was
arrested at his home in London last week.

Tuesday would mark the end of the seven-day period permitted by the
Terrorism Act for questioning a suspect without bringing charges, but
authorities were granted more time to question al-Sirri.

Al-Sirri runs a center that acts as a public relations contact for
Islamic fundamentalist groups, and recently circulated a statement by
Mohammed Atef, third-ranking leader of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida
network.

Al-Sirri has declined to discuss how he obtained that statement.
