Easy on the paranoia and the abuse, folks. My attitude is that, so long
as our public servants are doing what we actually pay them for (in this
case, investigating a clearly common-law crime - mass murder), I will
help if I can. That doesn't mean cooperating on a fishing expedition in
my quarters. of course, but I will meet somewhere and contribute
whatever I know about what they're looking into - not that I know a
damn' thing besides what I pick up on CNN and on the various lists.

We can ALL help by letting cooler heads prevail, and applying reason to
the paranoid ravings that inevitably follow an outrage like this. In the
last few days I have answered distraught folk who thought that:

- the Towers were brought down by explosives; the 'planes were just a
diversion!

- the US government did this to justify repressive measures at home.

- the inevitable Numerology freaks and those who find Biblical
references in the numbers

On the second point, there's no question that opportunists in government
are taking full advantage, but I don't think the deed was done by
government or under government auspices. It would make things nicely
symmetrical, but life is rarely that way

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

Rather than make war on the American people and their
liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
