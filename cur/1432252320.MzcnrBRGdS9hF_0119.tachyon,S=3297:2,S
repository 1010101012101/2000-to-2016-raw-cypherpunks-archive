Dave,

For IP if you wish:

Imagine how law enforcement at all levels is reacting to the AOL
search log exposure.  Now there is a searchable database of the
search logs: See http://www.aolsearchdatabase.

You can quickly locate people who may be planning crimes. We find,
for instance, 43,206 people searched for "child porn." Now, do a new
search, filtering only by a user number. You'll see all the searches
that person did over a three month period.

Here's what's going to happen: law enforcement officers at every
level are mining this data right now for unsavory searches. When they
find a pattern of worrisome searches -- user 2150654 seems very
interested in how to make meth -- they'll search for clues to the
identities of these searchers. If they can't find a person's
identities in the search logs, they'll pursue a subpoena to make AOL
cough up the screen name.

In many cases, this will lead to arrests and probably successful
prosecutions.

And then watch law enforcement at all levels demand the ability to
fish through search logs indiscriminately anytime they want.
