Kazaa can't bar child pornographers, court told
By Tim Richardson (tim.richardson at theregister.co.uk)
Published Friday 10th December 2004 17:16 GMT

Sharman Networks - the company behind peer-to-peer file sharing outfit
Kazaa - has denied it is able to block users who use the service to share
child pornography.

Sharman Networks is currently in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney
facing allegations that it created the world's largest music piracy network
and knew that its software was being used to distribute music illegally.

Earlier in the trial, Tony Bannon, QC - representing dozens of music
companies including Universal, EMI, Warner and Sony BMG - dismissed Sharman
Networks' claim that the company had no control over how its software was
used.

Quoting the company's policy on child pornography, he said: "If at any time
Kazaa finds that you are using Kazaa to collect or distribute child
pornography or other obscene material, [Sharman] reserves the right to
permanently bar you and your computers from accessing Kazaa and other Kazaa
services."

The argument went on, that if Kazaa could bar traders in illegal child porn
images, then it could block users who illegally distribute music.

However, Philip Morle, Sharman Network's chief technology officer, told the
court yesterday that he did not think the company could bar people who used
its P2P software to distribute child pornography. He went on to say that he
didn't know how people could be blocked; nor was he aware of Kazaa's policy
on child pornography, reported ZD Net Australia.

The trial continues. .
