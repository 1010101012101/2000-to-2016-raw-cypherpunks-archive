I never understood this though! Doesn't it significantly weaken the second
amendment? What could weigh up to constitutional values, and who is
authorized to judge? Please don't say politicians...

Which is probably the only reason for the classification anyway (that and
how useful it is!).

It makes little difference. This is about current law. I'm sure the world
would be a better place if we left it to the right people, but who could
the right people be?

So, is there an accuracy difference in military and non military S&M
weapons?

It's probable they had a very serious internal discussion about these
things. I also suspect many others wanted to affect change but that they
found things became very hard for them from that point forward. (Please,
someone get this reference!)

For me it's both foreign superpowers with nukes and a lot of people
beleving in very self-justified governments. Although, that's the US and
China, not the NSA seperately.

Thing is, the NSA is just another program on USGOV payroll. Theoretically
democratic parts of the government can indeed shut it down. I just think
the NSA is too influential and self-serving to let that happen. Which sort
of means the NSA runs the nation. But, of course, that's a carefully
curated image that may be a total fiction.

So, should we treat them as a theoretical adversary and move on? Advocate
against them at every opportunity, but just, move on?
