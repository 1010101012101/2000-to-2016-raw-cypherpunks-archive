That's a useful roundup, thanks.

I think the cypherpunk goal of anonymity is still alive and well --
it's just that the folks involved in efforts like Freenet don't
necessary consider themselves cypherpunks or subscribe to this list.
Defcon featured a good number of anon projects; most dealing with
publishing/web browsing/email than anon digital cash, unfortunately 
(though the interest is there).
