This comes up regularly, Seth, I may have said it myself,
but don't remember, having seen the charge laid here
so often about all sorts of upper IQ interesting people. 
Tim, ever different than most, never denies it, never 
affirms it, just keeps writing and raging about what he's 
good at. 

Nobody who appreciates the sine curve quality of imaginative
literature on cpunks will be surprised as what comes of 
this best seller low roader -- which you got to admire, foretells 
the future better than most, may Minerva protect us, and goose 
us into amazing flights of fancy to ward off dulling conventional
wisdom, and, as always, Mars-inspired paranoia and rage and 
petty-minded schemes for making the world worse than
ever before in history, that is, aching for shallow recognition
like you, and the minor deities, wretched bedfellow provocateurs 
of discredited authority.

Dance the Watusi, drink the blood of patriots and tyrants.
