The difference between Stalinists and Trots is that the Trots
were from the beginning more extreme, more brutal, and more
contemptuous of ordinary Russians. The original point of
dispute between Stalin and Trotsky was that Trotsky though
Stalin was too soft on the kulaks. The moderate faction in
Russia were the Zinovievists. No one outside Russia thought
himself a Zinovievist, all identifying with the more extreme,
not less extreme, factions of Soviet communism.<<

Spain,jamesd,I thought we were talking about SPAIN! I know a bit about 
Trotsky's russian background,the betrayal of Makhno and Krondstadt,Its a 
huge separate issue.Id like to keep this thread a little focused.You are 
usually very crisp,cool and concise in your posts.Your making extreme 
statements here.

 >>There once upon a time was difference between those you
falsely call anarchists, and the commies<<

Todays anarchs are easy to find at Ainfos and Infoshop and 100's of minor 
pages.It might pay anyone calling themselves anarcho-whatever to check them 
out and compare and contrast information.I trust the natural selection of 
good ideas.
There are major differences with real live anarchists and "commies".Trust 
me on this.I've attacked N.Klein and N.Chompsky myself for playing footsie 
with the ISO,degenerate MLers.Lump everyone together and you only fool 
yourself.

 >>but after the
incompatibility between anarchism and socialism was
demonstrated in 1936-1938<<

By jamesd,sole expert on spanish anarcho-commie-fascism.Yeah right.

 >>the difference vanished. Chomsky
illustrates this well. Wherever the masters boot smashes
repeatedly into the face of a child, we can always rely on
Chomsky to find a good word for the master, and demonize the
child as a CIA agent. Chomsky defended the Pol Pot regime in
Cambodia, the slave labor camps employed to pacify South
Vietnam, rationalized the Soviet reinvasion of Czechoslovakia
and Hungary as defence against US aggression, and supported
Stalin's attacks on Greece. <<

The truth vanishes when jamesd gets all in a lather.Im not widely read on 
Chompsky.I recommend his essay "objectivity and liberal scholarship"on 
Spain and jamesd and whatever else you can find especially Abel 
Paz,"Durrutti,The People Armed".IF Chompsky did all those other things you 
accuse him of then he is contemptible but it would not detract at the 
slightest from his work on Spain.SPAIN,jamesd.SPAIN.SPAIN.SPAIN.Spainful 
for you?
