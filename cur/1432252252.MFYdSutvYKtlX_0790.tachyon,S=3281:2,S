I wonder if you could help me.  Have you heard of any "leads" to help me find 
2 people to join?  Perhaps there is someone who has been gifted many times 
over who would help me.  I have been in one activity for 2 months and talked 
to 40 something people.  I simply don't have the friends or contacts to find 
people to join me.  They are too afraid; they don't like to talk about money; 
they are afraid they will lose it; they have heard so many negative things; 
or they think it is illegal, a pyramid scam or something.

I am a conservative Protestant Christian lady, divorced, who hurts 
financiallly since I was divorced.  I came back to Chicago from L.A. and got 
myself deeply in debt on 2 credit cards.  I don't know what else to do.  
Someone said there were "leads" out there.

I could try and get myself out of the one I'm in - and opt out.  But I 
believe in the concept.  If this is people helping people, can't someone help 
the new people?  I have another friend who lost her job in September and has 
had a very difficult time.  She doesn't have 2 friends either.  

Thanks so much for your help,
Wendy
