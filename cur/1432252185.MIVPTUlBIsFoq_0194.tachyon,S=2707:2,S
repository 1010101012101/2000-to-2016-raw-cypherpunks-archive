Two men plead guilty in online file-sharing case

LOS ANGELES A Johnson City man is one of two defendants to plead guilty in
Los Angeles to federal charges over the online file-sharing of music,
movies and software over peer-to-peer networks.
The U-S Justice Department says William Trowbridge of Johnson City and
Michael Chicoine of San Antonio each pleaded guilty yesterday to one count
of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement.

Officials say the two are the first people convicted for online file-sharing.

The two men were targeted as part of an investigation which focused on
online piracy over peer-to-peer, or P-2-P, networks. Such networks enable
computer users to access files directly from the computers of other users
on the network.

The 50-year-old Trowbridge and 47-year-old Chicoine also pleaded guilty to
acting for commercial advantage or private financial gain.

Each faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 250-thousand
dollar fine. They could also be ordered to pay restitution to victims when
they are sentenced in April.
