The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wi|l real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
