The article's somewhat long, and has quotes by David Sobel of EPIC
and various Feds.  The Feds didn't have a wiretap warrant,
only a search warrant, and black-bagged Scarfo's computer.

         "Armed only with a search warrant, the FBI broke into Scarfo's 
business
         and put either a program on his computer or an electronic bug in 
his keyboard -
         officials will not say which - and recorded everything typed by 
the son
         of the jailed former boss of the Philadelphia mob."
