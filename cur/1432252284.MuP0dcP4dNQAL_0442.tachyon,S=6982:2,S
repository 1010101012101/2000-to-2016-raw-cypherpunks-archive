I consider it a Bad Thing that we don't have more clearly organized
technical documentaion to show right now, and I can only say that we are
working on providing this post haste. I certainly am not happy to be
pointing you to blogs as primary sources. I apologize for this, and I will
send stuff out to this alias when we have it.
