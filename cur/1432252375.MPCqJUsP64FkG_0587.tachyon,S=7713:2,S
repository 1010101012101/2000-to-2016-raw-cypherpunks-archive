 Why Airport Screeners Sometimes
 Don't Spot Guns, Knives, Scissors
 December 30, 2005

 It seemed like good news on the antiterrorism front. Using a system called
 Threat Image Projection, British authorities digitally inserted one of 250
 images of guns or other banned objects into X-ray images of bags passing
 through screening at a U.K. airport.

 At first the screeners' performance was mediocre (authorities will not
 release results, citing security concerns), but over several months it
 improved markedly. Then the testers changed their image library. Although
 the new images belonged to the same categories of forbidden items, the
 screeners' performance dropped off a cliff, to no better than it was when
 the TIP program began.

 The screeners had become eagle-eyed at recognizing the 250 images that kept
 popping up, but were apparently unable to generalize to images of a gun
 with a different grip or a knife in a different orientation.

 As experts in "visual search" study explanations for the screeners'
 blindness, they are discovering that there are more ways to miss targets
 than they ever imagined ... or feared.

 Scientists have long known that the ability to pick out a target in a
 complex scene suffers when there are loads of things you're not looking
 for. That may be why screeners at Newark Liberty airport missed a butcher
 knife in a cluttered handbag this year. In all the visual chaos and
 "distractors," they missed the knife.

 Another well-known security blind spot is trying to identify an item
 surrounded by distractors that are similar to it, as when trying to find a
 particular pair of pumps in a stuffed shoe closet. This "target-distractor
 similarity" will be exacerbated, experts say, by the Transportation
 Security Administration's decision to allow small scissors, knives and
 other tools in carry-ons, as of last week.

 But it is the problem highlighted by the U.K. test, of being unable to
 recognize variations on dangerous themes, that has security experts most
 worried. Called "target-target dissimilarity," it's familiar to anyone who
 has looked for a beer in the refrigerator. The suds may be front and
 center, but if the bottle looks different from the one in your mind's eye,
 it may as well be invisible.

 In studies funded in part by the TSA, cognitive scientist J. David Smith of
 the State University of New York, Buffalo, and colleagues trained scores of
 volunteers to learn a number of origami-like targets, the original shape as
 well as rotated or slightly distorted versions. The volunteers saw one
 shape at a time, on a computer screen, and determined whether it belonged
 to a target category. They made the right call as much as 76% of the time.
 Since the bird-like shapes were arguably more complex than, say, a knife,
 that wasn't bad.

 The scientists then embedded target shapes in cluttered scenes, where items
 overlapped, touched and took different orientations. The volunteers got
 better and better at finding the targets, as real screeners do. But as soon
 as they had to spot a target that was slightly different from the one they
 had learned, performance plummeted. The volunteers spotted only targets
 they had seen repeatedly, not variations of them. It was as if someone
 learned what dogs are by studying dachshunds and poodles, and then didn't
 recognize a spaniel as a dog.

 "Screeners have trouble applying their knowledge of what some guns and
 knives look like to identify other members of that category," says Prof.
 Smith. "They instead rely on what we call a specific-token strategy,
 remembering Bowie knives and Beretta guns and other images they've been
 trained on, but not in a way that lets them generalize to guns and knives
 they've never seen."

 Terrorists obviously aren't limited to weapons that screeners are trained
 and tested on. As Prof. Smith and his colleagues write in the current issue
 of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition,
 "It is a serious matter."

 Just to be sure there wasn't something especially difficult about the
 origami-like shapes, the scientists had 88 participants try to spot actual
 knives, scissors and guns in X-ray images of cluttered suitcases. Again,
 there was a steep learning curve as specific targets repeated, with people
 eventually spotting 90% of the contraband. But as soon as slightly
 different guns, knives and scissors were digitally inserted into the image,
 scores fell. Unable to see family resemblances, people missed three times
 as many novel items as familiar ones.

 Oddly, people did hardly better when they had to find one target category
 rather than three. That suggests that reducing the number of forbidden
 carry-ons won't make screeners catch more of them. "I was surprised that
 performance wasn't better with fewer targets," Prof. Smith says. "There's
 little reason to think that decreasing the number of items screeners have
 to spot will improve the quality of the search."

 The TSA has reportedly upped the number of images in its training library
 to more than 1,000. That may help, but what's really needed is a way to
 train the brain to broaden its search criteria so that it can spot any
 knife or gun after being trained on hundreds of specific knives or guns.

 So far, no one knows how to do that.
