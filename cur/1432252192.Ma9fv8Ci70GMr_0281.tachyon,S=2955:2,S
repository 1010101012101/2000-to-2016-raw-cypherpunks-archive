Much as we'd like reputational issues to rule, I think your final
parenthetical is important.  I would be willing to bet that Lance
*could* take FBI money to rat out users without it reaching the
userbase.  I'd also be willing to bet that Lance *wouldn't,* but that
bet would obviously be smaller.

So, to the question of, is a private company better than a research
lab?  Probably.  But could a privacte company comprimise its users
without imploding?  Probably.  The right system is probably something
like Tarzan, running low-latency traffic inside the file trading
cloud.
