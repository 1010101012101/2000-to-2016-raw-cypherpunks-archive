That's the way both military and commercial contracting usually
works in the U.S. as well:  The vendor makes a deal with the
purchasing agent, x units for y dollars, informally and off the
record.  Then the purchasing agent revises the specification so
that only the vendor in question can qualify.  The competitive
bidding process then proceeds normally, on the record, and as far
as the audit trail is concerned it's all perfectly legal.

The kickbacks are laundered in various ways; the most popular
method for military purchasing agents is for the vendors to hire
them as consultants when they leave the service, with
extraordinary pay and bonuses for little to no work performed.

Lots of other scams are also used, but the system described above
is probably the most widely used.
