Arabs respect power.  Well, everyone respects power, but arabs 
more so.

The image of Saddam being poked around will devastate the 
insurgents just as much as his bullet ridden body would have
done.  Either one works.

If he was cocky and defiant after being taken prisoner, that 
would have been a problem -- and I suspect that problem would 
have been swiftly solved.

What was done was an excellent use of him, perhaps the best 
possible use of him.
