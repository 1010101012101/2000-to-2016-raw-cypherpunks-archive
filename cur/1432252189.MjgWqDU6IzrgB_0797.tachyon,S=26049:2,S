    After reading this and evaluating the tables, I really
    will get run out of town on a tarred rail by the
    multi-cultural bigots.  Thank you Bubba and Bore for
    your fast track immigration policy which sold our
    primarily Judeo-Christian European heritage to the feast of
    the lions. <p>

    Even Buckley has caved in on maintaining ethnic balance
    (current population):<br>

	<table bgcolor=white><tr><td align=left>

         <i>"It seems to me that the idea traditionally
         defended of endeavoring to maintain
         existing ethnic balances simply doesn't
         work any more." <table><tr><td width=48><br></td><td></i>
         	--William F. Buckley Jr., letter to Jared
         	Taylor August 8, 2000 </td></tr></table>

	</td></tr></table>

    Does Buckley mean defensible? We're not obligated either
    to support the world or to change 200 years of history
    where everyone coming to the US learned English. <p>

    Multi-culturism is an extremely short-sighted tool of
    the Democrats, particular the fake bleeding hearts like
    Bubba (who feels everybody's pain) and Bitch (The Ice
    Queen). Their, and their friends', use of immigration to
    re-define the political balance of America and therefore
    its dreams and ideals might as well be the statement of
    Martin Luther King "...out-breed 'em."<p>

    King was not a cultural and social emancipator of his
    people: he was a core socialist establishing a power
    base from which to rule by central planning and
    supposedly redistribute the wealth --yeah, to him and
    his close friends before it was over.<br>

	<table bgcolor=white><tr><td align=left>
	In 1992, some 61.3 percent of whites over 18 voted;
	in 2000, turnout was down to 56 percent. These
	trends hurt Bush greatly because the Republican
	Party is fundamentally a white party. Virtually all
	of its votes--91 percent in 2000--come from
	whites. The evidence is very clear that the
	Republicans are failing to motivate their base.
	</td></tr></table>

    Bush's claim to have increased the Republican Spanish
    vote by 50% was meaningless --in terms of the total vote
    count, he lost ground since the Spanish voter base has
    almost doubled. But:

	<table bgcolor=white><tr><td align=left>
	...the Republicans could try
	&quot;inreach&quot;--appealing to their white
	base. This would, in fact, be amazingly easy. A
	brilliant <a
	href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/gop_future.htm">
	article</a> by Steve Sailer, posted on the webzine
	vdare.com, has demonstrated that if George W. Bush
	had increased his share of the white vote by just
	three percentage points, to 57 percent--and
	remember, his father received 59 percent in 1988--he
	would have won an electoral-college landslide of 367
	to 171. There is no reason why achieving this
	increase should have to alienate the Republicans'
	few minority supporters, but that wouldn't matter
	even if it did happen.
	</td></tr></table>

    All of this has major implications for 2004: Bush is
    obviously can not plan on the Islamic vote and unless
    the economic picture brightens dramatically, the
    traditional pocketbook and feel-good issues will be a
    factor regardless of W's "wartime" popularity --witness
    Bush 41 in 1992.<p>

    What Bush does have going for him is that the tiger has
    awoke and the people want real security, not money
    security, and the liberal Democrats are obstructing
    progress in defense. <p>

    But even more importantly:

        <table bgcolor=white><tr><td align=left>
	Overall, some 66 percent of white Southerners voted
	for George W. Bush last November. We calculate that
	if the Republicans could achieve 66 percent of the
	white vote nationwide, they would remain the
	majority party, regardless of immigration, until
	2080.
	</td></tr></table>

    Is that reasonable? I doubt it, unless a significant
    number of the liberal white Democrats who are alienated
    and disenchanted by the multi-cultural pandering of the
    Democratic party get sufficiently fed up to vote
    Republican as the lesser of evils. But, 11 Sep changed
    everything in the white vote, and Republicans have
    always believed in a strong America whereis the liberal
    Democratic multi-culturists are preaching FDR's
    "chicken in every pot". <p>

    Hopeful?  Maybe...  but the sure way is to send the
    aliens home, all of 'em: towel heads, wet backs, etc and
    get back to the basics of what made America great: God
    and country --and the willingness to do the work at hand.

    <b>"Unfettered immigration is rapidly shifting the ethnic and political balance of the United States."</b><br>
    <b>By Peter Brimelow and Edwin Rubenstein</b></center><br>

    "Demography is destiny in American politics.&quot; That
    was the stark opening of our controversial <i>National
    Review</i> cover story <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/pb/people.htm">
    &quot;Electing a New People&quot;</a> (June 16,
    1997). We pointed out that voting patterns in the United
    States correlate very closely with ethnicity, altering
    very slowly if at all. But the U.S. ethnic balance is
    shifting rapidly because of immigration. Therefore, a
    concomitant movement of the U.S. political balance is
    simply a matter of time. And since immigration is a
    matter of public policy, it is literally true that the
    federal government is dissolving the people and electing
    a new one, to paraphrase Bertolt Brecht's famous <a
    href="http://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv4n2/brecht.htm">
    advice</a> to the Communist rulers of East Germany. <p>

	<b><i>Peter Brimelow</i></b><i> writes: For reasons that
	are <a href="http://www.vdare.com/pb/pb_buckley.htm">
	obvious</a>, Ed Rubenstein and I were not invited to
	update our 1997 cover story in the </i> Goldberg
	Review<i> (changed from </i>National Review<i> because
	of the implication of nativism and hence Nazism).  We
	have now done so under the above headline in the Fall
	Issue of the Hudson Institute's </i>American Outlook<i>,
	whose Editor, Sam Karnick, recently wrote <a
	href="http://www.vdare.com/misc/karnick_fanatics.htm">
	"Give us Your Fanatics, Your Mass-Murderers"</a>, on the
	failure of U.S. immigration controls.  </i><p>

    In the present article, we review our
    back-of-the-envelope projection of immigration's impact
    on the political balance, then make a new projection
    based on the results of the 2000 presidential
    election. We conclude by analyzing the choices
    confronting the Republicans, the party that seems most
    likely to be the first victim of the changes. <p>

    Our view that demography is destiny was completely <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/sailer_election_math.htm">
    borne out</a> by the 2000 presidential election. The
    Republican nominee, George W. Bush, was chosen partly
    because of his <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/sailer_california.htm">
    alleged appeal to Hispanics</a>. The GOP made <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/gop_strategists.htm">
    desperate efforts</a>, notably at its much-ridiculed <a
    href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/GOPCVN_inclusion000731.html">
    convention in Philadelphia</a>, to present a
    multicultural face. But the result was ignominious
    failure--the ethnic patterns remained unbroken. In fact,
    in significant respects they grew even more ominous for
    the GOP. Only because Ralph Nader's Green Party siphoned
    off some Democratic votes did George W. Bush squeak into
    the White House, with a mere 48.4 percent of the popular
    vote. <p>

    For our original projection of immigration's impact on
    the political balance, we analyzed the 1988 presidential
    race, which the GOP won with 53 percent of the
    vote. This figure also happened to be the average vote
    received by the Republicans in presidential elections
    since 1968--the largest edge achieved by any party over
    any six elections in American history. And it was the
    vote received by Republicans in 1994, when they took
    control of the Senate and House. It can reasonably be
    regarded as the Republicans' high-water mark. <p>

    Then we lowered this high-water mark by adjusting for
    the shifting ethnic balance that the Census Bureau
    estimated would result from immigration, assuming that
    the various ethnic groups continued to vote as they did
    in 1988. It is important to note that these voting
    patterns were established before the United States began
    any serious public debate over immigration--so
    Republican stands on the issue cannot be blamed for the
    party's poor performance with these ethnic groups, as is
    commonly and carelessly alleged. <p>

    Declining Support <p>

    The results were startling, as the figure shows. Even if
    the Republicans could have won their 1988 level of
    support again--which they miserably failed to do against
    Bill Clinton--they would have had at most two
    presidential cycles left. Then they would have fallen
    inexorably into minority status, beginning in 2008.  (<a
    href="http://vdare.com/pb/swept_away_table1.htm">See
    Full Results in Table 1...</a>) <p>

    But that was better than the prospect confronting them
    after the 2000 election.  George W. Bush came nowhere
    close to replicating the 1968-1988 Republican
    performance. As we have seen, he did not even get a
    majority of the popular vote. <p>

    A closer look reveals how poor Bush's performance
    was. He actually did <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/sailer_why_blacks_hate_dubya.htm">
    worse</a> among African Americans than Bob Dole did in
    1996, obtaining only 8 percent of African Americans'
    votes, as opposed to Dole's 12 percent. He also did
    worse among Asians than we allowed for in our original
    projections (41 percent vs. 47 percent), which suggests
    that this group may not be the natural Republican
    constituency that the party's strategists so wishfully
    think it to be. <p>

    Of course, Bush did pull a higher share of the Hispanic
    vote than Dole did--31 percent versus 21 percent. And
    this has caused a certain amount of innumerate glee
    among those who fixate on the proportionate increase (50
    percent) while ignoring the pitifully small base. But
    the brute reality is that Bush still lost among
    Hispanics in a landslide. And his performance was
    squarely in the range of earlier GOP presidential
    experiences, which run the gamut from awful (35 percent
    in 1972) to catastrophic (24 percent in 1976). In no
    sense could it be considered a breakthrough. <p>

    Innumeracy blinds some commentators to the full horror
    of the Republican predicament. When an ethnic bloc is
    growing rapidly, as the Hispanics are because of
    immigration, it is possible to increase your relative
    share of their vote and still be no better off in terms
    of their absolute contribution to your total vote. This
    is what happened to Bush. He increased the Republican
    share of the Hispanic vote by ten percentage points, but
    because the overall number of Hispanic voters increased
    so much, the net effect was that he lost the Hispanic
    vote by essentially the same absolute number as Dole did
    (2.8 million vs. 2.9 million). <p>

    In other words, the Hispanics left him just as deep in
    the hole. He needed help from the rest of the American
    electorate to climb out. <p>

    And he didn't get it. In perhaps the most important and
    underreported development of the election, Bush did
    relatively poorly among whites, getting only 54 percent
    of their votes. By contrast, his father received 59
    percent in 1988, and Reagan pulled 64 percent in
    1984. Moreover, white turnout has been falling. In 1992,
    some 61.3 percent of whites over 18 voted; in 2000,
    turnout was down to 56 percent. These trends hurt Bush
    greatly because the Republican Party is fundamentally a
    white party. Virtually all of its votes--91 percent in
    2000--come from whites. The evidence is very clear that
    the Republicans are failing to motivate their base. <p>

    No Laurels <p>

    So what happens now? Obviously, the GOP cannot rest on
    its laurels. It has none to rest on. To make our new
    projection based on the 2000 election, we redistributed
    the third-party votes of Ralph Nader (2.7 percent) and
    Patrick J. Buchanan (0.4 percent) equally to the major
    parties. This is an extremely favorable assumption for
    the Republicans and has the happy result of bringing the
    party's 2000 share to 50 percent. <p>

    But after that, it's downhill all the way--(as <a
    href="http://vdare.com/pb/swept_away_table2.htm">Table
    2</a><br> makes clear.) makes clear. Under these
    assumptions and taking demographic changes into account,
    the GOP loses narrowly in 2004 (49.7 percent) and by a
    slightly wider, though still small, gap in 2008 (49.4
    percent). Then, it sinks steadily as immigration shifts
    the political balance against it. In fact, Bush's poor
    performance, if replicated, will have the effect of
    hastening the estimated date of the GOP's demise by two
    presidential election cycles. <p>

    However, things may not work out even this well for the
    Republicans. Although we redistributed the third-party
    votes equally for the sake of clarity, we by no means
    predict that this redistribution will actually
    happen. In our 1997 <i> National Review</i> story, we
    cited countries as far apart as <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/misc/derbyshire/australia_refugees.htm">
    Australia</a> and France to demonstrate that immigration
    is preeminently an issue that, when ignored by
    establishment parties, provokes insurrection. Pat
    Buchanan duly broke with the Republicans and ran as the
    Reform party nominee in 2000, with immigration reform as
    part of his platform. His <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/mcconnell/november_26.htm">
    weak showing</a> (not that the GOP can afford to ignore
    any votes at all) will comfort only those who do not
    remember <a
    href="http://www.ashbrook.org/about/ashbrook.html"> John
    Ashbrook's</a> equally weak primary challenge to Richard
    Nixon in 1972, after which the conservative movement was
    widely written off--four years before Reagan's similar
    primary challenge to <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/fulford/fords_role.htm">
    Gerald Ford</a> helped scuttle Ford's reelection
    prospects and put the Gipper on the road to the White
    House. <p>

    Buchanan may not have been the Messiah, nor even a John
    the Baptist. But he could still be an Isaiah,
    prophesying the Republicans' demise. <p>

    In our previous story, we also mentioned the
    anti-immigration forces then mobilizing against
    immigration enthusiast <a
    href="http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=Spencer+Abraham+&sp-a=sp0a298a00&sp-advanced=1&sp-p=all&sp-w-control=1&sp-d=custom&sp-date-range=-1&sp-start-month=0&sp-start-day=0&sp-start-year=&sp-end-month=0&sp-end-day=0&sp-end-year=&sp-x=any&sp-c=25&sp-m=">
    Senator Spencer Abraham</a> in Michigan. They duly
    played a role in his very narrow defeat. We also noted
    the rise of the Green Party, pointing out that it was
    the Green Party's vote-splitting role that had caused
    the Republicans to win a recent <a
    href="http://www.lcv.org/campaigns/dirtydozen/redmond.htm">
    congressional special election in</a> New Mexico, rather
    than the mass conversion of Hispanics that was being
    proclaimed by the usual Republican Pollyannas. The New
    Mexico Greens appeared to be Anglo Leftists alienated
    from the worldly Hispanic machine that controlled the
    state's Democratic Party. We suggested that without
    Green intervention the Republicans would lose the seat
    in the general election, <a
    href="http://www.lcv.org/campaigns/dirtydozen/redmondrace.htm">
    which they did</a>. <p>

    It is not fanciful to suggest that what we are seeing
    here are the first, indirect effects of the current
    great immigration wave. The modern Democratic Party has
    become preoccupied with the ethnic and patronage agendas
    of the blocs that increasingly make up its base. White
    Leftists, more ideological and perhaps idealistic, no
    longer feel at home in that party, and they are leaving,
    although no doubt failing to acknowledge the real
    reason, even to themselves. <p>

    Ostrich Party <p>

    Thus the vast complication of ethnic politics brought
    about by current immigration policy may, in the end,
    confound both parties. This has happened before in
    American politics. Immigration, and the rise of the
    nativist <a
    href="http://members.cts.com/crash/b/baxley/nativist.html">
    American Party</a>, destroyed the Whigs and ended the
    Second Party System on the eve of the Civil War. <p>

    But it's clear that the Republicans are being confounded
    first. Their options are few. First, they could continue
    their clumsy, &quot;me-too&quot; multicultural
    &quot;outreach&quot; as exemplified by the Philadelphia
    convention. This should guarantee the party
    irretrievable minority status in two or three
    presidential election cycles. <p>

    Second, the Republicans could try
    &quot;inreach&quot;--appealing to their white base. This
    would, in fact, be amazingly easy. A brilliant <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/gop_future.htm">
    article</a> by Steve Sailer, posted on the webzine
    vdare.com, has demonstrated that if George W. Bush had
    increased his share of the white vote by just three
    percentage points, to 57 percent--and remember, his
    father received 59 percent in 1988--he would have won an
    electoral-college landslide of 367 to 171. There is no
    reason why achieving this increase should have to
    alienate the Republicans' few minority supporters, but
    that wouldn't matter even if it did happen. Under this
    scenario, Bush would still have achieved a tie in the <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/letters/electoral_college.htm">
    Electoral College</a> if not one single nonwhite
    American had voted Republican. <p>

    A cool reading of the Republican situation reveals that
    it is serious but by no means desperate. The demographic
    balance of many southern states that the GOP now wins
    handily is in fact far more lopsided than that of
    California today--or of the United States
    tomorrow. African Americans, solid Democratic voters,
    constitute 35 to 40 percent of the electorate in those
    states, but the GOP wins handily because it <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/francis/francis_dixieland.htm">
    mobilizes its white base</a>. In 2000, it achieved 81
    percent of the white vote in Mississippi, 73 percent in
    Texas, and 72 percent in Alabama. Overall, some 66
    percent of white Southerners voted for George W. Bush
    last November. We calculate that if the Republicans
    could achieve 66 percent of the white vote nationwide,
    they would remain the majority party, regardless of
    immigration, until 2080. <p>

    Third, the Republicans could simply stop the ongoing
    election of a new, non-Republican American people. They
    could repeal the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which
    accidentally triggered the current wave of immigrants
    after a forty-year lull in which there was virtually no
    immigration at all. That lull was vital to the
    assimilation of the first, 1890-1920, Great Wave of
    immigration. There is a strong case for resuming such a
    moratorium. But at the least, Republicans could insist
    that immigration policy favor applicants--skilled,
    English-speaking, quite possibly European--who are more
    likely to vote for them. After all, no state would be
    admitted to the Union without the most precise
    calculation of its partisan consequences. And
    immigration is currently adding the equivalent of a <a
    href="http://www.vdare.com/fulford/fulford_immigration_rotten2.htm">
    North Dakota</a> plus some 30,000 more people every
    year. <p>

    The inability of Republican strategists to understand
    all this is fascinating. Some are marketing
    professionals from the corporate world, people who never
    saw a market they didn't want to penetrate and have no
    experience with the zero-sum aspects of political
    struggle. Some Republican strategists obviously just
    can't count. Republican consultant Ralph Reed, for
    example, told the <i> Washington Post </i>that the party
    could no longer try &quot;to drive its percentage of the
    white vote over 70 percent to win an election.&quot;

    political base are immoral, even though the Democrats
    play that very game themselves. That is a formula for
    political destruction. And as immigration-driven
    demographic change transforms American politics, it will
    change the society as well, through the political
    process and in countless other ways. <p>

    Republican Party may prove to be the least that it
    sweeps away. <p>
