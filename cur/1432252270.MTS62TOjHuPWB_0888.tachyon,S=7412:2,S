Role of the US Tech Companies in Government Surveillance: A Lecture by
Christopher Soghoian

Christopher Soghoian will deliver a lecture on the role US tech
companies play in assisting government surveillance at the Centre for
Internet & Society office in Bangalore on August 27, 2012.

When Aug 27, 2012
from 05:00 PM to 07:00 PM
Where The Centre for Internet & Society, Bangalore


Your internet, phone and web application providers are all, for the
most part, in bed with US and other foreign government agencies. They
all routinely disclose their customers' communications and other
private data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Worse,
firms like Google and Microsoft specifically log data in order to
assist the government. How many government requests does your ISP get
for its customers' communications each year? How many do they comply
with? How many do they fight? How much do they charge for the
surveillance assistance they provide? Who knows? Most companies have a
strict policy of not discussing such topics.

The differences in the privacy practices of the major players in the
telecommunications and internet applications market are significant.
Some firms retain identifying data for years, while others retain no
data at all; some voluntarily provide the government access to user
data, while other companies refuse to voluntarily disclose data
without a court order; some companies charge government agencies when
they request user data, while others disclose it for free. For an
individual, later investigated by the police or intelligence services,
the data retention practices adopted by their phone company or email
provider can significantly impact their freedom.

Unfortunately, although many companies claim to care about end-user
privacy, and some even that they compete on their privacy features,
none seem to be willing to compete on the extent to which they assist
or resist the government in its surveillance activities. Because
information about each firms' practices is not publicly known,
consumers cannot vote with their wallets, and pick service providers
that best protect their privacy.

This talk will pierce the veil of secrecy surrounding these practices.
Based upon a combination of Freedom of Information Act requests, off
the record conversations with industry lawyers, and investigative
journalism, the practices of many of these firms will be revealed.

Christopher's Personal Experience

In the year 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided
Christopherbs home at 2.00 a.m. seizing his personal documents and
computers. Two attorneys, Stephen Braga and Jennifer Granick came to
his defence. With their expert assistance, Christopher was able to get
back his possessions within three weeks, and FBIbs criminal and TSAbs
civil investigations were closed without any charges being filed.

Jennifer Granick came to Christopherbs assistance once again (joined
by Steve Leckar) in 2010 after the Federal Trade Commissionbs
Inspector General investigated Christopher for using his government
badge to attend a closed-door surveillance industry conference. It was
at that event that Christopher recorded an executive from wireless
carrier bSprintb bragging about the eight million times his company
had obtained GPS data on its customers for law enforcement agencies in
the previous years.

Spies We Trust: Third Party Service Providers and Law Enforcement
Surveillance". [PDF, 1056 Kb]
