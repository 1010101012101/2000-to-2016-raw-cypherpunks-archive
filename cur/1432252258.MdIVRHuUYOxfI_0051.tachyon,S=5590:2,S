Great points, but consider the example "Harvard University." People are
willing to pay a premium to be associated with it regardless of the academic
worth of the individual programs in the eyes of specialists. A lot of students
are after the cachet and couldn't care less about the curriculum. But then, 
I'm sure it's a mistake to assume education for it's own sake has the slightest
thing to do with why the majority of people bother going to college at all.
  
Ridiculous how so many employers put such stock in a word on a piece of paper
too--pure credentialism. How ironic when you contrast that with the fact that
the great Herman Kahn didn't have a PhD. I wonder where he'd end up today. 

Someone once remarked that the most unimaginitive, laziest Harvard graduate
students at the bottom of their class tend to end up at the IMF and UN. 
Sort of sinkholes of mediocrity. Oh well!
