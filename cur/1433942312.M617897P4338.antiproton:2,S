Files are standard DB Table dumps (packed) loading from a cluster of
VPNs from torrent and NAS protocols through central europe (entry
providers are all in privacy-sensitive countries) and intended to be a
distributed database service; there is simply nothing big enough to
handle this onload directly. (at 120+gbps bursts) Some of the services
are posting public torrent data and open sql database access. Table
files are set up as redundant master with cross-population and
standard distribution techniques. Some of the tracking data appears to
have 1 inch resolution target vectors.
