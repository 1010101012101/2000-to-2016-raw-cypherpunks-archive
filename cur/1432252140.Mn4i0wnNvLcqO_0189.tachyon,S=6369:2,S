Herman Kahn, Thomas Schelling, John Nash. You already mentioned von

Unfortunately, you're probably right. But in an earlier post I brought up 
an essay entitled 'Intelligence and the Information Revolution' which 
advocates the creation of analysis programs that suprass old barriers of 
department and specialty to create what the author termed 'Super Analysts'. 
If I can find a .pdf copy, I'll post a link, it really is interesting.

Given that most all the people on your list and mine are precisely what the 
author was driving at, I think the "Super Analyst" approach is certainly 
worth aspiring to. And as far as I've been able to tell, policy analysis 
PhD programs offer the most flexible way to pursue a multidisciplinary, 
scientific approach while striking a good balance between the theoretical 
and the practical. 

How well this kind of approach will fit in with the contemporary 
institutional climate remains to be seen, but on an individual level, you 
have precious little to lose. (yeah, I know: just "time" and "money". I 
think the potential payoffs make it worth the risk, YMMV.)

Anyone who read my posts carefully probably remembers I already said I'm an 
assistant research analyst and PhD student. Believe whatever you want; I've 
said plenty. And in a real sense, it doesn't matter: if my posts are weak, 
any appeal to credentialism isn't going to make them any stronger.

I'm preparing to try.

>old machines will help you in some magical way in this goal?

Of course not, it's a tool like any other. You seem to be trying to extract 
some kind of entertaining kookery from me that just isn't there.

You can have an enormous influence on policy without producing a "single 
great work" or "grand project" everyone can point to as being influential. 
I'm hoping that doing work in policy analysis will help put me in a 
position to make as much of a difference as I can. I'm not fooling myself 
as to the likelihood of actually succeeding at any of the things I have in 
mind, but where's the sense in giving up before you ever get started.

I think you misspelled "whippersnappers".
