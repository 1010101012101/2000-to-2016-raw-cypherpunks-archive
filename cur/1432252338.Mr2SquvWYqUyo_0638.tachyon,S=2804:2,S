When Mowbray began to get the feeling that he couldn't leave even if he
wanted to, he asked, "Am I being
detained?"

When a diplomatic security official told him "no," Mowbray announced
that he was leaving.

At which point, the guard stepped in front of Mowbray and said, "Now,
you're being detained." He was
 physically kept from leaving the building, and repeatedly pushed to
reveal his source, until, for whatever
reason, he was allowed to go.
