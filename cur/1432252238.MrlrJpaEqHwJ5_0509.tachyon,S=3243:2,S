I'm not sure if Clay ever hung out on the cypherpunks list.  None of this 
comes as a surprise.  Most knew early on that widespread adoption of crypto 
would require a killer app and that cypherpunks were not delivering these 
apps because one could not predict what they would be.  They would surely 
not be PGP and other encrypted email nor digital cash unless and until 
there was a small but lucrative market that could be addressed by such 
technology or a large market with broad citizen support.  That file sharing 
could be it was also recognized a long time ago on the cypherpunks list.

The really interesting aspect of this is what it portends for the 
future.  If, as Clay suggests, the current situation is like Prohibition 
from citizen perspective can we expect a similar repeal of government 
surveillance?  If not, what will happen as large numbers of citizens adopt 
P2P systems that not only flaunt copyright law but communications more dear 
to those in power?
