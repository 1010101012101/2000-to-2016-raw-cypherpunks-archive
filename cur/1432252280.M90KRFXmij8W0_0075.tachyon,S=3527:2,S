What actually seems to be happening is that chipset DRM is being deployed
silently,
though not on a wide scale yet, and but for game consoles in a facultative
version. Of course, such dormant DRM can be activated with subsequent
software
upgrades (watch the sneaky software-DRM games Cupertino plays).

The billion dollar question is: will users let themselves lock in into the
DRM prison, just because of a dangling premium content carrot, and the "I
gots your IP, my lawyers 0wnZ0r Ur 455" litigation stick?

We're going to see soon, as HDTV on BluRay&Co is going to be that experiment.
The next-generation signal lanes to display devices are encrypted, so there's
only the analog hole left to the naive user.

Online activation of software is already quite widespread, so it seems
customers are willing to accept restriction to ownership and use.

The entertainment industry has an order of magnitude less funds, but seems to
spend them far more efficiently. Also, the Far East market is increasingly
supplying itself, so Hollywood has less and less angle there. Let US and EU
get the crippleware, while the rest of the world gets swamped with plaintext
pirated copies (a single break is enough).
