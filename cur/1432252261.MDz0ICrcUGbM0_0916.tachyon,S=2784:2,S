    There must be a problem with the ds.pro-ns.net node dropping some
posts. I've seen replies by several people to at least three posts in the last
week that I never got the original one, like the above.

    Chickens ain't herbivores, they are omnivores, and, in fact, prefer meat,
bugs, etc. to all else. We always killed snowshoe rabbits for them in the
Winter, and hung the carcasses just a bit off the ground so the chickens had to
hop a bit to peck at it, which kept them warm. And if you've ever seen them go
after a sick chicken, you'd know they are also cannabals. 
     In fact, if you were to hit your head or otherwise pass out in a chicken
house, they'd kill you pretty quick, or at least peck out your eyes, and then go
as deep as they could. Likewise with any wound you had, say if you fell and hit
your head badly.

   A lot of old trappers I've know tell me they've eaten bobcat and lynx and
that they were tasty, and a lot like chicken.
