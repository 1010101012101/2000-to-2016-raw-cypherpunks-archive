When last I wrote, I was facing a dilemma: how to get a copy of my brith
certificate so that I could get a copy of my birth certificate :-/

I managed to "clear the hurdle" of the missing brith certificate.  Kinda.
Sorta maybe...

So, new certificate in hand, I went off to the DMV to get my picture taken
(wearing my "Frisk Me, I'm A Terrorist" T-Shirt of course).  At 8:50am I
was eagerly awaiting the opening of the local DMV office, and by the
opening bell at 9:00, there was actually a *line* behind me!

I rushed to the counter, plopped down my proof of insurance, proof of
address (a recent mailed in voter reg card), my old Illinois drivers
license, social security card, and held my breath.

They took them, and handed me back a form to check that everything was
correct prior to snapping the pic.  Oddly, it wasn't: the date of birth
was wrong, and it took them about 15 minutes to fix it (apparently the
computers are programmed to avoid the changing of a DOB, and they were
dumbfounded at how to proceed).  Finally, the moment arrived, and I was
the proud owner of not just a new Missouri driver's license (with clearly
shoing T-Shirt on the photo), but a Missouri state ID as well.

Then it was my wife's turn.  Unfortunately, she was turned away: even
though she had everything I did, she forgot to bring a certified copy of
our marriage license!  Without it, they refused to use her married name
for the license...  I trudged over to the city for a copy of said marriage
license, and lo, of course, there was aline out the door - women of every
age and description suddenly finding it necessary to get a certified copy
of their marriage license!  What a shocker - the Collector of Revenue is
having a field day with this.

She will try again tomorrow, and I certain that this time it will all
"work out", but still, I am left with disturbing questions.  For instance,
when we went to get *her* birth certificate, why did they not give a damn
*who* was asking for it?  Why is everyone on earth getting to charge an
extra $12.00 here and $12.00 there to allow us the privelege of complying
with this absurd law (which, BTW, even the fucking British refuse to
pass)?  This country is out of control, bouncing endlessly between
administrative fiat and endless taxation, and all we can worry about is
that some ephemeral "Terrorist" is going to blow up a bus?  To be honest,
I'm *far* more worried that George will blow up another country that I am
about some guy stealing my ID and using it to defeat democracy in
Quebec....
