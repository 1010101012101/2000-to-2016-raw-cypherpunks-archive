For those of you familiar with the Boulder Pledge against spam (see
http://www.panix.com/~tbetz/boulder.shtml), I submit the

          St. Louis Pledge Against Fascism:

"Under no circumstances will I ever purchase anything offered by a
contributor to George Bush's campaign.  This is my contribution to the
survival of freedom in the United States."
