I should have said "could have certs". BGP could use shared secrets or 
CAs; it may be the case that anonymous security (as at least I call it) 
doesn't map well to BGP, in which you usually know who you want to 
trust. It may still help, though - e.g., in the case of the recent TCP 
RST attacks, it would have.

The rest of your note focuses on the difference between two-party trust 
and trust using a shared third party. The former degenerates to the 
latter where I sign your cert, though ;-) I agree that for BGP the 
two-party case is probably more relevant, though there some BGP peerings 
are based on trust relationships of sets of parties that can - or 
already do - have trusted third-party coordination outside BGP.
