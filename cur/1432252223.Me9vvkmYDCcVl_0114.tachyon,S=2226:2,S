Yeah I miss boulder in the 70's.  "hey man, you need some weed, acid
or coke?"  You couldn't go 10 steps on Pearl street without hearing that.

Hypocrisy is the in thing now tho.  If the President can go from snorting
coke to stealing millions of barrels of oil a day, why can't everyone
else?  It's so much easier to steal than to work after all.

Patience, persistence, truth,
