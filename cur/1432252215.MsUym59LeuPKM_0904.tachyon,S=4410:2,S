These types of attacks mainly throttle the masses from their easy use.  Its 
not clear to me that they were ever intended to serve this market so these 
efforts may not bear much fruit for regulators.

I'd like to see more open auditing too.  I'd also like to see the 
equivalent of DGC trading fait money.

Unless someone launches a killer app that only take e-gold or one of the 
other DGCs I doubt they will become mainstream, but them again Private 
Banking has never been mainstream either.  As long as these systems don't 
get on the radar of the regulators they should do OK, even well, as small 
businesses.
