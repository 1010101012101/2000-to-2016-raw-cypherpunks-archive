This is the usual Marxist shit that living standards fell as a 
result of the industrial revolution, and have been falling ever 
since.

If it is getting harder to own a home, why is the proportion of 
people who own their own homes growing steadily, and been 
growing steadily (with some brief, minor, and infrequent dips) 
for as long as anyone has been keeping records?  Why are the 
homes steadily getting bigger, while the number of inhabitants 
in the home get steadily smaller?

You guys have been making up this data ever since Marx rewrote 
Gladstone's budget speech, to have Gladstone declare that "this 
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... is an 
augmentation entirely confined to classes of property."

When in fact Gladstone said the direct opposite, and proved it 
with statistics, proved that the poor had experienced, as a 
result of the industrial revolution "this intoxicating 
augmentation of wealth and power"

This is the same moron marxism as expressed in the word 
"sweatshop": To a naive and ignorant socialist it seems that if 
each man selfishly pursues his own desire, the result will 
necessarily be chaos and hardship, that one person's plan will 
naturally harm those that are not part of it, hence such 
phrases and concepts as "sweatshop" which presuppose that one 
man producing a plan to create value and another man providing 
equipment to implement that plan, has somehow magically made 
the workers in a poor country worse off, that saving, 
investment and entrepeneurship is unproductive, that 
investment, particularly investment by rich people creating the 
means of production in poor countries, is a plot to swindle the 
poor, a scam, a transfer from poor to rich.
