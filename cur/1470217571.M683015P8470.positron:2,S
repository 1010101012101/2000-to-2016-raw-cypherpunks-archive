By creating better alternatives which appeal to individuals, and grow
over time into alternative large and dominant syndicates.

The great challenge in doing this peacefully is not the existing
syndicates per se, but the anti-competitive, protectionist rackets
called "statute laws", which are lobbied for and abused by, these
existing mega syndicates.

In the democratic fascist model we see dominant today around the world,
the mega syndicates lobby 'governments' for special privileges - e.g.:
 - the right to tax humans driving on public roads (please, if anyone
   wants to debate this, start a separate thread)
 - the right to compel corporations and owner-operator individual
   'business persons' to sink inhuman amounts of fiat dollars into
   licensed superannuation funds
 - the right to use the courts to punish anyone trying to compete with
   your overpriced, poorly serviced telecomms network (wired or
   wireless)
 - etc etc

And so we see endless protectionist rackets, in every field of human
endeavour, all around the world, under the pretense of being
"democratic".

Oh, and by the way, when I use the term "right" above, I use it in the
sense of "predatorial right" (in case it weren't obvious).

at some levels, or in some cases, yes

BUT, not in all cases!

That is a part of the brainwashing - oh "they" are all so powerful,
there's nothing "we" can do without being shot.

BOLLOCKS.

(I know that's not exactly what you said - point is, we have to bust our
programming if we are to have any hope of making collective progress in
useful directions.)

..political anarchy is much more than a critique - it suggests
principles for principled ways for us to interact with one another,
regardless of domain of activity.

Sure. But not one of the definitions you've suggested is particularly
useful - add to that list "direct democracy" - perhaps not the best
definition, but one I saw once and got an "ahah" moment.

Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
"political anarchy" so that lay-persons can grok the concept, rather
than get caught up in the common meaning of 'anarchy == chaos'.

And those units, however they each choose to operate, may syndicate as
a syndicate of units.

And those syndications of units may syndicate ...

...

And, it certainly does not have to be a pyramid - whichever unit, at
whichever level (individual human, or a greater syndication of some
sort), can choose to be part of/ syndicate with, any other unit of their
choice, for whatever broad or limited purposes they choose...

...


Why limit the concept?

I'm not quite understanding what you're saying here. It sounds like you
are speaking from a "we need a traditional 'democratic state'" concept,
just without realising it...

I could agree that our tendency to not only speak, but to think in our
'traditional western schooled concepts' is a hard habit to break :)

Watch my lips carefully, as I'm only going to do this once:

Got it?

It's a simple concept. In fact, it is foundational to political anarchy
theory, from my very limited understanding.

Ok, statement of a potential problem clarifies your point. It is good to
clarify potential problems.

But, step 1 is to:
 - clear our heads of our existing schooling/ concepts/ think
 - refrain (!!) from putting words in the mouths of another
 - regrain from telling others what they 'need' to do


Yes, we Westerners are so very very schooled, from childhood by our
parents, and onwards, and so breaking these old communication patterns
won't be easy.

But we have to start....


There are too many assumptions in your above stated problem, and so at
the moment I suggest tidying up our languaging (I'm no exception either)
so that when we state a perceived problem, we at least do so using terms
concepts and assumptions we can agree on.

It is much more than semantic - history shows us many examples of
"bloody revolution", with vast millions of humans ending up dead in the
process of "transition".

A new syndicate does not start out "dominant". I guess you mean "new,
soon to be dominant syndicate".

And that's why the banks (the oligarchs) have funded all sides of every
war in history - very profitable business, war.

So before going to war, ask yourself if you are selling your soul to the
existing syndicates...

I am consistently reacting to what I am hearing from you as a fatalism,
that "new syndicates" are already dominant before they even topple the
existing syndicate, does not make sense.

And I don't think in history it has generally been black and white (new
vs old syndicate) either - the banks (old syndicates) funding both sides
is the kind of 'armed revolution' we usually see in history...

My reaction is because you seem to deny (by assumption in the words you
choose) these possibilities, for just some examples:
 - a new syndicate can start small, probably --should-- start small!
 - a new syndicate can be organically built.
 - a new syndicate might be just two women starting a computer repair
   "shop"
 - a new small syndicate, if it genuinely represents an improvement over
   the status quo (Uber), ought naturally grow into a large syndicate

Catering for likely contingencies is sensible.

I'm pretty sure the USD is gonna go down hard, and then the existing
oligarchs will go into looting overdrive - those who've positioned
themselves to be able to, of course.
Such is the sad state of human affairs we usually see.

It is all very well to start at the end goal, but not at a fatalistic
"guaranteed" bad outcome - if that's all you envision, either get
another vision, or start at the other end of the scale (how we can
usefully form small syndicates, from 2 humans upwards, to work towards a
possible better future).


I will -not- accept your fatalism and your presumed horrific outcomes.

I will -not- accept that there are no pathways to productively and
usefully evolve towards political anarchy in broad action.

Sounds great.

Sounds grand.

Sounds like there are possibilities for action by individuals and small
syndicates that could arise from this viewpoint. I think this could be
useful.

Sure, ACK. "We" the human race, need to, must do better.
