ECC appears controversial:

Update: This is really just meant as a primer, as background on the
issue, not really trying to derive any conclusions. I chatted a bit
Chris Evans (@scarybeasts) from google about some of those conclusion,
so I thought I'd expand a bit on them.

Does ECC protect you? Maybe not. While it will correct single bit flips
most of the time, it won't protect when multiple bits flip at once. The
hacker may be able to achieve this with enough tries. Remember: the
hacker's code can keep retrying this until it succeeds, even if that
takes hours.
