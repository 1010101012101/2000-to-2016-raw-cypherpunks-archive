Isn't he the guy who keeps sending emails about his corrupt Nigerian uncle's
poor widow who needs to smuggle $18B in unspent funds out of Iraq
and wants your bank account number so you can help?

(OK, no.  http://www.johnabizaid.com/ has his bio and pointers
that look like they're supposed to be his writings,
except there are broken html links to apaam.org,
the Association of Patriotic Arab Americans in the Military or something.)
He's apparently campaigning for the position of military governor of Iraq.
At least he does speak Arabic.
