Agreed, to a degree. But it isn't very difficult to outlaw crypto, and to
effectively control its use for online anonymity - to get a workable
anonymity infrastructure, you need common protocols, participants to create
the mixnets and a certain amount of publicity to make your effort matter. It
is extremely difficult to run such a usable setup without being detected by
a determined TLA. Unlike with IP, porn, prostitution and drug trade, control
of online activities can largely be automated.
