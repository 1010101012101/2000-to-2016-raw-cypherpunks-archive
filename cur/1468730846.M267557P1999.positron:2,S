        <p>Things seem to have settled down today. It was a very, very
          immature and idiotically conducted coup attempt, mistakes were
          way too amateur, especially considering turkish army's
          expertise on how to "restore democracy" in its history.</p>
        <p>First off, as a very brief intro to power struggle in turkey;
          there are secularist nationalists, which have been dominant
          ideologically in state and military through all republic's
          history. Then erdogan's islamist party won elections and in 14
          years, first time in republic's history, has managed to purge
          secularists from army, police departments and judiciary system
          so extensively. Via show trials, planted evidences, false
          accusations, etc., they have put all secularist army personel
          in prison with accusations of coup attempts. Some of the
          officers were not very innocent (army is known to have ousted
          islamist govts before), but in overall, very few and immature
          real evidence was expanded by way more lies, used to purge
          almost all secularists in army.</p>
        <p>Then there is a religious sect following the cleric fethullah
          gulen (who has been residing in pennsylvania for some time
          now). They have been hand in hand with erdogan in coming to
          power and all of secularist-purging operations all these
          years, they are also ideologically compatible with erdogan
          against the modern, pro-western secularists and other
          leftists. But eventually, they had come to a power struggle
          with erdogan and went in full scale war with h=C4=B1m with phon=
e
          tapes disclosing massive corruption and hidden unlawful funds
          by erdogan and his circle. Accusations and detention
          operations have been exchanged and erdogan has come victorious
          from that too. (I will refer to gulen organisation as "cemaat"
          from now on.)</p>
        <p>As any one with too much power and popularity, erdogan is now
          seeking to secure even more power (to form a total one man
          dictatorship with strong personality cult, to be precise) by
          changing the constitution and fundamentals of republic. He
          could not manage to gather enough political support (though he
          has a 45%-50% voter base) and deliberately made the country
          into a living hell, letting massive syrian refugee groups into
          country without proper preparations and security (some of
          which are isis affiliated); breaking the peace talks with kurd
          insurgents and provoking them by means of bloody military
          operations into their cities; subtly (and sometimes openly)
          supporting isis and not taking a strong stance against their
          terrorists inside the borders (he constantly cracked down on
          leftist students and intelligentsia whereas caught isis
          terrorists were being kept a few days under detention and
          easily released). We have been enduring frequent and horrible
          terror bombings at vital points in ankara and istanbul for
          about a year now. Most people, unfortunately (this is actually
          a classic, though) consolidating around him with extensive
          propaganda and with hopes that he will provide a strong
          leadership to stop this mayhem (with the irony, of course,
          that he is the one mostly responsible for all this bloodshed).<=
/p>
        <p>Now...</p>
        <p>The coup attempt was done yesterday, without any apparent
          support whatsoever from opposition parties, civil
          organisations or foreign countries. They could not manage to
          seize erdogan or any other govt ofiicials. They could not
          manage to disrupt media or communications (except a coup
          declaration from the national channel), whereas erdogan
          managed to make a media coverage with teleconference, calling
          the people to get down on streets and protest the rolling
          tanks. Coup staff has bombed security and intelligence
          headquarters (they are very loyal to erdogan), and eventually
          the parliament building itself with jets. They made incredibly
          stupid moves, did not arrest any govt personel, could not
          prevent media's pro-erdogan propaganda calling people to
          streets, could not seize erdogan where even i myself could
          keep track of his presidential aircraft from air traffic
          websites. No leader for coup emerged, people could not even
          determine the ideology of the rebels, lest show any support.
          In the end, it was ousted. Here are the few theories for the
          coup attempt:</p>
        <p>1- The coup was sincerely a coup, pulled off by still
          remaining few secularist generals veeery clumsily and failed.</=
p>
        <p>2- It was conducted by cemaat generals, knowing that they
          will also be purged at the next defence counsel (poor
          translation?) in a desperate attempt to hold on to their last
          chances.</p>
        <p>3- It was mit (intel office of turkey, reputed to be loyal to
          erdogan nowadays) falsely informing the generals with a
          secularist coup plan, where they were given missions that will
          create terror but not actually do any harm to erdogan's staff,
          claiming the critical jobs like arresting erdogan, seizing
          media, etc. were allocated to *some other general*. They took
          their parts with high hopes, only to discover they were
          deceived and suddenly left with blood on their hands with
          insufficient power to finish what they started. In
          desparation, they threw everything they have, bombing the
          assembly building and shooting around. This theory sounded
          like the most likely to me.</p>
        <p>4- It was a total hoax by erdogan.</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, we appear to be doomed now. Erdogan
          consolidated his power, he's going to arrest whoever he likes
          and nobody's going to question his rationale. His supporters
          have been brought down to streets and are now highly provoked,
          possibly leading to random violence and moblynching against
          minorities and opposers. He's gained great sympathy from other
          rightwing voters (he's been using an anti-coup rethoric all
          along his carreer, posing as the aggrieved of constant
          aggression from military staff as an elected entity himself).
          Calls to public to gather at the airport and guard erdogan
          were made from mosques all through the night with religious
          verses (wtf, really?! apparantly they like to depict this as a
          coup against their invisible friend up in the skies).</p>
        <p>I am very worried for the countries' future, and for myself.
          This is the current situation. Any comments are welcome.</p>

        ON THE OTHER HAND Erdogan could be seen to be setting up a fake
        coup to<br>
        use as excuse to kill of dissenting elements in the Turkish
        Military who<br>
        say he's trying to create an islamist state and use the puny,<br>=

        half-assed, undermined-from-the-git coup attempt by low-level
        officers<br>
        (patsies to you) to cement his power, as dictator, who allows
        the<br>
        supplying of =E2=80=AA=E2=80=8EISIS=E2=80=AC, and whose son owns =
the trucks that
        transport, the<br>
        refineries that process, the ships that carry to market, oil
        stolen from<br>
        Iraq and elsewhere, again, by ISIS.<br>
