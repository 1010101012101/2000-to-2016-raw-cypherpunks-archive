	Possible?

	Do you think that the utah datacenter is fantasy, that the
	klein 'disclosures' about ATT are fantasy, that all the
	snowden stuff is fantasy, etc? 

	Those are not possibilities, those are facts.

	The info is in the fucking public domain. And,  considering
	what's in the public domain, even retards should assume that
	their 'secret' capabilities are even bigger.

	and even against the FBI, actually. Oh, here's more very old
	news

	'DEA and NSA Team Up to Share Intelligence, Leading to Secret
	Use of Surveillance in Ordinary Investigations"

	I am a libertarian. I correctly recognize the US military as
	the biggest threat to civilization on the whole fucking planet.

	I am not frightening anyone. I'm telling people the truth. Had

	You know there are alternatives. You just were promoting

	Tell that to freedom hosting and all the rest. I can keep going
	in circles, you know, constantly refuting your propaganda...

	You just repeat baseless, wrong assertions, so I'm going to keep
	saying that your baseless assertions ARE FALSE.

	YOU ARE MISAPPLYING THE ARGUMENT and I already explained why, 
	twice. Or perhaps ten times. Tor is backdoored by design. GPAs
	have access to the backdoor.

	Oh yes. We lived in the stone age before the US miliary

	Yes, kurzweil is an AI. He's as clever as google's spam filter.

	Hm, I misread the part about evil? The US military uses tor for
	evil, there's nothing 'hypothetical' about that. Is that what
	you are saying?

	So the only hypothetical part would be tor actually working...


> >> If that were so, would you use and recommend Tor?

	Even if it worked I wouldn't recommend it. 

	Although the question is too vague and of course loaded.
	
	Would a real anonimity network make it possible to actually
	cause substantial damage to the government? In that case it
	might be worthwhile to try it. Perhaps.
	
	But would any government create something that can be used to
	destroy it? Obviously not, so your hypothetical is just
	diversion (in the 'military' sense). Sorry.
