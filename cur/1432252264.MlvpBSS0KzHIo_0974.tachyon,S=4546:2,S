A little less . . . equinimity . . . in the face of unauditable blobs,
maybe?


Getting back to deterministic builds, Eugen has mentioned Tor's efforts with
regard to deterministic builds, and I think we get the nugget of what
deterministic builds entail in the context of a single system vis a vis a
centralized repository, but consider:

  https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/deterministic-builds

Working out the conventions for this could diffuse the targets of
malefactors' subversion attempts against source repositories, against binary
repositories, and against build environments.

Think of it, perhaps, as a web-of-trust applied to the build process, or
DVCS meets web-of-trust meets grid computing.

A great deal of the "build from source" enthusiasm revolves around making
customized builds.  To the extent that these are one-off efforts (even if
done on a grand scale, as Marc has described), they don't yield to
distributed end-to-end auditing of the code, from source to object.

With the ability to compare the code at each end of the build toolchain,
perhaps subcommunities of interest will have more incentive to share details
of their more specialized efforts: So they can groom each other for bugs in
the build environment.
