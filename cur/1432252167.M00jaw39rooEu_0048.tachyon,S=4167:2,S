Check the archives for such discussions.

Most archives don't work that way. You will not be able to verify PGP/MIME
messages in the majority of web archives available, nor will you be able
to verify them with the majority of email clients available.

Certainly. However, those people should use RFC 2440 signed messages, not
2015.

This was discussed extensively on this list sometime in the past year, so
I was not going to go into it again. If you're still confused on the
topic, you can read the past discussions. For instance:

You can read the entire tread here:

(I found it in about 30 seconds with google.)
