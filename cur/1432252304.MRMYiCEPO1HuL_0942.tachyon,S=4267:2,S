Well, there's a difference between a system to recover plaintext given 
ciphertext (which ought not to work for any decent cipher, given a 
hill-climbing sort of approach), and a system to help a human work out the 
right way to cryptanalyze a system.  Hill-climbing techniques make sense 
when analyzing a component of a cipher, say.  (I know people have done 
stuff like this in various places, but I'm away from my library, so you'll 
have to look it up yourself.)

This ought to just be the other side of using these systems to do 
analysis.  If you can find an especially good way to partition the set of 
texts for a partitioning attack, you can use that to decide how to design 
your cipher to resist the attacks, for example.
