If TiVO works the same basic way my UltimateTV (Sony/DirectTV) works, 
having "Bubba and Ram Dass," or whatever, always in my  list of recorded 
shows for a week would be a massive annoyance.

You said you worked for TiVo, as I recall. I suggest you point out to 
your corporate bosses the Law of Unintended Consequences. I foresee 
growing irritation, hacks to permanently interfere with TIVo's spam 
recordings, the "Bubba and Doss" show being unfavorably smeared by angry 
TiVO customers, and even a grass roots campaign to monkeywrench TiVO in 
general.

By the way, so far my Ultimate TV hasn't tried any such Big Brother 
tricks on me. Though they may have their own corporate clowns looking 
for revenue enhancement.  Downloaded ads that play before every recorded 
show can be viewed. Schemes to disable fast-forwarding through 
commercials.
