Ellison rushed into this scam for selling more Oracle data bases (*) 
without much thought.

Mandatory for some means mandatory for all, else the "some" will simply 
claim they are part of the group not required to carry cards. Obviously.

(* Ellison says he will "give away the software," but he doesn't say to 
whom, or how agencies required to interact with the software will get 
their copies, or who will do the maintenance, etc. He is obviously 
looking for Oracle to give away some free copies but then be the 
Official Supplier to Big Brother. State capitalism in its most obvious 
form.)
