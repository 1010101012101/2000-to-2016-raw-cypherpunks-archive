Why? What for? It's the customers who need anonymity, not the Bank.



It is now legal in the UK and the EU to issue "private money". You need a
lot to start (euro100k or so) and you need to follow some regulations, but
AFAIK customer anonymity isn't prohibited.

I'm not clear on the details though. Started around the beginning of summer,
sorry no ref's, but an inventive Googler should find something. I think Ben
(Laurie) was interested in doing something along these lines.
