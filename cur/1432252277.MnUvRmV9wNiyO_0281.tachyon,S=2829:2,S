Sure it's nasty that the flight was delayed. But was it John's fault?
Likely not -- he seems to have behaved well within his rights, morally
speaking. Quite unlike the flight crew. (IOW, BA seems like the least cost
avoider in this particular dispute.) Naturally there should be refunds and
amends, but those should probably come from the crew's pockets. Not
John's.

Furthermore, the terms of contract posted earlier seem far too vague and
limiting to meet the usual standards of valid contract under a naove
interpretation of Common Law. (IANAL, but both good will and meeting of
minds appear to fail.) If so, BA ought to be in serious trouble. In the
ideal world they would lose in court, and have to either reevaluate their
guidelines or state them more explicitly. In the first case, everybody
would be happy, with John off the hook. In the second, they should meet
with widespread public outrage, a thorough-going boycott, huge financial
losses and the unavoidable backdrop to simpler terms of contract.
Otherwise: bankruptcy.
