It's often hard to tell whether a physical object violates
a given patent or not - bitspace is often pretty subtle stuff,
especially if it's manufacturing methods rather than end results
that are the subject of the patent.

But increasingly, the interesting patents are (gak) software,
(gak gak) algorithms, and (gak phfft) business methods,
all of which are basically bits that are potentially easy to make untraceable.
Sure, if you actually have to ship somebody the infringing code
on a CDROM or DVD, then there's some traceability,
but that's decreasingly interesting as a distribution method.
