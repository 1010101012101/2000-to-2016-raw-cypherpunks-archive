Doesn't work - many mail packages will encode non-printable characters
in ASCII, either with MIME or UUENCODE or hex or whatever,
and many encryption packages, like PGP, do that already.

If you require PGP Encryption, you can look for the 
	-----BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF------
line.  That still gets you into trouble with MIME if you're not careful,
so either be careful or don't :-)

The only way you can really tell if something is encrypted
is for a human to look at it.  Otherwise people will figure out
that they can send messages saying 
	-----BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF------
	HaHaWeFooledTheRemailer.  You suck!  
	-----END PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF-----
But still, you can keep out all but really determined abusers,
and all but incredibly determined spammers.
(Even basic encryption will keep out almost all spammers.)

(You could check that the whole message follows PGP syntax,
but without knowing at least one decryption key you can't tell
if it's valid or if they wrote the abuse on top of an otherwise
syntactically correct encrypted message.)

If you want to get fancier, you can also limit destinations to known remailers
or to people who've replied to a "You have anonymous mail - return this cookie
if you want to receive it. <blurbage about remailers>" request.
				Thanks!
