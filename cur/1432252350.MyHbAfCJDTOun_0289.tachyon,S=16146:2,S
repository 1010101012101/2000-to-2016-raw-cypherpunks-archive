The Feds of recently nailed the principals of e-Gold more or less to a
cross of gold for instantaneous non-repudiation of book-entry  
transactions,
threatening set loose the usual Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse.


Now it looks like various Men in Black are going after Liberty Dollar,
below, for instantaneously non-repudiable physical-delivery bearer
transactions, again to prevent the aforementioned Pale Riders -- or at
least Pac-Man characters -- to be at large and in charge...

Uncle Fed has been dancing on the heads of the Liberty Dollar crew --  
whose
business was selling gold and silver rounds, intaglio-printed warehouse
receipts, etc. on the, shall we be charitable, Amway, model and calling
them "dollars" -- for a few years now, including the confiscation of a
vault of coins and bullion at a custodial warehouse / minting-printing
contractor in Colorado somewhere.

Part of the hard-money hoard confiscated back then was a bunch of
about-to-be-released "dollars" with Ron Paul on their face, the  
profits of
which were to be donated to Mr. Paul's presidential campaign. The  
wikipedia
entry for "Liberty Dollar" tells a pretty fair story, for them as  
wants to
catch up on the whole thing in more detail. None Dare Call It  
Conspiracy,
and so on.

Paradoxically -- or not, depending on which side your agorist bread is
buttered -- the price of specie took off so much over the decade or so
LD has been cutting their precious metal cookies that the stated  
"dollar"
amount on coins issued at that time is significantly exceeded by the  
value
the gold/silver they're made of, including the, okay, usurious,  
premium at
which they were sold...


One presumes, again with the agorist cap on, that this is merely a  
prelude
to a confiscation of specie and other hard wealth, and a massive  
inflation
of the US Dollar in light of the recent assumption of decatrillions of
national debt, and thus, cats and dogs living together, The End Of The
United States As We Know It.

Having witnessed -- even enthusiastically participated in -- various  
forms
of millennialism, capitalist, digital, and/or both, over the past 20  
years,
I'm not so sure. Rome, though Byzantium, asymptotically persisted as a
political entity until the Turkish sack of the 15th century. Nothing  
ever
*really* goes away, even buggy whips and flint-knapping. Political
kleptocracy, force monopoly, socialism -- but I repeat myself -- will
persist in spite of themselves as recent "elections" -- Mencken's  
"advance
auctions of stolen goods" -- have shown.

However, this new but inevitable development in the Free (not as in  
beer)
Money business, like the times, is interesting, if mostly in the Chinese
sense.

"... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,
[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to
experience." -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'

...as my old .sig used to say.

Cheers,
RAH

Dear Friends,

Below is the latest news on Liberty Dollar.

Regards,

Jim

     	*_LIBERTY DOLLAR ALERT:_*
June 2009 Vol. 11 No. 06-A

Urgent News for All Liberty Dollar Supporters!

*FBI Arrests Bernard, Kevin, Sarah & Rachelle
The battle for a value based currency has began!*

The last two days have been amazing! Just shortly after midnight on  
Tuesday, the
phone started ringing and I let the answering machine take the call.  
But very
soon there was another call? with an even more urgent message! Very  
quickly, a
friend of Kevin Innes, explained to me that Kevin had been "detained"  
by the
local sheriff and was being held for the FBI to arrest him! Holy Cow!!  
The #2
supporter for the Liberty Dollar and co-instructor at the Liberty Dollar
University training sessions was in deep trouble with the Feds! I was  
sure to be
next. But would they arrive in a few minutes or would it be a pre-dawn  
Nazi
style assault?

Finally, I got up at 4:00 AM. I was very concerned for Kevin and  
wondered when
the FBI would hit me. Fortunately the morning was quickly filled with  
a flurry
of calls from Kevin's friend, other interested parties, the usual  
business calls
and making preparations for the inevitable knock on the door. But  
nobody came.
Then just after noon, Niles, who's wife, Rachelle, manages the Liberty  
Dollar
Fulfillment Office, called to tell me that Rachelle had been picked up  
by the
FBI at the LD Office and was due to be arraigned in just a few hours!  
The FBI
strikes again!

Luckily, I was able to talk to Rachelle via her cell phone while the  
FBI was
holding her. I was pleased that the FBI agents were the friendly  
professional
types and afforded Rachelle and I quite a few minutes of private  
conversation.
Under the circumstances, Rachelle's demeanor and resolve was right on  
target.
And very quickly, I learned that a warrant had been issued for my  
arrest. And
just a quickly, Rachelle was off to court to be arraigned.

Much later in the afternoon, I learned to my surprise that three big  
FBI agents
had arrested Sarah at work. She and Rachelle were arraigned together  
and quickly
released to on their own recognizance (OR) before the sun set on a  
very eventful
day for the Liberty Dollar. The quick, professional effort with Sarah  
and
Rachelle were gratifying and encouraging. Unfortunately, I was to  
learn that
Sarah lost her job because of this event.

By last afternoon it was clear that the Liberty Dollar would be best  
served by
my turning myself in to the to the US Marshals, otherwise know as 'self
reporting.' After a few calls, I found myself talking to Agent Andy  
(aka Agent
F) who was his usual friendly, chatty self. He even recognized my  
voice although
we had only spoken twice and that was over 18 months ago. Sure enough he
confirmed that a federal arrest warrant for my arrest had been issued.  
And after
a bit of gamesmanship with Agent Andy, I agreed to report to the US  
Marshal's
office in Fort Myers, Florida at 9:00 AM on Thursday morning as it was  
too late
to be arraigned, plus an overnight in jail would have wrinkled by  
clothes  :)

The following morning, Thursday, June 3, 2009, I actually arrived at the
Marshal's office at 8:30 due to light traffic. As the saying goes, "If  
you gotta
do time, do federal time." Quite simply, the federal boys are better  
educated,
better trained and have better manners. I was immediately escorted to  
a holding
cell. After an hour or less, I met with the Pre-Trila Service rep and  
made it to
court at 11:00 in chains and handcuffs. The female judge was  
businesslike and
granted my request to attend my son's graduation in Physics from UCLA  
next week.
After fingerprinting, signing a $50,000 Appearance Bond, one final  
meeting with
the Pre-Indictment Service rep, I was free.

In general, the arraignment was a pleasant affair. The US Marshals did  
their job
with very little attitude, as they should. After all, I am self  
reporting, and
it is for anything violent, I just want to prove that I have a right  
to issue my
own currency and if any body chooses to use it then it is a "private  
contract."
It is certainly not a crime.

*And so it came to pass,* 2009 years after the birth of Christ, that  
four
regular Americans have taken a stand to defend the People's right to  
protect
themselves from a government currency that has a long and unforgiving  
history of
stealing the people's purchasing power. This is a test of individual  
rights, as
protected by the Tenth Amendment. It is the deciding moment that a  
private
voluntary barter currency (PVBC) is legal in the great United States  
of America.
This is a test that the Liberty Dollar must and will pass, for that I  
have no
doubt. But it will not be easy or cheap. Please, if you support our  
efforts,
support us with any kind of money you have, including pro bono  
services. Now
that the Liberty Dollar faces a federal criminal trial, it is the *US  
Government
v Liberty Dollar* ala Bernard, Kevin, Sarah & Rachelle. Please help us  
win.
Please help yourself win. Please help American win.

Very simply this is a Win or Lose battle. In addition to money for  
this legal
fight we need articles that reference non-government currency, such as  
Air Miles
as currency, legal research assistance, expert witnesses, legal  
assistance, etc.
If you support the ideals of the Liberty Dollar, this is the time to  
get behind
the Liberty Dollar. We critically need your help! Please send your  
digital info
to Legal@LibertyDollar.org <mailto:Legal@LibertyDollar.org> and your  
donations
of value including other kinds of "currencies" to:
LIBERTY DOLLAR
225 N. Stockwell Road
Evansville. Indiana. 47715

*The best news* is that the Liberty Dollar finally has the opportunity  
to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is legal. Over two years ago I sued  
the US
government for a Declaratory Judgment to resolve the legality issue.  
And how did
they respond, they raided the Liberty Dollar and confiscated over $4  
million
dollars in gold, silver and cash. The US government has done  
everything possible
to kill the Liberty Dollar! And guess what? It has not worked. The  
mere fact
that the Liberty Dollar is still in business is a testament to your  
demand for
Real Money and the ideals that the Liberty Dollar represents.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support! Trust me, the  
Liberty Dollar
is not made up of any fat cats. We are all just regular Americans. And  
we all
just want good money, a lot less government and no damn war!

*Guess what?! Liberty Dollar still in business and we need more  
business!* As
there has been no Cease and Desist Order, Liberty Dollar remains *OPEN  
FOR
BUSINESS*. Please visit our shopping cart for all the 2009 Liberty,  
Peace,
Freedom, T-Dollars and more. Don't be bashful or stupid. Silver is  
going to the
moon, just as sure as the US dollar is going to hell with your  
purchasing power.
Now is the time to protect your purchasing with the "inflation proof"  
currency
and help usher in a new monetary model that provides the only proven,  
peaceful,
and profitable solution to the monetary cancer that has infected  
America.

*OUTSTANDING ORDERS:* Please rest assured that we will fill all  
outstanding
orders. Yes, after producing a sizable amount of pre-minted Silver  
Libertys and
finally getting current with most orders, we changed mints and are now  
behind
again. We apologize emphatically! Poor and/or slow delivery is not  
acceptable
business. It hurts everyone. And just when we were about to get  
current again we
were arrested. Please continue to support us with your patience too.  
We promise
to get every order out ASAP. But as I hope you can understand, it is a  
struggle
to run a business, any business, in such an environment and fight a  
major legal
battle for our right to protect our purchasing power

*The last few 2009 Arrest Dollars
<http://www.silverlibertymarketing.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=343 
 >*.
Are you familiar with the Arrest Dollars? Starting in 2007 and  
continuing
through this year the Arrest Dollar is one ounce Silver Liberty that is
specially hand hallmarked with a micro "handcuffs" stamp and my  
federally
registered mintmark. Issued only from the day of the raid to today.  
The last few
2009 Arrest Dollars are currently on the Shopping Cart
<http://www.silverlibertymarketing.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=343 
 >.
After these are gone, they are gone to eBay for much more money.

*The 2009 Tea Party Dollar
<http://www.silverlibertymarketing.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=79>* (T- 
Dollar)
is still available and we are still waiting confirmation on the  
shipment. We are
still expecting to have the first batch order in the first 24 HOURS  
here for the
July 4 events. The T-Dollar is still only a buck for an ounce of  
copper AND you
can still get them for 10% discount to they $1 face value for a 100 or  
more.
Hey, they are only a buck? you can't go wrong. Plus every copper issue  
has sold
out. Get these while you can and help support our legal efforts tooJ

*The 2009 Silver Libertys
<http://www.silverlibertymarketing.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=77>!* The
backbone of the Liberty Dollar model is the one ounce .999 fine silver  
Lib! Just
in the last few days, silver has bounced back over $16, soon the 30  
day moving
average will be $16 and the Liberty Dollar will Move Up again to the  
$50 Silver
Base. PLEASE don't be dumb and buy silver when it is high. Get it  
NOW!!! Sure it
is not $5 per ounce any more, nor will it ever be again. $5 silver is  
just not
possible with the government spending phony baloney fiat money like a  
drunken
sailor. Please order silver now and protect your purchasing power and  
profit
tomorrow!

Stay tuned to the Liberty Dollar News as we vindicate and validate the  
legality
of the Liberty Dollar. Please take an active role in this exciting and
profitable time. Don't lose out. Get involved with the Liberty Dollar  
to make
money, do good and have fun. I am having as much fun in my 60's and I  
did in The
60's and hope you are too.

Thanks again for your support.
