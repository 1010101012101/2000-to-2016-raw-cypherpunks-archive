I believe the US was ranked #37.

The study seemed to rank countries based on some pretty useless
things.

For example, IIRC, it put a great deal of emphasis on relative
levels of care within a country.  Absolute or objective levels of
care don't matter to the sick.  That is why countries like Oman,
Cuba, and Boobabooba outranked the US: almost everyone gets
shitty, but equal, levels of care.  Everyone gets to use that
same needle.

Also, it attempted to factor out the disabled, genetic freaks,
the old and pathetic, etc. -- all of the people you care about.
Chad can't afford to support these people, the US does, so it
just wouldn't be fair if this were to be factored in.  Those
people just don't count!
