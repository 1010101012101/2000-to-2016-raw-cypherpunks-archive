I see:  So when the US army is so unkind as to film Saddam
acting submissive, this is a shocking violation of his human
rights, and your bleeding heart feels for him deeply.

But when, however, people fly a plainload of passengers into
two tall buildings and murder thousands, those dreadful
Americans had it coming, were justly smacked like a naughty
child, and have no right to get indignant.
