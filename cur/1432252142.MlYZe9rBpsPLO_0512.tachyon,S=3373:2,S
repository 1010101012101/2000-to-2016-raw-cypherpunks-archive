I think the relative cost of parole vs. completing the sentence is the
pertinent question -- the parole system can be a wonderful thing, as Sandy
says, but the government should never be able to reduce costs by using it.
There should be paroles, but their cost should somehow be forced to the same
level as serving the time behind bars. After that the only reason to let
someone out would be the balance between the prospect of rehabilitation vs.
risk taken.
