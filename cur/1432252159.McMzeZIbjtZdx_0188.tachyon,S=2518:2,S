The Corps of Engineers has restricted access to most lock and dam
installations on the Mississippi (closed observation facilities and public
parks around the sites). Their concern is that terrorists may attempt to
destory them, causing the dissruption of barge traffic on the river.
They estimate over 60 billion dollars in  goods are transported by barge on
the river every year.

However, they plan no restrictions on river traffic.
