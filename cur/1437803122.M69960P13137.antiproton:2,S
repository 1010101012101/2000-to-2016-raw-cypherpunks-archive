IMHO even if you get perfect info security (which is impossible),
this will be just a small step.

Humans are screwing the climate and the food with dangerous
food supplements. In the long term this might extinguish
humans in its present form.

Heard that in Australia skin cancer is major concern,
closely related to the Sun and there a lot of food supplements
(locally we call them "E"-s) are forbidden by law.

I deny being green, but judge for yourself.
