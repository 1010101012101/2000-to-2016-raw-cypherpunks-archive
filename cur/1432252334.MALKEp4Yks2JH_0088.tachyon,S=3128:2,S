This is cryptic -- how do I know what this link will be about from your
subject line.  Can't you quote as ascii the first paragraph, or write your
own summary, or something?

If you can't be bothered to do that, the reference is not useful; it's just
a random pointer.  Historically most of them are not even remotely crypto
related.

I asked politely in private email if you would consider providing summaries. 
I received no reply.  If you aren't going to provide summaries and
meaningful subject lines, I politely ask that you stop sending the list
random URLs.
