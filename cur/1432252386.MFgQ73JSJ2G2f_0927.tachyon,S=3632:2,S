US shells out $10M for unmanned aircraft that can perch like a bird

By Layer 8 on Wed, 06/03/09 - 7:31pm.

Unmanned aircraft maker AeroVironment got an additional $5.4 million to
further develop the diminutive aircraft that can fly into tight spaces
undetected, perch and send live surveillance information to its handlers.

Last Fall, AeroVironment, got $4.6 million initial funding from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop the Stealthy,
Persistent, Perch and Stare Air Vehicle System (SP2S), which is being built
on the company's one-pound, 29-inch wingspan battery-powered Wasp unmanned
system.

According to DARPA, the key technical challenges of the new aircraft include:
multifunctional materials that integrate the SP2S airframe structure with the
power supply and transmit/receive antennas; advanced aerodynamics and control
systems, including the ability to land and return home automatically;
perch-and-grip technology; micro miniature pan/tilt/zoom EO cameras; (5)
autonomous image capture; and data link communications relay capability with
multiple digital channels that enables beyond-line-of-sight communications,
with data/video encryption.

Experts say the ability to actually fly in and perch like a bird will be one
the more technically challenging aspects of the system.

DARPA said the purpose of SP2S is to verify the utility of such a small perch
and Stare system (currently no such system exists).  DARPA said additional
work was required to take the military users feedback and refine/upgrade the
system to meet diverse requirements of a wide group of users.  This task
would then result in the delivery of ten upgraded systems for further
testing.

The US Air Force last year gave the go-ahead for full production of the ASP
III unmanned aircraft designed to be used for special battlefield operations
such as targeting and tracking.

 The AeroVironment Wasp III carries interchangeable targeting payload
modules, including an infrared camera, along with two integrated color
cameras that transmit streaming video directly to the hand-held ground
controller for display on an integrated monitor. It has been procured under
the Air Force's Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) program.

BATMAV systems are expected to let military personnel see over hills and
beyond their line of sight in real time and in low light. The unmanned
aircraft are highly portable, durable and can be launched by one person. The
BATMAV aircraft are expected to fly at an altitude of 500 feet, at about
40MPH and staying aloft for up to 90 minutes at a time.
