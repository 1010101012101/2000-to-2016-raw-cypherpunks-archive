Hi folks,

Joel Reardon has finished his thesis at U Waterloo under the guidance
of Ian Goldberg. He looked at switching Tor's transport from TCP to
UDP. There are still many unsolved problems before we can do the switch,
but the thesis walks through a lot of the issues as well as future
work. It's definitely worth a look.
