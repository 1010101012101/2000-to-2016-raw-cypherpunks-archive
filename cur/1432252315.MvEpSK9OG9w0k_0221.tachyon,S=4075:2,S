The question has been raised why a business which applies some 'entry
cost' to a particular group removes that business from a 'free market'.

What does it take to create a 'free market'? Hayeks says 'perfect
competition'.

What is 'perfect competition'?

"According to the generally accepted view, perfect competition
presupposes:

1. A homogenous commodity offered and demanded by a large number of
   relatively small sellers and buyers, none of whom expects to exercise
   by his actiona perceptible influence on price.

2. Free entry into the market and absence of other restraints on the
   movement of prices and resources.

3. Complete knowledge of the relevant factors on the part of all
   participants in the market."

Individualism and Economic Order
F.A. Hayek
ISBN 0-225-32093-6

Chapter V
The Meaning of 'Competition'


The reality is that Tim's believe that he can refuse to serve a customer
because they hold or perhaps practice some action that (while not
involving him or his property directly, only his apparently fragile
emotional ego) he finds offensive is within the bounds of free market
econoimics is just plain crap.

Hayek's views on fascism and socialism are well known, and not positive.
What Tim proposes is nothing more than fascism at the individual level.
