Look for gaps in global and national systems. Where there
is limited or no services. Rig a temporary hook-up, move
often, spread chaff, wipe traces.

Review ham radio history of legal and illegal provenance,
bootlegged and boot-strapped comms systems, illegal
systems which subversively tap into legal systems, short
and long-term.

Study favelas, ghettos, urban poverty rigs, ingenuity-led
poor countries, irrational rogue states, uncontrollable
mavericks, misfits and outlaws, rebels, and huge
variety of criminals, white, blue, pink, T-shirt collared.

Study covert operations of many kinds and histories. They
are a great many of them, past, present and future, all
"under the radar," more or less, but who knows for sure.

Avoid advanced countries who are manifestly in favor
of ubiquitous spying at home and in other countries;
their spies work in concert and in opposition but above
all else hate spylessness and avidly work to infect the
healthy unspied.

Expect to be betrayed, deceived, tricked, given shitty
advice, plagarized for good stuff, fed very bad stuff.
Like this forum.

Whatever you set up keep quiet about it or it will
be invaded and violated. Do not feed the animals.

At the moment, it would be prudent to avoid Tor which
has become a favorite target and user of spies, counterspies,
betrayers, opportunists, hustlers, tricksters, con artists,
panhandlers, pornographers, thieves, security testers,
data gobblers, sting operators, in short, no better or
worse than the internet but not as bad as cellphone
systems and human discourse.

Read the Tor mail lists, founts of hype and disinfo:
Tor Project hustlers currently advise critics "if you don't
like Tor, set up your own." That is excellent advice, and
a surefire indicator that that is what they have done. Yep,
another Tor onion-routed below the ruse, tucked behind
easily found hidden services, exited around camouflaging
exits. That, to be sure, was and remains the fundamental
intent of Tor: off the grid, criminal, illegal, illegitimate,
government grade security.
