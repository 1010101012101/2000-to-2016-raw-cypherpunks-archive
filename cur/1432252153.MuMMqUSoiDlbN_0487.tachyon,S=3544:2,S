The problem lies in the _institutional_ abuse of power. Whether that 
particular soldier is on duty, or "learns his lesson," is neither here 
nor there. Some _other_ soldier is probably, as we speak, doing the same 
thing to some other person reading an Unapproved Book, being a member of 
an Unapproved Political Party, or displaying Unapproved Religious 
Ornaments.

"Reprimanding" a particular soldier does nothing useful.

Left as an exercise is what should be done to curtail such violations of 
Posse Comitatus and such violations of the First and Fourth Amendments.
