Our experience of trust authorities is that they do not work. 
The overhead of complying with the trust authority is too
great.  Users do not do it, or they do it wrong.   Phishing is
a man in the middle attack, and SSL certificates do not prevent
it.

SSH provides cryptographic trust without a trusted authority. 
So it works.  SSL does not work, because no end users have
certificates, the costs of dealing with a trusted authority
being too great, and because no one checks server certificates
except for merely formal compliance.

You could intercept any one of them, but if you intercepted a
lot of them, you would be detected.

Not that I am defending the skype network, but your argument
seems to be that the trouble with the skype network is that it
did not follow the wise and highly successful example of SSL.

Skype's encryption sucks, but it is better than SSL, and better
than nothing.
