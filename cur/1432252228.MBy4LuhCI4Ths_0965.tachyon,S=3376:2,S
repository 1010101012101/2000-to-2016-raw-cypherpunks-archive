Starian, the company founded by Eric Blossom and others, had a 3DES unit 
the size of an external modem that worked as described. (I have one.)

The problem is the "fax effect":  who ya gonna call?

It works well for "cells" consisting of trading partners, drug dealers, 
freedom fighters, etc. They can just buy several of them for their 
members.

Solving the fax effect problem happens when a _standard_ is widely 
deployed, or when some major deals with cellphone vendors happen. I 
understand Starian has been trying to get a cellphone version 
designed-in.

hide evidence. Mr. Happy Fun Court is "not amused.""
