I don't have a problem with this at all: a symmetric lack of trust the most
honest basis for a relationship there is. Wouldn't you rather associate with
sharp-witted people who are on the ball than gullible quibblers fretting over at
what point they get to suspend their critical faculties and give you a free
pass in the name of comraderie?

Trust is overrated. Anyone who asks for it without earning it is either a fool
or a huckster. Either way, asking for it is a sure sign it shouldn't be given.
Where do you imagine the term "confidence artist" came from, anyway.

So be it: Whatever I have to say about it is quite irrelevant--it shouldn't be 
my place to do your thinking for you. What you do trumps what you say every
time, so it's really a non-issue. If you don't know enough about what I do to
decide for yourself, what possible difference could my reassuring you what a
good little girl I really am make. So no, I don't want your blind trust at all.

Where's the flaw in saying trust should be more than an empty word.
