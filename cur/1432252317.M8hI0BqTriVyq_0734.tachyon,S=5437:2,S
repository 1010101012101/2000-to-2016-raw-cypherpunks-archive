Hello,

Job posting on the Internet is an important part of recruiting - but by focusing on job seekers and career sites you only reach a fraction of the people on the Net. In fact, less than 10 percent of the Internet audience ever reads job ads and an even smaller percentage will ever post their resume on a job board. And competition for this small basket of job seekers is fierce.

AIRS (Advanced Internet Recruitment Strategies) takes you past the career sites to find millions of passive candidates hidden inside directories, databases and the Web servers of competitors and source companies on the Net. 

***************************** 
ABOUT AIRS

AIRS is the global leader in Internet recruitment training and information services, specializing in competitive intelligence and powerful cost-reducing information solutions for the recruitment industry. AIRS Training, Media, Publications and Tools have helped over 20,000 clients in high-growth companies define their active sourcing strategies via the Web and over half of the companies in the Fortune 100 have attended AIRS training. Now AIRS is leading the next generation of e-recruitment with a new approach and a new process that produces startling results in a fraction of the time recruiters and researchers are spending today.

***************************** 
AIRS SEMINARS AND TOOLS

AIRS SEARCH LAB is devoted to searching the Web for passive candidates and the majority of class time is focused on hands-on candidate searching. No other training course focuses on actual results - participants learn how to find candidates on the Net and leave the training with scores of contacts that can be immediately used on the job. If you've been reading The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company magazine or following the posts in the Electronic Recruitment Exchange, you've heard the buzz about AIRS Search Lab

AIRS CERTIFICATION is  a Web-based certification program.  You can sign up and be certified in hours from your own desktop - even if you haven't been to an AIRS seminar in a year or two. AIRS e-Certification includes eight, easy-to-use interactive study modules that navigate you through new materials only found in AIRS Search Lab - and prepare you to take the exam.

AIRS SEARCHSTATION is a state-of-the-art passive candidate finder, built on the methodologies developed and refined through research and real-market testing by AIRS. SearchStation automates the manual search processes taught in AIRS seminars to help you find candidate information - resumes, homepages, contact information - in hidden directories and archives all over the Net.
