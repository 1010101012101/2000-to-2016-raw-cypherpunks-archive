At some age people are able to sign binding contracts.  Once you
can, you are self-sovereign.

Polyamorous relationships are consensual, ergo not regulable.  Same with 
N=1 families (ie single parents), or serially polyamorous Americans
(fuck, marry, kids, divorce, repeat with someone else).

>	3)	Repeal of all public sex laws (including with kids);

What laws are these?

>
>	4)	Repeal of all laws against prostitution(even children);

Prostitution is a voluntary transaction.  Individuals are either
competent to get into binding agreements or not.


>	5)	Repeal of all sodomy laws (even with kids);

Once again you have no moral basis for regulating others behaviors.

Any state funded medicine is socialism.

See #6

Boy scouts are a private club, they can do what they want, but
not at public expense.

>	9)	sex ed taught by homosexuals in all public schools;

States should not be running compulsory youth indoctrination centers,
period.
