"I am aghast that

a bunch of

thieves like

Napster could end

up winning

because they

have 60 million

users.... It's like

making a drug

dealer a

pharmacist

because they sell

a lot of drugs." —

Liquid Audio CEO

Gerry Kearby on

Napster's

underground

success.

He sure likes state-blessed monopolies, doesn't he?
