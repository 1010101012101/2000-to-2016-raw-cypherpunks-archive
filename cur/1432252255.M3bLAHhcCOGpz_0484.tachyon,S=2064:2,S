Is this supposed to be an argument *for* the AA pop?

None of us, even TM, methinks, has anything against anyone for where
their
ancestors came.  Many of us have much against various *cultures*,
which are by definition voluntary, unlike albedo.  Cultures being
chosen sets of values, values being moral, ergo judgeable.
Genes being inherited are largely irrelevant to the discussion.

Trash is trash, it doesn't matter the color of the bag containing it.
And noble metals come in many colors.
