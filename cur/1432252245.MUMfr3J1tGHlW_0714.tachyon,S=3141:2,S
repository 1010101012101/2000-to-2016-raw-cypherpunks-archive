I don't see any way to read what Steve wrote this way.

He said: "An ISP is free to say "anyone requesting a tap is required to 
pay a fee," just as any ISP is free to say that it will handle 
installation of special Carnivore equipment for a certain fee."

A customer of the ISP is certainly _not_ the one requesting a tap. And 
he is certainly not the one installing Carnivore equipment.

"According to the FBI, there's a new wrinkle in prostitution: suburban 
teenage girls are now selling their white asses at the mall to make 
money to spend at the mall.
...
Now, you see, the joke here, of course, is on White America, which 
always felt superior to blacks, and showed that with their feet, moving 
out of urban areas. "White flight," they called it. Whites feared 
blacks. They feared if they raised their kids around blacks, the blacks 
would turn their daughters and prostitutes. And now, through the 
miracle of MTV, damned if it didn't work out that way! "
