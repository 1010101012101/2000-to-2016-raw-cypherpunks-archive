I'm still confused as to why Moxxie decided to build apps for Android.
Android is a really bad environment, security wise. The securephone (or
whatever it's called) did very little to assuage worries. The stack is way
too tall! The attack surface is *huge*. Then through the Google Store,
which is a problem too. Maybe Moxxie decided that any threat model that
include an adversarial Google will result in immediate loss, thus decided
that Google was his friend?
