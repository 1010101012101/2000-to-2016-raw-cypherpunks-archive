Subject: Saying bDo no evilb excludes you from any serious conversation about
	Google
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.20 (2009-06-14)

Google has had an unofficial motto for many years: bDonbt be evil.b
It came up as a joke during a meeting (including, among others, Paul
Buchheit and Amit Patel) seeking a mission statement.  A particular
Googler liked it and went around anonymously doodling it on
whiteboards until it became a permanent part of the culture.  Although
it was not originally intended for distribution outside the company,
it became known, and was explained in Googlebs 2004 IPO documents.

Part of the humor of the slogan is that it shouldnbt need saying at
all.  Itbs satisfied by having the tiniest modicum of ethical
achievement; almost nobody is evil according to the moral code they
aspire to live by, except, perhaps, for comic-book villains, Jeffrey
Dahmer, and certain pedophile priests.  The only reason itbs even
worth mentioning is that Google was born in a world dominated by
Microsoft and Doubleclick, which were generally agreed to actually be
evil, and Google aspired to do better.

bDo no evilb is a distortion.
-----------------------------

The slogan has always been a serious irritant to certain people ---
mostly, the most cynical, those who think bgoodb and bevilb are merely
hypocritical terms used by the powerful to conceal their pursuit of
their own interests; but perhaps there are some sincere people
irritated by it too, those who are disappointed by Googlebs choices
and priorities.

Of those rankled by Google, a few have been so dishonest as to rewrite
the slogan as bDo no evilb.  This may appear to be a small difference,
but itbs not.  Almost none of us *are evil*, but every moral agent
does *do evil* from time to time.  Doing no evil is an impossible goal
except for the dead.  Youbd have to be incorruptible and probably
omniscient.

Perhaps certain critics of Google would like to paint the company as a
hubristic, arrogant know-it-all.  But the ones who have a real case to
make donbt need to resort to lying about it, and the ones who are
lying about it probably donbt have a real case to make.

bYou can make money without doing evil.b
----------------------------------------

Some critics might point to this quote, from [Ten things we know to be
true][], to show that the company really does think it can bdo no
evilb.  I donbt think thatbs what it means.  You can debate different
interpretations, but in context, I think it refers to avoiding *net*
evil, more evil than good, not avoiding the merest taint of evil.

[Ten things we know to be true]: http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/tenthings.html

Summary
-------

bDo no evilb is an aspiration to godlike perfection.  bDonbt be evilb
is something anyone can do, and should.  The distinction between the
two could hardly be more pronounced.  Anyone who brings up bDo no
evilb as a supposed slogan of Google is trying to trick you because
telling the truth would undermine their points.

Conflicts of interest?
----------------------

I have never worked for Google and probably never will.  For ethical
reasons, I donbt keep my email in Gmail, even though itbs a pretty
good mail service.  Google is a big proprietary software vendor, even
though theybve made important contributions to free software.  But
lots of my friends, family, and Burning Man campmates work at Google,
and even more have in the past.  Ibve eaten lunch at Google
headquarters any number of times.

In short, I donbt hate Google, but I donbt love it either.  But I want
whatever criticism it receives to be deserved.
