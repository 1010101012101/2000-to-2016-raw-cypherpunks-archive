The author has neglected to consider the 4th and 5th frameworks :

BIGSTICKOLOGY. Wherein the existence of a disagreement defines the
entire situation independent of the reference frameworks or the specific
arguments of the participants and he with the biggest stick decides the
moral question.

THIRDPARTYBIGGERSTICKOLOGY. Wherin a third party, completely
uninterested in the moral dilemma faced by the parties of the first and
second part, has a bigger stick than either of them and resolves their
moral dilemma by altering completely the moral landscape from which the
contest arose in the first place rendering the arguments and opinions of
the first and second parties irrelevant.

Plus there could be a SIXTH and hitherto undiscovered framework.

Dammit Jim, post reviews not just links.
