It seems that there is (a rather brilliant) way to bypass TCPA (as spec-ed.) I learned about it from two separate sources, looks like two independent slightly different hacks based on the same protocol flaw.

Undoubtedly, more people will figure this out.

It seems wise to suppress the urge and craving for fame and NOT to publish the findings at this time. Let them build the thing into zillion chips first. If you must, post the encrypted time-stamped solution identifying you as the author but do not release the key before TCPA is in many, many PCs.
