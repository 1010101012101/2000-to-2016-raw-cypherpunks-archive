The 20/20 TV show on December 27, 2002 had a segment on Robert Hanssen, FBI
spy, in which he is described as becoming sexually aroused by a National
Security Agency PowerPoint presentation and stroked himself through his pants,
according to Eric O'Neill, a young FBI agent who had been assigned to covertly
report on Hanssens's activities. (The show transcript omits the stroking
description and demonstration on camera by O'Neill.) Crypome invites
information on which NSA presentation aroused Hanssen, and a copy of it for
publication.
