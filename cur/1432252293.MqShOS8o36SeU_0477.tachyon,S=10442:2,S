A group of 9 Tor routers also functioning overtly or indirectly as Tor
exit nodes have been observed colluding on the public Tor network.

The colluding routers map to two /16 IP subnets administered by Cogent
(formerly by PSINet) [1]. Traceroute reveals all routes to these routers
pass through Rethem.demarc.cogentco.com (38.112.12.190) at the final hop.

Analysis of a local snapshot of the Tor cached-routers file from
2006-05-27 first suggested the presence of colluding routers. The
analysis yielded the following information:

  - 9 Tor routers self-identified as aala, donk3ypunch, TheGreatSantini,
mauger, paxprivoso, soprano1, hubbahubbahubba, m00kie, and joiseytor
together reported carrying what amounted to 11% of the traffic on the
Tor network at the time of the snapshot, while the remaining 89% of Tor
traffic was carried by the other 551 (approximated) routers.

  - All 9 of these routers appear to be located in the Washington, D.C.
area.

  - 5 of these routers are on the same 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet.

  - 4 of these routers are on the same 154.35.0.0/16 IP subnet.

  - All 9 routers reported running Tor 0.1.0.16 on FreeBSD i386 machines.

  - All 9 routers reported nearly identical uptimes.

  - 3 of the 5 routers on the 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet reported providing
outproxy service for DNS, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTPS, AIM and IRC traffic
on Tor.

  - The other 2 routers on the 149.9.0.0/16 IP subnet reported rejecting
all outproxy traffic.

  - The 4 routers on the 154.35.0.0/16 IP subnet reported providing
outproxy service for the above traffic plus SSH and NNTP.


Collusion was definitively established by the following method:

1. The following lines were added to the local torrc:

   ExitNodes donk3ypunch,mauger,paxprivoso,soprano1,hubbahubbahubba,
m00kie,joiseytor
   StrictExitNodes 1

2. The local Tor client was restarted so the new configuration would
take effect

3. Using Tor as an HTTP proxy, the websites of the IP address mirror
services whatismyip.com and whatsmyipaddy.com were visited repeatedly
over the course of one hour

The results: An IP address of 149.9.0.25 was always reported by the IP
address mirror services. This is not the IP address of any of the exit
nodes forced by the new torrc configuration, but rather the address of
aala, one of the 2 other colluding Tor routers which report themselves
as rejecting direct Tor HTTP outproxy traffic.

Although further testing is needed, it appears that all 8 of the other
Tor routers identified may be forwarding their HTTP outproxy traffic to
the router known as aala, and that aala may be performing the exit node
duties on their behalf. aala may perform exit node duties for all
protocols supported by this collusion network--not merely HTTP. This
strategy would make aala a single point of transit (and possible data
retention or traffic analysis) for up to 11% of the traffic leaving and
entering the Tor network through exit nodes.

The function in this collusion network of the router identified as
TheGreatSantini is still undetermined. Its published exit policy, like
aala's, purported to reject all outproxy traffic, yet it hasn't been
observed acting as an outproxy as aala has. It may simply serve as an
intermediate router.

Due to the sheer amount of traffic apparently passing through this
collusion network, consolidation and analysis of exit node traffic is
only one of several forms of anonymity attacks made more feasible. Hence
these 9 routers appear to pose a significant anonymity threat to users
of the public Tor network.

Notes on select router descriptor fields:

  bandwidth <bandwidth-avg> <bandwidth-burst> <bandwidth-observed>

    Estimated bandwidth for this router, in bytes per second. The
"average" bandwidth is the volume per second that the OR is willing to
sustain over long periods; the "burst" bandwidth is the volume that the
OR is willing to sustain in very short intervals. The "observed" value
is an estimate of the capacity this server can handle. The server
remembers the max bandwidth sustained output over any ten second period
in the past day, and another sustained input. The "observed" value is
the lesser of these two numbers.

  uptime

    The number of seconds that this OR process has been running.
