As I recall, Adleman's DNA actually chugged away in a test tube computing
Hamiltonian Paths.

I look forward to news of Shapiro's DNA doing something similarly useful.

My favorite Weizmann Institute press release was the one about their
amazing discovery that electrons in a double slit experiment do not
produce an interference pattern when you observe which slit they go
through. (E. Buks et al., Nature, 26 Feb. 1998.)

Vulis lampooned this in a very funny spoof, in which the "Weizmann
Institute" announced the "amazing result" of a similar experiment with
photons.
