I worked with Bram and Zooko at Mojo Nation (where both BT and Mnet got 
their respective genesis) and was frankly surprised when the MPAA was so 
easily able to target and put out of commission BT's trackers.  The 
exposure of the trackers was a prominent topic of MN planning discussions 
and its odd that precautions, like distributing the tracker functions into 
clients or hiding them inside a TOR-like proxy network weren't taken earlier.
