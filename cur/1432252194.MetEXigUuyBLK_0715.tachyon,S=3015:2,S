Why beat around the Bush, the purpose of the press release
was to hype Bush's press conference tonight. Somebody
at the FBI was annoyed at having to cook up a dramatic
press release about nothing purely for show. Skyfall's a 
kissing cousin of Carnivore, that is to say, if you don't get 
that these names are used to embarrass upstairs assholes 
you don't deserve to know the truth.

It's like the FBI affidavit on the key logging system (KLS)
in the Scarfo case where a senior official is trucked in to
swear to something he knows little about in order to
convince the judge that withholding information is
necessary. The official's subordinates LTAO at the
turkey's gobbling the facts.

"Skyfall" like Carnivore, like KLS, like Infinite Justice, 
tells a truth of bureacracies indeed all large organizations, 
say, like the City of New York, that the titular leaders 
know only to puke in the prime minister's lap when
Sushied.
