There was a discussion (probably several) a few years ago on sci.crypt.
If you point at usenet and try lots of different combinations of keywords
I'm sure you'll find something.  Since I've never done it, I don't have
any direct references, I just remember some of the discussion.  A question
on sci.crypt might get you a lot too.

Patience, persistence, truth,
