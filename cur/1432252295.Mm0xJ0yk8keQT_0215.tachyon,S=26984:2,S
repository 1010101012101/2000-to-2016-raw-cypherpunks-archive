         Tom Camp, CEO of the Apogee Companies, Owned By Roy P. Disney,
          Accepts a Position on The Neptune Society's Board of Directors

        "The Board of Directors of any successful corporation must

        skills that are needed to run an organization in today's
        competitive environment. For The Neptune Society, this includes
        Directors with

        Director of Hanna Car Wash Systems International, LLC. Mr. Camp
        has also previously served as a Director of Micromonitors, Inc.

        "His background as an attorney and business executive, as well as
        his experience in private equity investments from both a legal
        and business perspective make him an incredible choice for this
        position on Neptune's Board of Directors,'' said David Schroeder,
        Neptune Society's President. "We are looking forward to working
        with Tom in the future, and being able to make full use of the

                            Neptune Society Highlights

                       *** Key Investment Considerations ***

        The Neptune Society® is the only public “pure play” in the
        cremation segment of the death-care services industry and the
        company benefits from extensive goodwill from its reputation and
        high visibility brand name built during its 27-year history.

        The Neptune Society recently received an 'Aggressive Buy'
        recommendation from Banyan Capital Markets with an $8 target
        price.

        The compelling value proposition for cremation is its simple,
        dignified, environmentally friendly and economical ($799 to
        $1,299) compared to ($5,000+) for a traditional burial service .

        Cremation service revenues were $2,242,000 for the three months
        that ended March 31, 2001 compared to $1,328,000 in 2000, nearly
        double the same period last year.

        The Neptune Society provided 6,639 cremations in 2000 and has
        already provided 5,098 in the first five months of 2001, that is
        double the same period last year with a very conservative
        projected total for 2001 to be approximately 7,400.

        The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled since 1999,
        has substantial industry expertise. The management has
        implemented a multi-pronged marketing strategy focused on selling
        “preened” cremation plans. Including direct sales over their Web
        site, the strategy also includes direct mail of approximately six
        million pieces being sent in 2001 and the support of five sales
        managers with approximately 200 independent, commission-only
        sales representatives providing follow-up.

        The Neptune Society serves customers in 35 major metro areas with
        16 offices located in 6 states (CA, FL, WA, OR, NY and IA),
        excluding the corporate offices and a dedicated “call center”
        with 20 telemarketers in Tempe, AZ.
