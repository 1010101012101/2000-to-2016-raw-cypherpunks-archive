Oh, I forgot their might be some other purpose for AWAC-type mapping of an 
urban area.

Although it's not too well known, McDonalds and other fast-food franchises 
actually have state-monitored radio-frequency 'beacons'. These beacons 
transmit at a special frequency that the brains of schizophrenics are very 
sensitive to, and that draws schizophrenics like flies. And if you've seen 
an inner-city McDonalds full of homeless and assorted schizos, its either 
because their transmitter has drifted out of spec, or they've deliberated 
boosted it up to increase sales.

So one purpose of those AWACs is obviously to map the fields of such 
transmitters. And its not the licensed ones they're worried about...imagine 
some 'terrorist' or other troublemaker getting one of those things and then 
cranking it up near some big political meeting, like G4 or whatever. (It's 
apparently happened on several occasions...apparently Woodstock was actually 
a pre-cmmmercial military test of the thing.)

Anyone know the frequency of that device? I think it it's the megahertz 
region, but don't quote me.
