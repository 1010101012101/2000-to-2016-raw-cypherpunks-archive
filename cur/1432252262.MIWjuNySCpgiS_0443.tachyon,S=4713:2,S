What I find incredibly myopic is the assumption that terrorists and other 
"bad actors" are likely to ue the services mentioned to facilitate their 
acts, whether good, bad, or fantasy.  I doubt that the targets are 
actually the proposed "bad actors" mentioned in the RFP, but believe that 
it is Joe Sixpack, Jane Minorcriminal, and John Protester who are the 
actual points of interest of the FBI and its [few, and all lettered] 
friends.

If we are really interested in bad actors of the classes suggested here, I 
think it's pretty much universally agreed that HUMINT is the standard 
bearer, and will remain so for the foreeable future - unless there is also 
some "plan" to have HUMINT tranliterated into Facebook and Twitter feeds, 
specifically to enable this kind of automated processing to proceed apace 
(*highly* doubtful, as such a plan would by definition require what is 
effectively a "public disclosure" of likely classified data streams from 
the various HUMINT sources).

Again, look not at what the elephant on your throat *says* she wants to 
accomplish, but look rather to the Military Industrial Software Complex 
for the Actual Truth - to be released every day, right after the 3 Minute 
Hate.
