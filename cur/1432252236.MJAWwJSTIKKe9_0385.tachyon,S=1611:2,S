Yes Tim, but as we happen to live in places where states make laws 
and employ men with guns to hurt us if we disobey those laws then 
we do have an interest (in the other sense) in who gets to run the

If you live next to the zoo you may be uninterested in the design 
of the lion's cage but you sure as hell aren't disinterested in it.
