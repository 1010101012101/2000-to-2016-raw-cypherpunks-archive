Thank you very much for this Message, Zenaan.
You are the voice of Suzie Dawson (suzi3d.com/), mine and many other
good-hearted People.

It's time for Actions. It's time to REVOLT against this INtollerable Evil
and INjustice against Appelbaum... against ALL THE HIGHER PRINCIPLES! It's
time (and it was since the first day of this smear campaign) to EXPOSE all
the scumbags who created the slander against Jake AND those who silently
accepted it
->
AND KICK THEIR FUCKEN ASSES OUT OF THE COMMUNITY!

___

Time to grow up folks. Own the damn mess. Clean up your shit. Get rid of
> those individuals who are evidently compromised in ways that can not be
> tolerated.

!!!

and we get either banned from the public discussion (Juan, Alex (afalex169)
> and others), OR booted from the community and Tor Inc with disgrace (Jacob
> Applebaum).
>

!!!

Yes, you sure do... plenty of work to clean up this mess -

!!!

in Tor Inc as well as any other corporation and

Tor Inc is not a "normal" company - none of you (employees of Tor Inc) are

And take good notice - it is perhaps most often your non-actions, which

Fail to meet our standard and you and your purported principles shall

Time to participate folks. Every one.
