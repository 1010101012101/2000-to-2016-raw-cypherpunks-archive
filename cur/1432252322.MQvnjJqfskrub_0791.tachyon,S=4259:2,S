Well, I might be willing to "condemn" the letter of May's post, but I'm not 
so sure about condemning the spirit of it.

Basically, if a newspaper claims to be doing objective reporting of the 
facts, and they then become merely an arm of 'law enforcement' (which in 
turn enforces the momentary whim of local dictators no longer constrained by 
law due to the 'Patriot Act'), then all hell's broken loose already. And 
while I can't get with the notion of killing somebody for doing something I 
don't like (unless they're trying to hurt me or my family), a brick through 
a window might be an appropriate response.
