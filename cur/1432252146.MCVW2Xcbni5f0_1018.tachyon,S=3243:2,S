So, how extensive is the database? Just locals?
If the person was never arrested, do they use
DMV photos?

#    
#    YBOR CAMERA FOLLOW UP
#    
#    Monday, July 2, 2001 In a follow up to a story we brought you 
#    about new surveillance cameras in Ybor City, Bay News 9 would 
#    like to apologize for an error in the on-line script.
#    
#    Police, using pole-mounted, remotely-controlled surveillance 
#    cameras, can now scan crowds of people and feed their digital 
#    images into a databank with the purpose of finding a match on 
#    anyone with an outstanding arrest warrant.
#    
#    In our original report, Bay News 9 inaccurately reported that 
#    the Visionics Corporation maintained the database.
#    
#    According to the company, the database is maintained by the 
#    Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and Tampa Police Department 
#    and only contains images of those wanted on outstanding warrants.
#    
#    We apologize and regret the error.

Declan, how did you find the Tampa story?
