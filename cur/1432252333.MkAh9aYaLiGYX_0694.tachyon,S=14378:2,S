I am much in sympathy with the "Give the market a chance." slogan.  But
TCPA/Palladium/DRM and Jack Valenti are not.  Nor are you.  Phillips could
make and sell a device, even the sort of trammeled computer that Jack
Valenti wishes to be universally imposed by law, within one year from
today.  Indeed, IBM, Sun, Apple, Dell, Sony, and any number of other
companies could have sold such a device any day they wished over the past
fifteen years.  Yet they have not.  So the market has decided, by your
standard.  The decision is clear: No DRM.

Of course, the minimal demand of the pro-DRM forces is to have root on
every machine in the world, with evasion of their root control a felony.

You support DRM lock stock and barrel, no matter your demonstrably
inaccurate claims that

1. You are all for the market.

2. Well, DRM is not so bad, see, RIAA-MPAA-AAP will give us all root on
their machines, so it is all equal!

3. Why, your computer will be exactly the same under DRM as it is today,
except better!

Today Microsoft and its script children have root on many machines, yet
there is no single root password for them.  Rather there is a system, which
includes

1. agreements with Dell, IBM, etc., to only offer for sale hardware with Microsoft OSes loaded

2. hardware that only runs right with a Microsoft OS

3. extortionate forced "license agreements" with end-users

4. hypnotic control of the mass media, which always claim that "After all,
you will have to run only Microsoft OSes forever."

5. hypnotic control of the managers who "decide" which OS to run, which
managers always claim that "After all, we have to run only Microsoft OSes
forever."

Of course, this hypnosis is mainly self-hypnosis, with only trim-tab level
direction by Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Sun, Apple, etc..

oo--JS.
