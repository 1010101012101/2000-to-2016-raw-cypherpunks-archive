"In a recent cost-benefit analysis, the US Government Accountability
Office rated the ADS worst out of eight non-lethal weapons currently
in development."

This assures maximum tax-rathole on the principle that no combo
has ever wasted more money than ineffectual military dorks and
armaments that are not designed to live up to their promise and
stay within first budgets, you death on industrial scale, why then
place no limits on cost. Hark, WMDs have brokeback the US and
USSR, and about to do the same to the little copyists.

Wait, that assertion excludes religion, education, capitalism
and our beloved hot-shit internet which is absolutely certain,
so it is said often in this esteemed forum, to free the oppressed
from the four thousand horseturds of .mil, .god, .edu. .com.

How many times, oh lord, must it be said, there is no security,
not a jottle. You got tranquillity and money, they will be taken
from you by force. That is a fairy tale, honey, to keep you scared
enough to buy protection from friendlies: dot-MGEC.
