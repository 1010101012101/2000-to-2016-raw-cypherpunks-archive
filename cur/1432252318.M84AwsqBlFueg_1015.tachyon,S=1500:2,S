....if America were tempted to ''become the dictatress of the world, she 
would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.'' What empires lavish 
abroad, they cannot spend on good republican government at home: on 
hospitals or roads or schools. A distended military budget only aggravates 
America's continuing failure to keep its egalitarian promise to itself.
-- John Quincy Adams (extended)
