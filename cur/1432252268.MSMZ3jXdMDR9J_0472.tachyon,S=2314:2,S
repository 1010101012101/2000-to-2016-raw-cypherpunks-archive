If I had record like Saddam's on me?

Gee, I'd be real happy I wasn't shot on the spot, or maybe cruelly 
tortured and then shot, the way I'd behaved to people I'd captured.
Or maybe torn into pieces by a shrieking mob.

Instead of doing any of that, they check my teeth and give me a haircut
in front of the cameras? Boo fucking hoo. I'd be real happy about 
millions of bleeding hearts all over the world jerking their knees in 
unison, ready to cry a fucking ocean over this unbelievably cruel 
haircut and medical check-up I'm being given. Fucking tools.
