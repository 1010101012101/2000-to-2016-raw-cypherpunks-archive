Actually, if you were an Etruscan, between spouse-swapping :-), you would
have created a bearer instrument, clay, metal, whatever, like *they*
eventually did. So, too, did various Mesopotamians, and before anyone else,
including the Chinese. (cf. "A History of Money", by Davies).

In the meantime, livestock work quite well in small agrarian groups, as
your average Masai (or Proto-Indo-European, or proto-Texan, for that
matter...), might have told you.


Cheers,
RAH
