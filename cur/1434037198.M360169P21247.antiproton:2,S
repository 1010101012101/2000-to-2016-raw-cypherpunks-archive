I've been following this since it was posted.  Speaking as someone who 
doesn't trust anyone in the employ of the US of Corporatocracy: while it 
piques my interest enough to suspend my disbelief a little to see where it 
is headed, you lost me me with that last paragraph.

Without something to back it up, I just can't buy that we're living in a 
1984/Truman Show construct.  I know I'm not the only one on these lists who 
enjoys the dark utopia and Cyberpunk genres of fiction, so if you're 
testing out ideas you'll find plenty of eager readers.  But call it that, ffs.

No links to source, nothing but fantastic (albeit interesting) 
descriptions... throw us a bone, sir, or I must call BS.
