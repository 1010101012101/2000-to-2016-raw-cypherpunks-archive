I don't think Godwin would agree.  Godwin's Law is a natural law of Usenet
named after Mike Godwin (godwin@eff.org) concerning Usenet "discussions".
It reads, according to the Jargon File: As a Usenet discussion grows longer,
the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.

Claims that it is a debate-ender are add-ons.
