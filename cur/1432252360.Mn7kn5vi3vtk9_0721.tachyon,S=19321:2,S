A trial date of October 9th, 2002 has been set for three of the remaining 
Republican Convention Defendants.
In August of 2000, when the Republican Convention met in Philadelphia, 
local activists invited their friends to be out in the streets protesting 
the Republicans' abysmal stance on criminal justice issues.
Over 400 of the protestors were arrested, and three of them are still 
awaiting trial. Eric Steinberg, Darby Landy, and Camilo (pronounced 
Camille) Viveiros were charged with conspiracy and violations against then 
police chief John Timoney.
Lawyers for the "Timoney 3," as they have been called, attempted to reduce 
the charges, which initially included conspiracy charges and a felony 
assault charge against community organizer Camilo Viveiros.
Initially court proceedings went well, and in October of 2000 some charges 
were dropped. In December of 2001 however, Mr. Viveiros's attorney Robert 
Levant recieved the bad news that the superior court of Pennsylvania had 
restored the charges, including the first degree felony assault.
An appeal was immediately filed with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
On Friday July 12th attorney Bob Levant was told that the appeal had not 
been accepted. All three defendants now face trial on October 9th, 2002.
Supporters for Camilo hope that friends and supporters will come to 
Philadelphia for the trial. Nore importantly, however, immediate actions 
can be taken to see that justice prevails.
Camilo is facing serious charges and the possibility of a long prison 
sentece. His friends are asking all concerned and compassionate people to 
help by educating others about the case, raising money for the legal 
defense fund, writing letters to Philadelphia publications expressing 
concern about the case, and writing letters, in care of Friends of Camilo, 
to Judge Yohn to be used at the appropriate time in the trial.
Help educate about the case by tabling at events and conferences, hosting a 
panel or discussion, or organzing a fund-raiser or other event to raise 
awareness.
If you were at the Republican convention protests and were near Latimer 
(near Walnut) and 17th at the time of the arrest you can help by contacting 
the legal defense team.
If you are a writer or journalist you can help by writing a story, an 
opinion piece, a letter to the editor or interviewing people involved with 
the case.
If you are part of an organization, a faith- based group, a radical 
network, or a concerned community it is helpful to write a sign-on letter 
on behalf of your group.
Local supporters can attend a legal update and letter writing event on 
Thursday, Aug. 22 at the Aspace, 4722 Baltimore Avenue in West Philadelphia 
at 7:30pm.
Guidelines for letter writing and information packets about the case will 
be available.

how the kind of work he does is so useful and necessary to society. E.G. 
“Proceeding with the prosecution of these charges would constitute a great 
disservice not only to Camilo and everybody that is lucky enough to know 
him, but to a society that is already suffering from a serious shortage of 
people as passionate and committed as Camilo.” Tom O’Brien, former 
co-working, MAHT
=================================
Biography of Camilo Viveiros Jr.
Camilo Viveiros was born in 1971 to immigrant parents from the Azores, 
Portugal. Before immigrating to Southeastern Massachusetts, his parents led 
an agrarian life in the Azores, a small group of islands in the Atlantic 
between Portugal and the U.S. Raised in the closely-knit Portuguese 
community of Fall River, Massachusetts, Camilo was taught from an early age 
that strong family ties and support were more important than the size of a 
bank account. Through their example, his parents instilled in their son a 
commitment to sharing generously with others -- important values in an 
extended family without large paychecks. Both of Camilo's parents worked 
blue-collar jobs -- his mother, working for over forty years in the garment 
industry, while his father worked his whole life as a laborer.
Camilo was arrested on August 1st, 2000, during demonstrations in 
Philadelphia highlighting national mispriorities of putting the profits of 
the few over the needs of public. In particular that day of protests was 
focused on the number one growth industry in the U.S. the prison and 
criminal justice industries. While more and more prisons are being built, 
funding for education, healthcare, affordable housing and decent jobs are 
being cut. As the regional organizer in southeastern Massachusetts and Cape 
Cod for the Mass Alliance of HUD Tenants, he works to assist mostly elderly 
and disabled tenants who are endangered by rent increases to form tenant 
associations and stop evictions. He had come to Philadelphia in that 
capacity, to represent the concerns of these tenants and to address call 
attention to the lack of support for low and moderate income people in 
general.
Until his arrest, Camilo has been involved in work for social justice 
virtually without a break. This dedication to helping those who have 
"fallen through the cracks" made itself known early on in his youth. During 
his high school years he began by volunteering as a caregiver, choosing the 
settings in which he could help those who were most overlooked. In his 
teens he spent time volunteering on a suicide hotline, giving attention to 
people who called in their worst moments of crisis. Believing he should try 
to contribute to the welfare of others before graduating high school, he 
dedicated time to distributing food to those in need. "Camilo is always 
looking after the underdog," his friend, David Malone, says of those years. 
"In high school he took time out to befriend others, who were being made 
fun of, because he has a big heart." After high school Camilo worked in 
group homes with developmentally disabled adults, assisting residents with 
their everyday needs to "make a little positive difference in their lives". 
Shawn Mills a co-worker of Camilo's at a group home for the developmentally 
disabled seniors said "Camilo always treated clients with respect, he spoke 
to them as peers and recognized them as unique individuals."
During his college years and in his professional work, Camilo has continued 
to devote his time to help people in impoverished communities to attain 
basic survival needs, from food and housing to environmental health and 
protection from domestic violence. This caring has been expressed through 
his work with myriad grassroots community organizations, several of which 
he helped to found. During college he worked in the local rape crisis 
center, assisting those who had been sexually assaulted to find services 
and counseling. Also while in college, he co-founded the Progressive 
Student Alliance, whose members struggled to increase financial aid funding 
and preserve programs to support immigrant and first-generation American 
students. Also, during these years, Camillo began what would become a 
lifelong commitment to ending homelessness and increasing the availability 
of affordable housing. He co-founded the national organization Empty The 
Shelters (Fill the Homes), which helped students and youth contribute to 
the efforts of welfare rights organizations and unions of the homeless.
Camilo's commitment to empowering communities in need has continued in his 
professional work. Yet his activism as an adult has not been limited to his 
paid work. As one example, he helped to mobilize a mostly Cambodian and Lai 
neighborhood in Fall River, Massachusetts, to pressure the city to shut 
down a toxic incinerator. Ed Duran, who was part a the coalition effort, 
commented, "Camilo is always thinking about how to broaden community 
participation He helped increase participation by simply going 
door-to-door. Residents responded to his approachable and humble character 
and with more community support we eventually got the incinerator shut 
down. " Again and again, both his professional colleagues and the community 
residents he works with describe Camilo's manner and organizing style as 
unique, marked by his belief in each person's human dignity and his soft 
spoken support. Efforts by police administrators to portray Camillo as 
violent or thuggish contradict sharply with the experiences of the elderly 
and disabled tenants, religious, labor and community leaders who have come 
to know him. As Gary Hicks, one public housing tenant who has witnessed 
Camilo's efforts, says, "Camilo constantly builds up tenants' 
self-confidence through his gentle encouragement". "All of Camilo's caring 
community work and sensitivity for some of our most vulnerable community 
members does not match who police officers claim he is," says his partner, 
Mimi Budnick. "Camilo has spent much of his life trying his best to play a 
positive role in others' lives. We will not allow an inaccurate impression 
of him to be accepted. We're confident that the more others get to know 
him, the more people will understand why this violent portrayal just 
doesn't ring true."
Background Information on Camilo
Camilo Viveiros Jr., a social justice activist who resides in New England, 
has been singled out and villianized by the most powerful law enforcement 
official in Philly, police commissioner Timoney. The Philly Commissioner of 
police testified against Camilo Viveiros at his pretrial on August 9th.
Camilo went to the Institute for Social Ecology for two summers and has 
made visits back to this area to keep in touch with other activists.
He has worked with Vermont activists in the mid 90's going up to Canada to 
stop the creation of a Hydro Quebec dam on Innu land. He participated in a 
non-violent blockade and was arrested with Vermonters defending the 
sovereignty of the Innu people from ecological genocide.
Through the years Camille has co-founded a variety of grassroots social 
justice groups ranging from Empty the Shelters in Oakland to Homes not 
Jails in Boston to community coalitions to stop incinerators, stop the 
construction of an outfall pipe on indigenous land, end the use of 
chaingangs etc. etc.
The Commissioners attempt to put Camille behind bars is a clear attack on 
the continually growing momentum of large direct action demonstrations.
Camille has been committed to the use of civil disobedience for years. 
Putting an end to the movement means that our opposition will want to scare 
people off by marginalizing people like Camilo.
Camille has always believed that the power of the people lay in passionate 
activists successfully building the support of ordinary people. This 
situation is no different. He recognizes that the City of Philly has sent a 
clear message to the core of long time activists who came to Philly. What 
needs to be done now is to broaden our support. Any community organization 
that looks into it's history, has to acknowledge that there was a time when 
authorities attempted to marginalize and in fact criminalize their 
activities: religious freedom, women's ability to vote, the emancipation of 
people of color from slavery, labors' protection of working people, 
"disabled" peoples' access to public buildings etc. All those movements 
have gone through times when their activists where painted as villains and 
violent trouble makers.
We need to reach out to community members and remind them of the past and 
invite their contemporary solidarity.
