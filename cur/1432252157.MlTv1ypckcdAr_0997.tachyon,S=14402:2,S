1 June 2004 - U.K. armed services raise threat level to "severe"

According to a report by Air Security, U.K. armed services officials raised
the threat level for U.K. military installations to "severe" after receiving
intelligence that terrorists with links to al-Qaeda are planning to stage
suicide truck bomb attacks against a U.K. military base within the next two
months. Military officials stated that terrorists are planning to drive a
truck packed with explosives into military headquarters. The intelligence
indicated London is a particular target, as are upcoming D-Day celebrations.



1 June 2004 - Assassination Plans Found On Internet

ASSASINATION PLANS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA'S MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR Prince
Nayif Bin-Abd-al-Aziz were discovered by Northeast Intelligence Network
analysts and submitted to the appropriate authorities.

As first reported on The Roth Show, a syndicated radio program based in
Spokane, Washington, the highly detailed plans are calling for the operation
to take place this Friday, June 4, 2004 using rocket propelled grenades
while the Prince is in transit.

The plans, authored by Abu Hajar Abdel Aziz al-Moqrin, the leader of al
Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and the man who claimed responsibility for the attack
on the residential complex in Saudi Arabia last Saturday, outlined Prince
Nayif's itinerary, manner and route of travel, personal security, and
planned method of attack using rocket propelled grenades.

The detailed plans were found in Issue 11 of Camp al Battar, a well known
military-style training manual referenced by terrorists and published
regularly on an elusive Internet forum. The translated communication can be
found at www.homelandsecurityus.com in addition to the audio statement of
Abu Hajar Abdel Aziz al-Moqrin claiming responsibility for the attack at
APICORP in Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

Translated from Arabic:

    The target: Nayef Bin Abdul Aziz. He will attend a reception of external
security personel in a secret visit of the queen at King Khaled
International Airport.

    Specification of the target: Nayef Bin Abd Al-Aziz Al Saud .

    Personal information:

    Name: Nayef Bin Abd Al-Aziz Al Saud .

    Age: 71 years born in 1933.

    Position: the Saudi Minister of Interior.

    Residence address: the Gardens - several palaces (the present palace in
Arqa, also the Mother's palace, and several other palaces that he
frequents).

    Daily routine: He goes to sleep shortly before dawn, and goes to the
ministry some days at 7 o'clock at night until eight thirty, resting in the
evenings, and attending parties, and private meetings.

    Number of guards: 8 persons

    Typed of armament: light .

    The guards can be targeted as they descend from the care; they are near
but not too close.

    The movement of the procession: it blocks off the roads, and they drive
the target car in the midst of the procession with similar cars possibly to
provide a camouflage procession.

    The guarding crew breaks up any surveillance.

    The guarding crew varies the route at times..

    The number of guarding cars in the procession: (not less than ten cars
and their job is to opened the highway). The first car, with the oscillation
light, then the cars for personal protection, then the cars in which the
targets are found which are probably similar in color and model and without
numbers or with similar numbers to the protection cars, then the patrol cars
that close the procession. Sometimes there is a smaller procession without
the target that moves in side streets.

    The target changes its car.

    Mostly uses the same car, which is not easy to approach since the
highways are closed.

    Route information: From Arqa palace to the airport, 40 kilos.

    Route Description: From Arqa, take the western circular, then the
northern circular, then the airport highway, with the probability of moving
onto other roads:

    (Arqa - Khris highway, Jabber Alsabah's highway, the northern circular,
the airport highway).

    (Arqa - Ad Dir Iyah, Alamaria parting, then move in an easterly
direction and return to the specialize route to the airport highway ).

    Schedule

    The time of departure for the reception: on 15 / 4 / 1425 AH

    The departure time: at six at night .

    The arrival time: 25 minutes after 6 .

    The side streets: many sides streets come from the circular exits ( 4 -
5 - 6 - 7 ) and from them (the western gates of King Saud University)
(Prince Abdullah Highway ) .

    The bridges: the field linking between the northern circular and the
circular extension east of the Airport Highway.

    Places where the cars can park, and deserted places: there are none.

    There are many turns: Among them the turn of the circular on the western
meeting the northern circular, and the turn of the circular northern meeting
to the eastern, and there are moderately thick trees and gardens and
football playing fields.

    There is a high building of several floors belonging to the Sabk
company, and the Imam University buildings, and there are trees in the
moderate island separating between the two ways, which are good for the
invisibility and ambushes and at the entrance to the airport highway there
is a gate which can be closed.

    After the target has been specified, the command began issuing orders to
the concerned leaders, dividing the operation into several stages:

    The first stage: the specification of the target. This stage is
complete.

    The second stage: the collection of the information. This stage is
complete also.

    The third stage: Determining the way of killing (the explosives), and it
will be with the explosions in the procession during the passing of the
procession at the bottom of the bridge linking the northern circular and the
eastern one, and on the sides of the highway at the turn, beginning with the
emergence of the group of confirmation and the destruction, with the
assurance of killing them, or it may be carried out with the use of
anti-armament missiles.

At this point, it is impossible to determine if this is an actual
assassination plan, or some sort of hoax. The fact that it was published in
issue 11 of Al Battar, a known Al Qaeda publication that has proved credible
in the past, and that it was written by Abu Hajar Abdel Aziz Al Moqrin (see
article below) certainly lends a degree of urgency to this information.

The level of detail of the information in the "plan" is very high and shows
the results of extensive surveilance of the individual named as the target.
However, it must also be taken into consideration that Abu Hajar has changed
pertinant details prior to publication. It is possible that the target of
the attack is a different member of the Saudi royal family.

A posting on the Al Qal'ah forum this morning refers to a "big surprise"
coming in the next week for Saudi Prince Mohamed Bin Fahd, son of the
current Saudi king.

The Al Battar article specifies the date of June 4, 2004, for the attack.
Since that is just a few days away, we are posting the relevant material in
hopes that the attack will be thwarted by authorities.

Law enforcement, diplomatic, and other security personnel who need access to
the original documents we translated should contact our director at
dhagmann@adelphia.net.

1 June 2004 - Who is Abu Hajar Abdel Aziz al Moqrin

Throughout the past few months, a new Al Qaeda militant has emerged to the
forefront in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Abu Hajar Abdel Aziz al Moqrin is
widely recognized as the leader of Al Qaeda operations in Saudi Arabia. He
has claimed responsibility for this weekend's attack on the Oasis
residential complex in Khobar, and for the attack on the Yanbo petroleum
facility a few weeks ago.

But little has been published about this militant. What exactly is known
about him?

Abu Hajar, or Hajar's father, first made his public appearance on the scene
in the Badr al Riyadh videos, released by Al Qaeda in the winter of 2004,
and commemorating the Ramadan attacks in Riyadh in November of 2003.

According to the semi-official biography published by Al Qaeda, Abu Hajar
has spent the last 16 years of his life in the service of Al Qaeda. Abu
Hajar, who is reportedly 33 years old, has "served" in combat in Bosnia,
Algeria, and Somalia, before assuming the reins of the operation in Saudi
Arabia.

Abu Hajar was sentenced to four years of prison in Saudi Arabia, and was
released after 2 years, with the sentence reduced for "good behavior". He
assumed control of the Saudi operations after the death of the previous
leader in a shootout last year.

Moqrin dropped out of school at the age of 17, and went to Afghanistan,
purportedly to join in the fight against the Soviet Union. He apparently
received his paramilitary jihad training in the Al Qaeda training camps of
Afghanistan. According to reports, he was in Afghanistan for four years,
from 1990 - 1994.

While in Afghanistan, he was responsible for training operations in the
"Governor's Camp" near the city of Khost, Afghanistan, and was also involved
in numerous combat operations. He left Afghanistan in 1994 to move to
Algeria, to help train the Islamic insurgents in that country.

After leaving Algeria, Abu Hajar went to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he
again was active in the training of militants as well as in combat
operations.

He returned to Saudi Arabia, then made his way through Yemen, and on to
Somalia where he fought with the militant groups against the Ethiopian
forces. He was arrested in Somalia, and extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he
was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released after two years on
"good behavior".

A month after his release, he made his way back to Yemen, and then to
Afghanistan in 2001.There he joined combat operations with the Taliban
against the American troops. After the fall of the Taliban, he returned to
Saudi Arabia, to his home in the Swedish district of Riyadh.

He immediately became involved in the establishment of jihad training camps
in the middle and western regions of Saudi Arabia. When Khaled Al Bin Al Haj
was killed on March 15 in a shootout with the Saudi security forces, Abu
Hajar assumed leadership of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Abu Hajar was raised in the city of Riyadh. He is a high school dropout. He
was married at the age of 19, and has one child (currently 10 years old)
with this wife. According to the biography, Abu Hajar remarried without the
knowledge of his family, and had a second child, who died before the age of
2.
