On the other hand, see this article (from slashdot):

http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23412867-details/Tens+of+thousands+of+CCTV+cameras%2C+yet+80%25+of+crime+unsolved/article.do

(or http://tinyurl.com/2n6zrz)

"A comparison of the number of cameras in each London borough with the

to catch offenders in areas with hundreds of cameras than in those
with hardly any".
