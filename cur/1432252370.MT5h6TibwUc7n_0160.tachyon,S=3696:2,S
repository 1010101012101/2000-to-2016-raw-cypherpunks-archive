Do a little research, man.  Clear Channel denied this,
and even posted a luke-warm press release about it.  Do a simple
search at groups.google.com , you'll see about a thousand
different messages in different forums where this 
was discussed.

I'm not saying it's a hoax, but there's a lot more to
the story (or a lot less) than the month-old message
you circulated.  Better luck next time...
