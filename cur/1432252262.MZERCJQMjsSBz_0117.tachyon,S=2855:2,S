   Democrats were the most strident critics of that decision. Barney
   Frank (D-Massachusetts) said: "What we have today is an outrageous

>But this is the way the best police states are established: quickly, out of the light of day, and with muted dissent.

>It's what many of my friends have been hoping for. Only a complete fascist takeover can trigger the eventual collapse.
