Um, he's not *advocating*.  He pointed out that such systems were
inevitable.

He was pointing to a primitive culture that had just discovered metal
smelting and gunpowder and
remarked that the the petty feudal barons who intimidated the sheeple
with swords and horses were
going to see interesting times.

"Reminds me of when a sociologist was interviewing a southern farmer:
Why do you think the murder rate is higher in the south?
I guess more southerners need killin'." (as told by Aaron Evans)

A primer on Rand and initiation of force for a jury of proles?   Hoo
hah.

Most of us would say that stink bombing the IRS (which got Mr B noticed)
was inappropriate.
Or at least inadequately covert, as he got caught.  Some would even
call for something more brisant or acetylcholinesterase inhibiting than
a stink bomb.
Whatever.  JB's troubles aren''t about AP except that it sounds scary.

Maybe the stinkbomb was a publicity stunt for AP.

Its possible that even Jim Bell wasn't responsible for his actions,
which might have been a good defense once, but folks don't
like to consider themselves (in the words of Teddy K.) "sickies".

He hasn't set up a site.  He wrote a whitepaper, a technical report.
IIRC someone
else (Toto?) set up an inert mock site.
