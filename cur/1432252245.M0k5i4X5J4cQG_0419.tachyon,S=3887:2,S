Wow, you're related to the Amish? 

Anyway the English :-) may make exceptions for the Amish, but generally,
and even in rural america, you can't sell a house for human (chiiiildren)
occupation
that's not wired for classical infrastructure ---water, wires, N lbs/ft^2. 

[Just another example of the state rape of property rights which I do not
defend]

Rural folks may get away with more slack, but only because they may not be
caught.
Simple example: No matter how rural you are, a single cat-tail gives the
ARmy Corps of Engrs
'rights' to control the use of that 'wetland'; however this is hard to
enforce universally because
the Army Corps doesn't have access to 10 cm spy satellites to survey every
farm.  [not intending
to start an ecological flame]
