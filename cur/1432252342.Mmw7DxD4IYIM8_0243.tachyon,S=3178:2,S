A prime example of machine counting being unreliable.

#
#    The county withdrew early-voting and absentee ballots Tuesday
#    night after officials discovered a glitch in the computers used
#    to tally votes. The machines would not read ballots carrying
#    straight-party ticket votes that also included at least one vote
#    for a candidate from another party, election officials said.
#
#    The machines' supplier blamed the problem on how county officials
#    programmed the machines.
