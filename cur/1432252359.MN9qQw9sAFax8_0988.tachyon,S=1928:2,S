Sir, I do not own a cellphone.

Do any models let YOU decide to send your location to ANOTHER
phone?   Do any models even let YOU know your OWN approx location
(to within that 100m Fedfascist standard)?

I'm fully aware the pigs track you unless the battery is removed or you
have a TEMPEST case.  I'm suggesting that regular citizens will have
access to that, if (in my cluelessness) they don't already.
