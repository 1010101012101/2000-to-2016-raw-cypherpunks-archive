No he can't.  What hackeddomain.com is sending is the certificate for 
hackeddomain.com which does not contain the host name www.amazon.com.
Therefore, it won't be accepted by the client.

If hackeddomain.com acts as a proxy, then the certificate that is
received by the client is the real one from www.amazon.com and so the
session is protected.  You can't have it both ways.
