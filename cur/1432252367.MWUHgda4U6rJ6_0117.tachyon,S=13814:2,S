mirimir - you prove you know what was in the mind of the filmmaker and then
prove that the overriding factor in any documentary is absolutely what was
in the mind of the filmmaker

could it possible be that the story matters more than the filmmaker - ya
think maybe ? maybe possibly ?

plus your 'proposiition' is not evidence - its no excuse for him exploiting
a dead body anyway

people when you are an ethical journalist you are careful not to exploit
images of children, people that are unconscious etc as they do not have a
say in the image content - if this is breeched it is possible they are
being exploited but to then place oneself in the frame is just beyond all
of that even - that is totally unethical
