RE: persuasive speechesHello, for what it's worth, you may plagiarize =
from here:
     IMHO, computer-related issues that involve an ethical dilemma are=20
worthy of discussion among laymen and computer specialists alike.=20
Particularly such discussions among computer-related specialists should =
be=20
pursued because computer applications are almost ubiquitous in our urban =

lives (and will continue to pervade our environment, even as part of our =

clothes, and our very bodies.) So yeah ethics should be important for=20
computer specialists, students and teachers.=20

     Another field that has dropped its interest in the ethical =

users.=20

We don't want to see this happen in the field of computer science and =
its=20
applications. At worst, these ethical discussions can't hurt.=20

     Now regarding the question of downloads, I've missed the thread, =
but I=20
wish to express that the intellectual property issue is mostly a hoax, =
and a=20
falacious concept that serves only to maximize the profits of the=20
entertainment industries.=20

     Many aesthetes and philosophers (Popper, Foucault, Barthes, Jung,=20
Althussere &c.) have pointed out that ideas (which translate into =
popular=20
culture) arise from clich=E9s, archetypes and memes that are shared =
throughout=20
our culture, and have been circulating and roaming around our collective =

cultural consciousness for centuries. These ideas are simply the =
recycled=20
riffs, proverbs, motifs, themes, folk tales and poetry, melodies, hopes =
and=20
fear, and indeed the entirety of human experience since the beginning of =

history.=20

     Moreover, I also would like to note that once you issue a song or a =

poem, it is no longer yours. It is released into popular consciousness.=20

     The notion of royalties is laughable really.=20

     As to the ethics of intellectual property, well it is again my =
personal=20
opinion that popular artists are overrated, their wages are overrated=20
(especially now that art and culture have been on the decline in quality =
for=20
over two decades,) and the videos, books, dvds, and cds are overpriced =
by=20
the entertainment industry.=20

     I believe that true artists do wish that their art be shared by =
all,=20
and for free. A musician's living would be more rightfully earned from =
live=20
gigs, session work wages, contracts with distributors etc. But this =
concept=20
of royalties is a cheat at best.=20

     Having said all this, I encourage others to use Napster (while it =
is=20
still free,) and to use Gnutella when Napster caves in to corporate =
lustre.=20
