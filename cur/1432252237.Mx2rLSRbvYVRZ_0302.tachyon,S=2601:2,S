Crypto-anarchy is in fact not really anarchy, since it only addresses 
some kinds of authority, ie government, and only in certain situations. 
True anarchy involves the dissolution of other hierarchical relationships,
including those that spring from private property. Get rid of private 
property and many of these problems disappear.

I believe that the standard argument is "Eliminate the commons." (by 
auctioning off to the highest bidder perhaps)
