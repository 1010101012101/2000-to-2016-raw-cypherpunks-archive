Hi folks,

You're getting this mail because you've registered a Tor server. Thanks
for contributing to the Tor network! We've been getting a lot of nodes
lately from people saying they're happy Tor exists because now they can
publish anonymously, reach websites that are blocked from their country,
etc etc. This is all possible because of people like you.

There are two parts to this mail: (1) asking how Tor servers are doing
and reminding you to upgrade / restart them, and (2) asking you to
prepend some more exit policy lines in their torrc.

****** Part one: ******

If your Tor server has crashed and you haven't noticed, please notice,
and consider upgrading to at least 0.0.9.3 and restarting it. :) If it
was running 0.0.9.3 when it crashed, please let me know of any hints
(e.g. core files and error messages) you might have for us.

If you've turned off your Tor server because it's eating too much of your
bandwidth/CPU, please consider setting BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst
and starting it up again. Bandwidth limiting also limits the cpu use,
since it's tied to how many bytes you process. Even cable and DSL
rates are usable and useful to us. Also, note that we've implemented
Hibernation, which lets you set a maximum number of bytes to handle per
day/week/month, and your server goes to sleep in between. Let me know if
you need help choosing good configuration parameters; I'm happy to help.

If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try the code in CVS:
http://tor.eff.org/developers.html
It hasn't crashed on us lately, and it uses pthreads rather than forking
so the "using lots of memory for each dnsworker" problem should be
resolved. We'll be putting out an actual package for 0.1.0-alpha in a
week or two, if you prefer to wait.

If you're feeling adventurous and still have bandwidth to spare, feel free
to set your BandwidthRate to something higher than the 780 KB default.
http://serifos.eecs.harvard.edu:8000/cgi-bin/exit.pl?sortbw=1 shows the
daily top servers by usefulness, for those with a competitive streak. :)

And if you have any wishlist items or other comments, we'd love to
hear them.

****** Part two: ******

In the past weeks, file-sharing has been pummeling the Tor network:
http://www.noreply.org/tor-running-routers/

While we don't have any legal or moral opinions about this particular
traffic, we need to take technical measures to make the network usable
again. One solution would be to enumerate the ten or so ports that
we know we want to accept, and reject the rest. We may end up needing
to do that, but we'd like to try an intermediate approach first. So,
please prepend the following line to your exit policy, by putting this
line in your torrc file:

ExitPolicy reject *:4661-4666,reject *:6346-6429,reject *:6881-6999

There's no need to do this if you're a middleman node, or your chosen
exit policy already rejects these. But otherwise, please do it even
if you personally do not mind carrying traffic for these ports: Tor's
architecture means that most of the hops in the circuit don't know what
traffic they're carrying, and at least for now we'd like to crank down
the overall bandwidth used by applications on these ports. Hopefully in
the future we'll have a better (e.g. more decentralized) Tor that can
handle it, but there's no point letting the network die in the meantime.

Thanks!
--Roger
