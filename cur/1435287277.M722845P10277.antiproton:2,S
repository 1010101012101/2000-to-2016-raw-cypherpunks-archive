	L, perhaps you are not yet appreciating the true nature of
	american oligarchy.

	doing another!"

	In a parallel universe in which we're overdosing on LSD, maybe
	he does. But in the real world...

	That's pure terrorist talk. 'Official' terrorism of course.
	Bottom line being : because of microsoft, NATIONAL SECURITY is
	at risk.

	Curiously enough, they don't bother to mention that microsoft is
	a monopoly thanks to the state granted privileges of 'patents'
	and 'copyright'.

Cartman: 	I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by
some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew
one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same
time, act like it doesn't want to. You people who are for the war, you
need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made
of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need
these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing
but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why
the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having
your cake and eating it too." 

Randy: 	He's right. The strength of this country is the ability
to do one thing and say another.
