This would let us "whiten" entropy with confidence.  Now we just
assume without really knowing that feeding everything through SHA1 is
a good idea; that is, the mapping of input strings to the resulting
hash string is even.  (This is different from the "can't find a
collision" property.  Even if that property doesn't hold, so long as
the probability of each resulting hash is about the same, it will work
fine as an entropy whitener.)

The term "random" may be misleading.  What they are likely close to
proving is that the occurences of any given string of bits is evenly
distributed.

This does not mean it is a good encryption algorithm.  For example, if
it turns out that given a sequence of bits it's easy to find the
places in pi where they appear, you have a good known plaintext
attack.

However, if in addition it was shown to be impossible to do this, we
would have something neat and very important - a provably strong
encryption algorithm.  My guess is that this is a ways off, if it's
even possible.
