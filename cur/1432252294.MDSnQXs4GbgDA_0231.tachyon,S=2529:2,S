DCF Quoth:

>>The name came into use when Osama used his cash to bankroll a series
of
bases in Pakistan to assist fighters on their way Afghanistan to fight
the
Commies.  He used the opportunity to collect a rather valuable direct
marketing list of somme 40,000 names and addresses of dedicated
Musselman
Warriors for future use.  Wonder what dbase software he uses?<<

*Obviously* Osama uses Oracle, because he and Larry Ellison are
Well-Known Evil Persons.
