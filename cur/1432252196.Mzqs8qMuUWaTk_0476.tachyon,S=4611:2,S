Jeesus that's naive.

What makes you think that new regime who used your tool to take over won't
then shoot you and take 'your profits'. By participating you may in fact
be signing your own death warrant.

The highest bidders are going to be the ones with the most money at the
tiem of the auction. Whether they gained that money by selfish/altruistic
or good/bad reasons is relativistic. Further, to assume that the profits 
go to the 'bad guys w/ selfish reasons' a priori is just begging the
question. Or is your thesis that the optimal market strategy is to be a
'bad guy w/ selfish reasons'? If so, you need to review that Galtian
utopia.
