My guess would be that microwaving them will not help. Microwaves heat
up moist things by starting electric currents in them. Anthrax spores
are not moist and probably will not even heat up.

Try your regular stove. Set it to, say, 400 degrees and pray that the papers
will remain legible. I'd prbobably be more likely to be attacked by meteorites
or abducted by aliens than be anthraxed via mail, but *if* I had to sterilize mail,
I would use a stove.
