Thus spake Steve Thompson (steve49152@yahoo.ca) [25/11/04 10:17]:
: You're dreaming.  People simply do not learn from history.

People /do/ learn from history.

But most people never bother learning history, period, and many of those
that do believe that their situation is different.  And...

: Never mind the fact that the historical record is largely incomplete and
: of course written by the victors; what does survive in the history of the
: species entirely fails to teach individuals and cultures the errors of
: primitive and barbaric ways.
