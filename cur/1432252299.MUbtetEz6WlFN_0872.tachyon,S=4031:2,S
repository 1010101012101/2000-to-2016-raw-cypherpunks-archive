(Tim and "Riad S. Wahby" <rsw@mit.edu> have been discussing
mail formats for PGP.)

Riad's latest message worked fine - it's the first time in a while I've seen
Mutt sending PGP-signed messages that were actually readable
with Eudora (in other words, they're Just Text,
not some kind of broken MIME attachment.)

Looks like you're using Mutt 1.2.5i.
What settings did you use for other parameters?

On my system, by the way, the previous message didn't launch MSWord;
it asked me what application to use to read the message
(and I told it Notepad, since I expected it to be text.)
Tim probably picked one the Evil Empire tool sometime in the past,
though perhaps it's a Mac-specific thing.
