Didn't Barrett Brown end up in Solitary Confinement for giving out links
to data?

As for the real question, my ethical argument still stands:-

Those people in the OPM leak who were using personal resources to
conduct government business got what they deserved (leaked).

Those who were being honest and kept business dealing to the appropriate
and democratically accountable systems did not deserve their details to
be leaked.

Then there is another group who work to deceive the public and preserve
the state at any cost, those also deserve to be leaked (NSA, CIA, FBI
etc etc).

The hack on OPM also proves another thing that Governments (or indeed
anyone) should not create large databases of personal information
because they become huge and irresistable targets for crackers.
