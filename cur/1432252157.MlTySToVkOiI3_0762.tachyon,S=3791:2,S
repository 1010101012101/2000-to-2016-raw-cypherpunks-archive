If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

That was a blast from the not so distant past of one 'measl'...Now someone 
tries to put the fine words into effect
with tools apparently feared and taken seriously by the oppressors and they 
get asked by someone called measl
"did you take your meds today?" Thanks measles,thanks a hell of a lot.
Is ja terranson just another blowhard pantsdown republican paintballer?
