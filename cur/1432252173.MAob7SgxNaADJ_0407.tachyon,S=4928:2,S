The MAIN reason (and I agree that it's work-ability is a good secondary
reason, and I like the comment about cavemen finding it 'cause its shiny)
gold is used as a medium of exchange is because it is SCARCE.

If a modern day alchemist figured out how to easily turn lead into gold, it
would become worthless (well it might still be valuable when it was made
into art objects, like clay is).

All of gold's "romance" arises  from this scarcity.

I always liked the sub-plot in Scott Adams "Hitchhiker's Guide" books where
the accounts, middle managers, and "telephone sanitizers" that were sent to
earth to "prepare" for future inhabitation decided to use tree leaves for
currency, then set about to burn down all the trees "in order to control the
money supply".
