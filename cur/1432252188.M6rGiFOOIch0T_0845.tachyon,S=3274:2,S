A couple of posts ago Aimee confidently declared that none of the people presenting themselves as lawyers on this list had made the claim that you just made again.

She is backpeddling, because it has become obvious your claim is nonsense, and the fact that you made it, (and perhaps she made it also before denying that she or anyone else had made it) shows you do not know shit from beans.
