I am continually reminded why I prefer to be onymous when talking to various
counterculture/resistance/etc movement members around the city. So many of them
are paranoid of each other and 'the man'

So I can confirm this from direct experience. I like dealing with people with
real names, locations, and whom I can tell them whatever I feel like is
appropriate, without having to compartmentalize my life.

I can only imaging that a huge contributing factor to Edward Snowden's decision
to leak was the inability to tell anyone close to him (girlfriend, family,
friends) what the hell was bothering him.
