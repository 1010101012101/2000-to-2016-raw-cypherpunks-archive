It would usually be approached through Intelligence and/or
Diplomatic channels.

If it looks like the US is attempting to extort French surveillance data
on French citizens, in exchange for the name of the French terrorist,
I'd expect France to be disappointed at the USA, with the French looking
for alternative Intelligence sources: Italians, Moroccans, Egyptians,
Russians, etc.

IOW, it's not good for the US to over-play its hand.

But then, it all depends on the "state of play" ...
Sill,  diplomacy is reciprocal  aide , or reciprocal "retaliations",
etc. etc.

One is left to wonder about the actual National Interests,
and many "forces": lobbies/factions/States/regions ,
act on Governments at the same time.

I believe History offers a Guide to Diplomacy.
