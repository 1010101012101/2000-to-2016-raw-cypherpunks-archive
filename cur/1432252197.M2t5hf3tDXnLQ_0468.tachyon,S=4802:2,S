Psychiatrists to join protest over bill
Article about a planned march on Whitehall by psychiatrists and 'mental 
health user groups', in protest against a draft mental health bill 
described as 'a public order bill dressed up as mental health legislation'
( Guardian )
See also this text (1.96MB PDF) of the draft bill, this summary of changes 
to the existing law from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and this joint 
statement by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Law Society, all 
from last month, and this paper by Robin Munro (PDF) about the political 
abuse of judicial psychiatry in China, from 2000
Wonder what the ROYAL colleges position on female and catholic succession 
discrimination is? (Ilegal in the EU .)
