Fortunately for the Swiss, Tim has it pretty much wrong.  Switzerland and
pretty much universal mandatory military service for males.  The mandatory
part is offensive, but the result is that military personnel are usually
issued submachine guns which they keep--along with ammo and the rest of
their gear--in their home so that they can be called up quickly if
necessary.

In addition, the Swiss have a high level of ownership of personal weapons.
Kids regularly take their .22 rifles to school for approved shooting
activities and business owners are often armed to the teeth.  (Ask Duncan
about an eye-opening visit to the back room of a Swiss restaurant.

Have you ever hear of a bank robbery in Switzerland?  In most Swiss banks,
tellers are armed.  They consider it their duty to chase down any bank
robbers that make it out of the bank alive.  Don't fuck with the Swiss.
