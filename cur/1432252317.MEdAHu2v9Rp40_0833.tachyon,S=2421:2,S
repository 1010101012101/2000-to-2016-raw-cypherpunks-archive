Sympathies,solidarities with family,friends and fellow free spirits.I feel 
deeply saddened by this news.Dark times.

Special best wishes to tim,I cant imagine his feelings now and for my own 
balance wouldnt want to.

The psychology,preparation,training and methods of the french resistance 
might distract us from our grief.

Commiserations comrades."Send not to know...
