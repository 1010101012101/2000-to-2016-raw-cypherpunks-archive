Technology is science applied with a purpose.

Science is understanding an 'event' in the abstract, usually including or
requiring a mathematical expression. It's most useful when it is
predictive, but there are categorical sciences as well.

Operations Research is about how to string the pieces together in a
workable system, with as little waste as possible.

Economics is how to pay for it.
