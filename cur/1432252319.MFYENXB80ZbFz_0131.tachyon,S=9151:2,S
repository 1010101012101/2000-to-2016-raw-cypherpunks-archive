another approach to conveying ideas about surveillance
through theater is via commentary on HDTV split-screen...

the aspect ratio could use or shrink a 4:3 aspect ratio for a given show or
new content, and then alongside it, to the left have a call center or
fundraising booth approach, in league with MSTK3 [3302032.9200] style
commentary occurring simultaneously with commentary as satire or otherwise,
given original or new content. for instance, an episode for existing or
preexisting television comedy could be thus be recontextualized and
reinterpreted via this approach, where the surveillance society would have
attackers stealing pins via hidden
card readers when an actor uses a cash-machine or purchases something at a
cash register. likewise, make a phone call and the surveillers light up
with commentary about what is going on, adding depth and counterpoint and
absurdity into the illusion of the 'secure' context, presented as if normal
and everyday. in this way, a theater approach could exist via such
conceptual structure and provide a format to explore such ideas via
advanced viewpoints and perspectives otherwise lacking or absent in their
parallelism, as situations coexist in simultaneous, interacting hidden
dimensions

these dynamics and relations then, thresholds, boundaries, identity and
awareness, as it relates to what is and is not observed, near and far, and
how it is all put together or people remain oblivious to the context of
their own existence via lack of information or legal protection from
events, and shared and-or unshared quasi-'reality' - perhaps a form of
wilderness, a condition of rogue ideology waiting for ideas capable of
evaluating it
