Not sure if this is too relevant to the list, but thought I'd bring it up
anyway.

Fairly important ruling today:
http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/trial-court-allows-poli=
ce-use-glomar-response-deny-records-requests

Basically, a few years ago, the NYPD hired a bunch of ex-TLA guys to handle
their freedom of information program, and then began declaring things as
being secret, even though the law mentioned nothing about the ability to do
this. Of course, they even extended their newly-created power to declare
the even the existence-or-non-existence of information secret. Today, in
horrifying fashion, the court affirmed their power to do this. FTA:

This is particularly troubling as a lot of police departments look to NYPD
as an example, and we may see this as a new tactic opposing police
investigators across the country. It's a very bad day for FOIA in my
opinion.
