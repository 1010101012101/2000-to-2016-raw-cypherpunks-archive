Lie down and just resist the temptation.

The world already has a dozen crypto/cyber rights mailing lists, 
probably more. And many '"e$", "digibucks," "digital bearer 
settlement," and "cybercurrency" types of list just from one single 
person...who also cross-posts to Cypherpunks.

I had a friend who created a new high technology company whenever he 
got bored. Of course, these were not _real_ high tech companies, with 
actual products and actual profits. Rather, they were "ventures," 
things that gave him a new business card, "Orion X. Altschluss, 
President, Plutonic Transgenics, Inc." A few months later, "Director, 
Corporate Relations, the Galt Foundation."

Some people think spinning off new lists whenever they get interested 
in some area is interesting. Most of these lists fail for obvious 
reasons. Sometimes a famous person, especially Net famous, creates a 
vanity list. Hence the "Interesting People" vanity list. This trend 
seems to be giving way to Blogs, however, as the various 
net.personalities realize that what they really want is a forum for 
blogging their message to an attentive audience.

I have done nearly all of my writing for Cypherpunks since 1992. I have 
watched Lewispunks, Perrypunks, various e-rights and digidollars and 
Geodesic Singularity Lists arise and do whatever they do after they 
arise. I have joined none of the varous other lists (which are usually 
"with permission of owner" lists--fuck that).

So now we have someone calling himself "Proclus," who has not 
contributed anything memorable to Cypherpunks, inviting Cypherpunks to 
join his new "cpunx-news" list.

Yawn.

Have fun.
