As usual, Jim relies on selective quotation when it suits his purpose. In
big
city POs, the cameras are out in the open. I stand by my position (stated in

the parts of my letter he deleted) that the absence of easily visible
cameras in 
my small town PO is not evidence of hidden cameras, but evidence that 
there are none.

Of course, he can't give an actual citation for a policy of concealed 
cameras in POs. He'd rather contend that 800,000 USPS civiilian 
employees, most of whom have no security clearance, all have 
maintained the existance of the hidden cameras in 38,000 POs as 
a perfect secret for years, while running 200 billion pieces of mail 
a year past cash-sniffing dogs. 

Jim needs to learn a few things from William of Occam.
