Dave,

Not much has been written about Narus, the company whose software was used.

Their main products identify and block or bill for VoIP phone calls
made through the equipment of traditional telecom providers. They
have customers for this system in the Mideast, Asia, and South
America. We wrote about them last fall.
<http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct05/1846>. They just signed a deal
with Shanghai Telecom Co this week, by the way.

 Steven
