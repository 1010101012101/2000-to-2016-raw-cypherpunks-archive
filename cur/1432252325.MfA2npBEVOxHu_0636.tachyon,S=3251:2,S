A few questions.  First, could this be done under the US constitution,
or is it fiddling too much with the intent of the prescription that the
USG support these?
Second, who would judge market penetration?  Could PC vendors sue Apple
for overpenetration in the graphics market?

Also, I don't think you want to do this with trademarks ---they're
merely for
IDing a manufacturer for reputation purposes.  They precede and
transcend
the US; cf bin Laden heroin.

With patents, I suspect the best you could do would be to fiddle with
the
expiration policies ---something for which there is ample precedent.

Of course, other nations are free fnord to alter their laws.  And this
of course
assumes that one of Kim's nukular missiles takes out Hollywood before
Hollywood takes over the USG.
