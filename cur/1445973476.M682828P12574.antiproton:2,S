Yep!  Milgram thoroughly discredited the "only following orders" excuse 
decades ago.  (Look deeper the initial study they always talk about in 
popular media; Milgram repeated that experiment covering nearly every 
variable, at least 40 of them.  0% (zero) of participants continued 
administering the faux, potentially damaging/fatal shocks when told "you 
have no choice." Z e r o.)

There are not enough +1s I can give you for this.

Truth.  Making people think they must have useless crap... and hey, 
mindless consuming = economic stimulus, so now you're patriotic! It's 
pernicious and deceitful.

This manipulative propaganda has incredibly negative effects it has on the 
very concept of self.  It sets up unrealistic expectations of everything 
from self image to gender roles.  A complete distortion of what society is 
and what really matters in life.

They'll say anything to make a buck, and it *must* be true because it's on 
the tee vee!  You know, the home of "reality" shows and "fair and balanced 
news" for which you should "lean forward." (Left, right - all are corrupt 
and pwned by the same damn corporate pigs. Same hand, different puppet.)

that now.)

That's a very insightful post, Razer.  If you have to say more than that 
for someone to get a clue, there's not enough critical thinking left in 
them to get through.

Citizens United... the PATRIOT ACT... gotta love how they wrap up rancid 
turds in shiny words.
