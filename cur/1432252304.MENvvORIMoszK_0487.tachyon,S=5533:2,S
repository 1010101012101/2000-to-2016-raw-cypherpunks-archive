And how many anonymously-remailed messages to this list have ever, in 
all the years of this list, included reply blocks? No more than a 
small handful, as I recall seeing.

"the remailers allowed return mail" is terribly misleading, and 
probably arises out of ignorance of what reply blocks are and why 
they are so difficult to use, rather than imprecision in language.

As for "I can't believe they exist just to totally isolate...", with 
your claim that forging headers is apparently a good alternative, you 
are naive and ignorant.

Do you think that the anonymous poster who posted the RC4 code here 
several years ago should simply have done some kind of Port 25 hack 
instead of using a remailer?

Do you think that the folks who distributed the CoS NOTS files should 
have used header forgings instead of using Cypherpunks remailers? (As 
the educated amongst you know, the CoS efforts to force Julf to 
disclose the mapping ultimately failed to produce the source when 
Julf's mapping only pointed back to a Cypherpunks-type remailer being 
run at that time by C2Net.)

If you don't get it, you have no business trying to architect the 
structure of our list.
