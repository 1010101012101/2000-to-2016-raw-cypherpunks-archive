Look, people respond to points they are interested in responding to. 
That I didn't comment on your political point about "will to die to 
rally our cause" point does not mean I didn't "miss the point." It just 
is such an obvious point as to be unexceptionable.

More interesting to me was picking apart your "stainless steel bowls 
bomb."

A true understatement. Try beating a piece of uranium!

(From the rigidity modulus tables, and Young's modulus tables, you can 
find comparable metals to experiment with.)

This is why most such hemispheres and hemispherical sections are made 
with molds and slurries of fissionables. Getting uniformity by "beating" 
a fairly hard metal is not easy.

Pure metallic uranium, both in the natural abundances and in the pure 
U-238 (DU) form.
