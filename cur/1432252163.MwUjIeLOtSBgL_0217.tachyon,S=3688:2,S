He didn't say you needed a resume to get into the meeting;
he said you needed it if you wanted to apply for a job
so they can show the people they're asking for grant money
that they've got a bunch of highly qualified people that
are interested in working on the project.
If it's like most projects, the resume is largely separate from
whether everybody knows whether you write great code quickly,
but it can be a hook to remind them who's interested.

Personally, I like resumes to be in hand-written well-styled HTML :-)
