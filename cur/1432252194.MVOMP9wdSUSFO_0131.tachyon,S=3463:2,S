  Swiss accidentally invade Liechtenstein

  March 2, 2007

  ZURICH, Switzerland --What began as a routine training exercise almost
  ended in an embarrassing diplomatic incident after a company of Swiss
  soldiers got lost at night and marched into neighboring Liechtenstein.

  According to Swiss daily Blick, the 170 infantry soldiers wandered just
  over a mile across an unmarked border into the tiny principality early
  Thursday before realizing their mistake and turning back.

  A spokesman for the Swiss army confirmed the story but said that there were
  unlikely to be any serious repercussions for the mistaken invasion.

  "We've spoken to the authorities in Liechtenstein and it's not a problem,"
  Daniel Reist told The Associated Press.

  Officials in Liechtenstein also played down the incident.

  Interior ministry spokesman Markus Amman said nobody in Liechtenstein had
  even noticed the soldiers, who were carrying assault rifles but no
  ammunition. "It's not like they stormed over here with attack helicopters
  or something," he said.

  Liechtenstein, which has about 34,000 inhabitants and is slightly smaller
  than Washington DC, doesn't have an army.
