Bah. Read a physics text sometime. Miss the catch and the payload continues 
on in it's original path, which would be at a tangent to the intended orbit 
and therefore to the surface.

As for NASA playing "plutonium slingshot", they did indeed - with a huge 
margin for error, and a design so pessimistic that even if the damned thing 
had slammed head-on into the planet, there would almost certainly have been 
zero contamination. If the canister HAD broken, the contamination would have 
been roughly on the scale of Three Mile Island, which killed 0 people and did 
0 environmental damage.

If you and the other idiots want to object to the things NASA and others do, 
fine. Be my guest. But do your homework FIRST.
