Maybe. But even mirrors can be burned through by a laser. And then we've
got weight issues that this would entail. It's not like they've got a lot
of overhead for the job. I suspect that faceting wouldn't be any more
effective than a smoothly round body form, it could have aerodynamic
effects as well (ie sharp corners at the facet edges - and yes they could
be rounded - now you're moving back toward a round rocket planform).
