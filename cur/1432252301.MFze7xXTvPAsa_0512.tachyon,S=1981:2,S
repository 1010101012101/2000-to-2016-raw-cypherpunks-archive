Aside from tax laws, I don't know of any US Federal or New York State
laws applying to renting books. A quick search didn't turn up anything
in the US, either. (Though there's so much law out there that 'quick
search of the law' is oxymoronic.) I don't have any resources other than
Google for checking English law.
