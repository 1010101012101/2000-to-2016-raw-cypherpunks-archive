No mention of a fee for this "service."

Ironically, owners of politically incorrect rifles in California are 
being required to provide thumbprints, with lists of approved 
print-making centers. $20 for the print, the local authorities are 
saying.

As for California's so-called "homeless," they are bums, winos, 
tramps, drifters, addicts, whores (two dollar whores, rather), 
thieves, layabouts, and vagabonds. Unemployment is at a 35-year 
low...shops and restaurants are literally begging for applicants.

Bums and winos would rather snooze their lives away.

Decent persons will not give them a shred of help. And the State has 
no fucking business helping to feed and house (and fingerprint) those 
who have made their choices.

The crypto relevance: crypto anarchy will eventually result in sea 
changes which cause these bums and winos to either straighten out or 
face the consequences of Darwinian law. Their choice.
