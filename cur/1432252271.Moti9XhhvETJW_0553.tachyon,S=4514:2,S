   First of all, the entire library community is outraged at being put in this
position, and, in fact, the American Library Assoc. is suing Asskruft and the
fedzis over it. Secondly, I personally know a great many librarians, holding an
MLIS myself and having worked in several libraries, and all the librarians I
know are very pissed about this and have no interest in cooperating if at all
possible.

   So far I only know of one instance of the pigs coming to a library and
demanding info on a patron. And it wasn't the fedzis, it was the local pigs and
they weren't after a terrorist, they were after some poor souls library records
because they suspected him of something to do with drugs. And I'll bet you that
the vast majority of pig demands on libraries are in the same vein. 
   This one was on the web:

"The Virginia Public Library received a request for patron records from the
Deputy Sheriff. The staff member informed the officer he would need to talk to
the Director. Director Nancy Maxwell stated that she would check with the city
attorney. When he could not be located in time, she contacted ALS and was
advised to give them the information requested since it was accompanied by a
court order."

    Yup. That's their main interest. Fuck terrorists -- the pigs are only
interested if there is something to steal at the bust, like drugs or money, or
there might be property to grab. Just try and get them to do anything about
regular crime like enforcing disturbing the peace or drunk and disorderly. So,
of course, that's what they are using the unpatriot act for.
