I don't understand how DMCA comes into play for content already ripped by 
someone else.

I don't think so, but have never checked.

It seems that one ploy the digital video posters could use is to select a 
popular, innocuous, news group, and add their content.  @Home would then be 
forced to either filter binaries from that group or take it offline, 
offending a lot of innocent users.
