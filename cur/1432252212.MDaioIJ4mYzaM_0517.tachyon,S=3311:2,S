[..]
"We'll catch those 'folks' that did this", pledged President Sharon in 
direct reference to President Bush's words of just over a month ago.

Israel has access to some of the world's most advanced weaponry, and 
may use this against the terrorists. From jet fighters and helicopters 
for attacking the infrastructure of the nation harboring the 
terrorists, to sending in troops on the ground.

[..]
Do non-governmental actions constitute acts of war? In the case of 
terrorism, we have already reached that answer: Challenge a nation 
state in any way, and you run a major risk. Nation states, like Israel, 
have capabilities that are almost impossible to comprehend. They have 
people in uniform who do nothing but practice the fine art of visiting 
death on their fellow man. They have the ability to deliver fearsome 
tools of that art. Everything from drilling a bullet into one 
particular man's chest from a thousand yards away to putting a two-
thousand-pound smart bomb right through somebody's bedroom wind
