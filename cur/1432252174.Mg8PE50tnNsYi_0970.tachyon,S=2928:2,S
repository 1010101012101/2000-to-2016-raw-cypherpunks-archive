As recently as two years ago, I had a classroom full of cops (mostly fedz
from various well-known alphabets) who knew *nothing* about stego.  And I
mean *NOTHING*.  They got a pretty shallow intro: here's a picture, and
here's the secret message inside it, followed by an hour of theory and
how-to's using the simplest of tools - every single one of them was just
blown away. Actually, that's not true - the Postal Inspectors were bored,
but everyone _else_ was floored.

While the various alphabets have had a few years to get up to speed, the
idea that they are still 99% ignorant does not surprise me in the least.

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
