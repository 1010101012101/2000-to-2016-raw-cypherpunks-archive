ORCHID address space is perfect for this type of thing, and there are
particular extensions well suited to this. [0][1]

this came up on the p2p-hackers list, which i can't seem to get mail
through, [3]

regarding Android in particular, sounds similar to Serval. [2]

not to any noteworthy degree. the attempts have been numerous in both
commercial and research focus.

given the number of ad-hoc routing protocols, developers capable of
understanding the merits and detriments of general approaches and
specific implementations, and certainly not least of all the
difficulty in early-adoption of such a Metcalfe utility dependent
"collaborative transport" is quite difficult.

see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ad_hoc_routing_protocols



as for my druthers i am keenly interested in combined topologies and
overlays leveraging the distinct advantages of particular transports
together for a best effort, immediately accessible ad-hoc
infrastructure. leased circuits and dedicated fiber continued to work
in Egypt; a BGP4 peering blackout is just a small slice of the overall
communication stacks and paths.
(you can run E-Line/E-LAN over free space optics as easily as MPLS /
WDM lambdas over fiber, multi-OFDMA wide band systems can be
aggregated over polarizations and center bands, etc, etc. the
possibilities are endless. and even packet over shortwave can carry
signalling channels around the globe...)

use madwifi-ng and a mobile IPv4/IPv6 transport. for example a custom
SOCKS/HTTP/Transparent proxy to multi-homed SCTP over VPNs on virtual
station madwifi-ng capable hardware. (i've used up to 6 clients per
radio with success, and maximum 8 radios per PCI host bus.)

lots of options in this space as well. just not cheap or easy yet...
