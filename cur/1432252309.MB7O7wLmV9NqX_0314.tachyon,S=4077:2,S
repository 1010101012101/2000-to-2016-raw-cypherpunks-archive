I have no idea what they are saying now, or then, but the "cart off 
everything you own" has never been a practical reality. Most folks 
have too much stuff, so the Feds are not interested in clearing a 
place of everything.

I assume this notion got started, at least in our community, during 
the Steve Jackson Games of a decade or so ago. In that case, the Feds 
took everything in the office they figured might be 
helpful...computers, disk drives, even printers. Thrown into boxes, 
more or less. Lots of damage. Presumably they left office chairs and 
pen holders.

When they raided Bell, they didn't take everything in the house he was in.

So, I agree with Ray Dillinger. I don't see any news here.
