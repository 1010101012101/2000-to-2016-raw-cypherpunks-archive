In rereading the first line here, I didn't mean to define identity 
credentials as passwords and equivalents to signatures and chop marks. 
Just the opposite.;

Identity credentials are taken to be biometric ID, or is-a-person 
signed credentials, or other statements of legal and personal identy. 
The passport of Timothy C. May, for example.

But a Swiss bank, pre-eunuch version, did not require passports or 
credentials issued by the Vichy Government or Pol Pot or whomever. This 
is what numbered accounts were all about.

(Perhaps some did, and this was their "right" to operate as they 
wished.)

The core point is that identity credentials of the is-a-person sort 
have nothing to do with banking and money in general.
