Current quantum computers aren't that big, but 
they're only good for multiplying numbers up to 15 (I've heard rumors of 21!)
As with the early Cray supercomputers, where the 
size of the air conditioners and power systems 
were much larger than the round wirey bits,
a quantum computer is likely to be pretty small 
but may have some bigger helium coolers on-site.
Remember that you're trying to entangle subatomic 
particles, and maybe have some magnetic detector 
things that still aren't all that big.
If quantum computers became practical, they'd be 
using them to crack codes, factoring 1024-bit numbers or whatever.
What's really big are the NON-quantum computers 
they'd be using to attack those problems now.

The reason they need all that space is almost 
certainly for conventional data storage and processing.
They want to be able to collect and store 
everybody's phone calls, locations, credit card 
purchases, and internet traffic,
so they're handling multiple petabytes of data a 
day, finding the interesting bits,
correlating the interesting people with other 
people who might have been in the same place at the same time,
saving the parts that might be useful 
later.  Maybe doing some voice recognition on all their phone calls.
It takes a lot of basic horsepower and storage, 
and the correlation takes a lot of memory.

I think they've bought themselves a lot of 
cheap-ass electrical work, done by people who assume that
scaling up power requirements for a conventional 
data center by a factor of 10-100 doesn't change the principles.
