our local HAM radio club:

Subject: FW: Al Gore is trying to steal the election


URGENT NEWSFLASH -- ELECTION INTEGRITY 2000

Conservative voters speak up!!!

Democrat Al Gore's campaign has just announced that
they will not accept or concede the election results
in Florida even after a recount.  Liberal lawyers
and activists like Jesse Jackson are swarming into
Florida to file lawsuits and demand that the
election results be overturned.

Friend, we need you and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR
CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS to sign an e-mail petition to
Florida's Division of Election Director, Clay
Roberts, and ask for a certified announcement of
victory for George W. Bush right now.  The longer
the election results are up in the air, the more
likely it will be for Al Gore and the Democrats to
steal this election.

Help preserve our Constitution and protect the fair
election results by visiting
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com/home/h.cf (or
http://www.algorelost.org/home/h.cfm) and sending
your petition to Clay Roberts right now.  And PLEASE
forward this urgent e-mail to every single person
you know!!!

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
