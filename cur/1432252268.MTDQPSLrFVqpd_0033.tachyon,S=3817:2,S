Someone is Usenet wants to hassle the cameras
with paintball guns.

#    Orwell wrote 1984 warning for Britain. It is truly spooky how close he
#    was to the truth, though a bit late in the time frame.
#    
#    No one expected it to apply, too, to America. Yet, here it is. It is
#    far more sinister than people realize. As one reader already mentioned
#    in one thread: " this can readily be used for people carrying guns."
#    That, and the identification of members of the NRA, JPFO, GOA, North
#    Caucus, CCOPS, RKBA, and instant notification of the street cop in the
#    vicinity, and we have a far more THOROUGH Tyranny than even the North
#    Caucus envisioned when it began warning the people and government some
#    years ago.
#    
#    Our question, this time: "how accurate are paint guns? Seriously.
#    Could a
#    good shot peg these cameras from the street below?" We have similar
#    cameras
#    in a towns in Georgia, watching traffic for people running stop
#    lights. How long before those cameras are silently hooked into this
#    network for face recognition?
#    
#    It's time for civil disobedience.
#    1) Arm yourselves in anticipation of a governmental advance on your
#    firearms.
#    2) Get paint gun specialists to try these cameras.
#    3) WARN the governments, local, state and national, that we won't stay
#    put
#       for such tyranny as they envision.
#    Our warning:
