The reason for the weak statement "I think" is that I imagine you might
make an argument that the momentum transfer from the photon to the
"mirror" results in a very small doppler shift...I'm just not positive
about it at the smallest level of interaction.

I've reached the same conclusion. I've known some very bright people who
lacked access to a formal education. The results were some startling
levels of understanding mixed right in with some mind blowing
misconceptions and some outright gaps.
