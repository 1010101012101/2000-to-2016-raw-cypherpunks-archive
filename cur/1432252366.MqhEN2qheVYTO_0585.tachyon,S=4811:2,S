Hello Everyone!

Today Lance Cottrell (the original author of Mixmaster) myself, (chief
Mixmaster Alpha tester and contributor) and Anthony Papillion (Cypher)
had a meeting on Jitsi to discuss the current status of Mixmaster and
remailers in general.

We have decided that we are going to investigate updating to a new
Mixmaster that will fill the weaknesses and issues that are present in
the current version of Mixmaster (Mixmaster 3.0).

The first issue will address the 1024-bit key length. We will be
looking at the development code currently available on the Internet.
The first thing we will do is to implement a 4096-bit key structure.

More features are under discussion. We would like your input on what
features you would like to see. Please keep in mind that we are
looking at functionality first. Secondly we are looking at introducing
a desktop GUI for major operating systems. Lastly we want to make
using remailers and encryption as seamless as possible.

Your thoughts and suggestions are welcome but please remember that it
is just the three of us so let's keep the "exotic" stuff to the end of
the project.
