Ah, yes, now I understand: in Coulter's Land of the Normal, rape is
perfectly fine because, after all, children *are* molested. I guess she
would also be perfectly happy at being manhandled by the local Muslim

Somehow I don't think I need to buy her book. I no longer see what the
lies could possibly have been.
