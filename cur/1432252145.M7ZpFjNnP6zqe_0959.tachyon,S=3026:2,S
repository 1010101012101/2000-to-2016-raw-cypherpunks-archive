Do you have any references for those?  I'm in the market for a voice
encryptor system.  Are these devices really comparable in terms of
ease of use?

Yeah, I remember they were supposed to be much cheaper.  Perhaps they
will drop the price later.  I'm sure they didn't pick this number
casually.  If this is something that a lawyer would use to communicate
with a client in criminal defense cases, or for government use, for
instances, then $2k/pair might be a very reasonable price.  It does
price it out of the consumer market, but how big is the consumer
market for these things, even if they are $100 each?
