The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
exp|ore the deve|opment of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapidly. Emerson will 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| flow it will be able to bui|d a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing all possib|e 
0ppOrtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we wi|l have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, which 
wi|l always encourage the participation of financial partners."


Symbol - EOGI
Price - .O9

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
slight|y, you wi|l sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
