I have several theories/conjectures about what is happening to mailing 
lists.

First, a lot of the younger folks--who used to be some of the fresh 
blood for lists like ours--are not users of mailing lists. I expect 
some of them don't even know such things exist. For them, IM is the 
norm. (And IM is mostly an interpersonal, chat format.)

Second, blogs seem to have taken over for many formerly active mailing 
lists. In some of the areas of interest to me, a dozen blogs are 
frequently read, including the ones with fairly active followup. And 
example is "Lambda the Ultimate," http://lambda.weblogs.com/, just one 
of many similar language and programming blogs.

(Personally, I think much is being lost in the shift away from Usenet 
and mailing lists towards these blogs. For while follow-ups exist for 
many of them, there is always the sense that one is participating in 
Dave Winer's blog, or Mitch Kapor's blog, or whatever. Further, many of 
the blogs take on a "my daily diary" and "random musings" tone. By the 
way, though I read the good blogs, like LtU, I don't post to any of 
them.)

Third, the explosion of mailing lists, Yahoo discussion groups, 
"pipermail" groups (such as the E language and "capabilities" folks 
tend to use), etc., has made many groups "subcritical." (Something we 
began to see half a dozen years ago, when Cypherpunks had a bunch of 
close competitors (cryptography, coderpunks, etc.), plus several lists 
run by Hettinga, plus a couple by Declan, and so on. Cross-posting to 
Usenet newsgroups was bad enough, but cross-posting to many mailing 
lists was a major pain. Especially as most lists are closed to 
outsiders, who can sometimes posts, sometimes not, but where context 
and followups are lost.)

Fourth, 9/11. A lot of people got very scared of saying what they 
think. Read the archives and note the drop-off in certain kinds of 
political discussion. Even some of the former nodes have vanished; my 
hunch is that many of those subscribed to the vanished nodes never 
bothered to find another node. (I have no idea how many subscribers the 
list has. The nodes I know of don't allow listing the subscribers. I 
would not be surprised if the subscription total has dropped below a 
few hundred. And of these, clearly only a few dozen regular posters 
come to mind.)

Fifth, relevant for our list, "crypto is tired." As in Wired's old 
"wired/tired" joke column (and of course "Wired" is _especially_ 
tired). Not that crypto is less important now than it was, but, 
plainly, some things expected have not yet happened, with little 
prospect of happening soon. And since the basic ideas have been 
discussed so many times before, in so many ways, not much excitement in 
discussing "dining cryptographers" for the 7th time, or "how to make 
PGP more popular" for the 16th time.

Sixth, the lack of news about crypto. No prosecutions of a "folk hero" 
like Zimmermann to pull in newcomers. No Clipper chip. No bans on 
crypto (at least not yet).

But even if crypto got trendy again, I just don't see the young 
students of today flocking to our particular mailing list. Too many 
other choices. Probably they'll read someone's daily blog....

One last reason, the most controversial one. When I was 40 I really had 
no difficulty dealing with the 20-year-olds. They seemed basically a 
lot like I was when I was their age. But something has changed. Maybe 
it's me, maybe it's not. But now, at the age of almost 52, I find 
dealing with most of the people in their 20s I encounter, even at CP 
meetings, much harder. Maybe it's their usually bald heads (seems many 
guys in their 20s shave their heads). Maybe it's the rings through 
their noses and eyebrows and lips and other places (shudder). Maybe 
it's that openly embrace "geekiness" without actually having a solid 
foundation in math and physics and such. And probably it's that when I 
was 40 I was not _that_ much older than the people in their 20s...but 
now I am older than their own parents!

Whatever, I find when I talk to these newcomers with their bald heads, 
their piercings, their Linux geek talk, I have almost nothing in common 
with them.

And, as many have noted, very few of the "kids" today are libertarians 
(either small L or large L). This was the fertile ground Cypherpunks 
started in (myself, Gilmore, Stewart, Sandfort, etc., whether or not 
they called themselves libertarians or not).

This shows up in the fact that protests against global capitalism draw 
vast crowds of young people, and even several subscribers to our list 
have nattered on about the dangers of globalism and free trade.

In other words, politically-speaking, Cypherpunks is out of tune with 
what most twentysomethings seem to believe.
