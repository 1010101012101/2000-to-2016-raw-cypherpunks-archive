I could use some help to finish this.

If anyone wants to help get this done, you can access
CVS anonymously on Savannah and submit patches.  It
needs allot of work, but it's progressing reasonably
swiftly.

Note:  By submitting a patch you are expected to
understand that you agree to surrender your
copyright on the patch.

Subject: ANNC: cks-0.0.5 Released


Version 0.0.5 of the CryptNET (Al-Amin) openPGP Public Keyserver
has been released.

About CKS:

CKS is an openPGP (RFC2440) compliant public key server which is
currently under development. It is written in C, and runs on Linux.
It uses PostgreSQL for key storage, and supports the hkp protocol
(it can interface with GnuPG and NAI PGP). The keyserver is mostly
functional.


What's new in 0.0.5:

The technical changes include: data structure changes, multiple subkey
support, UID revocation support, a fix for subkey id generation bug, a
fix for regex query bug, database schema redesign, optimization, a
program to synchronize with pks based keyservers, new pks based
synchronization code, new administrative utilities, and new
documentation. The administrative changes include: support for an
/etc/cks.conf configuration file, automake and autoconf support,
and more conformance to the Gnu coding standards.  A great number of
other minor feature enhancements and bug fixes are also in this
release.
