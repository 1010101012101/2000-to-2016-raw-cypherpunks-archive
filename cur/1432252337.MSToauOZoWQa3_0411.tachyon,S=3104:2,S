This prejudice is caused by:

1.  IP is already overprotected by the state, so any additional
protection will meet with hostility.

2.  Trusted computing is being brought to us by people we do not
trust, accompanied by documents that fail to inspire trust.

3.  Trusted computing is an idea that popped up at the same time
as a variety of proposals to force the world back to the TV
paradigm, a few big companies producing information, and everyone
else passively absorbing it.
