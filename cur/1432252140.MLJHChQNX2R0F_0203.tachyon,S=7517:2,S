CALL FOR PAPERS - SAC 2007

The 22nd ACM Symposium on Applied Computing
March 11 - 15, 2007, Seoul, South Korea
http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2007/

Track: Trust, Recommendations, Evidence and other Collaboration Know-how
(TRECK)

Proceedings: ACM printed form, ACM CD-ROM, ACM digital library and IJI
Journal special issue (printed and online ISSN)!

Aims and scope of the TRECK track:

Computational models of trust and online reputation mechanisms have been
gaining momentum. One reason for this is that traditional security
mechanisms are challenged by open, large scale and decentralised
environments. The use of an explicit trust/reputation management component
goes beyond security though.
The goal of the ACM SAC 2007 TRECK track remains to review the set of
applications that benefit from the use of computational trust and online
reputation. Computational trust has been used in reputation systems, risk
management, collaborative filtering, social/business networking services,
dynamic coalitions and virtual organisations. In last year TRECK, a paper
even described how computational trust and reputation could mitigate the
privacy issues of trusted computing hardware modules. The TRECK track covers
all computational trust applications, especially those used in real-world
applications.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Recommender and reputation systems

Trust-enhanced collaborative applications

Trusted computing, trusted platorm modules (TPM, TCG, TCPA, NGSCB...)

Trading privacy for trust and security

Tangible guarantees given by formal models of trust and risk

Trust metrics assessment and threat analysis

Pervasive computational trust and use of context-aware features

Trust/risk-based security frameworks

Automated collaboration and trust negotiation

Trust in peer-to-peer systems

Technical trust evaluation

Impacts of social networks on computational trust

Evidence gathering and management

Real-world applications, running prototypes and advanced simulations

Applicability in large-scale, open and decentralised environments

Legal and economic aspects related to the use of trust engines

User-studies and user interfaces of computational trust applications


Submission guidelines are posted on the TRECK 2007 website
(http://www.trustcomp.org/treck/), which always contains the latest updates.

Authors are invited to submit full papers about original and unpublished
research. A paper cannot be submitted to more than one track. We would like
to encourage the submission of industrial experience reports and reports of
innovative computing applications.

The body of each paper should not exceed 5,000 words.

Submissions should be properly anonymized to facilitate blind reviewing.
At least three reviewers will be assigned to each submission to the TRECK
track.


IMPORTANT DUE DATES

Until Sep. 8, 2006: PDF extended abstract submission of the full paper (500
words maximum; this deadline may be extended)

Sep. 8, 2006: Full paper submission

Oct. 16, 2006: Author notification

Oct. 30, 2006: Camera-ready copy

Mar. 11-15, 2007: SAC in Seoul, South Korea

Conference Venue:

Seoul is the capital of South Korea and the ancient seat of Korea's royalty.
Therefore, there are many magnificent palaces, cultural places and old
monuments to visit.
