What subsidies?  They tax the hell out of it (e.g., petrol here in the
US, even worse in UK).

If you're counting US military involvement overseas, well, we can
do without that and pay more (temporarily, until supply increases) 
for the oil we replace that oil with.  If you think the US subsidizes 
oil companies, you need to look at how much taxes they pay.
