Very odd that your "little research" would turn up this list of 
electors who didn't vote as expected but NOT turn up the MacBride 
case: entering "macbride virginia elector" into Google immediately 
turned up numerous hits giving the story.

Weird. Maybe your search engines find obscure tihngs about Adlai 
Stevenson but skip a much more recent election. Even more odd that 
entering "macbride" turned up Stevenson stuff, but not MacBride stuff.

(I'm being facetious of course.)
