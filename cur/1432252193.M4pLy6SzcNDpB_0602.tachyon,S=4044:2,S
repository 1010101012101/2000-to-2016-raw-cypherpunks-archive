[entire article by Goldberg and introductory comments by Gaylor snipped, 
due to their boring nature]

I bogged down about a third of the way into Goldberg's article. It 
reminded me of why I was so bored at the one and only Libertarian Party 
State Convention I attended (in California, circa 1991. Russell Means 
was the only interesting speaker. The rest were beyond merely boring.)

This kind of "debate" amongst apologists is why the Cypherpunks exist.

I hope more people read this essay so that more of them will give up on 
the Libertarian Party.

(If it matters to anyone, I voted for John Hospers in 1972 and I debated 
the Nolan Chart wth that very guy. Lots of libertoonians here in 
California. I met David Friedman in 1974. I tend to call myself a 
libertarian, when I'm not calling myself an anarcho-capitalist, but the 
Libertarian Party qua Party is utterly irrelevant and boring. Lots of 
nerdy clerks nattering about natural rights and quoting Rothbard. Gag!)

Quote of the Month: "It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; 
perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks." 
--Cathy Young, "Reason Magazine," both enemies of liberty.
