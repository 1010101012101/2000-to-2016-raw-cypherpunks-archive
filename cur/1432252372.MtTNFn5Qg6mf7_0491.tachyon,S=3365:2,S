I very much doubt terrorist would build an efficient bomb.  Non of what we
discussed is effcient.  Your pipe idea is a very interesting example.  But
I think the point is made that harm can be done.  Even if the mass does
not go critical - it still means a few city blocks that will be
inconvenienced from the resulting radiation.  You pipe certainly would not
go boom - but it would leave a mess of radioactivity in the area.
