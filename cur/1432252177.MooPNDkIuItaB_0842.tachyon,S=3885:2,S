It was not my intention to imply that, and I do not think your post was 
Nazi related.

However, as someone who routinely gets in flame fests with real Nazis, both 
the plug ugly kind who claim the lesser races are secretly making war with 
us, and the kind that piously tell us "I am not a nazi and my best friends 
are jews but ...", I am no fan of Godwin's law.

You do not have to be a nazi to invoke it, but it frequently seems that way.

Similarly the commies routinely invoke McCarthy.
