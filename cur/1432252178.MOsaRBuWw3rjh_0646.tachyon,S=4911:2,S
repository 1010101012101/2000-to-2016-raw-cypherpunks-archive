           All the wireless LAN/WAN stuff uses encryption, altho only 128bit
AFAIK. However, do crypto-anarchists really care what the FCC says? When/if
crypto email is outlawed on the net, will packet pirates give a rat's ass
whether it's legal to broadcast spread spectrum encrypted data, usurping
whatever band is optimal or they can afford the hardware for?

         I'm working with wireless specs right now, but for WAN (although you
can use the same hardware)  and trying to do this with that tech is pretty
limiting. If you want any distance at all (over about 800 feet) it's strictly
point-to-point, true line of sight, which means no foliage in the way.  You can
do about 25-30 miles that way, and you can have repeaters, of course, but you
have to get up over the tree tops.  And you can get 11mbs over that distance
with pretty cheap hardware, but the towers cost you at least $2500 each. Of
course you can use existing towers.
        But, of course, this is all pretty obvious stuff -- easy to spot, easy
to destroy, hardly a underground answer.  And pretty expensive compared to say
shortwave broadcast hardware.

               I was thinking more like converted mil surplus or cb or ham
tech.

          Especially in the early stages.  Fido2 nodes all around the internet,
set up and functioning with mirrors to packet radio units hidden away in the
bunkers.  8-)  And maybe played with occasionally.

            I think you'd want to meld mixmaster with something like CLX (
http://www.clx.muc.de/ ) the packet node software.
