But, to repeat, why the worker and not his bosses? Is this a way
for Adobe/FBI/DoJ to signal the interest of its own bosses?

And why are the protests limited to Adobe when the FBI and
DoJ are doing the dirty work -- well, actually, low-level FBI
and DoJ? Oops, that's right, don't fuck with workers-pissed-
at-their-bosses who have the guns which they'd like to turn
upstairs.
