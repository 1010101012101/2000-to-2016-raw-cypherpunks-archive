Not true.  I personally run several mailing lists with heavy political
bents.  One in particular, "antisocial" (the name is a play on a post someone
made a long time ago) is vibrant and continually growing.  But they need to
be nurtured - this is the failing of this list.  We no longer take care to
bring in new blood.  We have failed utterly to encourage new ideas.  And any
new blood which may test the waters with a posting that doesn't follow median
doctrine is likely to find themselves and their deviant ideas under heavy
attack, rather than discussion.

People won't post ideas that conflict with the mainstream (which obviously is
different in each unique forum) if these ideas are either dismissed out of
hand or attacked ad hominem.

Not really.  The blogs tend to be more of a "pulpit" that an idea exchange
point.

Yes, but these suffer from the same malaise of everyone having the same
opinion :-(

Usenet is the perfect example of an inherently hostile arena.  Even worse,
its a perfect example of what true anarchy really is - usenet has been lost
to the disruptors.

Precisely.

Totally agree, however, CP has been going "subcritical" since long before
9/11.

None of mine will allow it either, with the reason being the protection of
the list contributors.

CP has always been so much more than crypto.  The history here is political,
with crypto not always playing a part.  Even the non-crypto discussion is
almost completely lost.

Unless someone goes out of their way to try and introduce them to the
list.  We regularly solicit for antisocial - especially from areas that are
anathema to the posting-core of the list.  

To put it simply, CP has lost many of the core values that made it so
important - Information Wants To Be Free, right?  Or does it. 

We are not spedning much time trying to dig up information from people with
positions we may consider abhorrent...

Oh jesus: the "Young People Are So *Different*" BS.  Spare us.  This is the
easy way out - it places the onus on others, when really the weight falls to
all of us.  We need to either put up or shut up.

Then why aren't you inviting them here to listen and learn?  Maybe you can
convert them?  Or maybe they will convert you?

No.  Cypherpunks has become out of tune with what most CPs claim to believe.

Father, you are a great and mighty God. Help our governments to remember the
lessons of our history and to appreciate the purpose of your son Jesus. Teach
our representatives not to be so arrogant as to speak in one way, but doing
another, for surely this not the way of truth. Help us to understand that
your will is not death but life, not the darkness of hatred but the light of
friendship in Christ. In the name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
