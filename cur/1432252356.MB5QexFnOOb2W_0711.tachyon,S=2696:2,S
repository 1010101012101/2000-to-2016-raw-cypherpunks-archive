First, it's "falsely shouting fire," and second, I wonder how you would 
draw a distinction between a newspaper saying that, someone saying that on 
this list, and someone saying it in a public park. Imprison all of 'em?

The problem is that if you create a rule that can be used to imprison the 
Holocaust deniers (a loathsome sort, I agree), it can be used to jail those 
who challenge the conventional orthodoxy, even if they believe they're 
right. More to the point, even if they *are* right.
