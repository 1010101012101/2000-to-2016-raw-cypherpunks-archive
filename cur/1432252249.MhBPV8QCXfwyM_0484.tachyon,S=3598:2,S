I have no doubt that they will try to screw the motherboard ( they are,
after all, motherfuckers ) but I suspect it will turn out to be more
difficult than they think to completely eradicate noncompliant devices.
That is unless the new protocols that the administration wants require
hw id fields and  authentication before packets can be carried. Now that
I think about it it could easily be like getting service to a cell phone
only more so.

Interestingly, wireless equipment could be used to make networks that
are not part of the controlled net. Then of course those can be
outlawed. It looks pretty grim.
