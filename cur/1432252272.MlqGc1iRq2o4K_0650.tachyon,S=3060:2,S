Dear Friend: 

Maybe I havent told you yet, but I get paid to be online.  Really! 

I recently joined UniqueSurf.com, a new company that pays its members to go 
online - and they will be paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
members. 

This is not just a one time shot! As long as you and your friends stay 
online, you will get pay months after months and years after years. Isn't 
that GREAT!!! 

What's the catch? There is no catch. Membership is totally free and 
private.  

The sooner you join, the sooner you'll get paid. Please use my referral ID 
number (rufhouz), because I get paid when you sign up and go online. Be 
sure to tell all your friends who use the Internet -- the more referrals we 
get, the more money we can earn. You can sign up with UniqueSurf.com now at 
http://www.UniqueSurf.com/default.asp?rid=rufhouz 

This is a really great deal with no strings attached! 

Sincerely,
Ed Womack
