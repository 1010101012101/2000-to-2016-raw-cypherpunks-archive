The network overhead is pretty small.  Payments are only sent every N
packets, not every packet, and the number of extra bits needed for the
coins is not excessive.  It's possible as you say that the total
throughput might not be increased by this incentive scheme, but I
think that is unlikely. More people would probably run relays if they
got something in return (whether that is money or faster access, which
are sort of interchangeable here)

Actually, I think that the issues of reduced anonymity/higher speed
and whether you run a relay or not are directly related.  Nothing
forces a relay operator to use the faster bandwidth that is
accumulated by his relay if there is a fear that it will make him less
anonymous.  Alternatively, he might wish to take it out in the form of
a monetary payment (instead of faster service).  Similarly, a client
could get super fast access by paying, and so the partitioning
actually breaks the set of users into those going for speed, and those
striving for more anonymity (as opposed to clients vs server
operators).

However, you are right that, depending on how this was implemented, it
could partition the network into fast/slow user sets that might make
it easier for some attacks.

I think that people would contribute unpaid bandwidth to the network
for the same reason that they do now (altruism), especially if it were
the default setting (how many people really change the defaults?).
However, I see the incentives (bandwidth/monetary) as important to get
lots more people using Tor in the first place, which would hopefully
increase the total amount of free/unpaid bandwidth available through
the network.

I agree 100%.  I'm not at all proposing that the developers add this
in to Tor, they definitely have more important things to be working on
right now.  But I think that this kind of work is important for
further into the future--incentives (whether they are monetary or
performance-related) are going to be crucial to scaling the Tor
network.  And scaling the network is important for everyone's
security.  Without wide adoption of Tor, there are a lot of attacks
that are very easy against the network, and the lack of public
understanding and recognition makes it more likely that Tor could
suddenly become illegal in more and more countries.  So, I just think
that scaling is going to be very important, and we should be thinking
about what that will entail now, so that we can start thinking and
planning for it.

Thanks for the comments everyone.
