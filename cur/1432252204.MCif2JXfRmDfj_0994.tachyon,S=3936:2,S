Yeah, I read the fucking essay. It's flawed in a variety of ways. It's
understanding of human psychology (which it purports to manipulate in

Not paradoxical, hypocritical. And no, it doesn't limit anything (unless
there are is so much money being made killing wives, husbands, and

mechanism for the 1st party to anonymously hire the 3rd party to kill
