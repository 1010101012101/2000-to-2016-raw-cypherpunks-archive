  I also can't see an alternative; yes, we are giving military
organizations the "crown jewels" of our efforts for no cost (although at
least in theory they should pay for anything that is copyrighted or
patented :) but no large company can afford to spend a fraction of what
the NSA do every day on analysis - it is rely on the community or rely on
a handful of staff who may or may not be able to code their way out of a
paper bag (and if there is no community to give peer status to a
cryptographer, how can you tell good from bad when you hire one?)
  Almost always, closed source systems are either snakeoil, or based on
publically accepted algos with just a few extra valueless steps thrown in
so that they can claim it is different (VME for example can be very secure
indeed provided you combine it with something else - explicitly mentioned
as an option in the patent document - but the combined system is still
patented because their silly variant on a classic cypher is used at some
point)
