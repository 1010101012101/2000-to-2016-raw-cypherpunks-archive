For example, 90% of sheeple send their children to government mind 
destruction facilities to have their minds destroyed.

You may have seen ads which show mothers driving their innocents to these 
institutions in Volvos (supposedly because they want to keep them 
safe).  Better they should drive their kids in old VW Beetles and keep them 
away from facilities designed to brain damage their offspring.

I sincerely hope not because if he does worry about my children he might 
feel compelled to do something about them and the resulting fire fight 
would cause significant collateral damage in the neighborhood.
