Cpunk care about the sheeple, and their gripe is a legit frustration...
sheeple seem to be biologically unreachable regarding the risks
they face in this area.

Can anyone point out a successful strategy that has been used for
the cpunk to reach and enlighten them such that they make some sort
of change for themselves, or act to change their world?

Now look at a certain subset of sheeple... the NRA.  These folks
are built of the same sort as the average sheeple, but it is
discovered one thing that motivates and resonates them... guns, and
the surrounding rhetoric and issues.  And it so happens that they
also have a strong interest in privacy and dislike of government
nature. They mention against the NSA and spying and databases in
their convention speeches, you can find them on youtube. And their
political action call tree and fundraising is one to be reckoned
with. If cpunks would just reach out, these guys would be a close
symbiot army.  For example, if you show them your encrypted chat
app it's not long before lightbulb and they ask you "Wait, so you
mean I can talk shit with my buds about how many rounds of ammo I
got in the basement, moonshine, and that damn president we got...
all without the gubmint hearing me?" "Yep," you say, at which point
you've become instant friends.

Yet where is the cpunk set up with a booth at NRA conventions and
gun shows giving demos and handing out pamphlets???

The sheeple may be mostly hopeless cause, but there are various
groups that could be allied with in order to multiply cpunk numbers
to the level necessary to effect change.  Which ones and why?

The religious...
Doctor Patient...
Attorney Client...
???

Where is Cpunk focusing its efforts and getting results?
Wasting on Johnny who might not ever get it, or on cultivating a
symbiot army that will cause change and thus bring something new
to Johnny by default.
