It doesn't seem reasonable to legitimise the legal fiction of "corporation as
person" at all.  A corporation is really nothing more than the aggregate of
its employees skills and assets (which are already considered to be `owned' by the
corporation as opposed to its principals.)

Which _could_ incentivize the shareholders to pressure the board of directors
to ensure the corporations actions don't result in a loss.  However,
individuals working within a corporation will know that if they cause the
corporation to commit an offence, their personal risk will be less for the
reason that the `corporation' can take the fall for them.

Which incentivizes a new type of piracy.  Install provocateurs in the employ
of a competitor, have them `set-up' the company for a fall.  The law then
convicts and breaks up the company.  End result: you no longer have a
competitor and the true offenders get off with minimal punishment and collect
large deposits in their off-shore accounts.

Who gives a shit about the workers?  Certainly not the governement, and the
major shareholders won't either.

Which justifies what?

Besides, the power of, say, the UAW will ensure that Ford or GM will never be
held culpable for any major offenses.  Same thing goes with Oil companies,
Union Carbides, and the rest.

I doubt it.

For those responsible for ensuring workplace safety?
