Note: This is off-list. I don't care if you post it back there, but I
don't see the need to take it there.

You have said repeatedly:

"...and, two, that our social structures map directly to our
communication architectures..."

	I've been doing some thinking about this, and it seems to me
that you are about 95% correct in this, you just don't take it far
enough.

	It seems to me that what we think of as society is our
communication. Social structures don't just map to the communication
infrastructure (architecture, whatever), the communication
infrastructure IS the social infrastructure.

	Society is Communication. Communication is Society. You can't
have society without communication. As soon as you have any
communication, you include (or are included) in the society of the
person you are communicating with--and as soon as the communication
is stopped for any length of time you are not apart of it any more.
