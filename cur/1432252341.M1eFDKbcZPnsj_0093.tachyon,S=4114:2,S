                 One report currently being investigated by U.S.
intelligence officials came from Pakistani Inter-Service
                 Intelligence sources who had conducted an interrogation of
a "terrorist suspect" in early November. Under
                 "coercion," the suspect said that agents of bin Laden had
smuggled two portable nuclear weapons into the
                 United States, according to the report seen by a U.S.
government expert.

                 The government expert, who has had access to the Pakistani
investigation, said ISI provided "the highest
                 levels of the U.S. government" with materials from the ISI
interrogation including a summary of the suspect's
                 confession, which this source had seen. The summary did
not give the specific dates of the smuggling, the
                 method, or time of entry. The suspect said only that the
smuggling had been carried out, the U.S.
                 government expert said.

                 The sources of the report "were current ISI officers who
had kept contact with U.S. counterparts" they had
                 known from the 1980s, this U.S. government expert said.
The summary was accompanied by "collateral" or
                 supporting documents, he said. The package was given to
senior U.S. officials in mid-November.

                 The ISI had not rated the report's credibility but felt it
important enough to alert the U.S. government, this
                 source said.

                 "What was disconcerting about the (suspect's) information
was that he knew details of the activation of the
                 weapons and their construction that are not in the public
domain," the U.S. expert analyst said.

"Coercion" is a nice word for raping his wife?
