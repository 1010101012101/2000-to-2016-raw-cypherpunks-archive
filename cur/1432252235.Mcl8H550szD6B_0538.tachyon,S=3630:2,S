Some or most of them eventally went to his nephew and ended up in Tito's 
Yugoslavia. There is a Tesla Museum in Belgrade that houses them.

The missing papers were apparently copies of his partice beam work that 
were made for an Air Force weapon project. Whether the originals 
disappeared also is not clear from the PBS account.
