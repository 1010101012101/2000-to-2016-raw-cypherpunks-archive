It is not clear to me that Haskell is useful for producing 
programs that are actually useful to end users.   Sure you can 
produce a prototype in nothing flat, but it seems to me that as 
with complex SQL expressions, it is very easy to produce 
Haskell expressions that evaluate several billion times slower 
than they should when the program starts handling a large 
number of users with a large number of transactions.

And to get back to the topic of this thread.  I cannot see 
anything but random deranged crap in alt.cypherpunks -- maybe I 
need to adjust my filters, but there does not seem to be any 
signal in the noise.

Of course I can only see the signal on this list, because over
the years I have developed some heavy filtering.
