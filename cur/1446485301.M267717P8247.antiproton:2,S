                      administers the sanctions program, issued new

                      That created an opening for GTT, as well as any
                      other American companies that want to cash in on
                      the Iranian market for Internet service, which is
                      booming thanks in large part to a surge of new

    <p>Despite the nuclear deal, Iran is providing the bulk of ground
      forces to crush Syrian rebels opposed to Bashar al-Assad, and is
      part of an emerging power axis with Russia, which has <a href=3D"http=

      airstrikes to keep the Syrian dictator in power and to keep
      Moscow=E2=80=99s foothold in the Middle East.</p>
    <p>But Iran is expanding economically=E2=80=94and digitally=E2=80=94as =
well. And
      that presents an opportunity for American technology companies.</p>
    <p>Since August 2014, when the Iran=E2=80=99s national telecom regulato=
r
      began awarding licenses for 3G and 4G mobile phone service,
      subscriptions have surged, to about 20.5 million people last
      month, Amy Cameron, a senior analyst with BMI Research, told The
      Daily Beast. That=E2=80=99s about 27 percent of the country=E2=80=99s=
 population,
      the majority of which is under 30 and, presumably, eager to
      embrace new technologies and the access to information that comes
      with them.</p>
    <p>The surge in mobile phone service is a big business, and Iran
      needs more Internet addresses and access for all those new
      devices, Cameron said. In addition to acquiring new service
      routes=E2=80=94like the ones GTT provides=E2=80=94the government has =
also been
      buying up Internet addresses that use the so-called <a href=3D"http:/=
/research.dyn.com/2015/04/ipv4-address-market-takes-off" target=3D"_blank">=
=E2=80=9Cversion 4=E2=80=9D</a> protocol, a vital, and
      increasingly scarce, component of the world=E2=80=99s Internet
      infrastructure. And Iran plans to auction more wireless broadband
      spectrum, which should in turn attract more investment in mobile
      networks.</p>
    <p>=E2=80=9CAll of these developments point towards Iran making concert=
ed
      efforts to open its Internet market,=E2=80=9D Cameron said. Of course=
,
      there are limits to that openness: Iran=E2=80=99s primary telecom com=
pany
      is owned by the military, and the Tehran government monitors
      communications for prohibited content.</p>
    All of which makes its affiliation with a telecom company in
    suburban Washington even more unusual.<br>
