To the best of my knowledge, patent law is not uniform internationally,
certainly not to the extent copyright law is.  In the US, both patent
and copyright are powers granted to, not obligations required of,
Congress.  There is prior precedent for lifting patent protections,
usually as anti-trust settlements.

Peace.
