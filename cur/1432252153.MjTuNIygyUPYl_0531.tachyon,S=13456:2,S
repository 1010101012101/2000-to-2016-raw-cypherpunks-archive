dear mirimir you cannot read

'Nonetheless, because of the general faith I had in political and media
institutions, I assumed - since both political parties and media outlets
and journalists from across the ideological spectrum were united in support
of the war - that there must be some valid basis to the claim that Saddam
posed a threat. My basic trust in these institutions neutralized the
objections I had and led me to passively acquiesce to what was being done
("I believed then that the president was entitled to have his national
security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I was able to develop
a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American security really
would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.").'

did you read the motherfucking article?

this should tell you how duplicitous he is just like the government says he
didnt do anything - he didnt fuck that bitch - oh he fucked them hard though
