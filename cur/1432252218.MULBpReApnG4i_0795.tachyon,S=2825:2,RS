Simple answer: turn off javascript and java.  It is generally not 
used except to make ads more annoying.  If your browser allows it 
(I gotta put in a plug for the registered version of Opera here) 
turn off animated graphics.  These three simple acts will kill 
over 90% of web advertising. If you're actually after *content*, 
you can usually turn off autoloading of images as well, and that 
will kill almost 100% of web advertising.
