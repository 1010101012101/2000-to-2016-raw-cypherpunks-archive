Damn few "privacy fundamentalists" out there.  Most "privacy advocates" 
support massive government privacy invasions including the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended, the Census Bureau, and the various state DMVs.

Unless a "privacy advocate" is prepared to call for the elimination of the 
above privacy invading institutions or at least their conversion to 
anonymous credential technology, then I submit that they are *not* privacy 
advocates at all.

As for the eternal SS# question, Amex and Discover will currently give you 
"one time use" cc numbers to use over the nets.  A consumer-friendly 
government could do the same.  Particularly since they already have the 
institutional setup in place.  Anyone who forms an entity of any kind that 
has US tax implications (sole proprietorship, partnership, trust, estate, 
corporation, etc.) can/must apply for a taxpayer ID number (TIN).  The Feds 
could issue them to the rest of us for one-time use.

I knew America was in trouble when I found that the application to join the 
Sons of the American Revolution asks for your Social Security Number.
