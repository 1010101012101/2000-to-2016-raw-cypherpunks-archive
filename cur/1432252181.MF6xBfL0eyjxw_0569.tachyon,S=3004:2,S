Thanks for the cite!

It shows how far down the path to destroying even the First Article of 
the Bill of Rights we have gone. Several cases of BATF harassment, even 
an attempt to recruit John Ross' ex-wife to help put him away.

Thanks again.

P.S. I see you have copied Ray Dillinger in the cc: field (which I have 
blanked in this reply, as is my custom). Be advised that Ray Dillinger 
has covered his ears and doesn't want to hear about this kind of icky 
stuff.
