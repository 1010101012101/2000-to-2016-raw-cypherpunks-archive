Murdoch's Grand Wishes for Net Control
CNet: Media chief decries Net's moral fiber. The president of media giant 
News Corp. warns that the Internet has become a "moral-free zone," with the 
medium's future threatened by pornography, spam and rampant piracy.
The word "hypocrite" is grossly insufficient to describe Peter Chernin and 
his corporate master, Rupert Murdoch, but it'll have to do for now.
News Corp. has done more to bring down the level of journalism and 
entertainment than perhaps any other organization on the planet. These are 
the people responsible for much of the tabloidization of the press. These 
are the owners of the putrid Fox TV network.
News Corp. is a member in good standing of the entertainment and 
information cartel that is trying to capture absolute control of all 
digital information. It is attacking the users -- the customers -- of 
technology and entertainment, in a profound and damaging way.
If you believe the garbage you see on the Fox network, and in Rupert 
Murdoch's right-wing tabloids (which play up sex when it sells; note the 
bare-breasted women in its British newspapers), then you'll believe 
anything. If you have an ounce of independence of thought, you will find 
remarks like Chernin's some of the most dangerous rhetoric yet.
