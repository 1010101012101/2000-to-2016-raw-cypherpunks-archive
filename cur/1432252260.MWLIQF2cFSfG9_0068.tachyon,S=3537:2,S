Members of the 11Sept2001 sleeper cells visited Las Vegas. Among
the many interesting points about Las Vegas are the large numbers of tourists that stay in a very small number of
facilities. Anthrax or some other biological warfare (BW) agent delivered to the casino/hotel systems (through air
circulation systems, HVAC) would expose tens of thousands at a time; most of those individuals would enter the mass
transportation systems (airports, aircraft, trains, buses), spreading the infectious agent/infection, and arriving back at
their home destinations before common incubation periods would become an issue. Yes, the CDC is prepared to deliver
'push-packages' to cities in the U.S., but could it handle tens of thousands of possible cases throughout the entire U.S.
and the world? Could airports and aircraft be decontaminated effectively? The 'test cases' of anthrax through the U.S.
postal system expose the frightening potential of BW agents--the spores persist, travel, and are a trickier problem than
thought. Even with few fatalities, the mass transportation systems of the U.S. would come to a crashing halt.]
