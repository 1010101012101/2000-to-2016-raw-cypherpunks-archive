I don't say Jack to any government worker, even the Census poller...When it 
comes to Apparatchiks of the police state I'm unreachable. I do pay my taxes 
and participate in my state's driver license requirements...so the reality is 
that I do talk with government workers, albeit they do have a gun to my head.

In general you have nothing to gain by speaking to the Police or assorted 
Fedgoons, so don't.
