if Iraq did in fact destroy all WMD, as he stated he did, and as we are now 
beginning to acknowledge, how do we "justify" [read: "make legal"] our 
recent BoyzWithToyz party?"

ANd don't forget that whole loadacrap about their WMDs being destroyed 
"hours before the arrival of UN inspectors". Guess they took all that sarin 
gas and flushed it down the toilet, huh....

In the end I think it's clear that they really didn't feel they needed to 
work too hard to create credible lies.
