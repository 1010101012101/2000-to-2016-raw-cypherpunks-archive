Well, now it's time to start developing the kinds of tools discussed on
Cypherpunks back a few years ago:
Using one key yields one set of data (ie, the dummy data) and using the real
key yields the true data.
Of course, there needs to be a way to hide the data such that one can't tell
if there's another key.

And now I'm thinking that data should start being stored on the other side of
a Tor network or other similar wall: A key extracts data from one source but
the real data is somewhere else entirely. In any event, there is no encrypted
data for interrogators to see prior to receiving what the interrogated gives
them, and no way for them to know if that's the 'real' data.

This sounds like you don't even need to do much for this to be true.
