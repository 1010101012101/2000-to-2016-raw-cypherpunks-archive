The cops who are trolling for busts are taught by consultants to try to 
sound like either kids, or Aryans, or original gangsta niggaz.

Someday there's going to be a major bust based on one of these "bombz 
rulez, d00dz!" trolls. The Feinstein bitch is itching for such a bust, 
to get her "outlawing of bomb plans" legislation moving again. I expect 
the same kind of low-rent prosecutors who went after Jim Bell and C.J. 
Parker are also itching for such a case.

What I've done in a couple of these "Send me bombz info" trolls is to 
use a remailer chain to send the AOL cop trollers some truly interesting 
stuff about Astrolite and how to make it. All available from online 
places (well, CNN yanked the Astrolite material after explosives experts 
whined that CNN had detailed info on ANFO).

If a bombz d00d blows himself up, think of it as evolution in action.
