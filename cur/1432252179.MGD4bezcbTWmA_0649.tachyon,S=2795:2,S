Hum. Well, me I personally like the piss-off factor: the cops KNOW you had 
something, which is bad enough. And then, they KNOW you destroyed it. But 
most importantly, they know you know they know, but you don't give a crap. A 
flagrant touting of their authority. If they don't beat you to death, it'll 
be very satisfying.

The pod jettison idea is interesting, but I'm sceptical: Those guys are 
always on the lookout for something being chucked out of a car getting 
pulled over, but if it were jettisoned straight out the front it might work.
