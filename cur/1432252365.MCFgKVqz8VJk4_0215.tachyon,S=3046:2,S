Yes, I have found that puzzling too.

Articles I have read refer to the original version being "in the public
domain". You'd think the source code would be "out there" somewhere.

The least "Tin Foil Hat (TM)" version of the story I found is at Wired

http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.01/inslaw.html

Which gives this description:

"Designed as case-management software for federal prosecutors, PROMIS
has the ability to combine disparate databases, and to track people by
their involvement with the legal system. Hamilton and others now claim
that the DOJ has modified PROMIS to monitor intelligence operations,
agents and targets, instead of legal cases."

I find the claims made about this software (it's ability to reconcile
data from many different sources "automagically" ) pretty vague and
frankly, a little far fetched, based on what I know about software,
databases, etc.

(And that's not even including the "modifications" supposedly made to
install a TEMPEST back door in later versions).
