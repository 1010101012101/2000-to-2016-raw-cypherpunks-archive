I can speak to airbnb. I watched a city council meeting a few months ago
as a bunch of airbnb 'homeowners' (investment properties they MIGHT live
at) hammered the talking point over and over again that having people
rent their space by the day or week and go touristing is somehow better
for the economy of my town than having someone who lives in a unit year
round, goes shopping for groceries every week, has his car work done at
a local garage etc.

This happened at a meeting that was ostensibly to discuss the housing
crisis in my Monterey Bay area town where a studio apartment rents for
$2,000/month and no one who works for any average business based in the
town makes anywhere NEAR that kind of money.

The city council creeps just sat there mute. Not ONE OF THEM said "Can
you show us any numbers to prove this??, because they long ago had
prostituted themselves to mostly non-local commercial property interests
and they had no intrinsic argument with airbnb's view.

The problem with the "Sharing Economy" is that it only shares with other
people involved in that 'economy' and excludes others. That's feudal,
and Feudalist sharing is NOT sharing for the benefit of a whole
community. It's sharing for the benefit of a few. What else would you
expect from a totally psychopathic society like 'merica.
