Absolutely they are- but quite a bit more sophisticated than the "gang" or
"mafia" contacts a la the U.S. and Cuba in the 1960s.

See e.g. E-Systems (look particularly at it's board of directors- a who's who
of former intelligence big wigs).

8 of every 10 dollars in their contracting revenue are from classified
projects.

E-Systems employees were frequently doing counter-narcotics intelligence work
inside the U.S. and reporting directly to intelligence agencies without the
charter to operate domestically.  This came to light more recently when one
E-Systems employee- while cleaning his weapon in a motel room in preparation
for an operation- had an accidental discharge and killed a guest in the
adjacent room.  (4+ million paid to the widow after a lawsuit in 1991).
