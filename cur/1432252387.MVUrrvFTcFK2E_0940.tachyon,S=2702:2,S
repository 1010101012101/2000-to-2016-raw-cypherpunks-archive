Bob,

But your defenses of the fatherland are hollow formulas.
There has been no war to win, a war the US is forever
stealing from the citizenry to prepare for, and then fucking
up with the minor skirmishes by having no doctrine or
training to apply its mythical might, except, as always,
to explain away abject failure with fairy tales like you're
telling.

Deterence is bullshit, but it worked to keep the Soviet
and US militarists and their supplies in top level comfort.

Now, the US has no complicit partner in raiding the public
till, so it fabricates the terrorist threat, and lockstepping
right along comes Russia, the UK and all the natsec
bullshitters (slanted intelligence addicts) to march to
the beat of bucks aflowing imperially.

Dig deeper, middle-aged spinner, your history seems to 
have been framed by the Cold War and its bastard mini-me 
terrorism racket here lately.

Do you by any chance have a contract with the tomfoolers?
Or is it just natural to believe sugar daddy's tales of
conquest and invulnerability? 

And, what is this shit about needing to kill as many of
the varmints as possible? Have you ever tried to do that,
these mean sumbitches are not birds and rabbits and
women and children.

Beware the May/Donald megadeath syndrome which always 
indicates a yellow stripe down the back of those who love
to advocate others dying for their comfort and safety --
in large numbers, as if big bragging makes it braver.
Weenies do that.
