No, I think few topics on the Cypherpunks list are taken private.

I've had several people write to me in private, asking questions about 
things that came up on the list. Sometimes I reply, but usually I urge 
them to "stop lurking and post on the list!"

My reasons are two-fold: First, to get them to stop lurking and 
participate. Second, to work up the energy to compose an essay (or 
mini-essay, whatever), I need some motivation. I am not energetic about 
writing a long response to some stranger who asks me a question in 
private. If he posts publically, I may (or may not...) decide to use 
his post as a jumping-off point for something that I think needs to be 
said.

As for you, I have dumped on you because most of your posts to the list 
look a lot like you are asking for help on a homework problem or have 
just semi-randomly pulled an example out of a crypto or algebra book 
and have decided to "participate" in the list by asking if anyone knows 
the answer to some puzzle.

"hi,

Table shown is completed to define 'associative'
binary operation * on S={a,b,c,d}.
...
So can (a*d)*d=a*(d*d)=d considered as associative
over * for this case as per definition?"

and

"hi,

If we are to convert a k-bit integer n to a base b
number,it takes us O(log n) if the base b is a power
...
Is there an algorithm with time complexity O(log n)
which allows such conversion to base b ,when b is not
a power of 2?"

are just two of your more recent examples.

Now if you had told us you were implementing a crypto system for use in 
India (where I think you are from...), and had run into a tough 
problem, these might be interesting for people to comment on.

But they sure do look like homework problems.

A more fruitful sort of post might be for you to discuss the general 
crypto situation in India, the telecom infrastructure, and Indian 
government attitudes. Or, if these topics don't interest you, your 
thoughts on implementing DC Nets, or using digital money, or whatever.

But to post snippets of problems out of textbooks is NOT participation 
in the topics of the list. Think about it.

I wish you no ill-will, but you should find ways to participate which 
suggest you are actually reading what others are saying and giving your 
own views or responses to them.
