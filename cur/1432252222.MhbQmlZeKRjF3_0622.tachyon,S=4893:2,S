You still don't get it, do you?

A holographic system buys polynomial factors of improvement, not 
exponential factors. Shamir said as much, of course, with his optical 
tools he was writing about a few years back.

You keep referring to these "tricks" for reducing exptime to "a few clocks."

Paranoia is useful, but assuming that the NSA "must" have some 
selection of tricks which would astound and shake the world, absent 
any indications that this is so, is beyond paranoia and is into some 
weird kind of NSA-is-the-Great-Oz worship.


As Declan said, extraordinary claims require extraoridinary proof. 
All you've done so far is to hand wave (and somethingelse-wave) about 
how custom silicon and unspecified tricks _must_ be useful. As 
another poster noted, where's the 10^78-fold improvement?

(And the 10^200-fold improvement? Etc.)
