Whether they were a threat or not is an objective fact.  Jews were not a 
threat (unless perhaps one happens to live in Eretz Israel).  Nazis were a 
threat.  Anyone who says otherwise does not merely have different moral 
preferences.  He is deluded or lying.

In particular jews were not a threat to germans and the aryan race, whereas 
nazis really were a threat to everyone.

That the nazis tended to murder anyone including their fellow nazis, and 
commies tended to murder anyone including their fellow commies, is an 
objective fact, capable of being true or false.

That normal people do not tend to murder anyone, but only those that really 
do threaten them, is also an objective fact capable of being true or 
false.  From such objective facts, we can determine that the nazis really 
were objectively evil.

It is certainly true that many jews intended and continue to intend to 
steal the promised land from those currently occupying it, but the nazis 
intended to steal the whole world, and enslave everyone in it, whereas 
zionist jews merely intend that the current inhabitants of places near 
Israel shall go a few hundred miles further away.  Those oppressed by the 
nazis were kept against their will and prevented from fleeing.  Those 
oppressed by Israel refuse to leave, despite the fact that most jewish 
Israelis would very much like them to go away.
