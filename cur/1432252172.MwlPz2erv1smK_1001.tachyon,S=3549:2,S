Why was Jon Malkovich never charged with 'Threatening the life of a 
serving POTUS' for his role in In The Line Of Fire?  Clint Eastwood 
_specifically_ told him in response to a telephone threat that "[Y]ou 
could go to jail for saying that, even if you don't really mean it".

I thought there wasn't an exception for fantasy/fiction.  Malkovich 
isn't somehow 'connected' is he?
