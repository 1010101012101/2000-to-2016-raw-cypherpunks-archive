     I don't understand this controversy. Who cares what the law is?
Why would you ever let anyone know about the intruder you just blew
away inside your house? Just disappear the body in a shallow grave,
or cut it up into little pieces and run it thru a chipper in your
garage and bag it up, dump into a river for fish food.
    Why would anyone be stupid enough to call the pigs over
something like that? Geez, wake up!
