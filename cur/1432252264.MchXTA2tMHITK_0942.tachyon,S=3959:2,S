"...He decentralized decision-making authority and created a flat 
management structure to quickly respond to changes in his operating 
environment. He overcame turf battles by creating an overarching sense of 
mission and doctrine. He used the Internet, the globalization of news and 
the revolution in telecommunications to advance his organization's goals 
worldwide. He developed a complex organizational network in which 
information gets only to the right people at the right times. In his 
network, connections between individuals and groups are activated at key 
times to get work done and severed when they are no longer necessary. To 
terrorize America, Osama bin Laden adopted many of the management and 
leadership strategies that U.S. corporate leaders have embraced over the 
past decade-strategies that are gaining ground among U.S. military 
reformers and among leaders in the government's civilian bureaucracies. The 
strategies stem from a theory-being validated by American corporations, 
social activist groups and international terrorists-that in the information 
age, successful organizations behave more like computer networks than 
assembly lines..'
