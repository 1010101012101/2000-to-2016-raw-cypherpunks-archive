It seems that rnd_wavein uses a small window (you document 256 samples
as the default).  One common silent-failure mode of video capture
interfaces is to intermittently provide the same frame (around 1 MiB of
data) twice!

If your whitener doesn't chain blocks and you use the output directly as
random data (worst case, as an OTP) then a long-term repeat like that is
completely catastrophic, giving you a modern reprise of the Venona
break:
http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/coldwar/venona_story.pdf

If you do chain, it's merely reducing the entropy of the stream
significantly.  Also it's entirely possible that an attacker can
influence the behavior of the system; depending on your threat model
either through direct physical access or by causing CPU starvation
through a network or algorithmic DoS to trigger misbehavior in the
driver.

It would be much better to implement a multi-stage entropy pool design
with catastrophic mixing, such as Schneier et al's Fortuna:

Indeed.
