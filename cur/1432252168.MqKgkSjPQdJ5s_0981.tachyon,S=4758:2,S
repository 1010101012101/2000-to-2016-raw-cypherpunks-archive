I expect suicide bombers will still be more effective, although now
the bombers can fly 150 drones in formation to a target they can't 
physically get to and do some damage before they get droned themselves.

Don't think TOR will help when the UN defense forces drop tungesten from
orbit. Trying to hide is only going to get you AND the network you are
hiding behind killed.

That will be a faustian bargain for exit node operators.. censor/block/
limit known remote flight control traffic, or get bombed from orbit.

Oh, and latency. Line-of-sight and theft of commercial aircraft is 
still going to be able to cause more damage. 


What I expect will be *far* more interesting will be the escalation in
the seed-bombing wars.. http://www.guerrillagardening.org/ggseedbombs.html

The geese already started it..
