So there are no real Russian cryptos? Umm.

The competition was part of the swing, so was govt's saying
AES(256) was good for TOP SECRET (not that they use it over their
own suites), so was it's speed/hardware/simplicity.

There are govt laws for what the govt itself will only use.
 (Are you going to not sell to and profit from that govt?)
There are govt laws for what the populace will only use.
 (Are you going to jail for breaking that ban, or will you bow?)
There are paths between all the laws for what obediant
 users can use.
And rebels will use whatever they want.

If you personally use crap ciphers, that's your own problem.
If you support (absent force of law) crap ciphers, or more
than the best few in each class such that community has no
time to properly analyze them all, that's a community problem.
If you don't resist crap law, crap ciphers, or the spawning of endless
new ciphers of the month just because, that's a community problem.
