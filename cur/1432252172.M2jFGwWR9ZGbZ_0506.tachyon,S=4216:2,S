I don't understand this extraordinary level of concern  As both James
and Perry have tried to point out, 'volatile' is *not* an obscure
feature.  Maybe it was obscure back in the mid-1980s, but every C
compiler I've seen in years supports volatile.  Its behavior has been
part of the C std for a long time now, and it's a critical part of a
large body of code on pretty much every platform.

It's interesting that you bring up the subject of "fixed size buffers"
being overrun.  That also results from ignorance and carelessness on
the programmer's part *not* from incorrect compiler implementation.

It sounds like the problem is more a lack of understanding of what
'volatile' means.  Nowhere in this thread (or from what I can tell,
the thread on vuln-dev) has anyone alleged that an actual compiler
didn't handle 'volatile' correctly.
