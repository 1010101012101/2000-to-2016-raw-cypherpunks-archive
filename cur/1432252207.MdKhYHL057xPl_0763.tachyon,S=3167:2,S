If this were Brinworld, the two victims would have a video
safely offsite somewhere made by their Rodney King shoulder cameras,
and the cops would be getting the week off without pay for rudeness.

If this were Brin-dystopia, the cop car would have a camera,
and once the first cop looked up the license plate and
saw that there were two non-Anglo people in the generic-looking van,
he'd let his partner know to leave his jacket over the camera
when he got out of the car so they could beat them up.
