Yes.

Mildly.

Is there anybody with enough organizational/leadership skills to take over
the project, preferably located further away of the US influence than
Canada is? Export policies are relevant only when enforceable.

That could be relieved, given developers and skilled leadership.

Again, this can be relieved, given the developers.

I maintain a small conglomerate of private and corporate networks. We use
FreeS/WAN quite extensively, with great success - in last 2 years we had
no drop-out caused by the crypto infrastructure fault. No attempt for
opportunistic crypto on the IP level, though, at least not yet.

It was a good project. Hope somebody picks up the torch and keeps it
burning, possibly even brighter.
