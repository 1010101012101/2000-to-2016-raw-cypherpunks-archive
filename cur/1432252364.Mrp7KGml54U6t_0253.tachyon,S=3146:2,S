you gotta love fast asic's for this kind of stuff.  cloudstream also
has success with the fpga approach.  (there's a grad paper somewhere
that describes a 10GigE inspection setup using fpga's and capable of
~100-600 snort style rules per chip.  more rules == linear scale.
would be fun to try L7, which does make things more difficult...)

what makes you say this?  i'd be surprised if the control channel is
pulled from the monitored flows.  you need bi directional transport,
for control and backhaul, among other reasons.

maybe we'll find out when congress/judiciary orders the devices
removed?  *cough*
