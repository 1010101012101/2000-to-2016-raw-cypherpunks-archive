Dear America,

Yes, It's hard, but here's how. First, you can make comms unreadable. There
are well-known ways to do this. Second, you can make comms untraceable. Ways
to do this exist, and better ones are being developed*. Third, you can make
comms available to everyone - the 'net might help here.


If you don't choose to use these methods, the consequences are up to you.
But secure comms alone will only provide you with useful information, by
themselves they aren't enough; you need to vote. Lots of you.

Nothing else really matters. To "them", and you.
