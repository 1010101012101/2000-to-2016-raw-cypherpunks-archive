The suspicion when this was discussed after the RSA conference was that, based
on performance figures, they were doing something like using 3 DES engines and
pushing 3 different blocks through them at once (or a single DES engine with
per-round pipelining), this restricting them to the insecure ECB mode.  Using
one of the parallelisable modes would have been a better move.  The fact that
they were using ECB lead to the inevitable suspicions that there'd be other
security problems present as well - I think Lucky's condemnation may have been
a bit strong (it's not totally insecure), but the use of ECB mode doesn't
exactly inspire confidence in the design of the rest of the system, even if it
was done for pragmatic reasons.
