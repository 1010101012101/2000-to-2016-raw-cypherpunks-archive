Dear Joe,
   Thank you for interest in joining Better A Millstone. To receive an 
application send a request to the following: applyforbam@hotmail.com
along with your primary e-mail address and one will be sent to you.
   I'm afraid that you should not celebrate to much because even as I am 
writing this to you boychat is trying to get reestablished so our work is 
never done. We must be ever vigilant to protect our children from these 
perps who prey on our greatest resource - our children.
   If you were watching Americas Most Wanted last night, there is a Dutch 
pedophile group that is trying to protect Erik Rosser who is wanted by the 
FBI on charges of molesting his girl friends daughter. He has been on the 
run out of the country and he is still committing unspeakable acts against 
children in Spain.
   I ask you to keep your eyes open when you are on the internet for any 
forms of child pronorgraphy and report the websites to us immediately. You 
may reach us at the address you used or you may contact me at the address 
below. We thank you for assisting us in protecting our children. Feel free 
to cantact us any time.

Dear Mr. Echols,

Congratulations on finally putting those awful BoyChat people
out of business.  My whole family feels safer now that those
sick pedophiles no longer have a place to gather and exchange
information on how to molest children.

I hadn't realized, until I read the recent issue of Newsweek,
how pedophiles had multiplied and now threaten almost everything
we hold sacred.

I'd appreciate it if you could send me information on your
organization, and on how I can help put other pedophiles sites
out of business like you did with BoyChat.  I have a little
money saved up, and I can think of no better cause to spend it
on.

God Bless you Mr. Echols, for the wonderful work you are doing
to protect our children, and may the Lord guide you in bringing
us the final solution to the pedophile problem.

Sincerely yours,
Joe Cypherpunk
