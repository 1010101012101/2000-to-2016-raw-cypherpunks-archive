To me DRM seems possible to the extent that computers themselves 
are rendered tamper resistant -- that is to say rendered set top 
boxes not computers, to the extent that unauthorized personnel are 
prohibited from accessing general purpose computers.

To me, TCPA only makes sense as a step towards some of the more 
monstrous outcomes that have been suggested by myself and others 
on this list.  It does not make sense as a final destination, but 
only as a first step on a path.
