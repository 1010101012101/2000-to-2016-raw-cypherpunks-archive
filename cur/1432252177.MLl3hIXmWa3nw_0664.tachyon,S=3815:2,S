Au contraire, name and shame does work for criminals. Consider
drone operators or black ops being outed, or NSA cybercriminals
published with full name and address. I assure they're not going
to take it lightly any more than sex offenders want to see
their mugs and full addresses and map locations published.

I agree, but it's a different kettle of fish entirely. The probability
overlap of being both willing to risk and able (to be hired) is 
negligible. Plus security measures are much higher after the
last heist. Not to say impossible, but personal risk is much higher,
and potential ROI is considerably lower.

That would be nice. But realistically only a very rate exception.

However, intelligence people do not operate in a vacuum. They use
the same public infrastructure as you. They don't teleport in and
out of their facilities. Collecting and crosscorrelating publicly
available data is powerful while invidual risk is low to zero.
Leaking large batches is safe if you follow standard security
procedures.
