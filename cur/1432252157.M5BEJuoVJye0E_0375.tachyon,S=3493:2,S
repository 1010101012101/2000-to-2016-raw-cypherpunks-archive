You did not miss much.

In the most recent Chomsky thread, all the same things were said, as have 
been said so many times before.  Indeed, I have traced the canonical 
Chomsky thread back to 1967.

The canonical thread goes as follows:

Chomsky critic:  "Chomsky distorts and misrepresents the sources he cites, 
and attributes arguments, evidence, and statements to people that they did 
not make.

Do
{
	Chomsky defender:  "No he does not.  Produce examples.  No one has ever 
given any examples of Chomsky doing such a thing."

	Chomsky critic produces his favorite examples again.

} while (patience remains);
