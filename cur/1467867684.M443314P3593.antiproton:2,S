	Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and our beloved US are all ex
	colonies/administrative divisions of the british empire - the
	quintessential state created by conquest. 

	Even if some of the - partial - secessions were 'consensual'
	as far as state agents were concerned, the new states never
	got any consent from 'their' subjects.

	And even if a state is not created by literal 'foreign' 
	conquest, it still operates exactly like an invading army.
	Which is actually worse since it's your own 'countrymen'
	the ones who are invading and plundering you.

	Yes, the essay is interesting because it has a couple of very
	contradictory positions like that one =P

	Also, I like how Bakunin who is supposedly a 'collectivist' and
	does have a demagogical collecvtivist streak actually ends up
	siding with the indidividual and against society's 'authority'.
