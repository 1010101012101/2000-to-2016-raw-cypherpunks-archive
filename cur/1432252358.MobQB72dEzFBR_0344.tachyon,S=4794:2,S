Also large scale encryption deployments mostly use hardware acclerated
crypto offloading which (I think for historical reasons) are not as easy
to audit and recompile as open-source code (at least currently). I guess
some companies can work around that and do their own ASIC designs but
most companies don't have the resources to do that.

I wonder how Google deals with the encryption of their links between
datacenters.  Either this could be done on a per node basis, i.e.
opportunistic encryption, or centralize encryption to their border routers.

My guess is that per-flow ipsec state resolving is too costly, processing
and memory wise, because either packets get dropped or get buffered
(leading to a waste of memory in case of a high peer count) before keys
could be resolved leading to degeneration in performance or having impacts
to the programs error handling, thus not being transparent. Maybe this
can be dealt with in some time but is certainly no drop-in replacement.

This makes me believe that centralizing approaches are mostly in use today
which use unverifiable crypto implementations in hardware and it depends
on how far we trust these implementations to protect us from goverment
spying activities. IMHO target dispersal is something one should strive
for especially when encryption is in use, but this is difficult and I
don't think it is possible to realize this currently in the scale it
would be needed.

Thus large-scale interception programs must become illegal, otherwise
it is just a matter of how much the intelligence services can throw
at it to technically break down such easier to implement centralized
encryption approaches. Certainly there are other subsystems on such a
router to exploit on those routers to make the encryption meaningless.

Greetings,
