No. He talked about Von Neumann machines. We don' need no steenkin'
nano, gringo, especially circa 1983 or so. Conceivably you could
build machines that replicate themselves without manipulating
individual atoms, yes?

Why? It pops out of google just fine, it answers your point
adequately, and it's what I remember from the Old Days, back when, as
an infant, I played at the feet of the Old Ones. :-).

Besides, my n-ty volume set of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica is in
the master library -- or is it the smoking room -- of the country
house, so I don't have it at hand at the moment...

;-).

Cheers,
RAH
