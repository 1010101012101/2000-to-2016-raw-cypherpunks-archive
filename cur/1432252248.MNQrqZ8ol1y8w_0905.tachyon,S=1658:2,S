Yeah, some dead french dude IIRC pointed out that light takes the
quickest route
through a lens.  Light and time being rather intimate if you believe
your
interferometer.

OTOH a packet takes a route that depends on business
practices, etc, and isn't generally optimal.

In any case you're a lot more readable if one global replaces 'geodesic'

with 'well-connected' or glibly 'wired'.
Feel free to ignore any constructive hints of course :-) your prose is
more
identifying than your pk sig.
