not sure what you mean. Tor uses encryption to provide anonymity for
TCP streams over a 3+ hop Tor circuit with authentication and privacy
between each relay (onion layer).

what you do with this TCP stream is your business. if the suggested
HTTPS/SSL/TLS over TCP is not available you may be forced to send
things in plaintext.

if it is in plain text the exit node can tamper with the data, just
like someone injecting on a wireless network, and many other
situations.

nope; there's nothing to get rid of.

best regards,
