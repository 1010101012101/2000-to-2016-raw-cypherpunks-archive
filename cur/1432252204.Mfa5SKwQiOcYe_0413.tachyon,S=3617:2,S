Removing the article after a few weeks is consistent with MSNBC.com's
long-standing article expiration policy. Some articles stay around for
years, while others disappear within a month. MSNBC.com reporters have
told me there's no logic to this -- and that they're personally
frustrated too.

Anyway I wouldn't read too much into the link no longer working (not
saying that Ross is, but others may).
