...of "cypherpunks write code" doesn't anyone around here understand?


Somewhere, as Aristotle might say, Antisthenes is laughing.

The political mental masturbations of leftist cryptographic
crypto-academicians don't actually amount to much, frankly.

Of course, if you want to change the physics of eavesdropping (end-to-end
encrypted VOIP is probably a good place to start, if not the best
solution), then you have my complete attention.

Bleating about laws, whether we have "a nation of laws" or not, doesn't
work too much when there's an egregious surplus of same.  Under those
circumstances, no matter who's in charge, the law fucks you in the ass.
Everything is illegal, and thus nothing is.

As far as voting goes, no matter who you vote for, the government gets
elected, as the old libertarian saw goes.

Even if, as Twain wisecracked, history does rhyme instead of repeat, don't
look for the Ballad of Tricky Dick Nixon -- or Slick Willie Clittin' -- to
be recited in iambic pentameter from a Republican legislature anytime soon,
and, since the Democrats don't actually have any *prescriptive* behavior
available during a putative state of war -- or during a massive global
increase in freedom and prosperity, for that matter -- that doesn't make
the electorate laugh out loud, expect them to continue implode like
crypto-marxist "social democrats" everywhere else in the world. (Okay.
There's North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. And Bolivia. Knock yourselves
out.)

Lex vincula justitiae, as Mr. Pullo might say...


Cheers,
RAH
