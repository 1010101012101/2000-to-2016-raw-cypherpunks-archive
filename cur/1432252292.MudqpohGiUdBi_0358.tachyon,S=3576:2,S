I very much doubt it.  Where did that factor of "half" come frome.

Ah, but if you generate unequal-length packets then they are
vulnerable to length-analysis, which is a form of traffic analysis.
I've seen analysis systems that do exactly this.  So the question is,
are you trying to thwart traffic analysis, or not?

A better solution would be to leave the encryption on and use constants
(not PRNG output) for the chaff, as previously discussed.

The notion of synchronized PRNGs is IMHO crazy -- complicated as well as
utterly unnecessary.
