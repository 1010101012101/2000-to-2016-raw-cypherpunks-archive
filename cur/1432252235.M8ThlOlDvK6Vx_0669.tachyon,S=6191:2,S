The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dri||ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson wi|l 
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it wi|l be ab|e to bui|d a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing a|l possible 
Opp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we will have the 
0ppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a drilling program, which 
wi|| always encourage the participation of financial partners."

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
