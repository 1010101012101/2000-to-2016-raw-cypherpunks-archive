Justice Dept. Report Cites F.B.I. Violations

By Eric Lichtblau / New York Times

WASHINGTON, March 8 b The Federal Bureau of Investigation found apparent
violations of its own wiretapping and other intelligence-gathering procedures
more than 100 times in the last two years, and problems appear to have grown
more frequent in some crucial respects, a Justice Department report released
Wednesday said.

While some of these instances were considered technical glitches, the report,
from the department's inspector general, characterized others as
"significant," including wiretaps that were much broader in scope than
approved by a court and others that were allowed to continue for weeks or
sometimes months longer than was authorized.

In one instance, the F.B.I. received the full content of 181 telephone calls
as part of an intelligence investigation, instead of merely the billing and
toll records as authorized, the report found. In a handful of cases, it said,
the bureau conducted physical searches that had not been properly authorized.

The inspector general's findings come at a time of fierce Congressional debate
over the program of wiretapping without warrants that the National Security
Agency has conducted. That program, approved by President Bush, is separate
from the F.B.I. wiretaps reviewed in the report, and the inspector general's
office concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to review the legality
or operations of the N.S.A. effort.

But, the report disclosed, the Justice Department has opened reviews into two
other controversial counterterrorism tactics that the department has widely
employed since the Sept. 11 attacks.

In one, the inspector general has begun looking into the F.B.I.'s use of
administrative subpoenas, known as national security letters, to demand
records and documents without warrants in terror investigations. Some critics
maintain that the bureau has abused its subpoena powers to demand records in
thousands of cases.

In the other, the Office of Professional Responsibility, a Justice Department
unit that reviews ethics charges against department lawyers, has opened
inquiries related to the detention of 21 people held as material witnesses in
terror investigations.

As with the F.B.I.'s use of administrative subpoenas, civil rights advocates
assert that the Justice Department has abused the material witness statute by
holding suspects whom it may not have enough evidence to charge. The new
ethics inquiries are reviewing accusations that department officials did not
take some material witnesses to court within the required time, failed to tell
them the basis for the arrest or held them without any attempt to obtain their
testimony as supposed witnesses in terror investigations, the inspector
general said Wednesday.

Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee, characterized the report as "yet another vindication for
those of us who have raised concerns about the administration's policies in
the war on terror."

Mr. Conyers said that "despite the Bush administration's attempt to demonize
critics of its antiterrorism policies as advancing phantom or trivial
concerns, the report demonstrates that the independent Office of Inspector
General has found that many of these policies indeed warrant full
investigations."

For its part, the F.B.I. said in a statement that it had been quick to correct
errors in intelligence-gathering procedures when they were discovered and that
"there have been no examples by the F.B.I. of willful disregard for the law or
of court orders."

The inspector general's review grew out of documents, dealing with
intelligence violations, that were released last year under a Freedom of
Information Act request by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
private group in Washington. The inspector general then obtained more
documents on violations and included an 11-page analysis of the problem as
part of a broader report Wednesday on counterterrorism measures.

The inspector general reviewed 108 instances in which the F.B.I. reported
violations to an oversight board in the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years.

"We're always looking to bring the number of violations down," John Miller,
chief spokesman for the bureau, said in an interview, "but given the scope and
complexity of national security investigations, that's a relatively small
number."

The inspector general's review found that reported violations under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs some federal wiretaps,
accounted for a growing share of the total, having risen to 69 percent last
year from 48 percent in 2004.

The duration of the violations also grew in some crucial areas, the review
found. Two of those areas were the "overcollection" of intelligence b going
beyond the scope approved by the court in authorizing a wiretap b and
"overruns," in which a wiretap or other intelligence-gathering method was
allowed to continue beyond the approved time period without an extension.

The review found that the average amount of time that overcollections and
overruns were allowed before they were discovered and corrected rose to 32
days last year from 22 in 2004. In most cases, the F.B.I. was found to be at
fault, while about a quarter of the time a "third party," usually a
telecommunications company, was to blame, the data showed.

In taking issue with some of the findings, F.B.I. officials said the data were
skewed by a number of exceptionally long violations; one wiretap lasted 373
days.
