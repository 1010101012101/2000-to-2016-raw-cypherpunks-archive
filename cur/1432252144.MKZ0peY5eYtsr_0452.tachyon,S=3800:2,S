Interesting.  Even more interesting would be to get cooperation of the
paper's editor on the project: (1) avoid paying full price for the
space, (2) gain a free-speech ally.

 > Any pointers to local papers appreciated.

Here's a little list from google.

Listed below are general newspapers in the Seattle area.

      1   King County Journal (multiple locations)
      2   Puget Sound Business Journal (Seattle / Eastside)
      3   Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce (Seattle)
      4   Seattle Post-Intelligencer (Seattle - Combines ads with the 
Seattle Times)
      5   Seattle Press, The (Seattle)
      6   Seattle Times - (Seattle - Combines ads with the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer)
      7   Seattle Weekly, The (Seattle)
      8   Stranger, The (Seattle)
      9   Today's Careers (Pacific Northwest)

Some corresponding URLs

      1   http://www.kingcountyjournal.com
      2   http://seattle.bcentral.com/seattle/
      3   http://www.djc.com/classified/
      8   http://cgi.thestranger.com/classifieds/index.cgi
  >>    9   http://www.todays-careers.com/
End ex.
Another workaround would be to CC CJ and 'channel' any 'imaginings' of his 
here like 'the front'
Ill send him this now at... sonofgomez709@nospam.yahoo.com
