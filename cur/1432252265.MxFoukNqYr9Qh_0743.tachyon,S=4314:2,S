Of course if everyone feels that way, then we'll elect only the candidates
which have been pre-chosen for us.  Which is pretty much what happens
in the US, at least on a national level.  I refuse to play along,
especially in contests where I don't like the candidates from the two
major parties.  I prefer it to not voting at all.

If voters don't vote, then the major parties see them as merely
apathetic.  They don't care how many people don't vote as long at they
win.  If voters do vote, but for a third party, then the major parties
see them as voters who care, but not for them.  Meaning that there's an
issue or issues which they presumably voted for that the major
parties can co-opt in order to try to get their vote the next time.

So, while I agree with you that the system is rigged so that third parties
never get appreciable power, I disagree that voting for one is a waste
of one's vote.
