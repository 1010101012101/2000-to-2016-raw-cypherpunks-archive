i hope it was worth it for them!  'cause this is going to be expensive...


Matthew Green posted insights on how one might implement backdoors in chips:
  http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/p/some-thoughts-on-suborning-encryption.html
as well as the "Weak random number generators" attacks:

regarding the unredaction automation: the typographic interpolation
trick discussed on the list, matching type face with justified spacing
with candidate word(s), is a really annoying idea and won't get out of
my head.

 (i tried to distract and forget with a Tor patch -
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10402 - to no avail ;)

currently playing with scipy, skimage to:
- obtain from human initial document image
- obtain from human seed words / dictionary for matching
- misc. contrast / levels / etc conditioning for text optimized monochrome
- mask document image into text and non-text areas
- edge detect, align to horoz (for selections by x/y)
- broad region detect text rows into individual row images
- region detect individual chars per row image then assign char value via OCR
- insert human in loop to confirm / correct OCR row by row
- insert human to select redact line + redact area
- interpolate justified components: character spacing, word spacing, etc.
- iterate over known text with candidate fonts until best match.
- iterate over candidate words in best font until best match.
- success?  what confidence? (GOTO 10)
(the extra work for char by char and whole doc dis-assembly is in case
a "re-assemble scanned chars into candidate" rather than "match font
and re-produce text candidate" mode is needed.)

something better, Beuller?  ... Beuller?
... this won't be the last time i find this code useful!
