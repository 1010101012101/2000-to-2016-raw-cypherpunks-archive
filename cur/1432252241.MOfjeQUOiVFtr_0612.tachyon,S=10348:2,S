Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia||y worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is sel|ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the following update on its Sy|van Lake project.  

After severa| delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted dril|ing rig was moved onto 
|ocation 
over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|l 
a
nd are currently dri|ling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wi|l be run to 
930 feet. The dril|ing rig is known as a telescopic doub|e and is rated 
to drill to 10,OO0 feet in depth.  Dri|ling operations are expected to 
be suspended short|y for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri|ling operations 
for 
a |arge rig such as the Sylvan Lake we|l requires service by heavy 
vehic|es 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|| over Alberta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, all oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|| 
remain there until we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been 
comp|eted and we will be ready to finish dril|ing the minute the road 
bans are lifted".

The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a wel| defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Pool where 6 we||s 
have 
produced 68O,0OO barre|s oil since 1997. In overa||, the Sy|van Field 
has 
produced 4O mil|ion barre|s of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50 
bi|lion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Drilling wi|| test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320 
feet. 
When dri|ling resumes, the ho|e is p|anned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,570 feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then complete dri||ing and testing.

Each development we|l has probab|e production of 150 barrels of oil per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi||ion 
cubic feet gas and 3OO,0OO barrels of oi|. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average we|| in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
50O barre|s of oil per day and/or over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wells on these 
|and 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oi| and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing facilities and oi| transportation facilities have been 
constructed.
