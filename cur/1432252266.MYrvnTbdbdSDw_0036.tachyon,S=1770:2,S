That israeli intelligence apparently considers Tor broken.

While Tor definitely has not been designed with that
threat model in mind, this still strikes me as somewhat
dubious.

So either there's a design weakness, or boxes upstream
do sophisticated traffic analysis, or this is a canard,
(either freely invented, or planted).

Speculations (preferrably, more informed than mine) welcome.
