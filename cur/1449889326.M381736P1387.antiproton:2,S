	Oh, OK. Yes, all those things you mention are enhanced by
	electronic communication networks. And yes, the online
	library is especially nice. 

	I can't help pointing out though that all the things you
	mentioned existed before the internet and even before telegraph
	networks =P

	Before 'networking', access to libraries was more restricted,
	true, but the ability for governments to track millions of
	people in realtime was just a crazy dream - or nightmare. Looks
	to me that the good changes are more incremental in nature
	whereas the bad changes are kinda 'revolutionary'.

	Point taken.

	Until a few months ago I had a facebook account and yes, I
	used to follow copwatch, among other things. 

	As a matter of fact, I've been involved in the political
	networking you speak of (both online & offline) , for years,
	mostly in spanish speaking 'libertarian' circles.

	Yes, I realize that part of the hype actually references real
	and valuable changes.

	I honestly don't see a radical change in that area. Or else, if
	'poltical intelligence' is more common and of better quality,
	I don't see too many people acting on it.

	I don't think they plan to turn it off. That's the thing.
	Considering how computers work, it's possible or even
	easy for them to, say, sabotage or control personal
	communications while 'freely' allowing people to buy stuff off
	amazon.

	Wait and see I guess.

	Yes, you do have a point there, but it's not as if mass
	persecution of dissidents is impossible either. Just look at the
	US 'war on drugs'.

	I don't think there's been a real 'on the field' test yet.

	Well, that I can agree with. I obviously am not too optimistic
	regarding future outcomes, at least as far as the near future
	is concerned.

	That may be true.

	Well, at 44 I'm not exactly young either =P.

	Anyway, I don't think the different views have much to do with
	age. Yes, young people on 'social networks' will post 'private'
	pictures for all the world to see, but I think even them have
	secrets they don't want to share.

	I don't think there are many radicals around here, either young
	or old =/  Maybe I should move...

	I kinda suspect I already did =P
