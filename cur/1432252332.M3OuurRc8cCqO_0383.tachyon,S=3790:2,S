Wow, check this out.  Not surprising, in retrospect. 

Teacher: "Johnny, why didn't you finish your research report on that 
candidate and his views?"

Johnny: "The library computer blocked me."

Teacher: "It's to save the children."

> It turns out that politicians' websites are being blocked in schools

> political spectrum; the other takes a big chunk out of Republicans,
> Libertarians and conservative third parties. One Republican candidate
> (so far) has changed his position on filters because of this report.
