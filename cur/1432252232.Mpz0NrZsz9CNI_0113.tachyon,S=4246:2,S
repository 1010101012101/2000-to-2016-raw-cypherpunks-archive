regarding various altcoin pools for various eventualities:

consider a cypherpunk insurance pool with coins allocated fractionally
by some agreed upon method or individual contribution.  in the event
of their untimely demise for any reason, said funds delivered to
designated entity named by prior cryptographic signature (which must
be frequently re-attested).

would it be useful to have a pool for cypherpunks who "buy the farm"?

expenses per "buy the farm" may be as trivial as re-homing your cat
and books, or as extensive as a large family with medical
complications, significant debt obligations, and unexpected costly
events of unplanned nature requiring support decades into the future.

the only restriction which may be advisable is prohibiting the
designated beneficiary from running a death pool against specific or
general groups of individuals.  my distributed graph solver still
crunching, but preliminary results suggest that a critical threshold
of cypherpunks with wills to death pools combined with a specific
trigger set of few otherwise natural deaths multiplies into a
maelstrom of murder; presuming of course that a reasonably robust
death prediction market or assassination market comes into existence
which satisfies the pre-conditions of my computational game theory
model of this multi-party, multi-round stratagem mapped over a
topological isomorphism of the entire set of probabilities for a given
set of initial conditions into a single high order topological
manifold transformation collected in aggregate for an overall motif of
risk...   will advise.
