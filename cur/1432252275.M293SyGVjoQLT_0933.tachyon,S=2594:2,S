The first two parts: ok by all means. People simply shouldn't submit to such
shitty treatment. It's too bad more of us do not refuse. About the last
part: how is this different from the government using IR scanning to invade
your privacy? This is about a reasonable expectation of privacy. And don't
tell me the Men with Guns make a difference - the government could achieve
its goals quite well purely through economic means. Zaibatsu-like company
states offer prime examples of how to structure this.
