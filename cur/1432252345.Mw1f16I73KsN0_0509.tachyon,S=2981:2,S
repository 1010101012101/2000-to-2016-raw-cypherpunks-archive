I'm afraid that is what is being proposed.
of course, similiar stuff has been proposed for a long time. the IP
industry is greedy, as we all know. and since IP is an artificial right,
created by law (copyright, among others), they need laws if they want to
move into new areas of business or extend their old ones. other people
innovate to grow, IP corporations buy new laws.

lawsuit, civil, most likely.
