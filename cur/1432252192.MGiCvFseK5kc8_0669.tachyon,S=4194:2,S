This seems like a likely outcome, part of the "credentialling of America."

There are parts of biological research which can only be done by 
approved, credentialled researchers. Ditto for weapons work of 
various kinds.

(And I won't even get into the licensing of increasing numbers of 
professions, licensing which is really part of a rent-seeking deal by 
_established_ actors and also part of a _control_ method welcomed by 
government.)

In direct analogy with Mike's point above, thing about locksmiths and 
locksmith tools. In many places, only "certified locksmiths" may 
possess even simple lock picks and diagrams of locks. (As with most 
such limitations on freedom, I don't think the Supreme Court has ever 
heard a major case on the constitutionality of making possession of a 
lock diagram a thought crime.)

The DMCA is like this ban on locksmithing tools and knowledge. It 
obviously doesn't apply to the _developers_ of such "locks," only to 
those outside the guild who try to analyze them.
