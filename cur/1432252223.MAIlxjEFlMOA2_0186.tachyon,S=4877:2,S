Why does the vast majority get started, then poop out?</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>

<BR>
Just what does it take to make it happen?<BR>
<BR>
We all know that MLM can get you Financial freedom in an <BR>
unusually short time; we’ve seen it done over and over, albeit <BR>
not by everyone who gets started, nevertheless it CAN be done.  <BR>
<BR>
	So, how do we make it work for more of us?<BR>
<BR>
Simply put, it takes a real <B>BURN</B>.  <BR>
You’ve just got to want it real bad.<BR>
<BR>
Now, given this burn, then what you want is a company to work<BR>
with that is Proven.  One that has withstood the test of time.  <BR>
<BR>
How about a company that has been voted #1 in the industry<BR>
for the last four years in a row?  How about one that has a <BR>
compensation plan that is not in question?  How about one whose <BR>
products are not in question?  How about one that has the most <BR>
sophisticated downline management and business building tools <BR>
in the industry?  <BR>
<BR>
So, if you’ve got the Burn, this is the company.<BR>
<BR>
The question now is, "Do You Have the BURN?"<BR>
<BR>

Read the 7/23/01 article about White Collar layoffs.  <BR>
It talked about the new surge of layoffs.  Since <BR>
January, 26,000 at Daimler-Chrysler; 16,000 at Lucent; <BR>
9,600 at Proctor & Gamble; 8,500 at Cisco; even 4,000 <BR>
at Disney!  This is the era of white-collar layoffs.<BR>
<BR>
Don't get caught with your hands in your pockets. <BR>
Have a "Fall Back" position for your financial security. <BR>
Desperation, excuse the expression, sucks.<BR>
