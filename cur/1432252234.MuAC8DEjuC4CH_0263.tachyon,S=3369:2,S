XML's a decent match with tuples, and providing an easily
standardized and malleable data interchange format is not only
an easy thing to bolt on but a potentially big win for usability,
as well as providing the lastest buzzword compliance.
Of course, just because you *can* use it to make things cleaner
instead of uglier and more complex doesn't mean you have to.

Lots of the recent user interface trends are a waste of, umm, skins.
A certain 3.5-letter-acronym company or its suppliers recently
put lots of effort into enhancing its secure VPN dialer product,
and I *wish* they'd focused on testing the Mac product instead of
doing customizable look&feel for the Windoze versions...
