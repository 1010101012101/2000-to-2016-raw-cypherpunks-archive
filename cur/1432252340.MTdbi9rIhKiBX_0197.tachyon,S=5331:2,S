Snowden filtered by Janes Risen filtered by New York Times,
as with all other filterings by special-interested Snowden
filters, does deliver a reassuring message to precisely
answer highly filtered questions and charges that have
been made about his heavily filtered, nay, almost negligible
releases.

Perhaps Snowden actually speaks in person, appears
in a filtered documentary, in a WikiLeaks filtered video,
emails encryptically! via Greenwald and Risen, like a
character from a brain-washing film, formulaicly, always
on point, no ifs and buts, no waverings from
propaganda-like rationales and justifications.

But so far every version of his apperances by whatever
medium come across as carefully vetted by WikiLeak's
Sarah Harrison, lawyers and PR wizards, as over-edited,
sanitized and directed, as little substantiated despite
alleged thousands of documents as hard driven
advocacy so like reviled special-interested groups of
all persuasions.

This critique applies to the dog and pony shows now
ranging the globe by freedom of information special
interests, staffed by a coterie of so-called ex-spies,
their lawyers, their PR wizards, national security
journalists and civil liberties exploiters, bedded and
applauded by camp followers, funded by egotically,
narcissisticly bored and wealth-drunk patrons like
Omidyar, Soros, and, why not j'accuse the combine,
the USG and its filthy rich spies long known to use
the wealthy to protect their common special interests
since corruption was invented, Day One.

Snowden is either an ignorant fool, seduced along
with Manning, by the narcotic dispensed by govs, NGOs,
spies and the wealthy "to do good" or a fabulous
con artist like Assange to "fleece the fuckers" as he
emailed January 2007, via leaks extortion, that is,
adopt the strategy and tactics of the "enemy" to
seduce others into their concentrated wealth carnal
palace.
