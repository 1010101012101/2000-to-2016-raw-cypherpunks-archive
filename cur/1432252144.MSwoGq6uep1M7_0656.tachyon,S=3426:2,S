The sheeple are being asked in online polls, in man-on-the-street 
surveys by news crews, just how many civil liberties we should give up.


Tim's Alternative Poll:

Q: What do you think should be done to those who violate the Bill of 
Rights, for example, by suspending various of our civil liberties?:

a) arrest, trial, and, if convicted, lengthy imprisonment for tens of 
thousands of cops, judges, bureaucrats, and others complicit in any way 
whatsoever with this suspension of civil liberties

b) victims should fight back with all resources, and, if possible, kill 
their attackers

c) all government employees involved in such a suspension should be 
herded together and then doused with aviation fuel and lit...

d) we should demand to know why the CIA, er, the Taliban, altered its 
plans to hit the Capitol and instead diverted at the last minute into a 
nearly empty section of the Pentagon
