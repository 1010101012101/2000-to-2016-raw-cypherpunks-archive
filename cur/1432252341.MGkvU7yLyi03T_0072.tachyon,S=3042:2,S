  How To Steal an Election

  It's easier to rig an electronic voting machine than a Las Vegas slot
  machine, says University of Pennsylvania visiting professor Steve Freeman.
  That's because Vegas slots are better monitored and regulated than
  America's voting machines, Freeman writes in a book out in July that
  argues, among other things, that President Bush may owe his 2004 win to an
  unfair vote count. We'll wait to read his book before making a judgment
  about that. But Freeman has assembled comparisons that suggest Americans
  protect their vices more than they guard their rights, according to data he
  presented at an October meeting of the American Statistical Association in
  Philadelphia.
