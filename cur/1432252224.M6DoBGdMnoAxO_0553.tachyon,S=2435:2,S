Ayup. New toys.

What's wrong with looking obviously military? Especially if you're getting
paid for it. :-).

Natural selection being what it is, I'm actually thinking about follow-on
generations of said merc-meat becoming recursively less toasty over time,
as an eventual more efficient replacement for state-paid force. Something
which could be fun given the right market forces.

So, what, declare all current property claims in Fallujah to be null and
void, sell claims off to the highest bidder, and whoever gets there with
the most men owns it. I mean, it worked in Texas with the Comanches and
Apaches...

Yeah, it's a fantasy, but we all have our dreams, right? :-).

Cheers,
RAH
