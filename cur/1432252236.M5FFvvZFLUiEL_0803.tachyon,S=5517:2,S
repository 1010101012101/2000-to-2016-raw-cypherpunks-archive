I agree, most of it was like a bad history of cryptography in America. I
wish I had stuck watching Boston Public.

Last year (1999/early 2000) Congress tacked a requirement onto an
appropriations bill which required the NSA to report on Echelon and
monitoring of American citizens. This was shortly after the director plead
attorney client privilege with the NSA's Chief Counsel.

Does anyone know what happened with this report? Were there any sections not
classified?

Watched it, ET giving me a 3 hr advantage over you golden staters. A
definite passover except for last 10 minutes, Echelon-dodging making
the spooks limber enough to Macarena with Clipper Chip-endorsing Al
with dispatch. "Trust us," DIRNSA proudly proclaims, with Church bells
ringing in the near distance. Of note is latest permutation of
horsemen riding in on backs of Defcon-going hackers as justification
for existence of The Agency That Shall Not Be Named.
