Web page developers using the OptiCart system are praising that the website 
no longer has to be built around the shopping cart unlike other shopping 
cart software and e-commerce software, but is instead added as an extra 
skin after the design and implementation has already been made.
The OptiCart system uses Java technology to provide real-time updates of 
the contents of the shopping basket and brings the concept of cybercash one 
step closer to reality.
