   Tor VM is a small virtual machine that acts as a router and redirects
   your TCP traffic and DNS request through Tor while filtering out
   protocols that could jeopardize your anonymity. Tor VM is built using
   all open source software and is free.

   There are many advantages to running Tor in a virtual machine. Any
   application on any operating system that uses TCP for communication is
   routed over Tor. By using a small virtual machine that acts as a
   router, protocols such as UDP and ICMP are filtered, preventing a
   compromise of your anonymity. Placing Tor in a virtual machine
   separates Tor from potentially insecure applications that could
   compromises Tor's integrity and your security.

   The Tor VM ISO is designed to be run in a virtual machine, not on
   physical hardware. The ISO requires two virtual NICs to be used; one
   bridged interface, one OpenVPN Tun/Tap adapter. The Windows build of
   Tor VM is portable and includes QEMU to run the virtual machine, but
   requires Administrator privileges to install the Tap32 adapter.
   Traffic is routed through the Tap interface, into the VM, TCP and DNS
   are directed to Tor's Transport while other protocols are discarded,
   then Tor does it's magic with your traffic. More details can be found
   in the design documentation.

   Lots of people are going to ask "What's the difference between JanusVM
   and Tor VM?", so I'll address this now. JanusVM was designed to be
   used by multiple users, runs HTTP traffic through Squid and Privoxy,
   and was build on top of Debian packages. Tor VM is built from entirely
   100% open source software, is pre-configured to support only a single
   user, is much smaller in size, uses less memory than JanusVM, and
   works with QEMU. Is Tor VM going to replace JanusVM?? It's too soon to
   tell.

   This software is in the late alpha stages of development; work is
   still in progress. For the time being, Tor VM is being hosted on the
   JanusVM server. Martin and I would appreciate it if a few of you would
   give Tor VM a go and provide us with your feedback. Feel free to
   review the We look forward to hearing from the community.

   One last thing. Mad props to coderman! Martin did an amazing job
   hacking QEMU and the WinPCAP drivers in order to create an interface
   that is a raw bridge into the existing network card. This is just as
   good as VMware bridge service, if not better! It's Amazing work; make
   sure to take a close look at what is under the hood. Tor VM wouldn't
   have been possible if it wasn't for his insane amount of knowledge and
   skill. Let me be the first to say it; Thank You. :)

   Best Regards,

   Kyle Williams
