I'm with Steve Schear on this one.

If Alice in California buys a thing from a person or store in 
Pennsylvania, and that store is not operating in California (the 
"nexus"), then charging a tax on that item is NOT a "sales tax." It is 
much more like a tariff on goods entering California.

(What else could it be? The sale is not happening at a store in 
California, or even arguably at an out-of-state "branch" of a store in 
California, there being no such store at all in California. Thus the 
"tax" is really just a tariff or duty. Something specifically forbidden.)

Of course, states like California get around _parts_ of this ruling when 
people bring cars bought elsewhere into California: they require some 
calculated amount of the effective sales tax, had the car been bought in 
California, to be paid upon registration of the car.
