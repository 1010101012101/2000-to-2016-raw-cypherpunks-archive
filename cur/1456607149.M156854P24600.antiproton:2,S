Probably the only job on the list with any sort of real job security,
and they might make you store manager. As corporate jobs go, Starbucks
is probably a good job to 'fly a desk' at too.

A few years ago this guy, a chemical engineer, who worked at a local
startup that was attempting to do some "Green Tech" by leasing a piece
of a nearby cement plant to experiment with sinking CO2 into the
concrete as a way to help the environment, needed to find another job
because the 'suits' were having too much fun driving their leased
Ferraris to look for funding.

He was looking at a job in the SF Bay area as an engineer at a thin-film
emulsion company, and a job as chemist for Gallo wine. He had a newborn
and a wife and asked me what I thought.

I recommended the company that had existed long before he was alive, and
most likely will exist long after he's gone... Smart guy. He took my advi=
ce.
