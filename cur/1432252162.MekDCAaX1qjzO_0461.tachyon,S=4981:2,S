Subject: [free-sklyarov] San Jose Monday: schedule and directions

This is a summary of the plans for the demonstration at Adobe that
we discussed at the meeting last night.  We agreed to meet at the
park and walk to Adobe together, and the snake is an obvious meeting
place that is close to, but out of line of sight from, Adobe HQ.

Parking: An inexpensive pay parking lot is available at the San
Jose Convention Center, across San Carlos from the snake sculpture.
The entrance is from Almaden Blvd., one block west.

Please do not park at Adobe!


WHAT TO BRING

Please bring a sign or a U.S. or Russian flag, and a cell phone if
you have one.  Keep signs simple (4 words is ideal) so that they
are easy to read for people passing by.

"Adobe: drop the charges" and "Free Dmitry" are examples.

Free event T-shirts to the first 50 attendees.
