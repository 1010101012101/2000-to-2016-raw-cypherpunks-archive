You can use GPS as naming service (name collisions are then equivalent to 
physical space collisions). You can actually label the nodes 
automagically, once you know that it's a nearest-neighbour mesh spanned 
over patches of Earth surface. You can use signal strenght and 
relativistic ping to make mutual time of flight triangulation. It is a 
good idea to use a few GPS anchor nodes, so that all domains are 
consistent.

I think it can fit.

No, an orthogonal identifier is sufficient. In fact, DNS loc would be a 
good start.

The system can negotiate whatever routing method it uses. If the node 
doesn't understand geographic routing, it falls back to legacy methods.
