Some toy guns could be made illegal if the government goes ahead with its 
intention to ban replica firearms.

Home Office minister Charles Clarke revealed that such a move was possible 
when he spoke at an exhibition of seized fake weapons, which included 
imitation Uzi machine pistols and an SA-80 assault rifle.

Such replicas can be bought in shops or by mail order and are frequently used
by criminals.

The minister said replicas posed a "real threat" to society.
