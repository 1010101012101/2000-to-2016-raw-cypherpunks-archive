What an unmitigated crock of shit.  Who would have imagined that
anti-stalking laws, originally sold to the public with tear-jerking tales
of battered women needing to be protected from violent boyfriends and
spouses, would be employed by jackbooted thugs claiming to be in fear of
their lives because publically available information about them is in the
possession of the citizens they harrass and persecute.

Clearly Jackboot-Americans feel they should be completely exempt from
ordinary rules of accountability which apply to all other Americans, and
that the state apparatus should be at their beck and call to carry out
personal attacks against their critics.

Laws on terrorism, conspiracy, and harrassment are being twisted daily to
do an endrun around the First Amendment, and convictions are being won,
and case law is being created, which says this is all fine and dandy.

It's gotten to the point where one may not exercise ones right to free
speech, unless one gives up ones right to freedom of action, and vice
versa.  One can say what one thinks of government officials, as long as
one does not engage in any behavior, however legal, which constitutes
action in support of that speech.  And conversely, one may engage in legal
action, as long as one gives up ones right to engage in legal speech.

To engage in both legal action and legal speech at the same time, is to
risk having the government twist ones actions into a conspiracy, and to
risk getting convicted under the new plethora of laws sold to the public
under various disingenuous guises, or under old laws given new
interpretations.

It's not necessary that the legal speech and legal action have any genuine
relation.  If you say the government is corrupt, and you belong to a
militia, and play paintball games in the woods on weekends, then you are
obviously conspiring to overthrow the government in word and deed.

Similarly, it's perfectly legal to own nitric acid, and it's perfectly
legal to say that IRS agents deserve to be dissolved in nitric acid, but
it's very dangerous to ones personal freedom to do both at the same time.

It's perfectly legal to possess publicly available information on
government employees, and to possess chemicals, and electronic devices.  
It's also legal to go anywhere one pleases, on public property, and even
on private property to ring doorbells and ask people questions, as long as
one leaves when one is asked to.

It's also perfectly legal to hold satirical legal proceedings against
public officials, for the purpose of making a political statement.  It's
perfectly legal to speculate on cryptographic solutions to government
corruption.  

But if one person does all these things simultaneously, one risks being
the subject of a contrived fairy tale, written by a boob like Jeff Gordon, 
sprinkled with innuendo, and rubber stamped by a judge as inerrant
scripture, which makes one look like the next Osama Bin Laden. 

So the First Amendment is effectively dead, not repealed by the will
of the people, but suffocated in the dead of night by Jackboot-Americans
like Jeff Gordon and his pals.  (puke)
