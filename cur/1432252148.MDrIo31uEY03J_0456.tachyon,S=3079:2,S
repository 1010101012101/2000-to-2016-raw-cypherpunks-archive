Indeed there's been a few cases of something like BSE in Americans
who've eaten elk and / or deer.  But since the infected aren't fed
back into the population, there's no way for it to spread.  (E.g.,
if it arises spontaneously now and then.) 

Grass-eaters are not carnivores, much less cannibals, in the wild.  By
definition.
