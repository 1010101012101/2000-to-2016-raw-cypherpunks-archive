I know this has been mentioned before, but it seems to me that we should 
make use of all the great CRM watermarking technologies being 
developed.  One of the primary goals of such technology is to hide the 
watermark in such a way that it cannot be isolated from the source material 
or removed by copying or filtering without making reproduction of the 
source material unacceptably degraded.

At MacCrypto BlueSpike http://www.bluespike.com/ gave an good talk on this 
and my mind has been considering the stego uses of CRM ever since.  To the 
degree such technologies deliver on these aspects of their CRM mandate they 
may serve the needs of clandestine communications.
