I agree, and I'm a "wuss ninnie," according to many. They are broadcasting
the hotlines/website: http://www.ifcc.fbi.gov (slashdotted, on my end). They
want everything.

...Could the remops collaborate in some fashion so as to offer collection
assistance?

...Could you set up a working group to assist with these situations in the
future?

...Could you build something to facilitate anonymous reporting? I'm
brown-nosing Steele again, but terrorism seems to support a Whitehat
Blacknet (what I called an OSINT Intellagora). Isn't this a perfect example?

I think a working group on something like this would put crypto in a
positive light.
