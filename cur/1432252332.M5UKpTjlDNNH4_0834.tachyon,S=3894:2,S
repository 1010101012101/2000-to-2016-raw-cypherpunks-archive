Funny you should mention that.  NNTP is, to my mind, the world's greatest 
messaging protocol.  Back in the day, Netscape built a "collaboration 
server" that added access controls and some management functions to an NNTP 
server - it was an incredibly powerful tool.

In some sense, the model sitting in the back of my mind, is:
- NNTP (with encryption and crypto-based access controls)
- easier management of (private) group creation
- messages containing HTML & JavaScript that can do some embedded  
threading (think about sending a Wiki page, the initial page shows up as a 
news message, edits are automatically applied rather than showing up as 
separate messages)

Yes... saw that a while back - does look really interesting.
