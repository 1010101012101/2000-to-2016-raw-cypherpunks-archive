Tor is not alone in misleading users about online security.
It would be worth repeating that security online, as offline,
is always an iffy promise and that communication and
identity-protection caution is a basic requirement.

Offerers of security in whatever guise -- national,
governmental, commercial, organizational, religious,
individual -- are well aware of the limits of what is being 
offered and thus over-promise to conceal those limits.

Security should be understood to mean limited security,
which is how security experts know it. A few of them laugh,
or growl, at the ease with which scoundrels among them
deceive the public. Most, however, enjoy the rewards of 
keeping quiet, or most likely, shading the truth in such a 
way that when vulnerabilities are exposed -- ie, people 
die (far more than sacrosanct journalists, entire duped
populations) -- they roll out the usual exculpations of 
charging the victims with complicity in their suffering 
for believing what they were told.

Never trust a security expert for they an incapable of
knowing the full consequences of what they are advising
about, having been trained to fudge, blather, brag, warn, 
and promulgate the faith.

Security means to blame the victim, that is, require to
the victim to believe in corrupt security, to never doubt 
the security offerers, all of whom are motherfucking 
liars, cheats and false priests, most often in pay of 
those who reap great fortunes fucking the people,
themselves protected by secrecy.

Without secrecy none of this shit would work. Thus,
above all else, cloaking secrecy with evasive bullshit 
is essential, for example, the open source religion
which hides crimes and misdemeanors around
the globe, above and below.

Dinky revelations of vulnerabilities hide great ones.
Thus, the near monthly revelations of data hacking,
the crowing about finding holes, the issuing of new
patches and protections, the revisions of privacy
policies, the proposed new legislation and regulation
to control violations, the warnings of national attacks,
the grandstanding virii of machinic attacks, the calls
for digital identities and banning of anonymity, the
jailing of a few pipsqueak examples, the avoidance

of effective law enforcement and punishment of
major cartels and spy regimes inside and outside 
government, the excusing of corporate and institutional
siphoning of user data, the lack of constraint on military
arms sales and product promotiing wars, well, its a 
long list of what secret security fosters.

Believe nothing you hear about security, should be the
motto required of every peddler and advocate of it.

Alternatives to security are available but get no traction
against the hegemon.
