We know the spooks do bad things.  They have done bad things to people who post on this list.  We also know commies do bad things.

The argument I object to is that all the bad behavior, the authoritarianism, the crimes, the repression, that we saw from the new left during the seventies is somehow the fault of the spooks, and somehow not the fault of the people who were doing it.
