i'd like to pass off previous legitimate criticisms on the lack of
pervasive and popular crypto by claiming usability flaws as the
culprit.  but encouraging the public is surely some part of this
effort.

how about handing out bootable CD's chock full of usable crypto
goodness[1] to all those sign waving agitators so they might exercise
a little personal responsibility for securing their privacy in
addition to the masturbatory mob unity displays seeking redress and
retraction from large, distant organizational structures who give two
shits about that catchy slogan wielded impotently on ceder stick as if
it were Excalibur itself expecting imminent victory over all of the
world's ills...

an updated image with zPhone integrated would be nice; perhaps
something i'll poke at in the near future unless someone else does it
first.  privacy knoppix needs a rebirth :)
