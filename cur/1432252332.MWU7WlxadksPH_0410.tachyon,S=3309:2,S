like Jim Bell and Carl Johnson? 

Did Milosevic and bin Laden violate the laws of the countries in which they 
live, or did they (as we all do) violate the laws of unrelated jurisdictions? 

Or is this "police force" merely a well-organized band of thugs bent on 
demonstrating their own virility? 

If that's what you're looking for, Hell's Angels have much better parties 
and are more trustworthy.
