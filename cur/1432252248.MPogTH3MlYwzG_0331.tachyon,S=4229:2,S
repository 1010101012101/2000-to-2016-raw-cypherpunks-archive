There is good and evil censorware, and many in the censorware project were
more concerned with good censorware than evil.

The censorware project was a typical pinko project, directed at private
choice, instead of state power.

Most US censorware, in particular the censorware that I write, can be
uninstalled in five clicks of a mouse.   Just click on start, settings,
control panel, add/remove programs.   I would not be part of any project
that was otherwise.

Pinkos are fond of imposing odd meanings on "free speech", sometimes
interpreting it as a right for certain views to be heard, rather than a
right of people to speak to those that choose to hear.
