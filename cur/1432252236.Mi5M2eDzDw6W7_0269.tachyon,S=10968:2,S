Interesting - the article is a little confused on a few points - 
specifically, this is not the first time this has happened, the DEA 
subpoena'd records from a publisher of mushroom growing books back in the 
mid 90's. They also subpoena records from garden supply stores looking for 
people who buy too many grow lamps or hydroponic setups.

Also, it doesn't sound like they're talking about a search warrant - those 
aren't issued by DA's, nor do their targets have an opportunity to argue 
about what's searched prior to the search, because the searches take place 
without notice and at gunpoint. It sounds like they're talking about a 
subpoena, which does afford the recipient a chance to get an attorney and 
argue about it prior to releasing information.

Still, it's a good reminder that it can be dangerous to trust even good 
people with sensitive information - the good people may not willingly 
betray you, but they may be forced to divulge the information on pain of 
losing money, property, or their life, or it may simply be stolen by armed 
gangs.
