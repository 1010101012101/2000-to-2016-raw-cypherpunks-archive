I've owned an "Audio Alchemy" SCMS-stripper since 1991, when I bought 
my first DAT machine. It cost about $99, was about the size of a deck 
of cards, and stripped the SCMS bits out of the digital bitstream.

A later DAT machine I bought, a Tascam portable pro deck, has the SCMS 
stripped by default. (It takes in digital signals and writes to the DAT 
with the SCMS code set to "unlimited number of digital copies allowed.")

Likewise, a professional CD writer I own (HHB) bypasses SCMS. (Not just 
allowing a digital copy to be made, but making the resulting CD-R 
copyable freely.)

A friend of mine bought his DVD player on EBay: it bypasses all region 
coding (i.e., it makes all DVDs "region-free"). Region coding is a 
different issue, but part of the DRM universe.

Until George W. Bush and the Carlyle Group start putting money into 
these things and thus discover that SCMS strippers are terrorist tools, 
such tools will likely continue to be available.
