By the way, a topic I talked about a month or two ago, the bogus nature 
of the _Economics_ prize, has been in the news. Some of the descendants 
of the Nobel family want the Economics prize to have no connection to 
the name "Nobel."

Their claim is that Alfred Nobel didn't create or fund the prize, so why 
is it called "Nobel"?

I think the subtext is that the Econ prize is trivializing the other 
prizes.

"Economists win for "lemon analysis"" does not quite compare with 
discovering basic laws of physics or chemistry, for example.
