where to begin?  disclosure: i know nothing of applied cryptography though
the idea has fascinated me for a long time. the concepts involved, their
potential. thus perhaps a series of naive observations, some less useful
than others. from what little i know yet discern about given assumptions, a
worldwide charade is being played with cryptographic systems that has
become transparent, made the lies self-evident and the liars either
self-conscious or openly, treacherously duplicitous. the security game,
maybe this is, though thoroughly reliant on unstable theory to maintain the
illusion, the bullshit growing ever more deep, quicksand smothering.

it is proposed the existing 'crypto' song and dance routine buttressing
illegalities of the worldwide terror state is based on a false perspective
decades if not millennia old, which has made accounting for truth secondary
as a route to securing a shared ideological viewpoint. the problem of
relativism at its core, an ever shifting eye that exploits the warp and
skew as its means of obfuscation, a lazy route to secrecy- dumb
cryptography in some sense, if what is exchange or transmitted is not
verified as actually true, and instead circulates as 'partially true' or
'sorta accurate' though is _believed to be absolute truth in a too simple
consideration of events.

thus you could have Bob and Alice in some key exchange, who knows, maybe
Bob is Nancy and Alice is Edward in drag, and they could share [z] via
crypto exchange, software that complicates and seemingly protects the
transmitted data, and so [z] moves from one location to another, or is
pinged or relayed or somehow becomes shared consciousness, "known" such
that: bob [z] and alice [z].

Yet without establishing and relying upon its verification - not only in
but as truth - the assumption could exist that [z] by its very nature is by
default true because it is believed, versus the core data being corrupted
in the realm of ideas, accuracy of viewpoint; actual intelligence and
validation and verification of the accuracy and worth of ideas, which
ultimately must ground to truth, as close to unerring as possible, else
that is where problems creep in and erosion of shared views begins. In
that, [z]=truth could be assumed yet could be based on an ideological
framework, lacking both depth and knowledge, and instead exist as 'shared
falsity' which, if unaccounted for, has all the pragmatic worth of 'shared
truth' yet exists and is functional only virtually, as long as it remains
unaccounted for.

In this way, [z]=partial truth or [z]=falsity could be what is exchanged
via crypto softwarez. A weak point in crypto may be the data being
exchanged, its integrity and actual versus perceived value. In such a way a
false perspective could be established via this 'secured communication'
that is a secrecy based on shared lies.

And that more than anything else to me describes the corruption at the core
of crypto systems today, their total invalidity as platforms of secure
exchange and instead the means for trojan horsing and backdooring every
last electronic and photonic and emissive blip, including neurotic gray
matter signaling, as if people are just that fucking stupid to believe all
the collective bullshit this involves.

The ideological mindset that allows this, nay, the binary religion of
technocrats schooling the captive society via oppressive social engineering
into _only using 10% of their brains -  else blitzkrieg pills and the psych
ward for you! - regulates into existence a drugged compliant machine-like
population of yes men and pacified complacent children who can only
memorize and repeat, creating a supercomputer via that wonder-component of
electronics: the human slave, until a robot or more efficient part can be
made, the former natural resource to be exploited then discarded, made
obsolete for the automated state megamachine. Godless Bureaucracy that is,
just like these shithole dysfunctional computers serving its crooked
agenda, labyrinths for extortion, oppression, exploitation, billionaires,
trillions made off of this enslavement, all the while the future and hope
vanish for those so entombed, buried alive in the silicon wasteland.

These pyramids of late 20th century cities not unlike the massive
e-commerce grid of banks and businesses at scale and distributed online,
the canned CMS sites like big-box stores along highways, with long arteries
of regressive planning extending standardized mediocrity akin to the
subsidized utopia of suburban sprawl - yet at a price of infrastructure and
dilution of culture, the society made for and run by middle-management; a
realm reliant on taxes and yet with a tax system incapable of accounting
for its own transactions: such basic knowledge not taught in schools at any
level, thus reliant on a professional class and its politics of
interpretation. Illiteracy, the subtext, if even that can be read anymore.
Bad thoughts, no-no's are no-go, shaming, a certain kind walking around
like freaks in surveillance databases, no single varsity letters: scarlet
alphabets. Ah, two way mirrors and glass walls, reflections inside
refracted reflections.

The lie allowing this, the inaccuracy is the binary worldview, the conceit
of notation of truth (1) and falsity (0) as a normative pleasure and
determination, as if quiz show answering via gut instinctual response,
biofeedbacking truth via the electrode array of slime, however networked,
modeled, theorized to exist- statistics, monetization, force feedback,
saliva or ejaculatory bliss. Get the animal in the box, then drop the walls
to reveal the cage with which to drown the beast. That would be humanity,
sanitized and ultimately anesthetized then poked, prodded, punctured, and
administered the lethal injections via homeopathic drips and drops via
poisoned air, food, water, relations, environment itself- the antireason
for the ruling ideology of the puritanical who hate love and serve only
their own truth.

The bullshit of years of the universe and binary crypto is an obscenity to
the mind to calculate again and again, ever longer the lie, as if
101001010101 is some stronghold of information when for 50 plus years it is
likely quantum computers have existed in the background, nothing in the
publicly available global state uncrackable at the level of public service,
private service or otherwise. An entirely 'nother platform assumably exists
beyond this non-sense. That said, this is based on the reality of aliens,
time-travel and other state fair ephemera, the deep-frying of collective
consciousness, counterculture onward, not removed from any of this
civilizational exploration and development and instead, driving its
evolution and devolution simultaneously, acid in the water supply as the
insurance plan for speeding up armageddon, to the point today of completely
idiocy as the conversation mediated, regurgitated, forced to swallow and
share vomit again and again.

Great Society, eh? The damned never had it so good. Living like kings and
queens, freedom of opinion, shared views, messaging, gossip, "secrets".
FANCY.

So the game seems to be a false perspective based on a binary worldview
that becomes software that fronts for this cultural maldevelopment that is
moving towards increased *ignorance* and *incapacitation* of citizens,
rather than towards their liberation and providing tools for the control
and governing of said lunatic murderous state. Boot licking not enough for
survival, extinction is the only placeholder for humanity in the algorithm,
these other populations whether deranged hominids or robotic-workforces of
sell-out cyborgs or shared-POV androids, their goggles glass already,
whether false eyeballed, contacts or frame, able to relay and relate via
'shared state' in other dimensionality while dumbstruck humans have no
words to match experience and are disallowed from thinking and thus
thinking and intelligently communicating beyond the rubric of the already
always corrupted viewpoint. This, relativism's schtick.

Even email software standards degraded to disallowed cave wall comms,
inline diagrams disallowed, uncontrollable word-wrap, menacing nannyized
webware making sure helplessness is ever increasing- now THAT is a service
economy. The deception, deceit, hatefuless encoded, encrypted in these
events too. Hidden, secrets to be revealed or not- depending on one too
many wrong thoughts that tease open the nightmare and make an
irreconcilable differance, then and now.

The malice involved, key, mendacity at every level, crypto protecting that
shared lie, how secret is it really and what if it becomes transparent, the
crypto is not protecting anything because it becomes "known" by others,
observable via other effects, actions, every intricacy reliant and
structuring its worldly manifestation.

Most likely the only way worldwide communications could feasibly be cracked
in real-time would be by undocumented technology and storage and involve
other physics, perhaps the quantum computer an entrance into the weaving of
interdimensional entanglement into every life and object- else in a
clean-room simulation, this a contingent magic realm of converging parallel
worlds, partly true and partly artifice (actively reengineered,
reenactment) to fuse-form past and future into the present, some military
project of the future recreating model civilization under various scenarios
to unite them, bring them together then run them live together as a best of
all possible worlds gambit, who knows, maybe that master narrative is
nothing of contemporary history as if sorting out the past into respective
file cabinet folders of previous beliefs, as if more explanatory,
geopolitics of today better explaining the existing path than- say- Old and
New Testament. In other words, writing and views of today incapable of
fitting that data into its box and instead it is vice-versa, better
explained in reverse, more insightful and informative about the how and why
as a shared frame of reference. The wisdom of believers in the roughest
lands holding steady over centuries and millennia of this deep connection
more grounded in the political reality - the stakes - than a coddled soft
carebear of somatized educated class of the privileged, their morality on
par with mold spores.

Stay happy, stay healthy, the diseased open sore puss filled atmosphere
chokes against each breath, constricting further the phlegmatic release of
black bile into spittoon of once-open mail list culture, now sanitized
germ-free and wet-wiping nose fingers and ears for any trace of
contaminating residue, giving away the game, that yes- "we think you are
all idiots to believe this and we are taking you for a ride, suckers!"  Not
only are people making these bets, their careers, mortages, children's
futures are reliant on its sustenance. Hmm, GO figure. Black and White.

Semaphore of cryptic communications, the ops, Platonic mirroring of
language, role of the cymbal, its transmutation via calculus. The reliance
upon shared truth, understanding, awareness for secure interconnection-
grounding as it were, a ground state or condition, like a neutral antenna
that naturally fevers when in contact with truth, love. Shared empiricism,
foundational. The accuracy of accounting for truth in its absolute verse
dilute state. The scale of consideration being 'the internet' itself is the
cryptogram, junk DNA the profile moreso than the fiction of a series of
zeros and ones, laughable as a stage-set and huckster paradise.

[infinity] x [infinity] x [infinity] ... {N}

The model presumed existant. A string such as
TK32LJ35DX_4SJLSLU&*#(@((@(@()P)_ need not be decoded as binary to obtain
its meaning. Instead, it could be multivariant, exist in superposition, an
intricate puzzle or maze, beyond the two dimensional, involving collapsing
code, parallel structuring, trap doors, and cascading transformative
dynamics given the key, which could be multiple in a bounded context of the
infinite. Then scale that to all information and data coursing through a
shared framework, the global network, including connected global minds as a
noospheric calculating nervous system, natural, artificial, virtual- and
what have you if not something more in-line with random event generators
and spooky action at a distance, crystal ball computing scenarios, where
the mind itself as an observing entity chimes in with the flow of the
aetheric wind making its way through structures and circuitry, that
familiar hum and tune of validation, the submerged conscience moving in and
out of the lapping waves both above and below the waterline.

Given literacy, a tiny box could contain some meaningful information for
someone, somewhere. Depending on what is shared as truth, it may or may not
be decrypted or decoded by another or others elsewhere. It could be assumed
perhaps to contain only one correct answer- "this is its truth". And in
doing so, the revealing would validate its truth via correctly removing its
binarization. Whereas in an 'analog' (perhaps) approach, or gradient, it
may coexist in binary and other systems of consideration, parallel
interpretrations, some right, some wrong- it could remain a question and in
a realm of mystery; or even involve nesting of codes within other codes-
who is to say the code actually is the code- how do you know Alice is not
actually Edward in drag? So, the issue not only of truth, whatever it may
be and its reliance upon shared value (which could be a lie), though also
of indeterminacy, the contingent, the potential impossibility of knowing if
not having the correct viewpoint, and again the issue of calculability- can
its meaning be deciphered or the information decrypted of all possible
combinations and permutations not only of the "numbers" or "digits" (as if
1 and 0 finiteness) and instead in their inherent symbolic mutability, say
for any given perspective what those various patterns or combinations or
collections of data could potentially mean- in any given context. That is,
any thought from any viewpoint of any aspect of this event in its entire
potential for meaning: could a computer calculate that, and how would it be
able to decide what what is what not intelligible, especially if A.I. based
and reliant upon preexisting and preestablished scaffolding of meaning.

It would not, instead of a single answer there would be a vast ever
increasing span of probabilities, big-bang inflations, interpretation
inside nested interpretation, as data relates in and between cosmic
circuitry. The grounding in truth of one acronym in relation to another, or
one number pattern traced into 7-segment like display versus another, and
here we are dealing with infinities within infinities, as a potential, and
their tuning in and out of various scenarios and ~sequences. Maybe it is
useful, maybe it is not- what is required is massive computation along with
massive competence, and if enemies do not think alike, their very attempt
to crack or decipher or decode by default reveals their own perspective and
scaffolding, the wonderful self-same biasing of onesideness that is the
binarists weakness, such that the very action of trying to relate across
the boundary of ideology punctures the threshold of their own security and
breeches the psyche with other thoughts and ideas, questions and
assumptions, mindworks and frameworks as the calculating machines take hold
of external 'truth' and try to engineer and mold it to fit their needs.
This is a self-creating labyrinth in reverse, as the security of binary
crypto is made insecure outside its ideological domain, that terror maze
created and sustained in the stupidity of false absolutism turned
inside-out and incapable of mediating the very possibility it confronts.
The crypto itself is the trap. The core of an unshared idea, truth as the
foundational of shared reality- versus its compromise, corruption. There is
a difference between right and wrong, yet to those who do not distinguish,
they do not know which is which. And thus false views easily erected, even
if having the code and the keys, the variables within variables allowing
paths to precede the investigation, hints and clues and signage until
hovering above the tarpits and ground disappears.

The type and grammatical rarer, whose zoo to this. Ahhh. Just fucking
breathe... and via that inhalation, taking in the poison pill whether via
ears eyeballs snout or gullet or antennaed skinsuit, fingertips at peak of
inner domicile, circling around like a crazed bird trapped inside, til
figuring the way out, and then back in again.

Another type of crypto, core to language, its metaphysics, its calculative
pattern-based scaffolding, potential for unifying human awareness,
communicating shared and unshared views, parsing truth within the noise of
degradation, cross- and inter- and multi-cultural. Not pop-cult BS, here a
song there a song everywhere a song-song, kick the bastards out of
civilization and let the airwaves be filled with pure commercials, no more
charade, waxing lyrical about sentences, binary transmissions of "diary
music" and follow-alongs into the cattle chute, queued and awaiting
slaughter by compatriot handlers.

The Binary Crypto Regime (BCR!) is the bullshit par excellance!

Hocking bullshit trapdoor code to exploit users in the hidden terror state
dynamics, traitors. Every last device backdoors, weaponized alarm clocks
and TVs that can be TSCM tapped to remote view, who knows if your speaker
system is going to be entrancing you in the night hours when that little
blue light repeatedly turns on even when turned off. Lightbulbs as
speakers, speakers as microphones, here a data logger, there a data logger,
everywhere a data logger...

You think people are that fucking stupid to not differentiate computers
made to exploit, with chips and protocols themselves designed by spy
agencies worldwide, and then being held under watchful omniscient
private-eyes, multiplying across the grid, across society, across
landscape, this false perspective all knowing that presumes to 'know' TRUTH
via this absurd binary mindset, a realm of childlike belief and
infallibility in assumptions of a protected, privileged exploitative class.
Now that is a trap if ever there was one, to be in that central position in
the panoptic assemblage. A VERY BAD AND DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE. Anymore not
paranoid of consequences for that level of betrayal would best wise up and
get medicated quick, cause it can only get crazier and crazier on the
inside.

How many licks of the boot to get to the center, the deep core beyond the
false door of inner mountain, underground bunker society of black op
civilization, all that is feasible indicates a barrier between worlds of
knowing, and the crypto of state is not of this domain, not of its
computers or software, and like bunny suited FAB workers at the
assemblyline, dancing together with machinery in the ongoing orchestration
of circuitry, the hidden hand or tripwire of entanglement is triggered and
magic happens, that ephemeral state of connectedness and shared being,
alien to the ordinary and mundane of ever present surveillance in
electromagnetic hell, and from this that vantage, within such a context,
the surveillers are themselves being surveilled, all is known about the
mockery of the human race, its holocaust via planned demise, and those
holding the fake steering wheel, pockets full of money and hollow
lifestyle- the cruel and wicked machinery their destiny, their love, their
meaning. Terror itself embodied by lost souls with dead or non-existent
hearts.

What if the only secure crypto is based within grounded truth. And that
this is reliant upon context and scale, of cosmic dimensions. And of
populations, numbers of observers. Those false may presume shared awareness
yet it is finite and also artificial to a degree, affected, existence in
the key of nothingness. Whereas those grounded in nature connect with its
circuitry and values of life, and in this, of love, and of love, true love
that transcends normal boundaries and involves pre-existent shared
connection, an already-knowing or 1:1 relation, as if once whole, then
meeting in a separated condition, realizing this wholeness, and having that
as an understanding, a foundation of truth as the value, its validation and
verification via its observance, and service to the shared principles.
Empirical truth in this way would only be possible, seemingly, through
already achieving this "absolute" knowing of shared connection as a basis
for other empirical observation, thus values of honesty, integrity, shared
destiny and the human project. In knowing true love, it is to know and be
connected with 'the absolute' in its truth, and in this way, provides
reference for other observations and relations, particularly those lacking
love or truth, which then tend towards falsity or are absolute lies. This
polarization, the yin-yang duality and the particle smashing encounters
between reason and anti-reason indicative of the differing paradigms,
realities. One is real and the other is a contingent unstable false view,
yet has achieved governance of the state, which due to such stupidity could
only have happened by design. They own binary computing and crypto. That is
domain of thick layers of bullshit layered over and under and throughout
every last detail of existence via these scum.

You want to sell me a device that enables you to spy, cheat, exploit,
extort, tattle, subvert, control my life, and another device and another
government program and another educational degree and another family member
and another corrupted technology and another corrupted communication or
message or idea... And you think you are really SMART for getting away with
it, smarter than everybody else because you _think you are running this
game, not realizing the setup. The global civil discontent this relies
upon, those dangerous dynamics, as if the ploy is fortified and not meant
to fail once the supports are pulled out. A trillion stresses could appear
out of nowhere with the wrong data breech, opening wide the once secured
though always fictional private properties of oppression, the inner
workings to be massaged as egos wade above the surface, unaware of the
sharks both visible and invisible, eyes on their first, long awaited
appetizers.

This is the difference between intelligence and those who are 'smart' in a
finite, non-philosophical sense. Reality is not as simple as an equation,
and if it were it would be a highly accurate equation of extreme precision
and resolution. Obvious errors would have no place, that just is sloppy and
not cleaning up these things would indicate a certain presumptiveness of
relations between those who think they know and those who know better or
more or actually developed the cosmos. Instead the binarist as ideologue
can believe they 'know truth' and use it to create and sustain a charade or
false perspective, requiring masquerade and built on shared lies, and think
no one is the wiser who is on the outside of this duplicity. This is where
'partly true' is equated with 'wholly true' and 'mostly false' is made into
'totally true, just ignore the vagaries' which is the obey and proceed
model of workforce indoctrination and mindwashing, er the educational
system. That there is no effective feedback in a society reliant on
cybernetics and circuitry is a massive tell of top-down autocratic and
dictatorial aims of such administration, and in this way CRYPTO emblemizes
the detached arrogance and contempt of a mass mediated surreality force-fed
to a beaten down, poisoned global population, where each and every person
is configured to oppress others by their very existence, this most notable
as 'economics' where the concepts of shared destiny and basic exchange are
hijacked to have the money only serving some people while others die
horrendous torturous deaths due to no food, clean water, shelter, and live
in environments of rape and torture and oppression, in addition to be
overtaken or held in regions of perpetual war to sustain this insane
automated machinery. The money itself is tyrannical, its monopoly paper,
and yet figuring it out is off the table, it is all or nothing, a onesided
evaluation at every considered stage, as that is the only option, to play
the rigged game by those who operating within the illusion of total
control. There is no place for love in a world like this- nor truth. That
is why it has been engineered out of existence. Unspeakable,
uncommunicable, unless it is happening in other channels, outside the
limiting framework, which it is.

Today it is likely the meat in the supermarket is fake, artificial meat.
There is every indication. So too, sensors grafted into flora and fauna.
And brain-tapping of consciousness by others as part of the surveillance
regine. Sci-Fi today. So beyond the bullshit, the neutrality of "silence"
and secretive HUSH-HUSH quietism is presumably to protect what is already
known of this condition, no one wants to say or be held responsible for
saying what more actually exists as it exists, if not for fear of
life-ending consequences. And yet a data breech- of ideas- of the ubiquity
of surveillance which itself asks a question- well if the government
obviously can tap everything in real time globally, what is the real
government doing, and how does that relate to known surviellence far beyond
this in terms of methods of control, whether RFID or other sensors in teeth
or various chemicals that trigger walk-by monitoring systems as this
relates to recognition systems, facial and otherwise. Tracking of people,
selling of data, subverting of equipment via purchase triggers for
corrupting via software bugs. What of, say, a musician that legend has it
went offline decades ago, is not their false identity being tracked like
everyone else and accounted for. And if special privileges, in such
ubiquity, would they not need to occupy an exception list, and thus at some
level the data could be known, and thus old school anonymity is likewise a
false future, even if politically connected, due to the need to pattern
match, account for, at the level of each person a potential threat to
society. Are they are zero or a one today? What does the department store
returned items complaint put them at, or the mistaken debit card exchange-
has the scale tipped, the feather become lead? DOOM.

What is presumed is that any surveillance that is occurring in onesided
dynamics is itself not secure as a binary system and can be 'logged' and
thus crimes against the human population can be documented, in parallel,
and you'd have to be idiot to believe otherwise, reliant on a safely
embubbled worldview. Say a dwelling is rife with monitoring and used to
oppress a person held in an illegal prison by a dictatorial regime, that
very technology that is the oppressors strength becomes a weakness when
what it is doing can itself be monitored- it becomes legal evidence, and
can lead to real-world consequences for those involved.

The recent film The Numbers Station had a story of a code broadcasting
station in England that automatically sends out a dispatch that would close
down a spy program and this process was somehow subverted due to a security
lapse. At the time, once a particular message was relayed, a kill list
would be sent out that would put into action a self-destructive sequence
based on targeted assassinations. This would be automatic. Once the list is
out, there is nothing fuzzy involved, it is presumed "TRUTH" and becomes an
order. And so its very existence in the system, as the code, as the
instruction, determines its validity, its truth, otherwise it would not be
present in the message. If you were to read such instructions it would not
be debatable, there is no going back. Kind of like the launch sequence of a
nuclear missile, past the point of no return, warheads launched to multiple
sites. And let's just say for convenience that this is of a binary mindset
and a shared awareness is already secured- such a transmission is
equivalent to fate. It is just a matter of when it is going to happen, how
it will be carried out.

The weird thing about it is that few things are this absolute in normal
life, and even in government today it seems most of what is occurring is at
the 50 yard line or middle of the playing field, and the goal posts are at
45 and 55 respectively for tallying points. And yet, white to white and
black to black, yin-yang, it seems as though through osmosis or other
cultural filtering, that the 'human' is congregating on one side of the
field and the anti-human on the other, both with their kill lists as part
of the real world consequences of bloodsport and destiny. And that is also
where cryptography resides, in these same dynamics. The thing is, one
crypto system may be reliant on an unstable foundation for its
decision-making, unable to deal with uncertainty, and thus requiring the
middle zone for its continued functioning, to exploit the similarity while
secretly and subversively pushing for polarized difference, every closer to
a game winning touchdown. And there could be every indication via media
that this is the situation, that is the 'shared awareness' of the common
lie that frames the society, towards this loss via its exploitation.

And yet likewise and opposite, outside that simplistic binary viewpoint,
the ambiguous realm of paradox, myth, superstition, and magic, the
metaphysics of language and mathematics- another realm of crypto where the
algorithm is secondary to truth and does not seek to determine or limit or
confine it to something less than it actually is. This is the human realm,
and its crypto occurs not within the same parameters, though can still
connect through, inside, outside and around the binary structuring- it
occurs in archaeological finds, anthropological studies, cryptozoological
investigations, indebted and embedded within deep reasoning of truth and in
the same way as artistic insight, reveals the shared reality and brings it
into alignment with other structures of truth, its circuitry, local,
global, yet also cosmic, involving life itself as the current and currency.
In this way, perhaps like nothing else comparable, aesthetics are the basis
for this pure communication that carries with it a security of the
intelligible, where fakes and imposters and mimics are easily revealed, and
the labyrinth walls built. In this, the secret messaging is
multidimensional, it is of culture itself, ancient, of those here first and
of shared being. A deep investment, with trickle-charge connections
everywhere into capacitors storing the wealth of truth held outside
existing society, a Pluto-like condition of non-recognition and title loss,
does it exist or not? And thus an issue of non-belief by those who cannot
fathom another perspective beyond their own boundary, any truth beyond
their self-serving onesided skew that the ungrounded relativism and
corrupted empiricism allow - effectively invisible and unthinkable, that
this is not a football game, the stadium is a lie, and game-over remains
with the same consequence, yet they cannot read nor even imagine the
infinity codes that are circulating everywhere, and if they do try to
figure it out they will bring about their own demise by trying, as the
walls and blocked passages are erected around them until they have no where
to move, checkmate ad infinitum. Thus the final accounting mentioned, of
truth and falsity. That is the real issue of security within the cryptic
exchange. Corrupt ideas will perish, and those who serve them will have to
face the consequences of their actions.

In this way, like Jim Bell's Assassination Politics, the internet is
essentially a metaphysical Numbers Stations except those reliant on the
false perspective cannot read the 'signs', it only mirrors their viewpoint
back to them, the self-certainty of absolute infallible perspective- a
position of God over an enslaved humanity. It would not be possible for any
machine to calculate the infinities involved in parsing every possible
combination of encrypted messaging in real-time, nor like a random event
generator, comprehend the significance of changing constellations of data
as it is intertwined across manifold and myriad interconnectivities -
circuits - that like a cosmic intelligence are a form of omniscience in
service to this empirical truth, as it is grounded in merging perspective
of shared being. The level of awareness may remain unrecognized, the
intelligence completely hidden in its cosmic scope and span, the only hint
of its depth, hated and ignored theology that feeds the heart with the
divinity of love, and reminds of the importance of virtue, including
service and sacrifice, and faith, even in the worst scenarios.

Those who submit to truth, it absolute requirement for the foundation for
life and the role of logic in establishing reality, would operate within a
different sense of cryptography than those who rely on shared lies and a
finite reductionist approach that seeks to determine what is acceptably and
allowably "true" as a means for exploitation. They seem to think a massive
string of binary digits is indecipherable to those whose world they exist
within. The clue is that their entire system has been backdoored from the
very beginning. The oppressors positions of greatest strength are actually
an illusion, they are instead their positions of greatest weakness- it is
just an issue of taking it down, collapsing the structures, accounting for
truth amidst a false stage-set civilization built upon shared lies. And
thus in any given text or image, in any given exchange, critical data of
humanity could be coursing through the veins with missions and intelligence
and instructions and taking into account those naughty and nice, and this
could be actively tallied and ready for implementation when those fate
triggering events potentially occur. And so whose side you on- who do you
serve- what is your purpose, why is your crypto illiterate to the cause,
why the bullshit in times like these. Tick tick tick... tock.

Perhaps that is the big reveal: To find out who thinks this is actually
believes this is a game of football underway and not soccer, ferchrisssakes.

The enemies of humanity do not stand a chance. Do you believe in chance?
BULLSHIT!

ent doing, and how does that relate to known surviellence far beyond this i=
n terms of methods of control, whether RFID or other sensors in teeth or va=
rious chemicals that trigger walk-by monitoring systems as this relates to =
recognition systems, facial and otherwise. Tracking of people, selling of d=
ata, subverting of equipment via purchase triggers for corrupting via softw=
are bugs. What of, say, a musician that legend has it went offline decades =
ago, is not their false identity being tracked like everyone else and accou=
nted for. And if special privileges, in such ubiquity, would they not need =
to occupy an exception list, and thus at some level the data could be known=
, and thus old school anonymity is likewise a false future, even if politic=
ally connected, due to the need to pattern match, account for, at the level=
 of each person a potential threat to society. Are they are zero or a one t=
oday? What does the department store returned items complaint put them at, =
or the mistaken debit card exchange- has the scale tipped, the feather beco=
me lead? DOOM. <br>

<br></div><div>What is presumed is that any surveillance that is occurring =
in onesided dynamics is itself not secure as a binary system and can be &#3=
9;logged&#39; and thus crimes against the human population can be documente=
d, in parallel, and you&#39;d have to be idiot to believe otherwise, relian=
t on a safely embubbled worldview. Say a dwelling is rife with monitoring a=
nd used to oppress a person held in an illegal prison by a dictatorial regi=
me, that very technology that is the oppressors strength becomes a weakness=
 when what it is doing can itself be monitored- it becomes legal evidence, =
and can lead to real-world consequences for those involved.<br>

<br></div><div>The recent film The Numbers Station had a story of a code br=
oadcasting station in England that automatically sends out a dispatch that =
would close down a spy program and this process was somehow subverted due t=
o a security lapse. At the time, once a particular message was relayed, a k=
ill list would be sent out that would put into action a self-destructive se=
quence based on targeted assassinations. This would be automatic. Once the =
list is out, there is nothing fuzzy involved, it is presumed &quot;TRUTH&qu=
ot; and becomes an order. And so its very existence in the system, as the c=
ode, as the instruction, determines its validity, its truth, otherwise it w=
ould not be present in the message. If you were to read such instructions i=
t would not be debatable, there is no going back. Kind of like the launch s=
equence of a nuclear missile, past the point of no return, warheads launche=
d to multiple sites. And let&#39;s just say for convenience that this is of=
 a binary mindset and a shared awareness is already secured- such a transmi=
ssion is equivalent to fate. It is just a matter of when it is going to hap=
pen, how it will be carried out.<br>

<br>The weird thing about it is that few things are this absolute in normal=
 life, and even in government today it seems most of what is occurring is a=
t the 50 yard line or middle of the playing field, and the goal posts are a=
t 45 and 55 respectively for tallying points. And yet, white to white and b=
lack to black, yin-yang, it seems as though through osmosis or other cultur=
al filtering, that the &#39;human&#39; is congregating on one side of the f=
ield and the anti-human on the other, both with their kill lists as part of=
 the real world consequences of bloodsport and destiny. And that is also wh=
ere cryptography resides, in these same dynamics. The thing is, one crypto =
system may be reliant on an unstable foundation for its decision-making, un=
able to deal with uncertainty, and thus requiring the middle zone for its c=
ontinued functioning, to exploit the similarity while secretly and subversi=
vely pushing for polarized difference, every closer to a game winning touch=
down. And there could be every indication via media that this is the situat=
ion, that is the &#39;shared awareness&#39; of the common lie that frames t=
he society, towards this loss via its exploitation. <br>

<br></div><div>And yet likewise and opposite, outside that simplistic binar=
y viewpoint, the ambiguous realm of paradox, myth, superstition, and magic,=
 the metaphysics of language and mathematics- another realm of crypto where=
 the algorithm is secondary to truth and does not seek to determine or limi=
t or confine it to something less than it actually is. This is the human re=
alm, and its crypto occurs not within the same parameters, though can still=
 connect through, inside, outside and around the binary structuring- it occ=
urs in archaeological finds, anthropological studies, cryptozoological inve=
stigations, indebted and embedded within deep reasoning of truth and in the=
 same way as artistic insight, reveals the shared reality and brings it int=
o alignment with other structures of truth, its circuitry, local, global, y=
et also cosmic, involving life itself as the current and currency. In this =
way, perhaps like nothing else comparable, aesthetics are the basis for thi=
s pure communication that carries with it a security of the intelligible, w=
here fakes and imposters and mimics are easily revealed, and the labyrinth =
walls built. In this, the secret messaging is multidimensional, it is of cu=
lture itself, ancient, of those here first and of shared being. A deep inve=
stment, with trickle-charge connections everywhere into capacitors storing =
the wealth of truth held outside existing society, a Pluto-like condition o=
f non-recognition and title loss, does it exist or not? And thus an issue o=
f non-belief by those who cannot fathom another perspective beyond their ow=
n boundary, any truth beyond their self-serving onesided skew that the ungr=
ounded relativism and corrupted empiricism allow - effectively invisible an=
d unthinkable, that this is not a football game, the stadium is a lie, and =
game-over remains with the same consequence, yet they cannot read nor even =
imagine the infinity codes that are circulating everywhere, and if they do =
try to figure it out they will bring about their own demise by trying, as t=
he walls and blocked passages are erected around them until they have no wh=
ere to move, checkmate ad infinitum. Thus the final accounting mentioned, o=
f truth and falsity. That is the real issue of security within the cryptic =
exchange. Corrupt ideas will perish, and those who serve them will have to =
face the consequences of their actions. <br>

<br>In this way, like Jim Bell&#39;s Assassination Politics, the internet i=
s essentially a metaphysical Numbers Stations except those reliant on the f=
alse perspective cannot read the &#39;signs&#39;, it only mirrors their vie=
wpoint back to them, the self-certainty of absolute infallible perspective-=
 a position of God over an enslaved humanity. It would not be possible for =
any machine to calculate the infinities involved in parsing every possible =
combination of encrypted messaging in real-time, nor like a random event ge=
nerator, comprehend the significance of changing constellations of data as =
it is intertwined across manifold and myriad interconnectivities - circuits=
 - that like a cosmic intelligence are a form of omniscience in service to =
this empirical truth, as it is grounded in merging perspective of shared be=
ing. The level of awareness may remain unrecognized, the intelligence compl=
etely hidden in its cosmic scope and span, the only hint of its depth, hate=
d and ignored theology that feeds the heart with the divinity of love, and =
reminds of the importance of virtue, including service and sacrifice, and f=
aith, even in the worst scenarios.<br>

<br></div><div>Those who submit to truth, it absolute requirement for the f=
oundation for life and the role of logic in establishing reality, would ope=
rate within a different sense of cryptography than those who rely on shared=
 lies and a finite reductionist approach that seeks to determine what is ac=
ceptably and allowably &quot;true&quot; as a means for exploitation. They s=
eem to think a massive string of binary digits is indecipherable to those w=
hose world they exist within. The clue is that their entire system has been=
 backdoored from the very beginning. The oppressors positions of greatest s=
trength are actually an illusion, they are instead their positions of great=
est weakness- it is just an issue of taking it down, collapsing the structu=
res, accounting for truth amidst a false stage-set civilization built upon =
shared lies. And thus in any given text or image, in any given exchange, cr=
itical data of humanity could be coursing through the veins with missions a=
nd intelligence and instructions and taking into account those naughty and =
nice, and this could be actively tallied and ready for implementation when =
those fate triggering events potentially occur. And so whose side you on- w=
ho do you serve- what is your purpose, why is your crypto illiterate to the=
 cause, why the bullshit in times like these. Tick tick tick... tock.<br>
