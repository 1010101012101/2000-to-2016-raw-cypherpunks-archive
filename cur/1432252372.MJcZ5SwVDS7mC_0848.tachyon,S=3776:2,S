Fact is, this is revisionist crap.

They closed the original list. Members (none of the original founders
including Timmy) decided that this was not acceptable so they fixed the
problem of having any one person in charge of the list. In the process the
new lists decided to broaden the topics to crypto, civil liberties, and
economics since these topics have always been hot on the list.

Rich, motivated guy like yourself could start their own Cypherpunks list
with no hassle and minimum cost. It's interesting that you bitch about
what other people do with their list but you don't have the gumption to do
anything about it (just like when the original list you helped found
floundered because of incompetent handling).
