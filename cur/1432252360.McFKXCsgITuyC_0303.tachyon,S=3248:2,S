Yes, Amazon volunteered to cut off Wikileaks, which demonstrates that 
the degree of freedom that EC2 instances give you are very limited -

Eben Moglen gave a very good talk about the issues of privacy and 
control that I think are at the heart of the question you raise, 
recommending that people run servers on computing machinery that they 
physically control -

It's possible to implement Moglen's ideas with current technology: 
here's a "wall wart" plug server in the corner of my living room running 
GNU social on Debian -

And here's a project to create a distro specifically for such devices -
