Let me hear you say it.  Does a part of you hurt?

Skimmed it.  So the account was more real than not?  You are obviously
willing and able to provide the real citation, so what purpose was
served by changing all the names and obscuring the real cite, if
trickery was not a factor?

Talking about yelling "Fire" in a crowded theater is not the same as
doing it, no matter how "is" is defined, talking about bombs and making
them is no different.  Who was it?  Said "I disagree with what you say
but support your right to say it" or words to that effect?

I take it you have no interest in dealing with this topic seriously,
it's evident you are having too much fun clowning around.
