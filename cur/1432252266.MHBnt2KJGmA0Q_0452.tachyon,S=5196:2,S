Just in case AQ is listening, I'd like to remind them that there are some
other states that also have some *really* good targets ;-)  But, if you're
just "stuck" on New York, let me make my recommendations:

(1) Citicorp Center.
    Thousands of people work in this one gargantuan and
profoundly ugly building.  As a bonus, it belongs to one of Israel's
biggest finance sources ;-)

(2) One Police Plaza.
    Not just for donuts anymore!  This huge, purpose-built, multibuilding
plaza houses a significant percentage of New York's police department.  As
a bonus, it is also a centralized facility which serves a large number of
federal and state agencies as well.  One Stop Shopping!!!

(3) The George & Martha Washington Bridges.
    These two bridges share a single two level span which connects New
York and New Jersey (the Martha bridge was an add-on to the George, when
George turned out to be too small to carry all the traffic).  Destruction
of these two incredibly ugly and poorly designed bridges would be a boon
for the esthetic flavor of the area (which is otherwise surrounded by some
of the most beautiful areas in New York City proper), not to mention the
air quality.  And, for AQ, the resulting economic damages would amount ot
a Gift That Keeps On Giving ;-)

Happy Hunting!

NYPD Source: Al Qaeda May Target New York Firms
Sun Aug 1, 2004 09:31 AM ET

By Mark Egan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top federal and local law enforcement officials met
in New York during the weekend to discuss new intelligence about a
possible al Qaeda attack against major corporations or high-profile
buildings in Manhattan, a police source said on Sunday.

The New York Police Department source told Reuters that increased
intelligence "chatter" from overseas of a possible fresh attack of the
city prompted meetings late Friday and early Saturday between NYPD chief
Raymond Kelly and Pasquale Damuro, head of the FBI's office here.

"The intelligence is not specific but we are taking it very seriously,"
the source said, noting that the intelligence was deemed "credible."

New York was the city most affected by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks with
almost 2,800 people killed when hijacked planes destroyed the twin towers
of the World Trade Center. The city has remained on a heightened alert
since then and federal officials have said that the Republican National
Convention at the end of August would make an attractive terrorist target.

The threat was first reported by ABC News, which said the authorities were
particularly disturbed that the information indicated attacks may be
carried out by one or more suicide truck bombings.

Following the meetings, the NYPD issued a statement that said,
"Intelligence reporting indicates that al Qaeda continues to target for
attack commercial and financial institutions, as well as international
organizations, inside the United States."

The police department said it "recommends that corporate and institutional
security directors review their protection of HVAC (heating, ventilation
and air conditioning) systems, parking installations, and security in
general."

However, the department said the alert level for New York is unchanged and
remains at the second-highest level of "orange" or "high."

At the Republican convention from Aug. 28 to Sept. 2, President Bush will
be officially nominated to run for a second term in office. Thousands of
delegates, a large contingent of media and as many as 200,000 protesters
are expected in town for the event.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is scheduled to be in New York
on Sunday and The New York Times quoted a law enforcement official saying
he was expected to comment on the new information.
