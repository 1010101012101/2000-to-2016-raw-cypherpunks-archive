Squirrel definitions won't help you, Jim.  Neither will the ridiculous
straw men you're erecting.

A speeder, in this discussion, is a person who breaks the speed limit
imposed by the _rental_contract_, not the state.  If the company has
the technological ability to accurately (or inaccurately, although
that would probably be bad for business) measure the speed of the car,
they can tell if the person is exceeding their contractually
determined speed, that is, "speeding."  If the contract says they can
charge $5000000 for each infraction, they can.  Period.  

Like Declan and Steve point out, the consumer may not be happy with
this.  If they're not, they can go somewhere else.
