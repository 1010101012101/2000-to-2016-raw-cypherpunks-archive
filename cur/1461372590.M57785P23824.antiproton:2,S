Fear I think, the endless desire of those in power to hold onto that
power, and to try ever further sheeple controlling techniques to that
end.

Sweden appears entirely bound by the balls, Assange rape charges and
extradition - the conduct and sequence of events is, to my eyes, an
indictment against Swedish politicians and the Swedish legal and law
enforcement establishment. I hold that such a number of humans acting
unethically in concert do so because they are compromised - sexually,
financially, or by threats and intimidation. Those who desire control
catch more political bees with honey I suspect, which leads me to
think wikileaks, or rather anonymous publishing, scares the living
daylights out of them.

Only a matter of time before the leak of all leaks makes it public...
as the infighting grows, loyalty blows; will require purported
descriptions for public media consumption rather than direct wikileaks
publishing though, one can imagine.
