A thesis was made and an example to support it was offered. The example is
flawed (not to mention demonstrating a massive lack of emotional
maturity on the part of the author/animal abuser).

Animals don't fear 'no', they fear what you'll do to them. And you don't
have to use it to teach them what it means either. How do you teach an
animal 'fear'? One way and one way only, abuse.
