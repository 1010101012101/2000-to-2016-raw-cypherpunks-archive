Warning for German motorists

FRANKFURT, Germany -- German motorists have been told to stop making
rude gestures at traffic cameras or they could be charged with offending
the police.

A Bavarian court has ruled that a driver who held up his middle finger
while passing a traffic camera was addressing police officers rather
than the equipment itself, German auto association Automobil Club Europe
said.

The motorist in question had argued that he didnt think the camera was
switched on.

Germany is renowned for having no speed restrictions on many of its
motorways but rigorously enforces limits on other roads, often with the
help of speed monitoring equipment.
