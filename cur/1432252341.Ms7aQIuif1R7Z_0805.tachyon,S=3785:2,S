As with the current count of onions, it's not intentional harm,
just people wanting to do things. Bitcoin is bringing a big growth
in onion sites (litle impact itself). But the new bitcoin version
can interop with clearnet and onions natively. If I remember from
my last test, bitcoin rotates its traffic through a sizable address
pool. Multiply that by the userbase and it could be similar to
torrenting.

There might be utility in allowing different circuit expiry parameter
settings for different socksports... perhaps keeping a large state
table for some would reduce load.

Related at a distance is that I think the Phantom project mentioned
they will not hesitate to use disk to support the network protocol.

I want to get around to make some nice HS metrics along that ticket,
but I don't want to give early hopes.

Yes this is nicer.
