Hello Cypherpunks!

As many of you will likely know, Microsoft has recently made public a
release date for Windows 10 and has been testing the platform as part of
the "Windows Insider" program. With this update comes a number of
seemingly unoriginal [1], but nonetheless interesting features, such as
"Cortana", Windows' "truly personal" assistant (only to be available in
a handful of countries) and "Windows Hello", a biometric authentication
system allowing the use of the face, iris, or finger for access [2].

What changes in Windows' security are expected to take place? Will
systems such as Windows Hello leak uniquely identifiable biometric data,
despite a planned increase in security [3]? What could perhaps be done
to limit the risk of using systems such as a cloud-based, personal
assistant that is able to access most of a person's internet-connected
devices?

Thankyou very much,
Endless

[1] It seems that Windows 10's flagship features such as biometric
authentication have already been available on a number of other
platforms for quite some time, not to mention the fact that the name
"Cortana" was used as the name for an artificial intelligence character
in the popular "Halo" game series (The name seems to be have been used
without violating intellectual property laws, as Halo, having been
originally developed by Bungie, Inc. is now a subsidiary of Microsoft
Studios).
