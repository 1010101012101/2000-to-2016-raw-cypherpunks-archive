No, and I asked the author, he doesn't either.

Basically it just says that the only monetary system that respects
everyone's freedom is the one that creates money on a regular basis at
a fixed rate (temporal symmetry), and distributes it in equal shares to
users (spatial symmetry). It also gives a way to calculate an "optimal"
rate from the average life expectancy of people using the money.

Important relatively to which goal ? If the goal is freedom and
equality, then it's important.

What costs ?

Can't really do more predictable than a fixed rate.

English isn't my native tongue so I just looked up a translation and
found "hoarding". I meant money that's neither spent on goods/services
nor invested, money that doesn't change hands, which is bad if your
axiom is that money is primarily a means of exchange.

I have a few remarks.

Firstly, inflation doesn't trick people into spending any more than
deflation tricks them into saving. Note that I include "investing" in
"saving".

Secondly, I wouldn't use the term "growth" because it implies
"something more", like "manufacturing more goods", or "increasing the
quantity of services". Those aren't goals for me.

Lastly, I don't see the link between "savings" and "safety/robustness".

Likewise.
