The man who e-mailed The Times and claimed credit for the attacks used
the name Tony Marsden, which he said was a pseudonym. The man also said
that one of his hobbies was math and that he and his accomplices had
painted Euler's Theorem on the side of one of the cars.
FBI Searches Computers at Caltech in Hummer Probe

The man said he used the name Tony Marsden because he had known people
named Tony and Marsden.

There is a Caltech professor named Jerrold E. Marsden who co-wrote a
textbook titled "Vector Calculus" with Anthony J. Tromba.

Jerrold Marsden was on vacation in Northern California this week. On
Friday, he told The Times that he had not been contacted by the FBI or
Caltech.
