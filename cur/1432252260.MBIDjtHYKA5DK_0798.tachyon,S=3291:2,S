It's been pulled -- and mirrored :-). Nullsoft's part of AOHell. Gee, I
wonder how *that* happened...

Probably why they GNUed it, though.

Here's one mirror I found, through Google News:
<http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=1054104235>


Don't know if it's still working, as I run a Mac anyway. Lots of
slashdotters were talking about doing linux ports as soon as the
announcement came out, though.

Cheers,
