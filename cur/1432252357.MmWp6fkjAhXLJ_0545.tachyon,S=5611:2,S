The Kleinpaste/Julf anonymizing service had been in operation, widely, 
since 1991-2, before Cypherpunks, yes.

The CNN article is enormously misleading in many areas. The suggestiong 
that Lance Cottrell used the Julf experience to add nested encryption is 
false. The URL you quote above is one of the most detailed histories of 
remailers, even if I do say so myself. (Thanks for reminding me/us of 
it.)

 From your recollection of what you said to the reporter, it looks like 
the misunderstanding came from his thinking that the actual Penet 
failure was what triggered the modern remailer approach, when in fact 
you meant "these problems" in the sense that Chaum and others (us) 
realized the obvious limitations of "anonymity services."

And apparently the reporter then spun a story about how Lance Cottrell 
then invented message nesting, etc., all after the Penet failure. This 
is completely backwards. (It's not just the inaccuracy, or giving Lance 
too much credit...it's also that it makes it look as if we missed 
something so utterly obvious, that we were blindsided by the legal 
attack. Not so. And Chaum  knew this at least as far back as '81.)

In the big scheme of things, maybe no one who matters will read the CNN 
article. But it is false history and should be refuted. If not refuted, 
future historians who write about this interesting period may use it as 
primary source material.

If it isn't apparent, I make these points to correct the record, not to 
criticize Len, Lance, Julf, or anyone else. But as the URL above points 
out, we were fully aware of the problems with Kleinpaste/Julf-style 
services and knew they were neither interesting from our point of view 
or a stable basis for what we were seeking to build.
