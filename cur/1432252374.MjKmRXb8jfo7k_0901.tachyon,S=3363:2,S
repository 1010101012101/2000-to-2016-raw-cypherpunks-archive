It was discovered a while back, check the archives, or Tim's
FAQ, that all the remailers were compromised, with or without
the operator's complicity with TLAs. After that discovery there
was a turning of the covert control to re-direct it toward its 
implementer(s). That was soon re-turned by the TLAs back
at the turners, a cycle-countercycle that continues now.

One day you may be read by the TLAs, the next read by the
remailer operators, each looking for evidence of nefarium 
by the other so that countermeasures can be invented and
deployed.

While the remailer/coopt-remailer make-work has kept a 
couple of cut-out remailer operators busy in Bhopal
keeping the TLAs focussed on threats to the institutionalized 
suppression of anonymous speech, astute anonymity performers
are jabbering at mirrors and pontificating to pets against 
law and order elsewhere.

For a small fortune you can subscribe to a source of
absolutely secure means of communications tested by
centuries of reliability. Blind Faith.

No, not that of the Masons, and certainly not nouveau-cult
Skull and Bones, nor even Tri-Lateral Commies, what you 
have to do to get entry is to Fedex weapons grade anthrax 
to the homes (and/or lovers) of heads of government 
worldwide. You get ten HoGs, or 5,000 celebrities, certifiable 
by swissbank.com forwarded to you of their secret account 
deposits, you're in. Call yourself god's emissary.

And then a target for someone younger and smarter and
far uglier in ruthless mayhem, driven by murderous,
most often suicidal, hatred for everything holy.

Dread of easily-blameworthy TLAs is for cotton-candy 
addicts. Fear not those carrying a peashooter, instead
those armed with horrifying urges beyond belief.
