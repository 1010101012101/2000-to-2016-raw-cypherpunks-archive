Hi! Anybody knows anything about the VASCO Data Security gizmos' algorithm?
[You enter your pin, and it generates a 7-digit number, which is
synchronized with the number on the server you're authenticating to; the
number is valid for 30 secs or 1 minute, I'm not sure.] We just got some at
our company, and they're open to at least a replay attack, but I'm curious
what algorithm do they use for generating those numbers.

Mark
