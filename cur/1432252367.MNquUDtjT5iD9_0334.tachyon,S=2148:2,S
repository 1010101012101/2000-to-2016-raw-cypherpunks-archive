Yes, in the Permanent War on Some Dictators, we need permanent police  
state measures.

Bush faces a tough decision: roll east, or roll west.

Since Syria is more decrepit in its armaments, as Iraq was, it will be  
the likely target. But first we need to prepare by floating rumors that  
Saddam's missing "WMD" (not found by the U.N., not found by the  
swarming soldiers) must have been spirited out to Axis of Evil Founding  
Member Syria.

The Permanent War helps the defense contractors, helps the Republicans,  
and helps Israel.

What more can we ask? (Don't answer this unless you've checked with the  
text of the Homeland Security Act and PATRIOT Act to see if your  
answers make you an "illegal combatant.")
