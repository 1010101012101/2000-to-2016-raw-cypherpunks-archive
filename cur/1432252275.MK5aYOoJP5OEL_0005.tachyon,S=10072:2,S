I know this is off-topic, but no matter what your academic training, there's no
substitute for knowing how to take care of yourself in a crisis. Anyone who is
seriously committed to the idea of individual personal responsibility probably
acquired these skills a long time ago, but frankly I can't think of a better
time to brush up than right now, so here's a start...

ADVANCED SURVIVAL TEST

So!  You think you know enough survival skills?  Well try this one!  This test
is intended as a challenge of survival knowledge to those whom express
the "human denial factor" towards learning survival knowledge.  Statements such
as "Ill never get lost"--"I already know that stuff"--"I could do that if I
had to" are mumblings due to over-confidence.  This attitude could cost you your
life.  Therefore, I have composed this test in hopes of creating an awakening
awareness that we are NOT naturally born with--survival skills knowledge--
it must be learned.

This test is designed on a global aspect and in conjunction with the "survival
pattern to maintain life." This is not intended to be an average test, nor a
fair test, as it does require survival knowledge with experience plus survival
sense.  The answers are what I consider exact and correct according to the
listed references and my experiences.  I understand there may be acceptable
variables to the answers.  Sorry, no easy multiple choice questions as we want
you to think this out.  Print out this test, gather up your pen and paper,
write out an answer and compare with ours.  Good luck!
