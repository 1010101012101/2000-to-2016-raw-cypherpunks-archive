I think your best bet for an 8 bit CPU will be an assembly language
routine.  These processors normally include the carry/borrow out of the
high order bit in a status register.  An assembly routine can use that bit
to efficiently implement multiple precision arithmetic, which can, in turn,
be used to implement modexp.
