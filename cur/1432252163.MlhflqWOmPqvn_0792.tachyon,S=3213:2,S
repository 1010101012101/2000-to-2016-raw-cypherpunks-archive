Subject: Why the DMCA is anti-security and anti-privacy

Hi,

The Privacy Foundation has just posted an article of mine on why the
DMCA is bad for security and privacy research.  The URL for the article
is:


http://www.privacyfoundation.org/commentary/tipsheet.asp?id=47&action=0

The same article should also appear on the MSNBC Web site later in day.
