Ultimately if humans can read it, a machine can, unless you believe
humans are supernatural.  However, we're frequently ignorant of how
to tell machines to perform as well as us.


If you create letters by staggering stripes, the OCR will have a hell
of a time.  

The letter I:

----__---
----__---
----__---
----__---
----__---
----__---


Also reversing the contrast (in stripes across the letter) will disrupt
simpler OCR edge tracers, though this camoflage may impair human
readability too.
