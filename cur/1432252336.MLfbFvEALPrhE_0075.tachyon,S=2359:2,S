You're one-hundred percent correct. I saw that sack of shit Rumsfeld on a
press conference this afternoon where he answered the specific question of
does
parading Saddam around violate the Geneva convention.  His answer was that
some
things are more important, that it was necessary to show to the world that
Saddam was in custody and he wasn't going to be back in power, etc. He added
that Saddam is being treated humanly, and he takes offense to anyone who
suggests
otherwise.
