Hello,

We apologize for the unsolicited subscription, which we understand was 
not expected. We allow users to create email distribution and discussion
groups for free -- and a user seems to have ignored our policies and 
added you to his or her list without your permission.

Per your request, you have been removed from the group and you should no
longer receive messages associated with it. 
 
We will investigate the situation and take the appropriate action.  We 
are very concerned about preventing the abuse in Yahoo! Groups, and we 
will continue to evaluate any groups that violate Yahoo! Groups Terms of
Service.


Regards,

Yahoo! Groups Support

What Group are you reporting?
  Anti-Immigration

Subject: Unauthorized Subscription

Type your feedback here:
 "Cypherpunks" is a mailing list on an unrelated topic which 
has been subscribed to the Anti-Immigration group. This 
means that everyone on the Cypherpunks list has to receive 
this vile irrelevant racist drivel! Surely it is against 
your policy to subcribe entire mailing lists to other 
mailing lists. Please delete this unwanted subscription 
immediately! Thank you.
