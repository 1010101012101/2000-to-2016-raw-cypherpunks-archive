Lotus Notes or whatever, of course. The point here is that larger 
organizations with decryption capabilities probably do not think on the 
message-by-message level very often, just like credit card companies and 
insurance agencies deal with their customers in statistical buckets.

It's also conceivable that a large variety of individuals, of varying levels 
of sophistication and education, catch wind of information the government 
may be interested in. Some of them may not feel or know that their message 
is of enough importance to go outside ofLotus Notes or whatever if they have 
it.
