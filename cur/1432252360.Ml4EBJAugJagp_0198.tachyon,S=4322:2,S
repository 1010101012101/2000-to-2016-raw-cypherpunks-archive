This is not a joke. The noble and enlightened Cypherpunks Brigade 
(TM) members will be used to assist the ICC in the capture of 
notorious international criminals. Several ex-Presidents of the 
United States of America are now being sought for trial by the 
fraternal and benevolent governments of Cuba, Zambia, Serbia, and 
Myanmar. The lackeys who exploit the people have also been targeted 
by UNESCO for arrest by the ICC.

It is hoped that Cypherpunks will unite behind the internationale 
efforts to bring these running dogs and lackeys to trial, regardless 
of local laws. Our efforts are not to be confused with the "People's 
Court" of such constitutionalists and subversives as James Dalton 
Bell. Rather, we answer to the higher call of the Internationale.

Cypherpunks shall become the Secret Policemen of the New Socialist World Order.

Remember, the ICC is the arm of the World Court, and World Court is 
the world's pre-eminent enforcer of political correctness. Long live 
the Hague!, long live the Reign of Terror!

--Tim May, who's fucking glad he missed this particular Cypherpunks 
police-friendly meeting.
