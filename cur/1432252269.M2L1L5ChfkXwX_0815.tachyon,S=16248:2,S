Tor Weekly News                                      September 4th, 2013
========================================================================

Welcome to the tenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what is happening in the skyrocketing Tor community.

Serious network overload
------------------------

    <borealis> if it really is a coordinated attack from a bot twice the
               size of the regular tor network i'm much surprised tor is
               still usable at all — #tor, 2013-09-02 18:38 UTC

The tremendous influx of new clients that started mid-August [1] is
stretching the current Tor network and software to its limits.

Several relay operators reported their relays to be saturated [2] by the
amount of connections and circuits that relays currently have to
handle [3].

Mike Perry wishing to “compare load characteristics since 8/19 for nodes
with different types of flags” issued a call to relay operators [4]:
“especially useful [are] links/graph images for connection counts,
bandwidth, and CPU load since 8/19.”

It was reported on IRC that on some relays, only one circuit was
successfully created out of four attempts. This unfortunately implies
that clients retry to build more circuits, resulting in even more load
on Tor relays.

The tor 0.2.4 series introduced a new circuit extension handshake dubbed
“ntor” [5]. This new handshake is faster (especially on the relay side)
than the original circuit extension handshake, “TAP”. Roger Dingledine
came up with a patch to prioritize circuit creations using ntor over
TAP [6]. Various observers reported that these overwhelming
unidentified new clients were likely to be using Tor 0.2.3. Prioritizing
ntor is then likely to make them less a burden for the network, and
should help the network to function despite being overloaded by circuit
creations.

Sathya and Isis both reported the patch to work. Nick Mathewson pointed
out a few issues in the current implementation [7] but overall it looks
like a band-aid good enough for the time being.

Latest findings regarding traffic correlation attacks
-----------------------------------------------------

Erik de Castro Lopo pointed tor-talk readers [8] to a new well written
paper named “Users Get Routed: Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic
Adversaries.” [9] To be presented at the upcoming CCS 2013
conference [10] this November in Berlin, Aaron Johnson, Chris Wacek, Rob
Jansen, Micah Sherr, and Paul Syverson describe their experiments on
traffic correlation attacks.

This research paper follows on a long series of earlier research papers
to better understand how Tor is vulnerable to adversaries controlling
portions of the Tor network or monitoring users and relays at the
network level.

Roger Dingledine wrote to tor-talk readers [11]: “Yes, a big enough
adversary can screw Tor users. But we knew that. I think it’s great that
the paper presents the dual risks of relay adversaries and link
adversaries, since most of the time when people are freaking out about
one of them they’re forgetting the other one. And we really should raise
the guard rotation period. If you do their compromise graphs again with
guards rotated every nine months, they look way different.”

One tricky question with raising guard rotation period [12] is: “How do
we keep clients properly balanced to match the guard capacities?” [13]
It is also probably another signal for any Tails supporter that wishes
to help implementing guard persistence [14].

“I have plans for writing a blog post about the paper, to explain what
it means, what it doesn’t mean, what we should do about it, and what
research questions remain open” wrote Roger. Let’s stay tuned!

A peek inside the Pirate Browser
--------------------------------

Torrent-sharing website The Pirate Bay started shipping a custom
browser — the Pirate Browser — on August 10th. They advertised using Tor
to circumvent censorship but unfortunately did not provide any source
code for their project.

Matt Pagan examined the contents of the package [15] in order to get a
better idea of what it was. He compared the contents of the Pirate
Browser 0.6b archive using cryptographic checksums to the contents of
the Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-12 (en-US version).

According to Matt’s findings the Pirate Browser includes unmodified
versions of tor 0.2.3.25 and Vidalia 0.2.20. The tor configuration
contains slight deviation from the one shipped with the Tor Browser
Bundle. One section labeled “Configured for speed” unfortunately shows
wrong understanding of the Tor network. Roger Dingledine commented in a
subsequent email [16]: “Just for the record, the three lines here don’t
help speed much (or maybe at all).”

The remaining configuration change that “probably has the biggest impact
on performance“, according to Roger, excludes exit nodes from Denmark,
Ireland, United Kindgom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, China, Iran,
Finland, and Norway. “Whether it improves or reduces performance [Roger]
cannot say, though. Depends on a lot of complex variables around
Internet topologies.”

The browser itself is based of Firefox 23.0, with FoxyProxy configured
to use Tor only for a few specific addresses [17], and a few extra
bookmarks.

Later, Matt also highlighted [18] that some important extensions of the
Tor Browser, namely HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, and Torbutton were also
missing from the Pirate Browser.

In any cases, the Pirate Browser is unlikely to explain the sudden
influx of new Tor clients. grarpamp forwarded an email exchanged with
the Pirate Browser admin contact [19] which shows that numbers
(550 000 known direct downloads) and dates (“most downloads during the
first week”) do not match.

Monthly status reports for August 2013
--------------------------------------

The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the
month of August has begun. Sherief Alaa released his report first [20],
followed by reports from George Kadianakis [21], Lunar [22], Arturo
Filastò [23], Colin C. [24], Arlo Breault [25], Philipp Winter [26],
Roger Dingledine [27], Karsten Loesing [28], and Isis Lovecruft [29].
The latter also caught up with June [30], and July [31].

Help Desk Roundup
-----------------

This week Tor help desk saw an increase in the number of users wanting
to download or install Orbot. Orbot can be downloaded from the Google
Play store, the Amazon App store, f-droid.org, and guardianproject.info.
Guides on using Orbot can be found on the Guardian Project’s Orbot
page [32], or on the Tor Project’s Android page [33]. It looks like
Orbot is currently inaccessible from the Google Play store in Iran.
Please join the discussion on tor-talk [34] if you have input about the
latter.

  [33] https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html
  [34] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029684.html

All versions of the Tor Browser Bundle which include tor 0.2.4.x have
been reported to work in Iran. This includes the latest Pluggable
Transport Bundle, the 3.0 alpha series, and the 2.4 beta series.  Follow
our Farsi blog [35] for more Iran related news.

Miscellaneous news
------------------

The next Tails contributors meeting [36] will happen on IRC on
September 4th at 8pm UTC (10pm CEST). “Every one interested in
contributing to Tails is welcome” to join #tails-dev on the OFTC
network.

  [36] https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-August/003523.html

Yawning Angel has been “designing a UDP based protocol to serve as the
bulk data transport for something along the lines of ‘obfs3, but over
UDP’.” They are soliciting feedback on their initial draft of the
Lightweight Obfuscated Datagram Protocol (LODP) [37].

  [37] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005334.html

Kévin Dunglas announced [38] their work on a PHP library for the Tor
Control Port [39], released under the MIT license.

Kathy Brade and Mark Smith have released a first patch [40] for
Mozilla’s update mechanism which “successfully updated TBB on Linux,
Windows, and Mac OS ‘in the lab’ using both incremental and ‘full
replace’ updates.” This is meant for the 3.x series of the Tor Browser
Bundle and is still a work a progress, but this is a significant
milestone toward streamlined updates for TBB users.

Erinn Clark announced [41] that the software powering
trac.torproject.org has been upgraded to version 0.12.3. Among several
other improvements, this new version allowed Erinn to experiment with
the often requested Git integration [42].

  [41] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005328.html
  [42] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005346.html

David Goulet has released the second release candidate for the 2.0
rewrite of Torsocks [43]: “Please continue to test, review and
contribute it!”

  [43] https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005359.html

Much to her surprise, Erinn Clark found a “fraudulent PGP key with [her]
email address” on the keyservers [44]. “Do not under any circumstances
trust anything that may have ever been signed or encrypted with this
key” of short id 0xCEE1590D. She reminded that the Tor Project official
signatures are listed on the project’s website [45].

Philipp Winter published the final paper version [46] of the
ScrambleSuit pluggable transport [47], dubbed “A Polymorphic Network
Protocol to Circumvent Censorship”.
