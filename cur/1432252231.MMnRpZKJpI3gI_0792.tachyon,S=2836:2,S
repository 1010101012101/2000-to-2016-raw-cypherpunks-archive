I am to visit Russia soon: Moscow and St Petersburg, as a tourist. My 
interest is to visit interest telecommunications, cryptographic, espionage 
and related places. I have already visited GCHQ, MI5/MI6, NSA, DSD/ASIO on 
my trips to the United States, Australia and Great Britain. Can readers 
offer suggestions for a high-tech junky.
