All of these fuckers are trying to show the flag by repressing liberties.

Coming soon,

"MyEscowedYahoo (TM), the new account management and news tracking 
system from Yahoo, Inc. "We report your account balances and special 
news interests to the government so you don't have to!"

"IntelInside (TM), Intel's contribution to the War on Terrorism and Bad 
People. Intel, through its proprietary TrackBurst (TM) technology, 
reports the location of laptops and PDAs to the FBI through an iGPS 
(Intel GPS) module integrate into all i840 motherboards. Those who have 
something to hide should buy AMD!"

"Not be outdone in this war on liberty, AMD announces QuantiLiberty, the 
fractional liberty positional escrow system. We not only report your 
position, we also anticipate your future movements by examining your 
daily calendars!"

It's 10 p.m....does the government  know where you are?

deserve neither liberty nor safety." -- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.
