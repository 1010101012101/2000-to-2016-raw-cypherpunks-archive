www.indymedia.org  today proffr1 is clearly the victorian police...  Larry 
Ellison Will Die (english)
by Reg 10:59pm Wed Oct 17 '01



I have an idea that I don't have the resources to put into place. Feel free 
to pick it up if you do.

It is a website called www.lewd.org Larry Ellison Will Die.

It is a dead pool website where people can place bets on when Larry Ellison 
will die. This not advocating his death. It is not threatening him. It is 
not Larry Ellison Must Die. After all, we all will die and so will Larry 
Ellison.

So why don't we track his movements and wait for him to die. It could be a 
heart attack on the golf course. Maybe he gets swept away to sea on a 
yacht. Perhaps a CIA or FBI agent sees an opportunity to cash in and has 
him offed.

Feel free to take it and run with it. Copyleft.

Operation softdrill has nominated larry and scott mc mealy mouthed for 
infinite justice.Evil is patient.

Pork futures dictate that this message may not be kosher.
The threat to your liberties is verifiable.
