Sorry folks, USGovMil are the greatest evil on the planet today.
There's no other way to cut it. And yes, that's terribly sad. But tell
that to the over 250,000 Syrians who are now dead as a result of USA
Government foreign policy and CIA and military actions, training, etc.
And others all around the world.

There seems no way to pull the pin on this evil entity called the
United States government - but perhaps every little bit we do can
speed the process, educate those who don't understand what is
happening, and for citizens of the US of A, what is happening by their
implicit authority by acquiescence.

Eben Moglen (refer previous thread) has said he will not run for US
president. That's not only a great shame, it's a disgrace!

If someone is within distance to meet him face to face (I will not be
travelling to America, but if you know he is to travel to Australia, I
will meet him here face to face, but that will be too late for the
current presidential 'race'), -please- meet him face to face and
remind him that it is because good men and women with good hearts and
intentions such as himself, that do NOT stand for positions of
authority in the system within which they find themselves existing,
that is, by their acquiescence, that the tyranny of the despots and
sociopaths who DO stand prevails, prevails over them, and as regards
America, prevails over much of the world.

If Eben will not stand personally, then he has a duty of care to
everyone and a duty of care to his own principles, to nominate someone
whom he knows is of "good spirit" who is willing to stand!

If Eben can find no such individual, then he has a DUTY to stand for
president, and in this case if he does not stand, he is complicit to
the evil of the United States of America - implicitly, but complicit
none the less!

Feel free to forward him this email, but I find it is always much
better to speak with someone face to face. If you plan to do so,
perhaps print this email out.

Good men and women must stand. Perhaps you know the soccer mom living
next door who has demonstrated consistent "ethics" and good intention,
and ought be presented with this same position - stand, or be
complicit in your acquiescence to the evil.

It does not require a million dollar "slush fund", it requires a firm
grasp of reality, and of our individual complicity with that reality,
and a willingness to communicate the simplicity to others - we are in
an age of unprecedented rapidity of communication, of "flash mobs"
which are normally co-opted marketing crap, but this does not take
away from the reality of what's possible today.

We tech people talk far too much. Every part of our "Western" lives is
pervaded by politics! We cannot escape this simple fact that while
"good" men and women refuse to stand, since 'we' have lives to live,
creativity to explore and express, parties and sports events to attend
and families to raise, because of all these reasons and many besides,
that despots and sociopaths are the only individuals to stand and
therefore hold the positions of power! Over us! Over the world!
