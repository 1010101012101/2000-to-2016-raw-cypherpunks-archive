Most of the states have had variations on Criminal Anarchy statutes for
years.  They claim to regulate or punish Anarchy.  They are mostly dead
letter law after various decisions by the Supremes.

Like Bill O'Reilly vs. NAMBLA such statutes are based on the (currently)
mistaken belief that it is illegal (in the US) to advocate illegal
activity.
