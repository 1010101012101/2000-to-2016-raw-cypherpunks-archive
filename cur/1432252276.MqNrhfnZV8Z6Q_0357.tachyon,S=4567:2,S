NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ)

Biometrics Catalog Online

NIJ has teamed with the U.S. Department of Defense's Counterdrug 
Technology Development Program Office to launch the online Biometrics 
Catalog. Biometrics consist of automated methods for recognizing a 
person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics such as 
fingerprints, voice patterns, facial recognition, etc.

The catalog provides a single location to find information about 
biometric technologies and allows the Biometrics community to share 
information about commercial products, development efforts, and 
government evaluations. To visit the Biometrics Catalog online, 
please go to the following:

http://www.biometricscatalog.org/

You can search in the following categories: Fingerprint, hand 
geometry, eye-retinal, eye-iris, facial recognition, speaker, dynamic 
signature, multiple biometric, and other types.

I did a sample search on facial recognition and commercially 
available products and got these hits.

Now I'm just going to have to make sure I remember to invest in those 
theatrical mask companies...Or I could just celebrate Halloween all 
year long.
