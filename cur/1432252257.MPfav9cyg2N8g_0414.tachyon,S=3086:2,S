#    NSA prepares the U.S. for battle online
#    Tuesday, October 17, 2000
#    
#    The U.S. National Security Agency wants to do battle in cyberspace.
#    
#    "Information is now a place," Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden told 
#    a major computer security conference in Baltimore on Monday. "It is 
#    a place where we must ensure American security as surely as land, sea, 
#    air and space."
#    
#    And the NSA - the military agency responsible for intercepting 
#    communications worldwide - doesn't just care about defense.
#    
#    Ultimately the NSA must become the "security statement" of the U.S. 
#    telecommunications and computer industries, just as he views the Air 
#    Force as the "military statement" of the aviation industry, he said. 
#    "How else does our society develop the tools we need to do what it 
#    is that our agency has been charged to do?"
