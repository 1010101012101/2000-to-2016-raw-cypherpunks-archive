We assume the lamerz posting "h3lp m3 m4k3 b0mZ" queries are LEA's
trolling, but are they?  Is posting bomb recipes a violation of
some applicable law?  If so, what law?  If not, why do we assume
those to be LEA trolls, and not some hopeless wank or kook who
needs to get in touch with HisOrHer inner child and beat it up?

Quite simply, I'm curious and want to know.

Indeed, in the hidden away places is where the most interesting
things are found.
