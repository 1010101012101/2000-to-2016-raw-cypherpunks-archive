QUESTIONS:

From:  NICETY7078@aol.com
Subject:  What can I do about my computer freezing?

My computer freezes when I use AOL and sometimes when
I'm just using the basic functions of Windows 98.

My defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan
disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.

Any advice?

I don't want to destroy everything Ed said in his answer in 
Issue #438 about protecting the images, but on the Internet 
if you can see it you already downloaded it, you can just 
scan your browser's cache directory to find it.
 
The two ways to protect images are good up to a point.  
The Javascript right-click event can be dealt with in one 
of 2 ways.  The first is to simply disable the browser's 
JavaScript, then you can use your right-click all you want...
 
The other way is to simply click on the "Get Source" in the 
Display menu.  That way you can see the source code, find 
the right image and download it right off.
 
What I would suggest would be to use a watermark in the 
image.  That way if someone does download the image and 
uses it on another site you can prove it's a rip-off...

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #138:  http://www.mysticforest.net
April Williams
xena6@bellsouth.net
~~~~

I reviewed site 138 mysticforest.com  This is a great, easy to
navigate site!  I loved the layout (and the candles!)  The only
distraction I found was the way the backgrounds changed
for each page. Perhaps a single background used over and
over would be better? Just an opinion!  Keep up the great
work!
~~~~

The pages load nice and quickly, although the backgrounds
are not consistent and the layouts are not equidistant.

Your pages should not be as long as they are. Page one
should have been split up into two pages, and if you use
a frame for your menu, you will only need one static menu
per page, that can easily be found.

Some of the pics are not clear enough. The site has potential,
but needs refinement.
~~~~

Oh! I loved this site.  I was ready to order except for a couple
of things. First, your shipping link wasn't working, and though
I could see shipping charges on the order form, but didn't see
any information on how long it would take before I would get
the candles.  I didn't see the info on ccnow until after I had
left the order form, and I wasn't familiar with them.

So, when you refer to ccnow on the order form, make their
name an active link so customers can view information about
them before ordering. Maybe just a small pop-up box with
info about them.  And, give an estimate on how long it is
between time the order is placed and when I would receive.

I think there are a couple things you could do to just make
it easier to use the order form, maybe have some friends or
non-internet savvy people you know go through it while
you watch and see where they hesitate or pause or have
questions.

I've never heard of any place I could choose color and
scent and style of the candles I want. I burn candles alot,
and will definitely be back to your site to see if you have
the shipping time  information, and then I'll order.
~~~~

Liked the background of blue fabric.  The site was well laid
out and most of the links worked (but Shipping didn't work
for me).

I loved the design your own candle section but it would have
been helpful to click the options and have them entered into
the shopping cart automatically rather than have to try to
remember them to enter later.  The pages with candle graphics
took a while to load - perhaps thumbnails linked to allow
selection to larger pics would help?  Lots of helpful info
about candles.  Interesting site.
~~~~

Hi April,
I love the Celtic font.
Would you be interested in nestling your lovely candles
into a forest/nature background on your site?
http://www.purplewoods.com/  has free graphics, photos
etc, and one photo is a forest. When I saw it, I immediately
thought of your sensual candles and your site name.
Do you reckon it would work?

BTW, I think April is a beautiful name, and (to me) very
evocative of Nature, and you could use it to your advantage
at your site.  Just a thought.

<p>I reviewed site 138 mysticforest.com&nbsp; This is a great, easy to
<br>navigate site!&nbsp; I loved the layout (and the candles!)&nbsp; The
only
<br>distraction I found was the way the backgrounds changed
<br>for each page. Perhaps a single background used over and
<br>over would be better? Just an opinion!&nbsp; Keep up the great
<br>work!
<br>~~~~
<p>The pages load nice and quickly, although the backgrounds
<br>are not consistent and the layouts are not equidistant.
<p>Your pages should not be as long as they are. Page one
<br>should have been split up into two pages, and if you use
<br>a frame for your menu, you will only need one static menu
<br>per page, that can easily be found.
<p>Some of the pics are not clear enough. The site has potential,
<br>but needs refinement.
<br>~~~~
<p>Oh! I loved this site.&nbsp; I was ready to order except for a couple
<br>of things. First, your shipping link wasn't working, and though
<br>I could see shipping charges on the order form, but didn't see
<br>any information on how long it would take before I would get
<br>the candles.&nbsp; I didn't see the info on ccnow until after I had
<br>left the order form, and I wasn't familiar with them.
<p>So, when you refer to ccnow on the order form, make their
<br>name an active link so customers can view information about
<br>them before ordering. Maybe just a small pop-up box with
<br>info about them.&nbsp; And, give an estimate on how long it is
<br>between time the order is placed and when I would receive.
<p>I think there are a couple things you could do to just make
<br>it easier to use the order form, maybe have some friends or
<br>non-internet savvy people you know go through it while
<br>you watch and see where they hesitate or pause or have
<br>questions.
<p>I've never heard of any place I could choose color and
<br>scent and style of the candles I want. I burn candles alot,
<br>and will definitely be back to your site to see if you have
<br>the shipping time&nbsp; information, and then I'll order.
<br>~~~~
<p>Liked the background of blue fabric.&nbsp; The site was well laid
<br>out and most of the links worked (but Shipping didn't work
<br>for me).
<p>I loved the design your own candle section but it would have
<br>been helpful to click the options and have them entered into
<br>the shopping cart automatically rather than have to try to
<br>remember them to enter later.&nbsp; The pages with candle graphics
<br>took a while to load - perhaps thumbnails linked to allow
<br>selection to larger pics would help?&nbsp; Lots of helpful info
<br>about candles.&nbsp; Interesting site.
<br>~~~~
<p>Hi April,
<br>I love the Celtic font.
<br>Would you be interested in nestling your lovely candles
<br>into a forest/nature background on your site?
<br>http://www.purplewoods.com/&nbsp; has free graphics, photos
<br>etc, and one photo is a forest. When I saw it, I immediately
<br>thought of your sensual candles and your site name.
<br>Do you reckon it would work?
<p>BTW, I think April is a beautiful name, and (to me) very
<br>evocative of Nature, and you could use it to your advantage
<br>at your site.&nbsp; Just a thought.
