hi everyone,
Subject says it all, JYA has gotten rather loopy in his postings as of late
refuses to bow to Ft Meade and the blessed repository of crypto knowledge
our thought is the the NSA may be spiking/drugging his morning beverages
or perhaps he is newly a medical cannabis patient...

     one does wonder
