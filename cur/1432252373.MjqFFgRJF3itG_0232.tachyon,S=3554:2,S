The point was more that the programs were trivial and short,
and Perl was used because it's good for writing short unreadable programs.
There were also LISP implementations in about four lines,
though I don't think anybody got them down to three or two -
but they were much more readable, being basically straightforward
mathematical notations wrapped in lots of parentheses.

However, good crypto and compact Perl both have the advantage that it's
hard to distinguish them from line noise, and thus it's hard to
detect either one....
