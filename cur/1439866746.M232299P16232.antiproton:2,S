Julian Assange: the Untold Story of an Epic Struggle for Justice
John Pilger, July 31, 2015

An extract:

"
Why hasn’t the Swedish prosecutor resolved the Assange case?  Many in
the legal community in Sweden believe her behaviour inexplicable. Once
implacably hostile to Assange, the Swedish press has published
headlines such as: “Go to London, for God’s sake.”

Why hasn’t she? More to the point, why won’t she allow the Swedish
court access to hundreds of SMS messages that the police extracted
from the phone of one of the two women involved in the misconduct
allegations? Why won’t she hand them over to Assange’s Swedish
lawyers? She says she is not legally required to do so until a formal
charge is laid and she has questioned him. Then, why doesn’t she
question him? And if she did question him, the conditions she would
demand of him and his lawyers – that they could not challenge her –
would make injustice a near certainty.
