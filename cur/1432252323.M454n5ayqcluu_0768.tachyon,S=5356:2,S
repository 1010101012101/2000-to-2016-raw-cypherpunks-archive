I suspect the oBSD response would be that you don't have to.  Anecdotal
evidence (and Linus's own comments) are that Linux networking is weaker
than it could be, the BSD stack has traditionally held a security
advantage.

That said, oBSD's overall performance is generally considered to be
lower than that of GNU/Linux.  What with hardware prices, adding
redundant hardware might be considered preferable to trying to handle
the load on one high-performance box.  But that's also not my area of
expertise.

Back to the cornfield....

Peace.
