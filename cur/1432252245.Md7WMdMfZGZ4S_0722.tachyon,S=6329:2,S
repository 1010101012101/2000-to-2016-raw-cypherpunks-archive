I only answered the first question in the last census: how many people live
at that address (or something to that effect). The rest I crossed out with
fat black permanent marker. The result: no visits from the census taker. No
inquiries from the Census Office. No fine. No repercussions of any kind.

I am puzzled why anybody would have bothered to answer the remaining
questions.
