    Geese are pretty aggressive -- our used to intimidate the sled dogs and
eat their dog food.
     But anyway, dogs should be trained from puppyhood never to eat anything
given to them by anyone except their master, at least if you want good guard
dogs. But even hunting dogs should be trained that way, so they won't eat the
game.
