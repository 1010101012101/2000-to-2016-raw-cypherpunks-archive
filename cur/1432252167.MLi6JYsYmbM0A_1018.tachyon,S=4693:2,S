No - it gives you a direct solution that takes exponential time,
because there are exponentially many answers the thing could guess,
each of which takes a polynomial time to validate.
The "then a miracle occurs" step is that the NTM guesses the
_correct_ answer - that's why it's hypothetical, rather than real.

The reason that it's interesting mathematics is partly that many
NP-complete problems, or NP problems in general, are useful or interesting
to mathematicians, and sometimes to real people as well (:-),
and that it tells us about the complexity of the problem, 
and about the difficulty of finding answers, and whether to go for
optimal solutions to the problems or to look for heuristics that give
pretty good answers most of the time.
