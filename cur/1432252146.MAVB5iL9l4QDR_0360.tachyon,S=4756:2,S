This may or may not be true. This all depends on how junkbusters script
works. Perhaps junkbusters filters out all 480x90 images, for instance. In
which case I can place a 480x90 transparent gif at the bottom of my
entrance page, and upon request of such gif I can set something in the
user's cookie that would allow him/her further browsing. A lot of things
are computer detectable.

You are correct, for the most part, but your statement does not apply
to all sites.

Maybe it is collapsing for companies who hire dozens of programmers
to create some trivial nonsensical sites, e.g. drkoop.com. I created my
site by myself, with no costs other than my time involved (and I
enjoyed doing it anyway, so the true cost is near zero), and banners
nicely supplement my income. I am not looking for a multimillion IPO,
just looking to make some $$ after all expenses. I have the benefit of a
nice name (www.algebra.com), so I do not need to spend any $$ at all to
attract visitors. 

Practically, my site is making money after all expenses (dsl fees etc).

One of the most popular features, aside from math help, is "Talk to
Splotchy", which is a conversation with an Eliza-like AI program. But
unlike Eliza, Spltchy is more like a chatterbox with a lot more
personality. Some people even have cybersex with Splotchy.

Also, I have a "talk to George W Bush LIVE" section at
bush-2000.algebra.com.  Basically the same thing but politically
educated.
