I would like to clarify my own position, which is in some 
important ways different from your own:  I am not in favor of 
myself, or any one else in America, being sacrificed for the 
greater good of Iraqi democracy, and since Iraqi democracy is 
likely to consist of 51% voting to bugger the other 49%, I can 
understand the position of those Iraqis who are fighting to 
resist the imposition of democracy.  But if they fight by 
taking hostages and mutilating them on television, then by all 
means let us have them sodomized.  I don't want Americans sent 
to fight by their stupid government, but if they are sent to 
fight, I am in favor of them winning and the guys they are 
fighting dying, and if it means destroying the village to save 
it, serves the goat fuckers right.
