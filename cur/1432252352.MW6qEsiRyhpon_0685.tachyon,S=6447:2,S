There will be blood in the streets if a "do over" is allowed in Palm 
Beach County. Frankly, were such a "do over" ordered, I have no doubt 
that Gore would pick up the extra 300 or so votes he needs to beat 
Bush. I outlined the basic reasons a day or two ago in my "Causality 
and Close Elections" piece. It's why we all vote at nominally the 
same time.

In fact, the margin for a "new victory" would likely be much more 
than 300 votes.

To Ernest Hua, Pinhead, this would be "the will of the people."

As I've said, I sort of hope this happens. It would make for exciting 
news. And blood in the streets. Folks like me would be calling for 
the trial and execution of Al Gore and his thousands of lackeys. That 
would be sort of fun.

Meanwhile, the chaos and paralysis is also useful.

Re-votes, or "do overs," are inherently unfair in the most basic 
sense. This is why they are so rare, so _fucking_ rare. Even in cases 
in Miami where actual fraud was found, the courts did not order a 
re-vote. Rather, they tossed out entire blocs of ballots which were 
thought to have been tainted.

There is no evidence of substantial fraud in the Palm Beach County 
matter, as we've discussed ad nauseum (ballots approved in advance, 
ballots published, no disputes, ballots used in '96 election, number 
of spoiled ballots comparable to number in '96, etc.).

Even if there _were_, the remedy would likely be to discard all of 
the Palm Beach County votes before there would ever be a re-vote.

(And the 150,000 voters, IIRC, who got it "right," who didn't drool 
on their ballots or mark mulitple choices, would be justified in then 
complaining that _they_ were being penalized for having carefully 
looked at the ballot!)

Which is one reason I sort of hope the hundreds of lawyers sent down 
to Florida by the Gore Team succeed in throwing the election to Gore.

Got that one covered. I don't expect hordes in the countryside, but 
we could see some the Welfare Mutants and Inner City Maggots rioting, 
looting, and shitting in their own nests.  Most of South-Central LA 
remains boarded up and economically wasted, which I think is poetic 
justice. Let the Democrat "maggots and faggots" deal with Jesse 
Jackson's promised race war.
