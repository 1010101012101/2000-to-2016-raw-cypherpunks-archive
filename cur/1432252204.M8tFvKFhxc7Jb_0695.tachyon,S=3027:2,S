Two problems:

1.  Instantaneous and complete transfer is irrevocable, thus
attractive to ten million phishing spammers, virus witers etc.

2.  Governments want everyone to keep records on everyone else,
and make those records available to the government, thus
discriminate against the more cashlike forms of internet money.

It is clear that the world needs a fully cashlike form of
internet money, that there is real demand for this, but the low
security of personal computers makes it insecure from thieves,
and the hostility of national governments make it insecure from
governments.
