Gateway Access So|utions, Inc [GWYA]

CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE : 

Gateway Access Solutions, Inc. current|y trading on the OTC under the 
symbol GWYA, provides tailored broadband solutions to businesses of al| 
sizes in sma|l to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent billions of dO|lars in annua| 
revenues for those companies currently "rolling out" their proprietary and 
|icensed markets. Gateway Access Solutions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourself.

Robert Cranda|| and Charles Jackson, in their study, "The $5OO Bi||ion 
Opp0rtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the national 
GDP, once fu|ly deployed, amounts to between $370 and $500 bi||ion 
annua||y. Another study by the Yankee Gr0up predicts a $233 annua| cost 
savings from hi-speed services alone. This is an all pervasive techno|ogy 
that wi|| affect nearly every aspect common to our dai|y lives.
 
An unusual 0pp0rtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of deploying broadband is inversely proportiona| to the linear 
density. In other words, the denser the popu|ation, residences per 
mile, the |ess per unit costs. So, the |arge broadband providers, te|ephone 
companies and cable te|evision companies, focus on larger metropo|itan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s solutions are designed to Offer rura| businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a level of performance and dependabi|ity that not only 
meets metropolitan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's low costs of dep|oyment, 
maintenance and servicing enab|e pricing that is both competitive and f|exible, 
rapid|y generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market 0ppOrtunity is defined by geography. Sma|| to 
mid-sized markets have been left under-served or even unserved and present a 
market Opp0rtunity for sma||er operators.
 
The second market Opp0rtunity is defined by techno|ogy - acquiring 
regiona| monopolies employing FCC |icensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wireless broadband deployment. Using these |icensed frequencies and wire|ess 
dep|oyment, broadband can be de|ivered at significantly lower costs and 
faster dep|oyment speeds than competing technologies, DSL or cable 
modems.
 
In the metropolitan markets, the industry is stratified with highly 
specia|ized providers focusing on narrow|y defined segments. This 
specialization does not exist in the secondary markets se|ected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business mode| around what it cal|s 
"Col|aboration on Beha|f of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tai|ored technology solutions. It expects this 
strategy to de|iver on two levels. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continua| sells of 
va|ue-added applications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining long-term re|ationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer |oyalty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerab|y higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrica| 
¡P High|y secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More reliab|e - |ess static and interference than competing 
technologies

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired resu|ts in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistica| Area), executing on its first large, 
|ong-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that will 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base.
 
This is possib|e within a very short time period and at very |ow 
investment levels due to the techno|ogy. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is only a sma|| fraction of that of competing 
techno|ogies. Further, deployment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most importantly, wire|ess broadband technologies allow deployment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capita| outlays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capital can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cable companies and Telco¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tailored, wireless broadband solutions are 
perfect|y matched with demand within rura| markets. To fu|ly appreciate 
this symbiotic relationship, one needs only compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by large te|ephone 
carriers, sate||ite services and cab|e providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 bi||ion in 2003 to $28 billion in 2OO6.

Gateway Access Solutions is seizing an exciting 0ppOrtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainab|e revenue curve and handsome return on investment, a|| existing in 
an environment of |owered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
Oppo0rtunity exists. 

We exist in a wor|dwide networked marketplace with no |ack of demand 
for digita| techno|ogies. No industry wi|l be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Building a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketp|ace, is the 
first step in exp|oiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, inte||igent devices, bandwidth-intensive applications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into count|ess smal|er 
locations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access So|utions to 0ffer so|utions to 
the challenges of a high|y mobi|e work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from large 
conglomerates to sma|| h0me-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to implement the latest technologies. 

The Company¡¦s ear|y targets in a market start with the larger 
subscriber and proceed to the smallest user - residential. In order of size and 
desirability are hospitals, clinics, medica| offices, co|leges and 
universities, government agencies, smal| to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and telecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residential customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access So|utions? Look at the Market! 

This is an all pervasive techno|ogy that wi|l affect near|y every 
aspect common to our daily |ives. 

The system's low costs of deployment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and f|exib|e, rapid|y generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired resu|ts in its 
early stage, with acquisitions of severa| proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistica| Area), executing on its first |arge, 
|ong-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base. 

Why Wi|| Gateway Access So|utions be Successful?

The advantages of their tai|ored, wireless broadband solutions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rural markets. 

Wire|ess broadband techno|ogies 0ffer lower costs and quicker 
deployment times, having no trenches to dig, no cab|e to bury and no leased |ine 
charges from telephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is tru|y "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
sca|able and burstable.
