The Executive is part of the "national government" that Cruikshank says is 
restricted by the 2nd amendment, yes?

Then Cruikshank didn't mean to include the President as part of the 
"national government" that it found to be restricted by the 2nd amendment?

Again, Presser says the 2nd amendment restricts the president from such an 
executive order, yes?
