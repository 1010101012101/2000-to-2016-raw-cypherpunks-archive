Post the above to nanog.

Anyone can put 10G nics in router pc's and easily pass more than 1G..
But big fiber links are 10/40/100G per wave. You'd need some
very fast asic link encryptors for that or offload it to your hosts
doing ipsec between your cages/dc's. Yahoo, Google, etc may
peer but they almost certainly don't own the fiber they do it over,
the tier-n's they buy from do, or the raw fiber providers do. Though
they can often attach leased fiber direct to their shelves. These
questions are a bit mixed into different areas. You're either talking
bandwidth consumers trying to encrypt. Or the bandwidth providers
getting together to encrypt their backbones. Very different things.
