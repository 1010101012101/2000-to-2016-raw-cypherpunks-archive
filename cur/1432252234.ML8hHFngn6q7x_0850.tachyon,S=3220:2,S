Yah.  A pretty blatant one.  I'm wondering though why they're 
concentrating on international threats and political crap 
instead of more domestic threats.  

For example, considering how lucrative an aggressive program of 
corporate espionage and selective capital investment could be, 
and how relatively risk-free compared to cruder uses of inside 
information such as blackmail and extortion, I'd be astonished 
if there were nobody out there right now doing it. 

But people like that are not being brought to our attention.
