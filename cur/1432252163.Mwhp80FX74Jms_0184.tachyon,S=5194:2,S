Ritual Satanic Ritual Abuse in Denver Need Help
 
HI and Prrraise the Lord: 
 
My wife Rev. Helen ( revhelen@tds.net ) got the following e mail 
message.  I didn't know what to do with it.  Maybe you know 
someone that can check this out or pass it on to someone in the 
Denver area.  I sent it to Marilyn Hickey's ministry as she is in 
Denver.  
 
Thanks Rev. Paul at The SPRIG
