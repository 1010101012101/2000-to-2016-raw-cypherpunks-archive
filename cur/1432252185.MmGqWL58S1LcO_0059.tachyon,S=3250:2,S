So what is the end game of the violence monopoly ?

To be able to blow the brains out of domestic sheeple
(and, for sport, the faraway tribes) the state must
have trained killers (cops, fedz, army.)

If they are bred in somatized environment they will not
be good at it (ie. blowing the brains out ...) So either
we are going to see special camps that will take care of
piglet education, or they will have to import foreign-trained
carnivoras.

It is funny - society of Morlocks and Eloi, but with the
twist: Eloi are both stupid and ugly.
