Fear not your ignorance.
Nimble Nymph eh?  Facinating, but that remains to be seen...

So be it.  And as to your request- your urge to dance and play
amongst us in the Bacchae-

Oh for a draught of vintage! that hath been
Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, 
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
but the refrain comes too brief a time, 
fades away in all its splendor, 
and the maenad chokes
on a mouthful of blood, 
grasping a tarnished thyrsus. 
The ivy turns to pine, 
turns to smoke, 
and ancient lore
swells with bitter wisdom.
