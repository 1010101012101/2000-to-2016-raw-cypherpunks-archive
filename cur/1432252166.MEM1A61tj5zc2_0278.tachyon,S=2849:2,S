Yabut you gave cryptic replies, like
answering a question with a question.

#    Where in the Constitution does it say the fed's are supposed

Interstate commerce?

#    Where in the Constitution does it draw a distinction with regard

You're right! The Constitution only applies to white males!

#    The 10'th Amendment clearly makes these issues STATE issues, 
#    not federal ones.

So, the SCOTUS has no jurisdiction to claim jurisdiction?

#    Simply because a bunch of religious fascist/socialist wanna do 
#    it don't make it right.

SCOTUS or Congress?
