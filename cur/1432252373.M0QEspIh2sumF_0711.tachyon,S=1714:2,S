You don't get it.  The way to be free from Colonialists is to remind
the folks *behind the Colonialism* that they are not immune just because

they are bordered by oceans and 0wn3d northern and southern

UBL understands democracy better than most.

Strangling has nothing to do with it; Tim May used to encourage such
self-suffication, but that's not the Jihad plan.  The plan is to provide

negative reinforcement.   How do you say that in Spanish?
