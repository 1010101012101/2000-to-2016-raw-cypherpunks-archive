Quite clearly cash has got to go! I'm not sure how tough this would be
to sneak past the slumbering electorate. Pretty tough I expect. But the
usage level is certainly going down while the percentage of electronic
transactions is skyrocketing. We've even had concresscritters suggesting
that the transport of $10K !interstate! should be illegal. I think this
came up when the most recent international transport rule changes were
made. It's getting more wierd every week now. An adjustment in the other
direction will come along soon - I hope but doubt.
