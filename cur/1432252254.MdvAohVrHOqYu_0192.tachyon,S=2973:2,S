I came up with a plan which is workable immediately and which does not 
require substantive changes:

Put a partition down the middle of a school building. One side is 
"Blue," the other side is "Red."

Blue and Red have different academic orientations, different goals. 
What the goals are and how they are set might arise in different ways, 
e.g., by a vote of parents, or the backgrounds of the teachers in each, 
and so on. Not so important. What is important is what follows.


As the Blue and Red sides evolve, with perhaps one focusing on academic 
excellence and the other on "social skills," parents could move their 
children between the sides (say, on a semester by semester basis, to 
reduce thrashing). As the sizes of the Blue and Red sizes change, the 
partition would be moved.


This gives "policy choice" within a particular school building, which 
is a lot less expensive than busing students long distances to get to 
"magnet" schools (science, performing arts, crack dealing, etc.).
