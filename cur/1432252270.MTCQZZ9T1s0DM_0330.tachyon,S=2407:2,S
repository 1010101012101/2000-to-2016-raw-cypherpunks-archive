Did you miss the part where Google unofficially admitted storing queries for
good? Given their attidude, and storage, they're storing *anything* they
can.

Everyone is using Google. Not just for searching; Orkut and Google local,
News, AdWords, Gmail, what have you.

You don't have to run it, you can just read over their shoulders to get a
really detailed profile on any user. Or subpoena stuff on some selected
users.

Now here's your one stop shop for evil. A position for Google minister for
propaganda is about to be posted, so I hear.
