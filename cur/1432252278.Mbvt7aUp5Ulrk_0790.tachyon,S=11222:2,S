Except that I'd certainly expect the police here to treat politicians a 
little 
differently from other drivers -- unless the public was looking, and 
these 
cameras aren't in the pubic domain.

That is a very good point.  I think getting a car with dark glass may be 
a 
better response.

I had a look at that URL.  Star Office browser crashed trying to open it, 
but when using IE5 I got at least the text.  I've copied it below in case 
you or others would like to see.

copy of Doug Barnes's slides follows:
----------------------------------------
   Its the People, Stupid
 An analysis of privacy self-protection 
 as a public health issue.
----------------------------------------
   People Worry About Privacy
Privacy cited as #1 concern people have 
 about using web sites. 
Surveys show up to 97% of people say they are 
 reluctant to provide information on web sites. 
Much hand-wringing as information is, in fact, 
 combined and used in harmful or undesirable 
 ways, e.g. medical records.
----------------------------------------
   But Do Nothing About It
Vast majority of e-mail is unencrypted. 
Vast majority of IP traffic is unencrypted.
Almost everyone voluntarily trades personal 
 information for a small increase in ease-of-use. 
More advanced tools are not developed based on 
 limited uptake of more basic ones.
-----------------------------------------
   Case In Point: Doug Barnes
Will happily install buggy P2P software to 
 find warez and MP3s, but grumbles every time 
 he has to fire up PGP. 
Thinks less and less before entering personal 
 information at web portal sites with each 
 passing month. 
Actually used Evite recently to announce a party.
------------------------------------------
   Old, Tired Excuses
The available software sucks. 
Greedy companies have stupid patents and wont 
 let us play. 
Evil Government wont let us export. 
Nothing really bad has happened yet, once someone 
 gets in serious trouble, then everyone will see 
 the light.
------------------------------------------
   Its Time for a Fresh Excuse
Lack of buy-in on privacy self-protection is a 
 social and emotional problem more than a technical 
 or political one. 
Although similar to other widespread social 
 problems, important differences make real solutions 
 harder.
-------------------------------------------
   What is Privacy Self-Protection?
Using available tools to protect ones own privacy. 
Strongly encouraging counter-parties to use these tools. 
Demanding guarantees and use of privacy protection 
 from vendors, withholding trade when necessary.
-------------------------------------------
   Analogous Problems 
Privacy self-protection is most like: 
   Using condoms. 
   Washing hands. 
   Civility. 
And has similar elements with: 
   Wearing seatbelts. 
   Water treatment.
--------------------------------------------
   Common Elements
Small individual efforts 
Low-probability of a potentially very large negative 
 outcome 
Importance of network effects 
Need for common infrastructure & network effects.
---------------------------------------------
   Minimum Efforts
Using slightly more expensive software 
Using software that is slightly more difficult to 
 configure or understand. 
Dealing with new error conditions & failure modes. 
Paying (or enduring cost-recovery) for somewhat 
 increased resource usage & infrastructure. 
people make these sorts of efforts for many other 
 reasons, but not for privacy. Why not?
----------------------------------------------
   Apparent Solutions (1)
Legislation 
   Could mandate minimum standards of 
    privacy protection in products. 
   BUT, government has a conflict of interest, 
    limited jurisdiction, and (in theory) should not 
    be as worried about this as individuals. 
Government education 
   Same conflict of interest 
   Likely to be ineffective
-----------------------------------------------
   Apparent Solutions (2)
Corporate Initiative 
   Products targeted at personal privacy have not 
    been big sellers. 
   Corporate-targeted products suffer from a conflict 
    of interest. 
Grassroots Public Health Approach 
----------------------------------------------- 
   Grassroots Public Health Approach
Members a group recognize harm, organize as necessary, 
 and create awareness of the public health problem. 
   Advocacy of harm avoidance is a pro-social activity. 
   Identifies advocate as a good counter-party in an 
    iterated prisoners dilemma. 
   Self-reinforcing and highly effective at solving this 
    type of problem.
------------------------------------------------
Anti-Social Nature of Privacy

   I had a wonderful time, even though there were 
    a lot of cypherpunks there.  Anon. 
------------------------------------------------
   The Stigma of Privacy Obsession
While everyone wants privacy, an exaggerated interest 
  in privacy sends signals that evoke a strong negative 
response in most human beings. 
   Privacy gives an individual an advantage in an iterated 
    prisoners dilemma. 
   BUT, this disrupts co-operative solutions to IPD. 
   Detecting & shunning those overly concerned with 
    privacy is part of a co-operative strategy for IPD.
-------------------------------------------------
Limited SanctionHuman rights (knowledge seekers are the other.) 
Sexual Medical?
-------------------------------------------------
   A New Excuse
A social movement advocating for strong privacy sows the 
 seeds of its own destruction by identifying itself as 
 fundamentally anti-social in nature. 
No grassroots approach to privacy self-protection will 
have widespread success until this problem is defused.
