Boyce blocked my address in his private e-mail.  I've sent a message to
another e-mail address.  I was banned and can't subscribe again.  Phew,
hard times...  :-/

Hi Boyce.

I can't subscribe again.  I was talking seriously about being on topic.

If you search in my messages, you find references about my rapes.  Sorry, I
am receiving lots of messages talking about rape me again.  And again.  And
again.

I won't go to a Python meeting because my presence was public and two
persons that mention the rape are surely Brazilian.  Some of my friends are
trying to discover their identities and I am being more cautelous than
usual.

Sorry, don't you think it was a bit injust call me a "rape apologetics"?
Being sincere, it was disgusting enough for making me crying until now.

Hi again, Boyce.

I will re-subscribe and be on topic now.  You can moderate my messages to
be sure I will be strictly on topic, if you want.

I am humbly asking to return because there are some interesting subjects
there, about Tor Project in general.

Sorry for being deeply sincere, but mentioning "ludicrous rape apologetics"
makes really clear your beliefs and preferences.

Hope to be accepted again.

Cecilia
