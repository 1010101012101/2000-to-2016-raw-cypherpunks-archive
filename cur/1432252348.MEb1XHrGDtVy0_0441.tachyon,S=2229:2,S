Of course outgoing is impossible inside the TEMPEST box.
But you don't reveal the intermediate locations you drove
through to get to where you broadcast.

I drove to Cheech's with my phone unpowered and my
toll-road-transponder boxed.  Then I drove to the library
and unboxed my gizmos.  Simple.  The gap must have been
a "glitch" to the semiclued Big Bro.

I don't, because I'm a cheapo and professional paranoid.  But in my
'hood, there are many tollroad which use them.  Otherwise you have
to stop and toss coins.  Of course your license and face are video'd
anyway.

If I had one, I would box it unless I was driving on a toll road.
