I don't remember what was said at this point. :)

My comments were good-natured, George. They always are.

So, when you go to battle in the round, you want a good-looking gladiator to
"distract" the lions. Maybe they won't eat her because she's pretty? Maybe
they figure she's just "more tasty," and they will play with her a
little...and bat her around.... before they pounce on her and gobble her up
for being "a stupid twit."

When lawyers go into chambers, it's not for a damn lap dance.

If I could, I would file my teeth into sharp little pygmy points and graft
Doberman pincher ears to my head.

Oh, their papers get graded...
