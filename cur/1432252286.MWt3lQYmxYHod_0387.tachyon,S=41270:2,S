I look forward to a world without patents, so I'm afraid all that waffle about obtaining a worldwide government-enforced-monopoly merely made me sigh a bit.

 that an inventor should file for a patent in any country:<br clear="none" />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a significant amount of the invention will be made.<br clear="none" />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a significant amount of the invention will be used.<br clear="none" /><span class="tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If I assume that the royalty per meter of fiber is $0.25/meter (25 American cents per meter), it would be worth filing for a patent if the amount of fiber made or used is $10,000/$0.25, or 40,000 meters of fiber.&nbsp; This would be about 1.1 kilometers of cable that has 36 fibers in it.&nbsp; Obviously, even the smallest country would use enough fiber to justify obtaining a patent.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><span class="yiv4219404236tab" id="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_30275">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are 148 PCT-signatory countries.&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"

 probably 80 nations, and possibly as much as 120 nations.&nbsp; That would cost about $400,000, $800,000, or $1.2 million. (USD).&nbsp;&nbsp; I have considered raising the money by means of a Kickstarter campaign, but that site is oriented to collecting donations of money:&nbsp; It is specifically prohibited that a project proponent promise a financial return on such a contribution.&nbsp; But I'm not looking for a handout:&nbsp; I'm looking for a loan which will be paid back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that's called a 'bond'? <br clear="none" /><span class="yiv4219404236tab" id="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_30277">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would it be paid back?&nbsp; Corning says that 300 billion meters of fiber were manufactured in about 2012.&nbsp; If I get a market-share of 10%, that's 30 billion meters per year.&nbsp; At a royalty of, say, $0.25 per meter of fiber, that would be $7.5 billion per year.&nbsp; With even a tiny fraction of such a value,
 I could pay a huge return on a loan to finance
 these national-stage patent
 applications.&nbsp; I see nothing wrong with a 3x return:&nbsp;&nbsp; $3 returned for each dollar loaned, probably within 1-2 years.&nbsp; Does this sound interesting?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Bell<br /><br clear="none" /></span></div><br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><div class="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_8_1383759717740_12 yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_22152 yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_34221" id="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_8_1383759717740_13" style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt;"> <div class="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_12073 yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_22153 yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_34222" id="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_12263" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"> <div dir="ltr" id="yiv4219404236yui_3_13_0_1_1383759717740_12262"> <div class="yiv4219404236yqt7449766401"

 resources, there's a lot of<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; counter-measures based on human
 intervention that can definitely stop<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; the attack in the short-term<br clear="none" />&gt; <br clear="none" />&gt; <br clear="none" />&gt; The attack can be easily hidden. And be sure that before today, today,<br clear="none" />&gt; and after today, very smart people are at their computer planning attacks<br clear="none" />&gt; on Bitcoin. Exploits must be published and fixed FAST.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Not this exploit.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Here's a perfectly plausible worst-case scenario, that could be<br clear="none" />happening right now: RAND High Frequency Trading Corp (a subsidiary of<br clear="none" />General Evil) has a globe-spanning low-latency network of fiber,<br clear="none" />line-of-sight microwave, and some experimental line-of-site neutrino<br clear="none" />links criss-crossing the globe. They can get data to and from any point<br clear="none" />on this planet faster than anyone else. Of course, in
addition
 to their<br clear="none" />spectacular network they have an immense amount of computing power, as<br clear="none" />well as exotic overclocked liquid nitrogen bathed CPU's that run at<br clear="none" />clockspeeds double what commercial
 hardware can do; in short, they have<br clear="none" />access to scalar performance no-one else has. Of course, they like to<br clear="none" />keep a healthy reserve so, 99% of all this fancy gear is constantly<br clear="none" />idle. Whatever, they can afford it.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />RAND just hired a bunch of fresh MIT graduates, the best of the best.<br clear="none" />Problem is the best of the best tends to make not so best mistakes, so<br clear="none" />RAND figures a Training Exercise is in order. Fortunately for them the NSA (a<br clear="none" />subsidiary of General Evil) slipped a rootkit into my keyboard a week or<br clear="none" />so ago - probably that time when I woke up in that farmers field with a<br clear="none" />*splitting* headache - and are reading what I'm typing right now.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />I go on to explain how an excellent training exercise for these fresh<br clear="none" />MIT graduates would be to implement this nifty
 attack some Cornell<br clear="none" />researchers came up with. It's really simple, elegant even, but to do it<br clear="none" />best what you really want is the kind of low-latency network
 a<br clear="none" />high-frequency-trading corporation would have. I then point out how a<br clear="none" />good training exercise ideally is done in a scenario where there is<br clear="none" />genuine risk and reward, but where the worst-case consequences are<br clear="none" />manageable - new hires to tend to screw up. (I then go on to explain my<br clear="none" />analog electronics background, and squeeze in some forced anecdote about<br clear="none" />how I blew up something worth a lot of money owned by my employers at<br clear="none" />some point in the distant past)<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Unfortunately for the operators of BTC Guild, one of these new MIT grads<br clear="none" />happens to have a: passed General Evil's psych screening with flying<br clear="none" />colors, and b: have spent too much time around the MIT Kidnappng Club.<br clear="none" />He decides it'd be easier to just kidnap the guy running BTC Guild than<br clear="none" />fill out the
 paperwork to borrow RAND's FPGA cluster, so he does.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />As expected the attack runs smoothly: with 30% of the hashing power,<br clear="none" />neutrino burst generator/encoders's rigged
 around the globe to fire the<br clear="none" />moment another pool gets a block, and the odd DoS attack for fun, they<br clear="none" />quickly make a mockery of the Bitcoin network, reducing every other<br clear="none" />miners profitability to zero in minutes. The other miners don't have a<br clear="none" />hope: they're blocks have to travel the long way, along the surface of<br clear="none" />the earth, while RAND's blocks shave off important milliseconds by<br clear="none" />taking the direct route.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Of course, this doesn't go unnoticed, er, eventualy: 12 hours later the<br clear="none" />operators of GHash.IO, Eligius, slush, Bitminter, Eclipse and ASICMiner<br clear="none" />open their groggy eyes and mutter something about how that simulcast<br clear="none" />Tuesday party really shouldn't have had an open bar... or so much coke.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />They don't even notice that the team from BTC Guild
 has vanished, but<br clear="none" />they do notice a YouTube video of Gavin right on bitcoin.org doing his<br clear="none" />best Spock impression, er, I mean appealing for calm and promising that<br clear="none" />Top Men are
 working on the issue of empty blocks as we speak. Meanwhile<br clear="none" />CNN's top headline reads "IS THIS THE END OF BITCOIN?!?!"<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />It takes another hour for the Aspirin's to finally kick in, but<br clear="none" />eventually get all get on IRC and start trying to resolve the issue -<br clear="none" />seems that whenever any of them produce a block, somehow by incredible<br clear="none" />coincidence someone else finds another block first. After a few rounds<br clear="none" />of this they're getting suspicious. (if they weren't all so hung-over<br clear="none" />they might have also found suspicious the fact that whenever they found<br clear="none" />a block they saw a sudden blue flash - Cherenkov radiation emitted when<br clear="none" />those neutrino's interacted with the vitreous humour in their eyeballs)<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />It's quickly realized that "somehow" BTC Guild isn't affected...<br clear="none" />GHash.IO and
 Eligius, 22% and 13% of the hashing power respectively,<br clear="none" />decide to try a little experiment: they peer to each other and only each<br clear="none" />other through an encrypted tunnel
 and... hey, no more lucky blocks!<br clear="none" />slush, 7% of the hashing power is invited to the peering group next,<br clear="none" />followed by Bitminter, 6%, and Eclipse, 2%, and finally ASICMiner, 1%,<br clear="none" />for a grand total of... 51% of the hashing power!<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Of course, just creating blocks isn't useful for users, they need to be<br clear="none" />distributed too, so someone quickly writes up a "one-way firewall" patch<br clear="none" />that allows the group's blocks to propagate to the rest of the network.<br clear="none" />Blocks created by anyone else are ignored.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />It takes a few more hours, but eventually the attacker seems to run out<br clear="none" />of blocks, and transaction processing returns to normal, albeit a little<br clear="none" />slow. (20 min block average) Of course, soon there's a 3,000 post thread<br clear="none" />on bitcointalk complaining about the "centralized pool
 cartel", but<br clear="none" />somehow life goes on.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />The next day Gavin goes on CNN, and gives a lovely interview about how<br clear="none" />the past two days events show how the strength of
 the Bitcoin network is<br clear="none" />in the community. For balance they interview this annoying "Peter Todd"<br clear="none" />guy from "Keep Bitcoin Free!" who blathers on about how relying on<br clear="none" />altruism or something will doom the Bitcoin network in the long run.<br clear="none" />After the interview Gavin respectfully points out that maybe next time<br clear="none" />they find a so called "developer" with a ratio of bitcointalk posts to<br clear="none" />actual lines of code in the Bitcoin git repository better than one<br clear="none" />hundred to one. The producer just wishes that "Mike Hearn" guy was<br clear="none" />available; at least he's got a sense of fashion, sheesh!<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Anyway, I'm out of space for my little story, but yeah, the ending<br clear="none" />involves a group of now-rich pool operators who decide to start a large<br clear="none" />financial services and data networking company, oh,
 and time-travel...<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />&gt; Nevertheless, I agree&nbsp; that, as you say, we must not rush it. Look at the<br clear="none" />&gt; BIP, find if we missed anything, and let's
 discuss it.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Indeed.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Quite seriously, your attack is a serious long-term risk, but in the<br clear="none" />short term the social dynamics of Bitcoin are such that it's just not a<br clear="none" />show-stopping risk. At worst some miners will lose a bunch of money -<br clear="none" />that's something that's happened before with the March chain fork, and<br clear="none" />sure enough Bitcoin survived just fine.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; In addition, keep in mind<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; that this attack is very easy to detect, so if one is actually launched<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; we will know immediately and can start taking direct counter-measures at<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; that time.<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt;<br clear="none" />&gt; <br clear="none" />&gt; Not really. Please see the discussion section in our paper.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />You can hide *who* is
the
 attacker - you can't hide the fact that an<br clear="none" />attack is happening if done on a meaningful scale.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; That Gregory Maxwell so quickly identified a flaw in this proposed<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt; solution suggests we should proceed
 carefully.<br clear="none" />&gt; &gt;<br clear="none" />&gt; <br clear="none" />&gt; There is no flaw. You were just reiterating that the solution does not give<br clear="none" />&gt; us the 51% percent security you thought you had before. We showed that<br clear="none" />&gt; we're not getting this back, I'm afraid.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />That's not what we're concerned about - what we're concerned about is<br clear="none" />that your BIP doesn't discuss the issue, and you didn't seem to be aware<br clear="none" />of it. That suggests that the analysis is incomplete. There's no<br clear="none" />pressing need to rush changes, as explained above by example, so we're<br clear="none" />best off understanding the issue thoroughly first.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />There's a whole spectrum of potential solutions that haven't been<br clear="none" />discussed - I myself have two approaches I'm working on that may solve<br clear="none" />this problem in ways you
 haven't (publicly) considered. I'm sure there<br clear="none" />are many others out there.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />--
