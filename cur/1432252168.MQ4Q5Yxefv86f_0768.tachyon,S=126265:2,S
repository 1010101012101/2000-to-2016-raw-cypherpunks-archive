<p align=3Djustify>The law perverted! And the police powers of the state =
perverted along with it! The law, I say, not only turned from its proper =
purpose but made to follow an entirely contrary purpose! The law become t=
he weapon of every kind of greed! Instead of checking crime, the law itse=
lf guilty of the evils it is supposed to punish!
<p align=3Djustify>If this is true, it is a serious fact, and moral duty =
requires me to call the attention of my fellow-citizens to it.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Life Is a Gift from God</H3>
<p align=3Djustify>We hold from God the gift which includes all others.  =
This gift is life -- physical, intellectual, and moral life.
<p align=3Djustify>But life cannot maintain itself alone.  The Creator of=
 life has entrusted us with the responsibility of preserving, developing,=
 and perfecting it.  In order that we may accomplish this, He has provide=
d us with a collection of marvelous faculties.  And He has put us in the =
midst of a variety of natural resources.  By the application of our facul=
ties to these natural resources we convert them into products, and use th=
em.  This process is necessary in order that life may run its appointed c=
ourse.
<p align=3Djustify>Life, faculties, production--in other words, individua=
lity, liberty, property -- this is man.  And in spite of the cunning of a=
rtful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human leg=
islation, and are superior to it.
<p align=3Djustify>Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men h=
ave made laws.  On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and =
property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first pla=
ce.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>What Is Law ?</H3>
<p align=3Djustify>What, then, is law? It is the collective organization =
of the individual right to lawful defense.
<p align=3Djustify>Each of us has a natural right--from God--to defend hi=
s person, his liberty, and his property.  These are the three basic requi=
rements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely de=
pendent upon the preservation of the other two.  For what are our faculti=
es but the extension of our individuality? And what is property but an ex=
tension of our faculties?
<p align=3Djustify>If every person has the right to defend -- even by for=
ce -- his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a g=
roup of men have the right to organize and support a common force to prot=
ect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right -- it=
s reason for existing, its lawfulness -- is based on individual right.  A=
nd the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically =
have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts a=
s a substitute.  Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force agai=
nst the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the comm=
on force -- for the same reason -- cannot lawfully be used to destroy the=
 person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.
<p align=3Djustify>Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, co=
ntrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own indiv=
idual rights.  Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to de=
stroy the equal rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separa=
tely can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not =
logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force=
 that is nothing more than the organized combination of the individual fo=
rces?
<p align=3Djustify>If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than=
 this:  The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defens=
e.  It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces.  And =
this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural=
 and lawful right to do:  to protect persons, liberties, and properties; =
to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.=

<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Just and Enduring Government </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>If a nation were founded on this basis, it seems to me=
 that order would prevail among the people, in thought as well as in deed=
=2E  It seems to me that such a nation would have the most simple, easy t=
o accept, economical, limited, nonoppressive, just, and enduring governme=
nt imaginable -- whatever its political form might be.
<p align=3Djustify>Under such an administration, everyone would understan=
d that he possessed all the privileges as well as all the responsibilitie=
s of his existence.  No one would have any argument with government, prov=
ided that his person was respected, his labor was free, and the fruits of=
 his labor were protected against all unjust attack.  When successful, we=
 would not have to thank the state for our success.  And, conversely, whe=
n unsuccessful, we would no more think of blaming the state for our misfo=
rtune than would the farmers blame the state because of hail or frost.  T=
he state would be felt only by the invaluable blessings of safety provide=
d by this concept of government. =

<p align=3Djustify>It can be further stated that, thanks to the non-inter=
vention of the state in private affairs, our wants and their satisfaction=
s would develop themselves in a logical manner.  We would not see poor fa=
milies seeking literary instruction before they have bread.  We would not=
 see cities populated at the expense of rural districts, nor rural distri=
cts at the expense of cities.  We would not see the great displacements o=
f capital, labor, and population that are caused by legislative decisions=
=2E =

<p align=3Djustify>The sources of our existence are made uncertain and pr=
ecarious by these state-created displacements.  And, furthermore, these a=
cts burden the government with increased responsibilities.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Complete Perversion of the Law </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>But, unfortunately, law by no means confines itself to=
 its proper functions.  And when it has exceeded its proper functions, it=
 has not done so merely in some inconsequential and debatable matters.  T=
he law has gone further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to i=
ts own purpose.  The law has been used to destroy its own objective:  It =
has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to main=
tain; to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to res=
pect.  The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the uns=
crupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and pro=
perty of others.  It has converted plunder into a right, in order to prot=
ect plunder.  And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order =
to punish lawful defense. =

<p align=3Djustify>How has this perversion of the law been accomplished? =
And what have been the results?
<p align=3Djustify>The law has been perverted by the influence of two ent=
irely different causes:  stupid greed and false philanthropy.  Let us spe=
ak of the first.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Fatal Tendency of Mankind </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Self-preservation and self-development are common aspi=
rations among all people.  And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use o=
f his faculties and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, soci=
al progress would be ceaseless, uninterrupted, and unfailing. =

<p align=3Djustify>But there is also another tendency that is common amon=
g people.  When they can, they wish to live and prosper at the expense of=
 others.  This is no rash accusation.  Nor does it come from a gloomy and=
 uncharitable spirit.  The annals of history bear witness to the truth of=
 it:  the incessant wars, mass migrations, religious persecutions, univer=
sal slavery, dishonesty in commerce, and monopolies.  This fatal desire h=
as its origin in the very nature of man -- in that primitive, universal, =
and insuppressible instinct that impels him to satisfy his desires with t=
he least possible pain.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Property and Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Man can live and satisfy his wants only by ceaseless l=
abor; by the ceaseless application of his faculties to natural resources.=
  This process is the origin of property. =

<p align=3Djustify>But it is also true that a man may live and satisfy hi=
s wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of others.  Th=
is process is the origin of plunder. =

<p align=3Djustify>Now since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain -- a=
nd since labor is pain in itself -- it follows that men will resort to pl=
under whenever plunder is easier than work.  History shows this quite cle=
arly.  And under these conditions, neither religion nor morality can stop=
 it. =

<p align=3Djustify>When, then, does plunder stop? It stops when it become=
s more painful and more dangerous than labor. =

<p align=3Djustify>It is evident, then, that the proper purpose of law is=
 to use the power of its collective force to stop this fatal tendency to =
plunder instead of to work.  All the measures of the law should protect p=
roperty and punish plunder. =

<p align=3Djustify>But, generally, the law is made by one man or one clas=
s of men.  And since law cannot operate without the sanction and support =
of a dominating force, this force must be entrusted to those who make the=
 laws. =

<p align=3Djustify>This fact, combined with the fatal tendency that exist=
s in the heart of man to satisfy his wants with the least possible effort=
, explains the almost universal perversion of the law.  Thus it is easy t=
o understand how law, instead of checking injustice, becomes the invincib=
le weapon of injustice.  It is easy to understand why the law is used by =
the legislator to destroy in varying degrees among the rest of the people=
, their personal independence by slavery, their liberty by oppression, an=
d their property by plunder.  This is done for the benefit of the person =
who makes the law, and in proportion to the power that he holds.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Victims of Lawful Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Men naturally rebel against the injustice of which the=
y are victims.  Thus, when plunder is organized by law for the profit of =
those who make the law, all the plundered classes try somehow to enter --=
 by peaceful or revolutionary means -- into the making of laws.  Accordin=
g to their degree of enlightenment, these plundered classes may propose o=
ne of two entirely different purposes when they attempt to attain politic=
al power:  Either they may wish to stop lawful plunder, or they may wish =
to share in it. =

<p align=3Djustify>Woe to the nation when this latter purpose prevails am=
ong the mass victims of lawful plunder when they, in turn, seize the powe=
r to make laws!
<p align=3Djustify>Until that happens, the few practice lawful plunder up=
on the many, a common practice where the right to participate in the maki=
ng of law is limited to a few persons.  But then, participation in the ma=
king of law becomes universal.  And then, men seek to balance their confl=
icting interests by universal plunder.  Instead of rooting out the injust=
ices found in society, they make these injustices general.  As soon as th=
e plundered classes gain political power, they establish a system of repr=
isals against other classes.  They do not abolish legal plunder.  (This o=
bjective would demand more enlightenment than they possess.) Instead, the=
y emulate their evil predecessors by participating in this legal plunder,=
 even though it is against their own interests. =

<p align=3Djustify>It is as if it were necessary, before a reign of justi=
ce appears, for everyone to suffer a cruel retribution -- some for their =
evilness, and some for their lack of understanding.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Results of Legal Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>It is impossible to introduce into society a greater c=
hange and a greater evil than this:  the conversion of the law into an in=
strument of plunder. =

<p align=3Djustify>What are the consequences of such a perversion? It wou=
ld require volumes to describe them all.  Thus we must content ourselves =
with pointing out the most striking. =

<p align=3Djustify>In the first place, it erases from everyone's conscien=
ce the distinction between justice and injustice. =

<p align=3Djustify>No society can exist unless the laws are respected to =
a certain degree.  The safest way to make laws respected is to make them =
respectable.  When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen ha=
s the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his re=
spect for the law.  These two evils are of equal consequence, and it woul=
d be difficult for a person to choose between them.  The nature of law is=
 to maintain justice.  This is so much the case that, in the minds of the=
 people, law and justice are one and the same thing.  There is in all of =
us a strong disposition to believe that anything lawful is also legitimat=
e.  This belief is so widespread that many persons have erroneously held =
that things are "just" because law makes them so.  Thus, in order to make=
 plunder appear just and sacred to many consciences, it is only necessary=
 for the law to decree and sanction it.  Slavery, restrictions, and monop=
oly find defenders not only among those who profit from them but also amo=
ng those who suffer from them.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Fate of Non-Conformists </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>If you suggest a doubt as to the morality of these ins=
titutions, it is boldly said that "You are a dangerous innovator, a utopi=
an, a theorist, a subversive; you would shatter the foundation upon which=
 society rests."
<p align=3Djustify>If you lecture upon morality or upon political science=
, there will be found official organizations petitioning the government i=
n this vein of thought:  "That science no longer be taught exclusively fr=
om the point of view of free trade (of liberty, of property, and of justi=
ce) as has been the case until now, but also, in the future, science is t=
o be especially taught from the viewpoint of the facts and laws that regu=
late French industry (facts and laws which are contrary to liberty, to pr=
operty, and to justice).  That, in government-endowed teaching positions,=
 the professor rigorously refrain from endangering in the slightest degre=
e the respect due to the laws now in force."
<p align=3Djustify>Thus, if there exists a law which sanctions slavery or=
 monopoly, oppression or robbery, in any form whatever, it must not even =
be mentioned.  For how can it be mentioned without damaging the respect w=
hich it inspires? Still further, morality and political economy must be t=
aught from the point of view of this law; from the supposition that it mu=
st be a just law merely because it is a law. =

<p align=3Djustify>Another effect of this tragic perversion of the law is=
 that it gives an exaggerated importance to political passions and confli=
cts, and to politics in general. =

<p align=3Djustify>I could prove this assertion in a thousand ways.  But,=
 by way of illustration, I shall limit myself to a subject that has latel=
y occupied the minds of everyone:  universal suffrage.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Who Shall Judge? </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The followers of Rousseau's school of thought -- who c=
onsider themselves far advanced, but whom I consider twenty centuries beh=
ind the times -- will not agree with me on this.  But universal suffrage =
-- using the word in its strictest sense -- is not one of those sacred do=
gmas which it is a crime to examine or doubt.  In fact, serious objection=
s may be made to universal suffrage. =

<p align=3Djustify>In the first place, the word universal conceals a gros=
s fallacy.  For example, there are 36 million people in France.  Thus, to=
 make the right of suffrage universal, there should be 36 million voters.=
  But the most extended system permits only 9 million people to vote.  Th=
ree persons out of four are excluded.  And more than this, they are exclu=
ded by the fourth.  This fourth person advances the principle of incapaci=
ty as his reason for excluding the others. =

<p align=3Djustify>Universal suffrage means, then, universal suffrage for=
 those who are capable.  But there remains this question of fact:  Who is=
 capable? Are minors, females, insane persons, and persons who have commi=
tted certain major crimes the only ones to be determined incapable?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Reason Why Voting Is Restricted </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>A closer examination of the subject shows us the motiv=
e which causes the right of suffrage to be based upon the supposition of =
incapacity.  The motive is that the elector or voter does not exercise th=
is right for himself alone, but for everybody. =

<p align=3Djustify>The most extended elective system and the most restric=
ted elective system are alike in this respect.  They differ only in respe=
ct to what constitutes incapacity.  It is not a difference of principle, =
but merely a difference of degree. =

<p align=3Djustify>If, as the republicans of our present-day Greek and Ro=
man schools of thought pretend, the right of suffrage arrives with one's =
birth, it would be an injustice for adults to prevent women and children =
from voting.  Why are they prevented? Because they are presumed to be inc=
apable.  And why is incapacity a motive for exclusion? Because it is not =
the voter alone who suffers the consequences of his vote; because each vo=
te touches and affects everyone in the entire community; because the peop=
le in the community have a right to demand some safeguards concerning the=
 acts upon which their welfare and existence depend.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Answer Is to Restrict the Law </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>I know what might be said in answer to this; what the =
objections might be.  But this is not the place to exhaust a controversy =
of this nature.  I wish merely to observe here that this controversy over=
 universal suffrage (as well as most other political questions) which agi=
tates, excites, and overthrows nations, would lose nearly all of its impo=
rtance if the law had always been what it ought to be. =

<p align=3Djustify>In fact, if law were restricted to protecting all pers=
ons, all liberties, and all properties; if law were nothing more than the=
 organized combination of the individual's right to self defense; if law =
were the obstacle, the check, the punisher of all oppression and plunder =
-- is it likely that we citizens would then argue much about the extent o=
f the franchise?
<p align=3Djustify>Under these circumstances, is it likely that the exten=
t of the right to vote would endanger that supreme good, the public peace=
? Is it likely that the excluded classes would refuse to peaceably await =
the coming of their right to vote? Is it likely that those who had the ri=
ght to vote would jealously defend their privilege?
<p align=3Djustify>If the law were confined to its proper functions, ever=
yone's interest in the law would be the same.  Is it not clear that, unde=
r these circumstances, those who voted could not inconvenience those who =
did not vote?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Fatal Idea of Legal Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>But on the other hand, imagine that this fatal princip=
le has been introduced:  Under the pretense of organization, regulation, =
protection, or encouragement, the law takes property from one person and =
gives it to another; the law takes the wealth of all and gives it to a fe=
w -- whether farmers, manufacturers, shipowners, artists, or comedians.  =
Under these circumstances, then certainly every class will aspire to gras=
p the law, and logically so. =

<p align=3Djustify>The excluded classes will furiously demand their right=
 to vote -- and will overthrow society rather than not to obtain it.  Eve=
n beggars and vagabonds will then prove to you that they also have an inc=
ontestable title to vote.  They will say to you: =

<p align=3Djustify>"We cannot buy wine, tobacco, or salt without paying t=
he tax.  And a part of the tax that we pay is given by law -- in privileg=
es and subsidies -- to men who are richer than we are.  Others use the la=
w to raise the prices of bread, meat, iron, or cloth.  Thus, since everyo=
ne else uses the law for his own profit, we also would like to use the la=
w for our own profit.  We demand from the law the right to relief, which =
is the poor man's plunder.  To obtain this right, we also should be voter=
s and legislators in order that we may organize Beggary on a grand scale =
for our own class, as you have organized Protection on a grand scale for =
your class.  Now don't tell us beggars that you will act for us, and then=
 toss us, as Mr. Mimerel proposes, 600,000 francs to keep us quiet, like =
throwing us a bone to gnaw.  We have other claims.  And anyway, we wish t=
o bargain for ourselves as other classes have bargained for themselves!"
<p align=3Djustify>And what can you say to answer that argument!
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Perverted Law Causes Conflict </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>As long as it is admitted that the law may be diverted=
 from its true purpose -- that it may violate property instead of protect=
ing it -- then everyone will want to participate in making the law, eithe=
r to protect himself against plunder or to use it for plunder.  Political=
 questions will always be prejudicial, dominant, and all-absorbing.  Ther=
e will be fighting at the door of the Legislative Palace, and the struggl=
e within will be no less furious.  To know this, it is hardly necessary t=
o examine what transpires in the French and English legislatures; merely =
to understand the issue is to know the answer. =

<p align=3Djustify>Is there any need to offer proof that this odious perv=
ersion of the law is a perpetual source of hatred and discord; that it te=
nds to destroy society itself? If such proof is needed, look at the Unite=
d States [in 1850].  There is no country in the world where the law is ke=
pt more within its proper domain:  the protection of every person's liber=
ty and property.  As a consequence of this, there appears to be no countr=
y in the world where the social order rests on a firmer foundation.  But =
even in the United States, there are two issues -- and only two -- that h=
ave always endangered the public peace.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Slavery and Tariffs Are Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>What are these two issues? They are slavery and tariff=
s.  These are the only two issues where, contrary to the general spirit o=
f the republic of the United States, law has assumed the character of plu=
nder. =

<p align=3Djustify>Slavery is a violation, by law, of liberty.  The prote=
ctive tariff is a violation, by law, of property. =

<p align=3Djustify>Its is a most remarkable fact that this double legal c=
rime - a sorrowful inheritance of the Old World - should be the only issu=
e which can, and perhaps will, lead to the ruin of the Union.  It is inde=
ed impossible to imagine, at the very heart of a society, a more astoundi=
ng fact than this:  The law has come to be an instrument of injustice.  A=
nd if this fact brings terrible consequences to the United States - where=
 only in the instance of slavery and tariffs - what must be the consequen=
ces in Europe, where the perversion of law is a principle; a system?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Two Kinds of Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Mr. de Montalembert [politician and writer] adopting t=
he thought contained in a famous proclamation by Mr. Carlier, has said:  =
"We must make war against socialism." According to the definition of soci=
alism advanced by Mr. Charles Dupin, he meant:  "We must make war against=
 plunder."
<p align=3Djustify>But of what plunder was he speaking? For there are two=
 kinds of plunder:  legal and illegal. =

<p align=3Djustify>I do not think that illegal plunder, such as theft or =
swindling -- which the penal code defines, anticipates, and punishes -- c=
an be called socialism.  It is not this kind of plunder that systematical=
ly threatens the foundations of society.  Anyway, the war against this ki=
nd of plunder has not waited for the command of these gentlemen.  The war=
 against illegal plunder has been fought since the beginning of the world=
=2E  Long before the Revolution of February 1848 -- long before the appea=
rance even of socialism itself -- France had provided police, judges, gen=
darmes, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds for the purpose of fighting ille=
gal plunder.  The law itself conducts this war, and it is my wish and opi=
nion that the law should always maintain this attitude toward plunder.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Law Defends Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>But it does not always do this.  Sometimes the law def=
ends plunder and participates in it.  Thus the beneficiaries are spared t=
he shame, danger, and scruple which their acts would otherwise involve.  =
Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons, =
and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim -- =
when he defends himself -- as a criminal.  In short, there is a legal plu=
nder, and it is of this, no doubt, that Mr. de Montalembert speaks. =

<p align=3Djustify>This legal plunder may be only an isolated stain among=
 the legislative measures of the people.  If so, it is best to wipe it ou=
t with a minimum of speeches and denunciations -- and in spite of the upr=
oar of the vested interests.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>How to Identify Legal Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite =
simply.  See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and=
 gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong.  See if the law be=
nefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen hi=
mself cannot do without committing a crime. =

<p align=3Djustify>Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not onl=
y an evil itself, but also it is a fertile source for further evils becau=
se it invites reprisals.  If such a law -- which may be an isolated case =
-- is not abolished immediately, it will spread, multiply, and develop in=
to a system. =

<p align=3Djustify>The person who profits from this law will complain bit=
terly, defending his acquired rights.  He will claim that the state is ob=
ligated to protect and encourage his particular industry; that this proce=
dure enriches the state because the protected industry is thus able to sp=
end more and to pay higher wages to the poor workingmen. =

<p align=3Djustify>Do not listen to this sophistry by vested interests.  =
The acceptance of these arguments will build legal plunder into a whole s=
ystem.  In fact, this has already occurred.  The present-day delusion is =
an attempt to enrich everyone at the expense of everyone else; to make pl=
under universal under the pretense of organizing it.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Legal Plunder Has Many Names </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite num=
ber of ways.  Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it:=
  tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive t=
axation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wag=
es, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so=
 on, and so on.  All these plans as a whole --with their common aim of le=
gal plunder -- constitute socialism. =

<p align=3Djustify>Now, since under this definition socialism is a body o=
f doctrine, what attack can be made against it other than a war of doctri=
ne? If you find this socialistic doctrine to be false, absurd, and evil, =
then refute it.  And the more false, the more absurd, and the more evil i=
t is, the easier it will be to refute.  Above all, if you wish to be stro=
ng, begin by rooting out every particle of socialism that may have crept =
into your legislation.  This will be no light task.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialism Is Legal Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Mr. de Montalembert has been accused of desiring to fi=
ght socialism by the use of brute force.  He ought to be exonerated from =
this accusation, for he has plainly said:  "The war that we must fight ag=
ainst socialism must be in harmony with law, honor, and justice."
<p align=3Djustify>But why does not Mr. de Montalembert see that he has p=
laced himself in a vicious circle? You would use the law to oppose social=
ism? But it is upon the law that socialism itself relies.  Socialists des=
ire to practice legal plunder, not illegal plunder.  Socialists, like all=
 other monopolists, desire to make the law their own weapon.  And when on=
ce the law is on the side of socialism, how can it be used against social=
ism? For when plunder is abetted by the law, it does not fear your courts=
, your gendarmes, and your prisons.  Rather, it may call upon them for he=
lp. =

<p align=3Djustify>To prevent this, you would exclude socialism from ente=
ring into the making of laws? You would prevent socialists from entering =
the Legislative Palace? You shall not succeed, I predict, so long as lega=
l plunder continues to be the main business of the legislature.  It is il=
logical -- in fact, absurd -- to assume otherwise.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Choice Before Us </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>This question of legal plunder must be settled once an=
d for all, and there are only three ways to settle it:
<p align=3Djustify>1.  The few plunder the many.<BR>2.  Everybody plunder=
s everybody.<BR>3.  Nobody plunders anybody. =

<p align=3Djustify>We must make our choice among limited plunder, univers=
al plunder, and no plunder.  The law can follow only one of these three. =

<p align=3Djustify>Limited legal plunder:  This system prevailed when the=
 right to vote was restricted.  One would turn back to this system to pre=
vent the invasion of socialism. =

<p align=3Djustify>Universal legal plunder:  We have been threatened with=
 this system since the franchise was made universal.  The newly enfranchi=
sed majority has decided to formulate law on the same principle of legal =
plunder that was used by their predecessors when the vote was limited. =

<p align=3Djustify>No legal plunder:  This is the principle of justice, p=
eace, order, stability, harmony, and logic.  Until the day of my death, I=
 shall proclaim this principle with all the force of my lungs (which alas=
! is all too inadequate).
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Proper Function of the Law </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>And, in all sincerity, can anything more than the abse=
nce of plunder be required of the law? Can the law -- which necessarily r=
equires the use of force -- rationally be used for anything except protec=
ting the rights of everyone? I defy anyone to extend it beyond this purpo=
se without perverting it and, consequently, turning might against right. =
 This is the most fatal and most illogical social perversion that can pos=
sibly be imagined.  It must be admitted that the true solution -- so long=
 searched for in the area of social relationships -- is contained in thes=
e simple words:  Law is organized justice. =

<p align=3Djustify>Now this must be said:  When justice is organized by l=
aw -- that is, by force -- this excludes the idea of using law (force) to=
 organize any human activity whatever, whether it be labor, charity, agri=
culture, commerce, industry, education, art, or religion.  The organizing=
 by law of any one of these would inevitably destroy the essential organi=
zation -- justice.  For truly, how can we imagine force being used agains=
t the liberty of citizens without it also being used against justice, and=
 thus acting against its proper purpose?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Seductive Lure of Socialism </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Here I encounter the most popular fallacy of our times=
=2E  It is not considered sufficient that the law should be just; it must=
 be philanthropic.  Nor is it sufficient that the law should guarantee to=
 every citizen the free and inoffensive use of his faculties for physical=
, intellectual, and moral self-improvement.  Instead, it is demanded that=
 the law should directly extend welfare, education, and morality througho=
ut the nation. =

<p align=3Djustify>This is the seductive lure of socialism.  And I repeat=
 again:  These two uses of the law are in direct contradiction to each ot=
her.  We must choose between them.  A citizen cannot at the same time be =
free and not free.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Enforced Fraternity Destroys Liberty </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Mr. de Lamartine once wrote to me thusly:  "Your doctr=
ine is only the half of my program.  You have stopped at liberty; I go on=
 to fraternity." I answered him:  "The second half of your program will d=
estroy the first."
<p align=3Djustify>In fact, it is impossible for me to separate the word =
fraternity from the word voluntary.  I cannot possibly understand how fra=
ternity can be legally enforced without liberty being legally destroyed, =
and thus justice being legally trampled underfoot. =

<p align=3Djustify>Legal plunder has two roots:  One of them, as I have s=
aid before, is in human greed; the other is in false philanthropy. =

<p align=3Djustify>At this point, I think that I should explain exactly w=
hat I mean by the word plunder.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Plunder Violates Ownership </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>I do not, as is often done, use the word in any vague,=
 uncertain, approximate, or metaphorical sense.  I use it in its scientif=
ic acceptance -- as expressing the idea opposite to that of property [wag=
es, land, money, or whatever].  When a portion of wealth is transferred f=
rom the person who owns it -- without his consent and without compensatio=
n, and whether by force or by fraud -- to anyone who does not own it, the=
n I say that property is violated; that an act of plunder is committed. =

<p align=3Djustify>I say that this act is exactly what the law is suppose=
d to suppress, always and everywhere.  When the law itself commits this a=
ct that it is supposed to suppress, I say that plunder is still committed=
, and I add that from the point of view of society and welfare, this aggr=
ession against rights is even worse.  In this case of legal plunder, howe=
ver, the person who receives the benefits is not responsible for the act =
of plundering.  The responsibility for this legal plunder rests with the =
law, the legislator, and society itself.  Therein lies the political dang=
er. =

<p align=3Djustify>It is to be regretted that the word plunder is offensi=
ve.  I have tried in vain to find an inoffensive word, for I would not at=
 any time -- especially now -- wish to add an irritating word to our diss=
entions.  Thus, whether I am believed or not, I declare that I do not mea=
n to attack the intentions or the morality of anyone.  Rather, I am attac=
king an idea which I believe to be false; a system which appears to me to=
 be unjust; an injustice so independent of personal intentions that each =
of us profits from it without wishing to do so, and suffers from it witho=
ut knowing the cause of the suffering.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Three Systems of Plunder </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The sincerity of those who advocate protectionism, soc=
ialism, and communism is not here questioned.  Any writer who would do th=
at must be influenced by a political spirit or a political fear.  It is t=
o be pointed out, however, that protectionism, socialism, and communism a=
re basically the same plant in three different stages of its growth.  All=
 that can be said is that legal plunder is more visible in communism beca=
use it is complete plunder; and in protectionism because the plunder is l=
imited to specific groups and industries.  Thus it follows that, of the t=
hree systems, socialism is the vaguest, the most indecisive, and, consequ=
ently, the most sincere stage of development.
<p align=3Djustify>But sincere or insincere, the intentions of persons ar=
e not here under question.  In fact, I have already said that legal plund=
er is based partially on philanthropy, even though it is a false philanth=
ropy. =

<p align=3Djustify>With this explanation, let us examine the value -- the=
 origin and the tendency -- of this popular aspiration which claims to ac=
complish the general welfare by general plunder.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Law Is Force </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Since the law organizes justice, the socialists ask wh=
y the law should not also organize labor, education, and religion. =

<p align=3Djustify>Why should not law be used for these purposes? Because=
 it could not organize labor, education, and religion without destroying =
justice.  We must remember that law is force, and that, consequently, the=
 proper functions of the law cannot lawfully extend beyond the proper fun=
ctions of force. =

<p align=3Djustify>When law and force keep a person within the bounds of =
justice, they impose nothing but a mere negation.  They oblige him only t=
o abstain from harming others.  They violate neither his personality, his=
 liberty, nor his property.  They safeguard all of these.  They are defen=
sive; they defend equally the rights of all.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Law Is a Negative Concept </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The harmlessness of the mission performed by law and l=
awful defense is self-evident; the usefulness is obvious; and the legitim=
acy cannot be disputed. =

<p align=3Djustify>As a friend of mine once remarked, this negative conce=
pt of law is so true that the statement, the purpose of the law is to cau=
se justice to reign, is not a rigorously accurate statement.  It ought to=
 be stated that the purpose of the law is to prevent injustice from reign=
ing.  In fact, it is injustice, instead of justice, that has an existence=
 of its own.  Justice is achieved only when injustice is absent. =

<p align=3Djustify>But when the law, by means of its necessary agent, for=
ce, imposes upon men a regulation of labor, a method or a subject of educ=
ation, a religious faith or creed -- then the law is no longer negative; =
it acts positively upon people.  It substitutes the will of the legislato=
r for their own wills; the initiative of the legislator for their own ini=
tiatives.  When this happens, the people no longer need to discuss, to co=
mpare, to plan ahead; the law does all this for them.  Intelligence becom=
es a useless prop for the people; they cease to be men; they lose their p=
ersonality, their liberty, their property. =

<p align=3Djustify>Try to imagine a regulation of labor imposed by force =
that is not a violation of liberty; a transfer of wealth imposed by force=
 that is not a violation of property.  If you cannot reconcile these cont=
radictions, then you must conclude that the law cannot organize labor and=
 industry without organizing injustice.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Political Approach </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>When a politician views society from the seclusion of =
his office, he is struck by the spectacle of the inequality that he sees.=
  He deplores the deprivations which are the lot of so many of our brothe=
rs, deprivations which appear to be even sadder when contrasted with luxu=
ry and wealth. =

<p align=3Djustify>Perhaps the politician should ask himself whether this=
 state of affairs has not been caused by old conquests and lootings, and =
by more recent legal plunder.  Perhaps he should consider this propositio=
n:  Since all persons seek well-being and perfection, would not a conditi=
on of justice be sufficient to cause the greatest efforts toward progress=
, and the greatest possible equality that is compatible with individual r=
esponsibility? Would not this be in accord with the concept of individual=
 responsibility which God has willed in order that mankind may have the c=
hoice between vice and virtue, and the resulting punishment and reward?
<p align=3Djustify>But the politician never gives this a thought.  His mi=
nd turns to organizations, combinations, and arrangements -- legal or app=
arently legal.  He attempts to remedy the evil by increasing and perpetua=
ting the very thing that caused the evil in the first place:  legal plund=
er.  We have seen that justice is a negative concept.  Is there even one =
of these positive legal actions that does not contain the principle of pl=
under?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Law and Charity </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>You say:  "There are persons who have no money," and y=
ou turn to the law.  But the law is not a breast that fills itself with m=
ilk.  Nor are the lacteal veins of the law supplied with milk from a sour=
ce outside the society.  Nothing can enter the public treasury for the be=
nefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes=
 have been forced to send it in.  If every person draws from the treasury=
 the amount that he has put in it, it is true that the law then plunders =
nobody.  But this procedure does nothing for the persons who have no mone=
y.  It does not promote equality of income.  The law can be an instrument=
 of equalization only as it takes from some persons and gives to other pe=
rsons.  When the law does this, it is an instrument of plunder. =

<p align=3Djustify>With this in mind, examine the protective tariffs, sub=
sidies, guaranteed profits, guaranteed jobs, relief and welfare schemes, =
public education, progressive taxation, free credit, and public works.  Y=
ou will find that they are always based on legal plunder, organized injus=
tice.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Law and Education </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>You say:  "There are persons who lack education," and =
you turn to the law.  But the law is not, in itself, a torch of learning =
which shines its light abroad.  The law extends over a society where some=
 persons have knowledge and others do not; where some citizens need to le=
arn, and others can teach.  In this matter of education, the law has only=
 two alternatives:  It can permit this transaction of teaching - and - le=
arning to operate freely and without the use of force, or it can force hu=
man wills in this matter by taking from some of them enough to pay the te=
achers who are appointed by government to instruct others, without charge=
=2E  But in this second case, the law commits legal plunder by violating =
liberty and property.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Law and Morals </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>You say:  "Here are persons who are lacking in moralit=
y or religion," and you turn to the law.  But law is force.  And need I p=
oint out what a violent and futile effort it is to use force in the matte=
rs of morality and religion?
<p align=3Djustify>It would seem that socialists, however self-complacent=
, could not avoid seeing this monstrous legal plunder that results from s=
uch systems and such efforts.  But what do the socialists do? They clever=
ly disguise this legal plunder from others -- and even from themselves --=
 under the seductive names of fraternity, unity, organization, and associ=
ation.  Because we ask so little from the law -- only justice -- the soci=
alists thereby assume that we reject fraternity, unity, organization, and=
 association.  The socialists brand us with the name individualist. =

<p align=3Djustify>But we assure the socialists that we repudiate only fo=
rced organization, not natural organization.  We repudiate the forms of a=
ssociation that are forced upon us, not free association.  We repudiate f=
orced fraternity, not true fraternity.  We repudiate the artificial unity=
 that does nothing more than deprive persons of individual responsibility=
=2E  We do not repudiate the natural unity of mankind under Providence.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Confusion of Terms </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it spring=
s, confuses the distinction between government and society.  As a result =
of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the so=
cialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. =

<p align=3Djustify>We disapprove of state education.  Then the socialists=
 say that we are opposed to any education.  We object to a state religion=
=2E  Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all.  We object =
to a state-enforced equality.  Then they say that we are against equality=
=2E  And so on, and so on.  It is as if the socialists were to accuse us =
of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise g=
rain.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Influence of Socialist Writers </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>How did politicians ever come to believe this weird id=
ea that the law could be made to produce what it does not contain -- the =
wealth, science, and religion that, in a positive sense, constitute prosp=
erity? Is it due to the influence of our modern writers on public affairs=
?
<p align=3Djustify>Present-day writers -- especially those of the sociali=
st school of thought -- base their various theories upon one common hypot=
hesis:  They divide mankind into two parts.  People in general -- with th=
e exception of the writer himself -- from the first group.  The writer, a=
ll alone, forms the second and most important group.  Surely this is the =
weirdest and most conceited notion that ever entered a human brain!
<p align=3Djustify>In fact, these writers on public affairs begin by supp=
osing that people have within themselves no means of discernment; no moti=
vation to action.  The writers assume that people are inert matter, passi=
ve particles, motionless atoms, at best a kind of vegetation indifferent =
to its own manner of existence.  They assume that people are susceptible =
to being shaped -- by the will and hand of another person -- into an infi=
nite variety of forms, more or less symmetrical, artistic, and perfected.=
 =

<p align=3Djustify>Moreover, not one of these writers on governmental aff=
airs hesitates to imagine that he himself -- under the title of organizer=
, discoverer, legislator, or founder -- is this will and hand, this unive=
rsal motivating force, this creative power whose sublime mission is to mo=
ld these scattered materials -- persons -- into a society. =

<p align=3Djustify>These socialist writers look upon people in the same m=
anner that the gardener views his trees.  Just as the gardener capricious=
ly shapes the trees into pyramids, parasols, cubes, vases, fans, and othe=
r forms, just so does the socialist writer whimsically shape human beings=
 into groups, series, centers, sub-centers, honeycombs, labor corps, and =
other variations.  And just as the gardener needs axes, pruning hooks, sa=
ws, and shears to shape his trees, just so does the socialist writer need=
 the force that he can find only in law to shape human beings.  For this =
purpose, he devises tariff laws, tax laws, relief laws, and school laws.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Socialists Wish to Play God </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Socialists look upon people as raw material to be form=
ed into social combinations.  This is so true that, if by chance, the soc=
ialists have any doubts about the success of these combinations, they wil=
l demand that a small portion of mankind be set aside to experiment upon.=
  The popular idea of trying all systems is well known.  And one socialis=
t leader has been known seriously to demand that the Constituent Assembly=
 give him a small district with all its inhabitants, to try his experimen=
ts upon. =

<p align=3Djustify>In the same manner, an inventor makes a model before h=
e constructs the full-sized machine; the chemist wastes some chemicals --=
 the farmer wastes some seeds and land -- to try out an idea. =

<p align=3Djustify>But what a difference there is between the gardener an=
d his trees, between the inventor and his machine, between the chemist an=
d his elements, between the farmer and his seeds! And in all sincerity, t=
he socialist thinks that there is the same difference between him and man=
kind!
<p align=3Djustify>It is no wonder that the writers of the nineteenth cen=
tury look upon society as an artificial creation of the legislator's geni=
us.  This idea -- the fruit of classical education -- has taken possessio=
n of all the intellectuals and famous writers of our country.  To these i=
ntellectuals and writers, the relationship between persons and the legisl=
ator appears to be the same as the relationship between the clay and the =
potter. =

<p align=3Djustify>Moreover, even where they have consented to recognize =
a principle of action in the heart of man -- and a principle of discernme=
nt in man's intellect -- they have considered these gifts from God to be =
fatal gifts.  They have thought that persons, under the impulse of these =
two gifts, would fatally tend to ruin themselves.  They assume that if th=
e legislators left persons free to follow their own inclinations, they wo=
uld arrive at atheism instead of religion, ignorance instead of knowledge=
, poverty instead of production and exchange.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Socialists Despise Mankind </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>According to these writers, it is indeed fortunate tha=
t Heaven has bestowed upon certain men -- governors and legislators -- th=
e exact opposite inclinations, not only for their own sake but also for t=
he sake of the rest of the world! While mankind tends toward evil, the le=
gislators yearn for good; while mankind advances toward darkness, the leg=
islators aspire for enlightenment; while mankind is drawn toward vice, th=
e legislators are attracted toward virtue.  Since they have decided that =
this is the true state of affairs, they then demand the use of force in o=
rder to substitute their own inclinations for those of the human race. =

<p align=3Djustify>Open at random any book on philosophy, politics, or hi=
story, and you will probably see how deeply rooted in our country is this=
 idea -- the child of classical studies, the mother of socialism.  In all=
 of them, you will probably find this idea that mankind is merely inert m=
atter, receiving life, organization, morality, and prosperity from the po=
wer of the state.  And even worse, it will be stated that mankind tends t=
oward degeneration, and is stopped from this downward course only by the =
mysterious hand of the legislator.  Conventional classical thought everyw=
here says that behind passive society there is a concealed power called l=
aw or legislator (or called by some other terminology that designates som=
e unnamed person or persons of undisputed influence and authority) which =
moves, controls, benefits, and improves mankind.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Defense of Compulsory Labor </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Let us first consider a quotation from Bossuet:<p alig=
n=3Djustify><CITE>"One of the things most strongly impressed (by whom?) u=
pon the minds of the Egyptians was patriotism....  No one was permitted t=
o be useless to the state.  The law assigned to each one his work, which =
was handed down from father to son.  No one was permitted to have two pro=
fessions.  Nor could a person change from one job to another....  But the=
re was one task to which all were forced to conform:  the study of the la=
ws and of wisdom.  Ignorance of religion and of the political regulations=
 of the country was not excused under any circumstances.  Moreover, each =
occupation was assigned (by whom?) to a certain district....  Among the g=
ood laws, one of the best was that everyone was trained (by whom?) to obe=
y them.  As a result of this, Egypt was filled with wonderful inventions,=
 and nothing was neglected that could make life easy and quiet."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>Thus, according to Bossuet, persons derive nothing fro=
m themselves.  Patriotism, prosperity, inventions, husbandry, science -- =
all of these are given to the people by the operation of the laws, the ru=
lers.  All that the people have to do is to bow to leadership.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Defense of Paternal Government </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Bossuet carries this idea of the state as the source o=
f all progress even so far as to defend the Egyptians against the charge =
that they rejected wrestling and music.  He said: "How is that possible? =
These arts were invented by Trismegistus [who was alleged to have been Ch=
ancellor to the Egyptian god Osiris]". =

<p align=3Djustify>And again among the Persians, Bossuet claims that all =
comes from above:
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"One of the first responsibilities of the prince=
 was to encourage agriculture....  Just as there were offices established=
 for the regulation of armies, just so were there offices for the directi=
on of farm work....  The Persian people were inspired with an overwhelmin=
g respect for royal authority."  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>And according to Bossuet, the Greek people, although e=
xceedingly intelligent, had no sense of personal responsibility; like dog=
s and horses, they themselves could not have invented the most simple gam=
es: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"The Greeks, naturally intelligent and courageou=
s, had been early cultivated by the kings and settlers who had  come from=
 Egypt.  From these Egyptian rulers, the Greek  people had learned bodily=
 exercises, foot races, and horse  and chariot races....  But the best th=
ing that the  Egyptians had taught the Greeks was to become docile, and  =
to permit themselves to be formed by the law for the public  good." </CIT=
E>
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Idea of Passive Mankind </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>It cannot be disputed that these classical theories [a=
dvanced by these latter-day teachers, writers, legislators, economists, a=
nd philosophers] held that everything came to the people from a source ou=
tside themselves.  As another example, take Fenelon [archbishop, author, =
and instructor to the Duke of Burgundy]. =

<p align=3Djustify>He was a witness to the power of Louis XIV.  This, plu=
s the fact that he was nurtured in the classical studies and the admirati=
on of antiquity, naturally caused Fenelon to accept the idea that mankind=
 should be passive; that the misfortunes and the prosperity -- vices and =
virtues -- of people are caused by the external influence exercised upon =
them by the law and the legislators.  Thus, in his Utopia of Salentum, he=
 puts men -- with all their interests, faculties, desires, and possession=
s -- under the absolute discretion of the legislator.  Whatever the issue=
 may be, persons do not decide it for themselves; the prince decides for =
them.  The prince is depicted as the soul of this shapeless mass of peopl=
e who form the nation.  In the prince resides the thought, the foresight,=
 all progress, and the principle of all organization.  Thus all responsib=
ility rests with him. =

<p align=3Djustify>The whole of the tenth book of Fenelon's Telemachus pr=
oves this.  I refer the reader to it, and content myself with quoting at =
random from this celebrated work to which, in every other respect, I am t=
he first to pay homage.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialists Ignore Reason and Facts </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>With the amazing credulity which is typical of the cla=
ssicists, Fenelon ignores the authority of reason and facts when he attri=
butes the general happiness of the Egyptians, not to their own wisdom but=
 to the wisdom of their kings: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"We could not turn our eyes to either shore with=
out seeing rich towns and country estates most agreeably located; fields,=
 never fallowed, covered with golden crops every year; meadows full of fl=
ocks; workers bending under the weight of the fruit which the earth lavis=
hed upon its cultivators; shepherds who made the echoes resound with the =
soft notes from their pipes and flutes.  "Happy," said Mentor, "is the pe=
ople governed by a wise king.". . ."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>Later, Mentor desired that I observe the contentment a=
nd abundance which covered all Egypt, where twenty-two thousand cities co=
uld be counted.  He admired the good police regulations in the cities; th=
e justice rendered in favor of the poor against the rich; the sound educa=
tion of the children in obedience, labor, sobriety, and the love of the a=
rts and letters; the exactness with which all religious ceremonies were p=
erformed; the unselfishness, the high regard for honor, the faithfulness =
to men, and the fear of the gods which every father taught his children. =
 He never stopped admiring the prosperity of the country.  "Happy," said =
he, "is the people ruled by a wise king in such a manner."
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialists Want to Regiment People </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Fenelon's idyll on Crete is even more alluring.  Mento=
r is made to say: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"All that you see in this wonderful island resul=
ts from the laws of Minos.  The education which he ordained for the child=
ren makes their bodies strong and robust.  From the very beginning, one a=
ccustoms the children to a life of frugality and labor, because one assum=
es that all pleasures of the senses weaken both body and mind.  Thus one =
allows them no pleasure except that of becoming invincible by virtue, and=
 of acquiring glory....  Here one punishes three vices that go unpunished=
 among other people:  ingratitude, hypocrisy, and greed.  There is no nee=
d to punish persons for pomp and dissipation, for they are unknown in Cre=
te....  No costly furniture, no magnificent clothing, no delicious feasts=
, no gilded palaces are permitted."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>Thus does Mentor prepare his student to mold and to ma=
nipulate -- doubtless with the best of intentions -- the people of Ithaca=
=2E  And to convince the student of the wisdom of these ideas, Mentor rec=
ites to him the example of Salentum. =

<p align=3Djustify>It is from this sort of philosophy that we receive our=
 first political ideas! We are taught to treat persons much as an instruc=
tor in agriculture teaches farmers to prepare and tend the soil.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Famous Name and an Evil Idea </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Now listen to the great Montesquieu on this same subje=
ct: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"To maintain the spirit of commerce, it is neces=
sary that all the laws must favor it.  These laws, by proportionately div=
iding up the fortunes as they are made in commerce, should provide every =
poor citizen with sufficiently easy circumstances to enable him to work l=
ike the others.  These same laws should put every rich citizen in such lo=
wered circumstances as to force him to work in order to keep or to gain."=
</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>Thus the laws are to dispose of all fortunes!
<p align=3Djustify>Although real equality is the soul of the state in a d=
emocracy, yet this is so difficult to establish that an extreme precision=
 in this matter would not always be desirable.  It is sufficient that the=
re be established a census to reduce or fix these differences in wealth w=
ithin a certain limit.  After this is done, it remains for specific laws =
to equalize inequality by imposing burdens upon the rich and granting rel=
ief to the poor. =

<p align=3Djustify>Here again we find the idea of equalizing fortunes by =
law, by force. =

<p align=3Djustify>In Greece, there were two kinds of republics, One, Spa=
rta, was military; the other, Athens, was commercial.  In the former, it =
was desired that the citizens be idle; in the latter, love of labor was e=
ncouraged. =

<p align=3Djustify>Note the marvelous genius of these legislators:  By de=
basing all established customs -- by mixing the usual concepts of all vir=
tues -- they knew in advance that the world would admire their wisdom. =

<p align=3Djustify>Lycurgus gave stability to his city of Sparta by combi=
ning petty thievery with the soul of justice; by combining the most compl=
ete bondage with the most extreme liberty; by combining the most atrociou=
s beliefs with the greatest moderation.  He appeared to deprive his city =
of all its resources, arts, commerce, money, and defenses.  In Sparta, am=
bition went without the hope of material reward.  Natural affection found=
 no outlet because a man was neither son, husband, nor father.  Even chas=
tity was no longer considered becoming.  By this road, Lycurgus led Spart=
a on to greatness and glory. =

<p align=3Djustify>This boldness which was to be found in the institution=
s of Greece has been repeated in the midst of the degeneracy and corrupti=
on of our modern times.  An occasional honest legislator has molded a peo=
ple in whom integrity appears as natural as courage in the Spartans. =

<p align=3Djustify>Mr. William Penn, for example, is a true Lycurgus.  Ev=
en though Mr. Penn had peace as his objective -- while Lycurgus had war a=
s his objective -- they resemble each other in that their moral prestige =
over free men allowed them to overcome prejudices, to subdue passions, an=
d to lead their respective peoples into new paths. =

<p align=3Djustify>The country of Paraguay furnishes us with another exam=
ple [of a people who, for their own good, are molded by their legislators=
].
<p align=3Djustify>Now it is true that if one considers the sheer pleasur=
e of commanding to be the greatest joy in life, he contemplates a crime a=
gainst society; it will, however, always be a noble ideal to govern men i=
n a manner that will make them happier. =

<p align=3Djustify>Those who desire to establish similar institutions mus=
t do as follows:  Establish common ownership of property as in the republ=
ic of Plato; revere the gods as Plato commanded; prevent foreigners from =
mingling with the people, in order to preserve the customs; let the state=
, instead of the citizens, establish commerce.  The legislators should su=
pply arts instead of luxuries; they should satisfy needs instead of desir=
es.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Frightful Idea </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Those who are subject to vulgar infatuation may exclai=
m:  "Montesquieu has said this! So it's magnificent! It's sublime!" As fo=
r me, I have the courage of my own opinion.  I say:  What! You have the n=
erve to call that fine? It is frightful! It is abominable! These random s=
elections from the writings of Montesquieu show that he considers persons=
, liberties, property -- mankind itself -- to be nothing but materials fo=
r legislators to exercise their wisdom upon.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Leader of the Democrats </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Now let us examine Rousseau on this subject.  This wri=
ter on public affairs is the supreme authority of the democrats.  And alt=
hough he bases the social structure upon the will of the people, he has, =
to a greater extent than anyone else, completely accepted the theory of t=
he total inertness of mankind in the presence of the legislators: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"If it is true that a great prince is rare, then=
 is it not true that a great legislator is even more rare? The prince has=
 only to follow the pattern that the legislator creates.  The legislator =
is the mechanic who invents the machine; the prince is merely the workman=
 who sets it in motion.</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>And what part do persons play in all this? They =
are merely the machine that is set in motion.  In fact, are they not mere=
ly considered to be the raw material of which the machine is made?"</CITE=
>
<p align=3Djustify>Thus the same relationship exists between the legislat=
or and the prince as exists between the agricultural expert and the farme=
r; and the relationship between the prince and his subjects is the same a=
s that between the farmer and his land.  How high above mankind, then, ha=
s this writer on public affairs been placed? Rousseau rules over legislat=
ors themselves, and teaches them their trade in these imperious terms: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"Would you give stability to the state? Then bri=
ng the extremes as closely together as possible.  Tolerate neither wealth=
y persons nor beggars. </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>If the soil is poor or barren, or the country to=
o small for its inhabitants, then turn to industry and arts, and trade th=
ese products for the foods that you need....  On a fertile soil -- if you=
 are short of inhabitants -- devote all your attention to agriculture, be=
cause this multiplies people; banish the arts, because they only serve to=
 depopulate the nation....  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>If you have extensive and accessible coast lines=
, then cover the sea with merchant ships; you will have a brilliant but s=
hort existence.  If your seas wash only inaccessible cliffs, let the peop=
le be barbarous and eat fish; they will live more quietly -- perhaps bett=
er -- and, most certainly, they will live more happily.  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>In short, and in addition to the maxims that are=
 common to all, every people has its own particular circumstances.  And t=
his fact in itself will cause legislation appropriate to the circumstance=
s."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>This is the reason why the Hebrews formerly -- a=
nd, more recently, the Arabs -- had religion as their principle objective=
=2E  The objective of the Athenians was literature; of Carthage and Tyre,=
 commerce; of Rhodes, naval affairs; of Sparta, war; and of Rome, virtue.=
  The author of The Spirit of Laws has shown by what art the legislator s=
hould direct his institutions toward each of these objectives....  But su=
ppose that the legislator mistakes his proper objective, and acts on a pr=
inciple different from that indicated by the nature of things? Suppose th=
at the selected principle sometimes creates slavery, and sometimes libert=
y; sometimes wealth, and sometimes population; sometimes peace, and somet=
imes conquest? This confusion of objective will slowly enfeeble the law a=
nd impair the constitution.  The state will be subjected to ceaseless agi=
tations until it is destroyed or changed, and invincible nature regains h=
er empire.  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>But if nature is sufficiently invincible to regain its=
 empire, why does not Rousseau admit that it did not need the legislator =
to gain it in the first place? Why does he not see that men, by obeying t=
heir own instincts, would turn to farming on fertile soil, and to commerc=
e on an extensive and easily accessible coast, without the interference o=
f a Lycurgus or a Solon or a Rousseau who might easily be mistaken.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialists Want Forced Conformity </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Be that as it may, Rousseau invests the creators, orga=
nizers, directors, legislators, and controllers of society with a terribl=
e responsibility.  He is, therefore, most exacting with them: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"He who would dare to undertake the political cr=
eation of a people ought to believe that he can, in a manner of speaking,=
 transform human nature; transform each individual -- who, by himself, is=
 a solitary and perfect whole -- into a mere part of a greater whole from=
 which the individual will henceforth receive his life and being.  Thus t=
he person who would undertake the political creation of a people should b=
elieve in his ability to alter man's constitution; to strengthen it; to s=
ubstitute for the physical and independent existence received from nature=
, an existence which is partial and moral.  In short, the would- be creat=
or of political man must remove man's own forces and endow him with other=
s that are naturally alien to him."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>Poor human nature! What would become of a person's dig=
nity if it were entrusted to the followers of Rousseau?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Legislators Desire to Mold Mankind </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Now let us examine Raynal on this subject of mankind b=
eing molded by the legislator: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"The legislator must first consider the climate,=
 the air, and the soil.  The resources at his disposal determine his duti=
es.  He must first consider his locality.  A population living on maritim=
e shores must have laws designed for navigation....  If it is an inland s=
ettlement, the legislator must make his plans according to the nature and=
 fertility of the soil....  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>It is especially in the distribution of property=
 that the genius of the legislator will be found.  As a general rule, whe=
n a new colony is established in any country, sufficient land should be g=
iven to each man to support his family....  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>On an uncultivated island that you are populatin=
g with children, you need do nothing but let the seeds of truth germinate=
 along with the development of reason....  But when you resettle a nation=
 with a past into a new country, the skill of the legislator rests in the=
 policy of permitting the people to retain no injurious opinions and cust=
oms which can possibly be cured and corrected.  If you desire to prevent =
these opinions and customs from becoming permanent, you will secure the s=
econd generation by a general system of public education for the children=
=2E  A prince or a legislator should never establish a colony without fir=
st arranging to send wise men along to instruct the youth...."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>In a new colony, ample opportunity is open to the care=
ful legislator who desires to purify the customs and manners of the peopl=
e.  If he has virtue and genius, the land and the people at his disposal =
will inspire his soul with a plan for society.  A writer can only vaguely=
 trace the plan in advance because it is necessarily subject to the insta=
bility of all hypotheses; the problem has many forms, complications, and =
circumstances that are difficult to foresee and settle in detail.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Legislators Told How to Manage Men </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Raynal's instructions to the legislators on how to man=
age people may be compared to a professor of agriculture lecturing his st=
udents:  "The climate is the first rule for the farmer.  His resources de=
termine his procedure.  He must first consider his locality.  If his soil=
 is clay, he must do so and so.  If his soil is sand, he must act in anot=
her manner.  Every facility is open to the farmer who wishes to clear and=
 improve his soil.  If he is skillful enough, the manure at his disposal =
will suggest to him a plan of operation.  A professor can only vaguely tr=
ace this plan in advance because it is necessarily subject to the instabi=
lity of all hypotheses; the problem has many forms, complications, and ci=
rcumstances that are difficult to foresee and settle in detail."
<p align=3Djustify>Oh, sublime writers! Please remember sometimes that th=
is clay, this sand, and this manure which you so arbitrarily dispose of, =
are men! They are your equals! They are intelligent and free human beings=
 like yourselves! As you have, they too have received from God the facult=
y to observe, to plan ahead, to think, and to judge for themselves!
<p align=3Djustify><H3>A Temporary Dictatorship </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Here is Mably on this subject of the law and the legis=
lator.  In the passages preceding the one here quoted, Mably has supposed=
 the laws, due to a neglect of security, to be worn out.  He continues to=
 address the reader thusly: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"Under these circumstances, it is obvious that t=
he springs of government are slack.  Give them a new tension, and the evi=
l will be cured....  Think less of punishing faults, and more of rewardin=
g that which you need.  In this manner you will restore to your republic =
the vigor of youth.  Because free people have been ignorant of this proce=
dure, they have lost their liberty! But if the evil has made such headway=
 that ordinary governmental procedures are unable to cure it, then resort=
 to an extraordinary tribunal with considerable powers for a short time. =
 The imagination of the citizens needs to be struck a hard blow."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>In this manner, Mably continues through twenty volumes=
=2E =

<p align=3Djustify>Under the influence of teaching like this -- which ste=
ms from classical education -- there came a time when everyone wished to =
place himself above mankind in order to arrange, organize, and regulate i=
t in his own way.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialists Want Equality of Wealth </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Next let us examine Condillac on this subject of the l=
egislators and mankind: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"My Lord, assume the character of Lycurgus or of=
 Solon.  And before you finish reading this essay, amuse yourself by givi=
ng laws to some savages in America or Africa.  Confine these nomads to fi=
xed dwellings; teach them to tend flocks....  Attempt to develop the soci=
al consciousness that nature has planted in them....  Force them to begin=
 to practice the duties of humanity....  Use punishment to cause sensual =
pleasures to become distasteful to them.  Then you will see that every po=
int of your legislation will cause these savages to lose a vice and gain =
a virtue.  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>All people have had laws.  But few people have b=
een happy.  Why is this so? Because the legislators themselves have almos=
t always been ignorant of the purpose of society, which is the uniting of=
 families by a common interest.  </CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>Impartiality in law consists of two things:  the=
 establishing of equality in wealth and equality in dignity among the cit=

h and dignity -- and when the laws leave no hope of disturbing this equal=

<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Error of the Socialist Writers </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Actually, it is not strange that during the seventeent=
h and eighteenth centuries the human race was regarded as inert matter, r=
eady to receive everything -- form, face, energy, movement, life -- from =
a great prince or a great legislator or a great genius.  These centuries =
were nourished on the study of antiquity.  And antiquity presents everywh=
ere -- in Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome -- the spectacle of a few men moldi=
ng mankind according to their whims, thanks to the prestige of force and =
of fraud.  But this does not prove that this situation is desirable.  It =
proves only that since men and society are capable of improvement, it is =
naturally to be expected that error, ignorance, despotism, slavery, and s=
uperstition should be greatest towards the origins of history.  The write=
rs quoted above were not in error when they found ancient institutions to=
 be such, but they were in error when they offered them for the admiratio=
n and imitation of future generations.  Uncritical and childish conformis=
ts, they took for granted the grandeur, dignity, morality, and happiness =
of the artificial societies of the ancient world.  They did not understan=
d that knowledge appears and grows with the passage of time; and that in =
proportion to this growth of knowledge, might takes the side of right, an=
d society regains possession of itself.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>What Is Liberty? </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Actually, what is the political struggle that we witne=
ss? It is the instinctive struggle of all people toward liberty.  And wha=
t is this liberty, whose very name makes the heart beat faster and shakes=
 the world? Is it not the union of all liberties -- liberty of conscience=
, of education, of association, of the press, of travel, of labor, of tra=
de? In short, is not liberty the freedom of every person to make full use=
 of his faculties, so long as he does not harm other persons while doing =
so? Is not liberty the destruction of all despotism -- including, of cour=
se, legal despotism? Finally, is not liberty the restricting of the law o=
nly to its rational sphere of organizing the right of the individual to l=
awful self- defense; of punishing injustice?
<p align=3Djustify>It must be admitted that the tendency of the human rac=
e toward liberty is largely thwarted, especially in France.  This is grea=
tly due to a fatal desire -- learned from the teachings of antiquity -- t=
hat our writers on public affairs have in common:  They desire to set the=
mselves above mankind in order to arrange, organize, and regulate it acco=
rding to their fancy.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Philanthropic Tyranny </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>While society is struggling toward liberty, these famo=
us men who put themselves at its head are filled with the spirit of the s=
eventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  They think only of subjecting manki=
nd to the philanthropic tyranny of their own social inventions.  Like Rou=
sseau, they desire to force mankind docilely to bear this yoke of the pub=
lic welfare that they have dreamed up in their own imaginations. =

<p align=3Djustify>This was especially true in 1789.  No sooner was the o=
ld regime destroyed than society was subjected to still other artificial =
arrangements, always starting from the same point:  the omnipotence of th=
e law. =

<p align=3Djustify>Listen to the ideas of a few of the writers and politi=
cians during that period: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>SAINT-JUST:  "The legislator commands the future=
=2E  It is for him to will the good of mankind.  It is for him to make me=
n what he wills them to be."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>ROBESPIERRE:  "The function of government is to =
direct the physical and moral powers of the nation toward the end for whi=
ch the commonwealth has come into being."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>BILLAUD-VARENNES:  "A people who are to be retur=
ned to liberty must be formed anew.  A strong force and vigorous action a=
re necessary to destroy old prejudices, to change old customs, to correct=
 depraved affections, to restrict superfluous wants, and to destroy ingra=
ined vices....  Citizens, the inexible austerity of Lycurgus created the =
firm foundation of the Spartan republic.  The weak and trusting character=
 of Solon plunged Athens into slavery.  This parallel embraces the whole =
science of government."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><CITE>LE PELLETIER:  "Considering the extent of human =
degradation, I am convinced that it is necessary to effect a total regene=
ration and, if I may so express myself, of creating a new people."</CITE>=

<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Socialists Want Dictatorship </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Again, it is claimed that persons are nothing but raw =
material.  It is not for them to will their own improvement; they are inc=
apable of it.  According to Saint- Just, only the legislator is capable o=
f doing this.  Persons are merely to be what the legislator wills them to=
 be.  According to Robespierre, who copies Rousseau literally, the legisl=
ator begins by decreeing the end for which the commonwealth has come into=
 being.  Once this is determined, the government has only to direct the p=
hysical and moral forces of the nation toward that end.  Meanwhile, the i=
nhabitants of the nation are to remain completely passive.  And according=
 to the teachings of Billaud- Varennes, the people should have no prejudi=
ces, no affections, and no desires except those authorized by the legisla=
tor.  He even goes so far as to say that the inflexible austerity of one =
man is the foundation of a republic. =

<p align=3Djustify>In cases where the alleged evil is so great that ordin=
ary governmental procedures cannot cure it, Mably recommends a dictatorsh=
ip to promote virtue:  "Resort," he says, "to an extraordinary tribunal w=
ith considerable powers for a short time.  The imagination of the citizen=
s needs to be struck a hard blow." This doctrine has not been forgotten. =
 Listen to Robespierre: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"The principle of the republican government is v=
irtue, and the means required to establish virtue is terror.  In our coun=
try we desire to substitute morality for selfishness, honesty for honor, =
principles for customs, duties for manners, the empire of reason for the =
tyranny of fashion, contempt of vice for contempt of poverty, pride for i=
nsolence, greatness of soul for vanity, love of glory for love of money, =
good people for good companions, merit for intrigue, genius for wit, trut=
h for glitter, the charm of happiness for the boredom of pleasure, the gr=
eatness of man for the littleness of the great, a generous, strong, happy=
 people for a good-natured, frivolous, degraded people; in short, we desi=
re to substitute all the virtues and miracles of a republic for all the v=
ices and absurdities of a monarchy."</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Dictatorial Arrogance </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>At what a tremendous height above the rest of mankind =
does Robespierre here place himself! And note the arrogance with which he=
 speaks.  He is not content to pray for a great reawakening of the human =
spirit.  Nor does he expect such a result from a well-ordered government.=
  No, he himself will remake mankind, and by means of terror. =

<p align=3Djustify>This mass of rotten and contradictory statements is ex=
tracted from a discourse by Robespierre in which he aims to explain the p=
rinciples of morality which ought to guide a revolutionary government.  N=
ote that Robespierre's request for dictatorship is not made merely for th=
e purpose of repelling a foreign invasion or putting down the opposing gr=
oups.  Rather he wants a dictatorship in order that he may use terror to =
force upon the country his own principles of morality.  He says that this=
 act is only to be a temporary measure preceding a new constitution.  But=
 in reality, he desires nothing short of using terror to extinguish from =
France selfishness, honor, customs, manners, fashion, vanity, love of mon=
ey, good companionship, intrigue, wit, sensuousness, and poverty.  Not un=
til he, Robespierre, shall have accomplished these miracles, as he so rig=
htly calls them, will he permit the law to reign again.<p align=3Djustify=
><CITE>"Ah, you miserable creatures! You who think that you are so great!=
 You who judge humanity to be so small! You who wish to reform everything=
! Why don't you reform yourselves? That task would be sufficient enough."=
</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Indirect Approach to Despotism </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Usually, however, these gentlemen -- the reformers, th=
e legislators, and the writers on public affairs -- do not desire to impo=
se direct despotism upon mankind.  Oh no, they are too moderate and phila=
nthropic for such direct action.  Instead, they turn to the law for this =
despotism, this absolutism, this omnipotence.  They desire only to make t=
he laws. =

<p align=3Djustify>To show the prevalence of this queer idea in France, I=
 would need to copy not only the entire works of Mably, Raynal, Rousseau,=
 and Fenelon -- plus long extracts from Bossuet and Montesquieu -- but al=
so the entire proceedings of the Convention.  I shall do no such thing; I=
 merely refer the reader to them.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Napoleon Wanted Passive Mankind </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>It is, of course, not at all surprising that this same=
 idea should have greatly appealed to Napoleon.  He embraced it ardently =
and used it with vigor.  Like a chemist, Napoleon considered all Europe t=
o be material for his experiments.  But, in due course, this material rea=
cted against him. =

<p align=3Djustify>At St.  Helena, Napoleon -- greatly disillusioned -- s=
eemed to recognize some initiative in mankind.  Recognizing this, he beca=
me less hostile to liberty.  Nevertheless, this did not prevent him from =
leaving this lesson to his son in his will:  "To govern is to increase an=
d spread morality, education, and happiness."
<p align=3Djustify>After all this, it is hardly necessary to quote the sa=
me opinions from Morelly, Babeuf, Owen, Saint-Simon, and Fourier.  Here a=
re, however, a few extracts from Louis Blanc's book on the organization o=
f labor:  "In our plan, society receives its momentum from power."
<p align=3Djustify>Now consider this:  The impulse behind this momentum i=
s to be supplied by the plan of Louis Blanc; his plan is to be forced upo=
n society; the society referred to is the human race.  Thus the human rac=
e is to receive its momentum from Louis Blanc. =

<p align=3Djustify>Now it will be said that the people are free to accept=
 or to reject this plan.  Admittedly, people are free to accept or to rej=
ect advice from whomever they wish.  But this is not the way in which Mr.=
 Louis Blanc understands the matter.  He expects that his plan will be le=
galized, and thus forcibly imposed upon the people by the power of the la=
w: =

<p align=3Djustify><CITE>"In our plan, the state has only to pass labor l=
aws (nothing else?) by means of which industrial progress can and must pr=
oceed in complete liberty.  The state merely places society on an incline=
 (that is all?).  Then society will slide down this incline by the mere f=
orce of things, and by the natural workings of the established mechanism.=
"</CITE>
<p align=3Djustify>But what is this incline that is indicated by Mr. Loui=
s Blanc? Does it not lead to an abyss? (No, it leads to happiness.) If th=
is is true, then why does not society go there of its own choice? (Becaus=
e society does not know what it wants; it must be propelled.) What is to =
propel it? (Power.) And who is to supply the impulse for this power? (Why=
, the inventor of the machine -- in this instance, Mr. Louis Blanc.)
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Vicious Circle of Socialism </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>We shall never escape from this circle:  the idea of p=
assive mankind, and the power of the law being used by a great man to pro=
pel the people. =

<p align=3Djustify>Once on this incline, will society enjoy some liberty?=
 (Certainly.) And what is liberty, Mr. Louis Blanc?
<p align=3Djustify>Once and for all, liberty is not only a mere granted r=
ight; it is also the power granted to a person to use and to develop his =
faculties under a reign of justice and under the protection of the law. =

<p align=3Djustify>And this is no pointless distinction; its meaning is d=
eep and its consequences are difficult to estimate.  For once it is agree=
d that a person, to be truly free, must have the power to use and develop=
 his faculties, then it follows that every person has a claim on society =
for such education as will permit him to develop himself.  It also follow=
s that every person has a claim on society for tools of production, witho=
ut which human activity cannot be fully effective.  Now by what action ca=
n society give to every person the necessary education and the necessary =
tools of production, if not by the action of the state?
<p align=3Djustify>Thus, again, liberty is power.  Of what does this powe=
r consist? (Of being educated and of being given the tools of production.=
) Who is to give the education and the tools of production? (Society, whi=
ch owes them to everyone.) By what action is society to give tools of pro=
duction to those who do not own them? (Why, by the action of the state.) =
And from whom will the state take them?
<p align=3Djustify>Let the reader answer that question.  Let him also not=
ice the direction in which this is taking us.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Doctrine of the Democrats </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The strange phenomenon of our times -- one which will =
probably astound our descendants -- is the doctrine based on this triple =
hypothesis:  the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, =
and the infallibility of the legislator.  These three ideas form the sacr=
ed symbol of those who proclaim themselves totally democratic. =

<p align=3Djustify>The advocates of this doctrine also profess to be soci=
al.  So far as they are democratic, they place unlimited faith in mankind=
=2E  But so far as they are social, they regard mankind as little better =
than mud.  Let us examine this contrast in greater detail. =

<p align=3Djustify>What is the attitude of the democrat when political ri=
ghts are under discussion? How does he regard the people when a legislato=
r is to be chosen? Ah, then it is claimed that the people have an instinc=
tive wisdom; they are gifted with the finest perception; their will is al=
ways right; the general will cannot err; voting cannot be too universal. =

<p align=3Djustify>When it is time to vote, apparently the voter is not t=
o be asked for any guarantee of his wisdom.  His will and capacity to cho=
ose wisely are taken for granted.  Can the people be mistaken? Are we not=
 living in an age of enlightenment? What! are the people always to be kep=
t on leashes? Have they not won their rights by great effort and sacrific=
e? Have they not given ample proof of their intelligence and wisdom? Are =
they not adults? Are they not capable of judging for themselves? Do they =
not know what is best for themselves? Is there a class or a man who would=
 be so bold as to set himself above the people, and judge and act for the=
m? No, no, the people are and should be free.  They desire to manage thei=
r own affairs, and they shall do so. =

<p align=3Djustify>But when the legislator is finally elected -- ah! then=
 indeed does the tone of his speech undergo a radical change.  The people=
 are returned to passiveness, inertness, and unconsciousness; the legisla=
tor enters into omnipotence.  Now it is for him to initiate, to direct, t=
o propel, and to organize.  Mankind has only to submit; the hour of despo=
tism has struck.  We now observe this fatal idea:  The people who, during=
 the election, were so wise, so moral, and so perfect, now have no tenden=
cies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downwar=
d into degradation.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Socialist Concept of Liberty </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>But ought not the people be given a little liberty?
<p align=3Djustify>But Mr. Considerant has assured us that liberty leads =
inevitably to monopoly!
<p align=3Djustify>We understand that liberty means competition.  But acc=
ording to Mr. Louis Blanc, competition is a system that ruins the busines=
smen and exterminates the people.  It is for this reason that free people=
 are ruined and exterminated in proportion to their degree of freedom.  (=
Possibly Mr. Louis Blanc should observe the results of competition in, fo=
r example, Switzerland, Holland, England, and the United States.)
<p align=3Djustify>Mr. Louis Blanc also tells us that competition leads t=
o monopoly.  And by the same reasoning, he thus informs us that low price=
s lead to high prices; that competition drives production to destructive =
activity; that competition drains away the sources of purchasing power; t=
hat competition forces an increase in production while, at the same time,=
 it forces a decrease in consumption.  From this, it follows that free pe=
ople produce for the sake of not consuming; that liberty means oppression=
 and madness among the people; and that Mr. Louis Blanc absolutely must a=
ttend to it.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Socialists Fear All Liberties </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Well, what liberty should the legislators permit peopl=
e to have? Liberty of conscience? (But if this were permitted, we would s=
ee the people taking this opportunity to become atheists.)
<p align=3Djustify>Then liberty of education? (But parents would pay prof=
essors to teach their children immorality and falsehoods; besides, accord=
ing to Mr. Thiers, if education were left to national liberty, it would c=
ease to be national, and we would be teaching our children the ideas of t=
he Turks or Hindus; whereas, thanks to this legal despotism over educatio=
n, our children now have the good fortune to be taught the noble ideas of=
 the Romans.)
<p align=3Djustify>Then liberty of labor? (But that would mean competitio=
n which, in turn, leaves production unconsumed, ruins businessmen, and ex=
terminates the people.)
<p align=3Djustify>Perhaps liberty of trade? (But everyone knows -- and t=
he advocates of protective tariffs have proved over and over again -- tha=
t freedom of trade ruins every person who engages in it, and that it is n=
ecessary to suppress freedom of trade in order to prosper.)
<p align=3Djustify>Possibly then, liberty of association? (But, according=
 to socialist doctrine, true liberty and voluntary association are in con=
tradiction to each other, and the purpose of the socialists is to suppres=
s liberty of association precisely in order to force people to associate =
together in true liberty.)
<p align=3Djustify>Clearly then, the conscience of the social democrats c=
annot permit persons to have any liberty because they believe that the na=
ture of mankind tends always toward every kind of degradation and disaste=
r.  Thus, of course, the legislators must make plans for the people in or=
der to save them from themselves. =

<p align=3Djustify>This line of reasoning brings us to a challenging ques=
tion:  If people are as incapable, as immoral, and as ignorant as the pol=
iticians indicate, then why is the right of these same people to vote def=
ended with such passionate insistence?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Superman Idea </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The claims of these organizers of humanity raise anoth=
er question which I have often asked them and which, so far as I know, th=
ey have never answered:  If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad =
that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the tende=
ncies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and the=
ir appointed agents also belong to the human race? Or do they believe tha=
t they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind? The =
organizers maintain that society, when left undirected, rushes headlong t=
o its inevitable destruction because the instincts of the people are so p=
erverse.  The legislators claim to stop this suicidal course and to give =
it a saner direction.  Apparently, then, the legislators and the organize=
rs have received from Heaven an intelligence and virtue that place them b=
eyond and above mankind; if so, let them show their titles to this superi=
ority. =

<p align=3Djustify>They would be the shepherds over us, their sheep.  Cer=
tainly such an arrangement presupposes that they are naturally superior t=
o the rest of us.  And certainly we are fully justified in demanding from=
 the legislators and organizers proof of this natural superiority.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Socialists Reject Free Choice </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Please understand that I do not dispute their right to=
 invent social combinations, to advertise them, to advocate them, and to =
try them upon themselves, at their own expense and risk.  But I do disput=
e their right to impose these plans upon us by law -- by force -- and to =
compel us to pay for them with our taxes. =

<p align=3Djustify>I do not insist that the supporters of these various s=
ocial schools of thought--the Proudhonists, the Cabetists, the Fourierist=
s, the Universitarists, and the Protectionists -- renounce their various =
ideas.  I insist only that they renounce this one idea that they have in =
common:  They need only to give up the idea of forcing us to acquiesce to=
 their groups and series, their socialized projects, their free- credit b=
anks, their Graeco-Roman concept of morality, and their commercial regula=
tions.  I ask only that we be permitted to decide upon these plans for ou=
rselves; that we not be forced to accept them, directly or indirectly, if=
 we find them to be contrary to our best interests or repugnant to our co=
nsciences. =

<p align=3Djustify>But these organizers desire access to the tax funds an=
d to the power of the law in order to carry out their plans.  In addition=
 to being oppressive and unjust, this desire also implies the fatal suppo=
sition that the organizer is infallible and mankind is incompetent.  But,=
 again, if persons are incompetent to judge for themselves, then why all =
this talk about universal suffrage?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Cause of French Revolutions </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>This contradiction in ideas is, unfortunately but logi=
cally, reflected in events in France.  For example, Frenchmen have led al=
l other Europeans in obtaining their rights -- or, more accurately, their=
 political demands.  Yet this fact has in no respect prevented us from be=
coming the most governed, the most regulated, the most imposed upon, the =
most harnessed, and the most exploited people in Europe.  France also lea=
ds all other nations as the one where revolutions are constantly to be an=
ticipated.  And under the circumstances, it is quite natural that this sh=
ould be the case. =

<p align=3Djustify>And this will remain the case so long as our politicia=
ns continue to accept this idea that has been so well expressed by Mr. Lo=
uis Blanc:  "Society receives its momentum from power." This will remain =
the case so long as human beings with feelings continue to remain passive=
; so long as they consider themselves incapable of bettering their prospe=
rity and happiness by their own intelligence and their own energy; so lon=
g as they expect everything from the law; in short, so long as they imagi=
ne that their relationship to the state is the same as that of the sheep =
to the shepherd.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Enormous Power of Government </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>As long as these ideas prevail, it is clear that the r=
esponsibility of government is enormous.  Good fortune and bad fortune, w=
ealth and destitution, equality and inequality, virtue and vice -- all th=
en depend upon political administration.  It is burdened with everything,=
 it undertakes everything, it does everything; therefore it is responsibl=
e for everything. =

<p align=3Djustify>If we are fortunate, then government has a claim to ou=
r gratitude; but if we are unfortunate, then government must bear the bla=
me.  For are not our persons and property now at the disposal of governme=
nt? Is not the law omnipotent?
<p align=3Djustify>In creating a monopoly of education, the government mu=
st answer to the hopes of the fathers of families who have thus been depr=
ived of their liberty; and if these hopes are shattered, whose fault is i=
t?
<p align=3Djustify>In regulating industry, the government has contracted =
to make it prosper; otherwise it is absurd to deprive industry of its lib=
erty.  And if industry now suffers, whose fault is it?
<p align=3Djustify>In meddling with the balance of trade by playing with =
tariffs, the government thereby contracts to make trade prosper; and if t=
his results in destruction instead of prosperity, whose fault is it?
<p align=3Djustify>In giving protection instead of liberty to the industr=
ies for defense, the government has contracted to make them profitable; a=
nd if they become a burden to the taxpayers, whose fault is it?
<p align=3Djustify>Thus there is not a grievance in the nation for which =
the government does not voluntarily make itself responsible.  Is it surpr=
ising, then, that every failure increases the threat of another revolutio=
n in France?
<p align=3Djustify>And what remedy is proposed for this? To extend indefi=
nitely the domain of the law; that is, the responsibility of government. =

<p align=3Djustify>But if the government undertakes to control and to rai=
se wages, and cannot do it; if the government undertakes to care for all =
who may be in want, and cannot do it; if the government undertakes to sup=
port all unemployed workers, and cannot do it; if the government undertak=
es to lend interest- free money to all borrowers, and cannot do it; if, i=
n these words that we regret to say escaped from the pen of Mr. de Lamart=
ine, "The state considers that its purpose is to enlighten, to develop, t=
o enlarge, to strengthen, to spiritualize, and to sanctify the soul of th=
e people" -- and if the government cannot do all of these things, what th=
en? Is it not certain that after every government failure -- which, alas!=
 is more than probable -- there will be an equally inevitable revolution?=

<p align=3Djustify><H3>Politics and Economics </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>A science of economics must be developed before a scie=
nce of politics can be logically formulated.  Essentially, economics is t=
he science of determining whether the interests of human beings are harmo=
nious or antagonistic.  This must be known before a science of politics c=
an be formulated to determine the proper functions of government. =

<p align=3Djustify>Immediately following the development of a science of =
economics, and at the very beginning of the formulation of a science of p=
olitics, this all-important question must be answered:  What is law? What=
 ought it to be? What is its scope; its limits? Logically, at what point =
do the just powers of the legislator stop?
<p align=3Djustify>I do not hesitate to answer:  Law is the common force =
organized to act as an obstacle to injustice.  In short, law is justice.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Proper Legislative Functions </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>It is not true that the legislator has absolute power =
over our persons and property.  The existence of persons and property pre=
ceded the existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guaran=
tee their safety. =

<p align=3Djustify>It is not true that the function of law is to regulate=
 our consciences, our ideas, our wills, our education, our opinions, our =
work, our trade, our talents, or our pleasures.  The function of law is t=
o protect the free exercise of these rights, and to prevent any person fr=
om interfering with the free exercise of these same rights by any other p=
erson. =

<p align=3Djustify>Since law necessarily requires the support of force, i=
ts lawful domain is only in the areas where the use of force is necessary=
=2E  This is justice. =

<p align=3Djustify>Every individual has the right to use force for lawful=
 self- defense.  It is for this reason that the collective force -- which=
 is only the organized combination of the individual forces -- may lawful=
ly be used for the same purpose; and it cannot be used legitimately for a=
ny other purpose. =

<p align=3Djustify>Law is solely the organization of the individual right=
 of self-defense which existed before law was formalized.  Law is justice=
=2E
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Law and Charity Are Not the Same </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>The mission of the law is not to oppress persons and p=
lunder them of their property, even though the law may be acting in a phi=
lanthropic spirit.  Its mission is to protect persons and property. =

<p align=3Djustify>Furthermore, it must not be said that the law may be p=
hilanthropic if, in the process, it refrains from oppressing persons and =
plundering them of their property; this would be a contradiction.  The la=
w cannot avoid having an effect upon persons and property; and if the law=
 acts in any manner except to protect them, its actions then necessarily =
violate the liberty of persons and their right to own property. =

<p align=3Djustify>The law is justice -- simple and clear, precise and bo=
unded.  Every eye can see it, and every mind can grasp it; for justice is=
 measurable, immutable, and unchangeable.  Justice is neither more than t=
his nor less than this. =

<p align=3Djustify>If you exceed this proper limit -- if you attempt to m=
ake the law religious, fraternal, equalizing, philanthropic, industrial, =
literary, or artistic -- you will then be lost in an uncharted territory,=
 in vagueness and uncertainty, in a forced utopia or, even worse, in a mu=
ltitude of utopias, each striving to seize the law and impose it upon you=
=2E  This is true because fraternity and philanthropy, unlike justice, do=
 not have precise limits.  Once started, where will you stop? And where w=
ill the law stop itself?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The High Road to Communism </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Mr. de Saint-Cricq would extend his philanthropy only =
to some of the industrial groups; he would demand that the law control th=
e consumers to benefit the producers. =

<p align=3Djustify>Mr. Considerant would sponsor the cause of the labor g=
roups; he would use the law to secure for them a guaranteed minimum of cl=
othing, housing, food, and all other necessities of life. =

<p align=3Djustify>Mr. Louis Blanc would say -- and with reason -- that t=
hese minimum guarantees are merely the beginning of complete fraternity; =
he would say that the law should give tools of production and free educat=
ion to all working people. =

<p align=3Djustify>Another person would observe that this arrangement wou=
ld still leave room for inequality; he would claim that the law should gi=
ve to everyone -- even in the most inaccessible hamlet--luxury, literatur=
e, and art. =

<p align=3Djustify>All of these proposals are the high road to communism;=
 legislation will then be -- in fact, it already is -- the battlefield fo=
r the fantasies and greed of everyone.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Basis for Stable Government </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Law is justice.  In this proposition a simple and endu=
ring government can be conceived.  And I defy anyone to say how even the =
thought of revolution, of insurrection, of the slightest uprising could a=
rise against a government whose organized force was confined only to supp=
ressing injustice. =

<p align=3Djustify>Under such a regime, there would be the most prosperit=
y -- and it would be the most equally distributed.  As for the sufferings=
 that are inseparable from humanity, no one would even think of accusing =
the government for them.  This is true because, if the force of governmen=
t were limited to suppressing injustice, then government would be as inno=
cent of these sufferings as it is now innocent of changes in the temperat=
ure. =

<p align=3Djustify>As proof of this statement, consider this question:  H=
ave the people ever been known to rise against the Court of Appeals, or m=
ob a Justice of the Peace, in order to get higher wages, free credit, too=
ls of production, favorable tariffs, or government-created jobs? Everyone=
 knows perfectly well that such matters are not within the jurisdiction o=
f the Court of Appeals or a Justice of the Peace.  And if government were=
 limited to its proper functions, everyone would soon learn that these ma=
tters are not within the jurisdiction of the law itself. =

<p align=3Djustify>But make the laws upon the principle of fraternity -- =
proclaim that all good, and all bad, stem from the law; that the law is r=
esponsible for all individual misfortunes and all social inequalities -- =
then the door is open to an endless succession of complaints, irritations=
, troubles, and revolutions.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Justice Means Equal Rights </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Law is justice.  And it would indeed be strange if law=
 could properly be anything else! Is not justice right? Are not rights eq=
ual? By what right does the law force me to conform to the social plans o=
f Mr. Mimerel, Mr. de Melun, Mr. Thiers, or Mr. Louis Blanc? If the law h=
as a moral right to do this, why does it not, then, force these gentlemen=
 to submit to my plans? Is it logical to suppose that nature has not give=
n me sufficient imagination to dream up a utopia also? Should the law cho=
ose one fantasy among many, and put the organized force of government at =
its service only?
<p align=3Djustify>Law is justice.  And let it not be said -- as it conti=
nually is said -- that under this concept, the law would be atheistic, in=
dividualistic, and heartless; that it would make mankind in its own image=
=2E  This is an absurd conclusion, worthy only of those worshippers of go=
vernment who believe that the law is mankind. =

<p align=3Djustify>Nonsense! Do those worshippers of government believe t=
hat free persons will cease to act? Does it follow that if we receive no =
energy from the law, we shall receive no energy at all? Does it follow th=
at if the law is restricted to the function of protecting the free use of=
 our faculties, we will be unable to use our faculties? Suppose that the =
law does not force us to follow certain forms of religion, or systems of =
association, or methods of education, or regulations of labor, or regulat=
ions of trade, or plans for charity; does it then follow that we shall ea=
gerly plunge into atheism, hermitary, ignorance, misery, and greed? If we=
 are free, does it follow that we shall no longer recognize the power and=
 goodness of God? Does it follow that we shall then cease to associate wi=
th each other, to help each other, to love and succor our unfortunate bro=
thers, to study the secrets of nature, and to strive to improve ourselves=
 to the best of our abilities?
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Path to Dignity and Progress </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>Law is justice.  And it is under the law of justice --=
 under the reign of right; under the influence of liberty, safety, stabil=
ity, and responsibility -- that every person will attain his real worth a=
nd the true dignity of his being.  It is only under this law of justice t=
hat mankind will achieve -- slowly, no doubt, but certainly -- God's desi=
gn for the orderly and peaceful progress of humanity. =

<p align=3Djustify>It seems to me that this is theoretically right, for w=
hatever the question under discussion -- whether religious, philosophical=
, political, or economic; whether it concerns prosperity, morality, equal=
ity, right, justice, progress, responsibility, cooperation, property, lab=
or, trade, capital, wages, taxes, population, finance, or government -- a=
t whatever point on the scientific horizon I begin my researches, I invar=
iably reach this one conclusion:  The solution to the problems of human r=
elationships is to be found in liberty.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Proof of an Idea </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>And does not experience prove this? Look at the entire=
 world.  Which countries contain the most peaceful, the most moral, and t=
he happiest people? Those people are found in the countries where the law=
 least interferes with private affairs; where government is least felt; w=
here the individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest=
 influence; where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where ta=
xes are lightest and most nearly equal, and popular discontent the least =
excited and the least justifiable; where individuals and groups most acti=
vely assume their responsibilities, and, consequently, where the morals o=
f admittedly imperfect human beings are constantly improving; where trade=
, assemblies, and associations are the least restricted; where labor, cap=
ital, and populations suffer the fewest forced displacements; where manki=
nd most nearly follows its own natural inclinations; where the inventions=
 of men are most nearly in harmony with the laws of God; in short, the ha=
ppiest, most moral, and most peaceful people are those who most nearly fo=
llow this principle:  Although mankind is not perfect, still, all hope re=
sts upon the free and voluntary actions of persons within the limits of r=
ight; law or force is to be used for nothing except the administration of=
 universal justice.
<p align=3Djustify><H3>The Desire to Rule over Others </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>This must be said:  There are too many "great" men in =
the world -- legislators, organizers, do-gooders, leaders of the people, =
fathers of nations, and so on, and so on.  Too many persons place themsel=
ves above mankind; they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, a=
nd ruling it.
<p align=3Djustify>Now someone will say:  "You yourself are doing this ve=
ry thing."
<p align=3Djustify>True.  But it must be admitted that I act in an entire=
ly different sense; if I have joined the ranks of the reformers, it is so=
lely for the purpose of persuading them to leave people alone.  I do not =
look upon people as Vancauson looked upon his automaton.  Rather, just as=
 the physiologist accepts the human body as it is, so do I accept people =
as they are.  I desire only to study and admire. =

<p align=3Djustify>My attitude toward all other persons is well illustrat=
ed by this story from a celebrated traveler:  He arrived one day in the m=
idst of a tribe of savages, where a child had just been born.  A crowd of=
 soothsayers, magicians, and quacks -- armed with rings, hooks, and cords=
 -- surrounded it.  One said:  "This child will never smell the perfume o=
f a peace-pipe unless I stretch his nostrils." Another said:  "He will ne=
ver be able to hear unless I draw his ear-lobes down to his shoulders." A=
 third said:  "He will never see the sunshine unless I slant his eyes." A=
nother said:  "He will never stand upright unless I bend his legs." A fif=
th said:  "He will never learn to think unless I flatten his skull."
<p align=3Djustify>"Stop," cried the traveler.  "What God does is well do=
ne.  Do not claim to know more than He.  God has given organs to this fra=
il creature; let them develop and grow strong by exercise, use, experienc=
e, and liberty."
<p align=3Djustify><H3>Let Us Now Try Liberty </H3>
<p align=3Djustify>God has given to men all that is necessary for them to=
 accomplish their destinies.  He has provided a social form as well as a =
human form.  And these social organs of persons are so constituted that t=
hey will develop themselves harmoniously in the clean air of liberty.  Aw=
ay, then, with quacks and organizers! Away with their rings, chains, hook=
s, and pincers! Away with their artificial systems! Away with the whims o=
f governmental administrators, their socialized projects, their centraliz=
ation, their tariffs, their government schools, their state religions, th=
eir free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their restrict=
ions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious moralizations!
<p align=3Djustify>And now that the legislators and do-gooders have so fu=
tilely inflicted so many systems upon society, may they finally end where=
 they should have begun:  May they reject all systems, and try liberty; f=
or liberty is an acknowledgment of faith in God and His works.
