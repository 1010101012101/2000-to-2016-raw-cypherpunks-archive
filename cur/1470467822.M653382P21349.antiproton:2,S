So it seems to me that information is in fact being transmitted. So I
can freely philosophize and hopythesize in science fantasy, soon to
become science fact :)

I consider that the wave function of the photon, although centred at the
"geometric center" of the photon, is in fact continuous, and for all
intents and purposes, affecting one point of the wave (say 40,000 km
away), affects the photon at the other end of that wave.

Next question, can they truly isolate the two entangled photonic wave
parts? (Not sure if the question makes sense.)
