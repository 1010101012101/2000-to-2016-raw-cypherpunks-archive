I actually read the whole thing.  Thanks for the effort.
I just want to focus in on one part for now.

Then how can the manufacturer sign the endorsement key?  That can't make
any sense - is a misprint maybe and they mean the private key?

What's the context of the "smoke test"?

So the spec allows for a one time write option - the manufacturer
MAY build a list of keys.  But they don't have to.

Yeah, that makes discussion difficult.  Obviously the spec is
flawed!!

Then anyone can create a TPM?  What does the manufacturer
know about the thing it created?  If they know the endorsement key
(since they put it in) they can compute the public key.  If they
don't know either key, then anyone can create TPM's and get them
certified!!

I guess I can't argue with that :-)

If the manufacturer signs the endorsement pubkey, how can they
not see it?  I think there must be a lot of confusion in the
spec about which key does what and where it is used.  That's a
different kind of flaw, but clearly the spec has a lot of problems.

Keep hacking at it guys.  Maybe the authors will re-write it
so it makes sense (or give up and toss the whole thing in
the trash).

Patience, persistence, truth,
