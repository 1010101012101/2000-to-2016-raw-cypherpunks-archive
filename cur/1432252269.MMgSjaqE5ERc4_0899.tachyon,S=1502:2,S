http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/zetapicts1.html has an amusing 
nastygram
from lawyers who threaten for even posting their threatening letter.  They
also whine about copyright violation for good measure.

Of course, in doing so, they make their actions newsworthy, as well
as making newsworthy the contested photos of a woman giving her fetus 
nicotine.
