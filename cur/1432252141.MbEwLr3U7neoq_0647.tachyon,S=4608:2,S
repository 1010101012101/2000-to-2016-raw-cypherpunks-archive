This issue has been discussed recently, in some newspaper articles. 
(Don't have a URL, as I was reading it casually, elsewhere.) It 
turned out that the government high-res photos were ideal for 
burglars to use to case properties for break-ins, to identify 
unsecured property in backyards, etc.

And it's not a function of government to snoop like this, the Supreme 
Court's rulings notwithstanding. Ironically, when private actors do 
things like this, one can count on various government types to rush 
in with denunciations and lawsuits.

Sort of the way the government cracks down on polluting vehicles 
while school districts and public bus agencies run the 
worst-polluting vehicles. Or the pension plans which Congress exempts 
itself from. Government always cracks own on others and exempts 
itself. Nothing surprising. We just shouldn't let it happen.
