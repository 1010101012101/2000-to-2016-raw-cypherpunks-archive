>From the perspective of the potential to create World War 3, Trump's
"America first" slogan is a contraction (if it were carried through in a
Trump presidency) of the hegemonic Exceptionalistan principle which
Clinton is a great promoter and enthusiastic supporter of (see below for a
summary).

And here's a sobering current economic anecdote: "Fully half of 25-year
old Americans live in their childhood rooms in their parents’ homes."

Some hard hitting truths in this article...


Cockroaches to Inherit the Earth?
http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/06/09/where-do-matters-stand-paul-craig-roberts/

"If you cannot wake up and escape The Matrix, your doom will bring the
doom of the planet."

Paul Craig Roberts

"Hillary is a person so crazed that she declared the president of Russia
to be 'the new Hitler'"”

On the eve of World War II the United States was still mired in the Great
Depression and found itself facing war on two fronts with Japan and
Germany. However bleak the outlook, it was nothing compared to the outlook
today.

Has anyone in Washington, the presstitute Western media, the EU, or NATO
ever considered the consequences of constant military and propaganda
provocations against Russia? Is there anyone in any responsible position
anywhere in the Western world who has enough sense to ask: “What if the
Russians believe us? What if we convince Russia that we are going to
attack her?”

The same can be asked about China.

The recklessness of the White House Fool and the media whores has gone far
beyond mere danger. What do the Russians think when they see that the
Democratic Party intends to elect Hillary Clinton president of the US?
Hillary is a person so crazed that she declared the president of Russia to
be “the new Hitler” and organized through her underling, neocon monster
Victoria Nuland, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of
Ukraine. Nuland installed Washington’s puppet government in a former
Russian province that until about 20 years ago was part of Russia for
centuries.

I would bet that this tells even the naive pro-western part of the Russian
government and population that the United States intends war with Russia.

Ever since Russia stood up to Obama over Syria, the Russians have been
experiencing hostile propaganda and military operations on their borders.
These provocations are justified by Washington and its NATO vassals as a
response to “Russian aggression.” Russian aggression consists of nothing
but obviously false assertions that Russia is about to invade the Baltics,
Poland, and Romania and recreate the Soviet Empire, the Eastern European
part of which, together with the former Russian provinces of Georgia and
Ukraine, now belong to the American Empire.

The Russians know that the propaganda about “Russian aggression” is a lie.
What is the purpose of the lie other than to prepare the Western peoples
for war with Russia?

There is no other explanation.

Even morons such as Obama, Merkel, Hollande, and Cameron should be capable
of understanding that it is extremely dangerous to convince a major
military power that you are going to attack. To simultaneously also
convince China doubles the danger.

Clearly, the West is incapable of producing leadership capable of
preserving life on earth.

What can be done when the entire West demonstrates a death wish for Planet
Earth?

Until the criminal regimes of Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, American
presidents from John F. Kennedy forward worked to reduce tensions with the
Soviets. Kennedy worked with Khrushchev to reduce tensions caused by US
missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba. President Nixon negotiated
SALT I (the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. President Carter negotiated SALT II, which was never
ratified by the US Senate but was observed by the executive branch.
President Reagan negotiated with Soviet leader Gorbachev the end of the
Cold War. President George H.W. Bush in exchange for Gorbachev’s agreement
to the reunification of Germany promised that NATO would not move one inch
to the East.

All of these achievements were thrown away by the neoconized Clinton,
George W. Bush, and Obama regimes, each a criminal regime on par with Nazi
Germany.

Today life on Planet Earth is far less secure than during the darkest days
of the Cold War. Whatever threat global warming poses, it is miniscule
compared to the threat of nuclear winter. If the evil that is concentrated
in Washington and its vassals perpetrates nuclear war, cockroaches will
inherit the earth.

I have been warning about the growing danger of a nuclear war resulting
from the arrogance, hubris, ignorance, and evil personified by Washington.
Recently, four knowledgable Russian-Americans spelled out the likely
consequences of trying to drive Russia to submission with war threats:

Don’t expect the brainwashed American population to have the moral
conscience and fortitude to prevent nuclear war or even the intelligence
to prevent their own vaporization. In a recent article in the Wall Street
Journal Scott Sagan and Benjamin Valentino report that 59% of the US
population support attacking Iran with nuclear weapons in the event that
Iran sank one US Navy ship:
http://www.wsj.com/articles/would-the-u-s-drop-the-bomb-again-1463682867

Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to approve attacking Iran
with nuclear weapons with 81% of Republicans approving nuclear war
compared to 47% of Democrats. Yet, the Democrats are behind Hillary who
would be the first to use nuclear weapons. After all, a feminized woman
has to prove how tough she is, just as Margaret Thatcher was “the Iron
Lady.”

Before it it too late for Americans and all of humanity, arrogant
Americans need to recall that “those who live by the sword, die by the
sword.”

The economic picture is equally dismal and unpromising. The latest payroll
jobs report was even more awful than reported. Hardly any new jobs were
created, but what largely escaped reporting is the fact that the economy
actually lost 59,000 full-time jobs.

Increasingly the US economy consists of part-time jobs that cannot support
an independent existence. Thus, more Americans age 19-34 live at home with
parents than independently with spouses or partners. Fully half of 25-year
old Americans live in their childhood rooms in their parents’ homes.

This is the “New Economy” that the filthy lying neoliberal economists
promised would be reward for the American work force giving up their
manufacturing and professional skill jobs to foreigners. What a monstrous
lie the neoliberal economists told so that corporate executives and
shareholders could put into their own pockets the living wage of the
American work force. These neoliberal economists, and, alas, libertarian
“free market” ones, have not been held accountable for their
impoverishment of the American work force deeply buried in debt with no
future prospects.

Those few Americans who have any awareness are beginning to realize that
the One Percent and the western governments that serve them are
re-establishing feudalism. The brilliant and learned economist, Michael
Hudson, has labeled our era the era of neo-feudalism.

He is correct. The majority of young Americans come out of university
heavily indebted, primed for debtor prison. When half of 25-year olds
cannot marry and form households, how can anyone believe that housing
sales and prices are rising except as a result of speculative investors
banking on rental income from a population that cannot even pay its
student loans.

The United States is the sickest place on earth. There is no public or
political discussion of any important issue or of the multiple crises that
confront America or the crises that America brings to the world.

The American people are so stupid and unaware that they are capable of
electing a criminal and a warmonger like Hillary president of the United
States and be proud of it.

These “tough” Americans are so frightened of hoax dangers, such as “Muslim
terrorists” and “Russian aggression” that they willingly sacrificed their
depleted pocketbooks, the Constitution of the United States—an act of
treason on the part of the American people who utterly failed their
responsibility to protect the Constitution—and their own liberty to a
universal police state that has all power over them.

It is extraordinary that once-proud, once-great European peoples look for
leadership from a country of moronic non-entities who have pissed away the
liberty, security, and prosperity that their Founding Fathers gave to
them.

Fellow Americans, if you care to avoid vaporization and, assuming we do
avoid it, live a life other than serfdom, you must wake up and realize
that your most deadly enemy is Washington, not the hoax of “Russian
aggression,” not the hoax of “Muslim terrorism,” not the hoax of “domestic
extremism,” not the hoax of welfare bankrupting America, not the hoax of
democracy voting away your wealth, which Wall Street and the corporations
have already stolen and stuck in their pockets.

If you cannot wake up and escape The Matrix, your doom will bring the doom
of the planet.
