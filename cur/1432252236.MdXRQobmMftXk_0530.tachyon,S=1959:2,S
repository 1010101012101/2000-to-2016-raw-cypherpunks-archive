"Security theatre" is perhaps as good, and fewer syllables besides.

"Fortress America" might be "Maginot-Asylum America" more precisely.

PS: what happens if your passport's chip doesn't work?   Do you get
sent back and the airline fined $10K?  Do you wait extra time while
the still-readable passport number indexes your record online?
How much extra time?  (Anyone have experience with domestic
eg traffic pigs discovering that your magstrip is corrupted?)

Are all chip biometrics encrypted with the same key?  How much does
that cost on BlackNet these days?    How much extra should our Seals
Flaps
and Documents dept charge?

Do you need an air quality management district permit to burn hostages?
