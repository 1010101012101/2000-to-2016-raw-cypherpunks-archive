  I assume it's unsealed, as it's posted on the DOJ website.

  Type the PDF URL in Google if for any reason that URL doesn't work.

  Haven't read it yet to make any comments, wanted to post the URL right away.

  The first thing that did strike me is that it took 1 year between the grand
  jury being sworn in (May 2006) and the indictment being filed in court
  (April 2007).
