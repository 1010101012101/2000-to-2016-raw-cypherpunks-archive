You miss out on the fact that, if Windows has, say, 90% of the
machines (disregarding differences between desktop/server/whatever),
the damage would, with your metric, be three times as large as the
cost you point at, which would affect a third of the machines (with
numbers higher than today, but still less that what they would be
with 90% of machines running MS).

Yes, you are right: when you don't put all your eggs in the same
basket, you have *more* risk to get crushed eggs. But, in return,
you have less risk of losing *all* your eggs. The point is to contain
worst case cost, at the expense of having more likely minimum cost.

Windows 2000 was only a few years ago too. Windows NT 3 and 4 were not
desktopo OSes, used only on servers. And I worked in a company that had
the misfortune of running an NT 3 server. Preemptive multitasking does
not imply stability, as this experience showed, though I won't claim our
experience was typical.
There was BeOS too, which could have been widely available save for MS
having the computer makers' ear (firmly grasped in an iron fist).

But you still have a fair point on this point, and I agree at varying
degrees with the rest of your points, except where you come back to:

For serial systems, not parallel ones. Encryption is a serial one.
Redundancy using different systems is not: you need to destroy all
branches to bring the system down (though I do not deny that you can
bring the quality of service down by bringing a node down, depending
on the degree of redundancy).
Of course, the above holds for a more or less homogeneous distribution
of the different (here) OSes. Otherwise, you have a connected graph of
monocultures, and the first argument applies.
