Well, kinda. Let's just say there's a sort of Platonic price floating around 
out there, and the activities of local politicalities can cause temporary 
displacements from that price. But, this displacement will of necessity 
cause short-term tensions and stresses until the displacement is resolved.

Arguably, any political attempt to fix the price--even the "correct" price, 
is like trying to stop a pendulum by tying it to another pendulum.

On the other hand, there are rare cases were political action (or the 
absence of it) impacts the short-term course of events. For instance, does 
it matter that Kodos brought us into Iraq but that Kang would not have? In 
the long run probably not but in the short run definitely. (Or at least if 
you were suckered into sending your kids to fight.)
