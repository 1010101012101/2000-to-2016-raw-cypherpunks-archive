WASHINGTON (Reuters) -
U.S.-led forces have warned
shippers to cooperate with
maritime searches for al Qaeda fighters fleeing Afghanistan
(news - web sites) by sea or risk being sunk, defense
officials said on Friday.

        The U.S. Fifth Fleet and coalition forces are monitoring
        commercial vessels in the North Arabian Sea, ``particularly
        those operating off the Pakistani coast'' in the hunt for
        Saudi-born extremist Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)
        and members of his al Qaeda network, as well as fighters of
        the collapsing Taliban militia that formerly ruled
        Afghanistan, a defense official said.

        ``Anyone suspected of assisting or transporting bin Laden
        and/or al Qaeda leadership should expect to be boarded and
        will risk the sinking or seizure of the vessel and will be
        detained and jailed,'' the defense official said.
