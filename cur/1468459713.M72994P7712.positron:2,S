Reduce the tax rate of "billionaires", and they will be much less motivated=

For some reason I can't seem to "operate" the graph. =C2=A0The picture zoom=

One of the reasons there are terms, "lying with statistics", is that people=
 cancarefully select the facts they choose to present, and exclude other re=
levant facts.
I would like to see, on these graphs, a representation of the size of gover=
nment atthe times involved: =C2=A0Put simply, I think of government as much=
 more the CAUSE=C2=A0of these problems, rather than the solution. =C2=A0
Another problem is that this data represents periods with a dramatic differ=
ence in America'sindustrial power: =C2=A0From 1945-1970+, America was a man=
ufacturer to the world: =C2=A0Europe had=C2=A0been bombed out, and nations =
such as Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, China, and=C2=A0India weren't=
 competeing with America. =C2=A0That effect was so extreme that in the 50's=

 the husband. =C2=A0How muchdoes this change, to today, affect the numbers =

I don't think nearly anybody anticipated the rapid fall of the "Iron=C2=A0C=

I have my doubts.=C2=A0 The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.=C2=A0 This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.
It's the old, "Just put a big enough defense on the top guy, and nobodycan =
get to him" objection to AP.
That's one reason why AP isn't limited, even in theory, to merely thetop-le=
vel people. =C2=A0What about second, third, fourth, and fifth level people?=
Their families? =C2=A0Their friends? =C2=A0It wouldn't take much to keep vi=
rtuallyanybody from wanting to work for a government. =C2=A0They would prob=
ablyhave to pay an increasingly large amount to accept the risk, money=C2=
=A0that it would be increasingly hard for government to collect.
The analysis for America is simple: =C2=A0The Feds collect $3 trillion in t=
axes peryear. =C2=A0Suppose each person who pays $1 in tax also pays 1 cent=
 for a fundto get rid of his oppressors, or $30 billion. =C2=A0 If a hit co=

Currently, "journalists" are seen as having very disproportionate power. =
=C2=A0Butwe've already seen that the situation is dramatically changed from=

If they didn't understand the whole picture, sure they might believe that. =
=C2=A0One difference is, "who makes the decisions as to who get killed?"If =
a long and bloody war (for example the war between Iraq and Iran in theearl=

This should have been studied and debated extensively 20 years ago. =C2=A0H=
owmany INTELLIGENT such debates eventually occurred about AP. =C2=A0(I'm=C2=
=A0not referring to CP list discussions, of course). =C2=A0I could probably=
 count themon one hand, or at most two hands.

Currently, this is true. =C2=A0The history of "courts", I believe, included=
 a kingmaking decisions about disputes of his people. =C2=A0Terminology suc=
h as a "court"=C2=A0("a King's Court"), "pleadings", "arguments" survived. =
=C2=A0 But soon enough I=C2=A0imagine that this got very boring and time-co=
nsuming for the King, sohe happily deligated this task to some trusted pers=
on, who eventually becamecalled a "judge".I use the term "court" to put thi=
s decision-making function in a familiar light.We think of a "court" as bei=
ng a physical location (a room), and people, setup to make decisions. =C2=
=A0One modern analog is "arbitration", and I could haveused that analogy. =
=C2=A0An AP-type system will ultimately replace not merely=C2=A0regional de=
fense, but also what we currently think of as "law enforcement"functions. =
=C2=A0But these will not necessarily be monopoly-operations.

> =C2=A0A Court whose sole function is to
>authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:
Maybe we will have to agree to disagree on this?
> Every=C2=A0sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its ca=
sus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble."
Effectively we entrust authority to do this to people chosen by vote, orapp=
ointed by these people, etc. =C2=A0Why not replace this with a different=C2=
=A0version of "wisdom of the masses"?

Doesn't surprise me at all. =C2=A0I've long known that Science Fiction has =
beenused as a way to test out new ideas, rhetorically, without having to pl=
