  You sure as hell are. This is the source of the power of the State: 
popular demand for its services. <<

Thanks for clearing that up.I thought it was the enormous militarized 
systems of oppression/repression.And theres a demand for ID's?I had no idea.

 >>AP all the politicians and bureaucrats, and it would be those like 
yourself who assert entitlement to government benefits who would be 
stumbling over each other to erect new politicians and bureaucrats in order 
to provide those services.<<

Actually Id be down to the selfmanaged metalstorm factory to work and 
studying flying part-time.(Im not supposed to fly a plane at the moment) 
Its nice someone else here believes in APster,thanks.

 >>AP all the self-righteous claimants to entitlements, like yourself, and 
the State would dry up and blow away.<<

True,jim seems to anticipate this with the car thieves scenario.No reason 
it couldn't apply to welfare Queens.The state needs to be shown that its 
powerless against APster.Im volunteering to die,just be careful that I'm 
really dead.Sandy Sandfort see's a way to rip off the APsters here.I think 
he should be APped.
