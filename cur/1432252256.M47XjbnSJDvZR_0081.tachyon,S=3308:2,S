actually, no it doesn't.  The real, working code has a configuration file which 
contains a list of all known addresses associated with the account.  That list 
of addresses is necessary because of people having virtual domain based 
addresses collecting all at 1 mailbox.

The code uses that list of valid addresses in the stamp validation process.

mailing lists are your "friend".  While I don't have the code in there yet, I 
expect I will need to pay attention to the -request form of addresses and white 
list both the -request form and the plain form for a while.  Ideally, the 
mailing lists would sign each message with its own private key and use the white 
list by public key filtering method client side.

while I know this is the cypherpunks list, but if you ever get tired of debating 
this to death and would like to write some real code, let me know.  ;-)
