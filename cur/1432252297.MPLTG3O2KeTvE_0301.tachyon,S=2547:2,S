The RSA Data Security conference will be held at the Moscone Center and the 
Metreon in San Francisco this year, April 8-12.

http://www.rsasecurity.com/conference/rsa2001/intro2.html

It's a really neat conference, but pricey. However, looking through the
registration web
pages, I found this:


>Student Scholarships

>Several corporations have kindly proposed to sponsor student
>registration fees; full-time students wishing to apply for a scholarship
>should contact RSA Security at
>rsa2001_scholarships@rsasecurity.com


I don't know how many are available, or what they include, but the regular
academic 
registration is $495.

Also, if you just want to attend the Expo (we have over 250 vendors
expected), you can get
a free pass if you register before March 2 (otherwise, $50 at door).
