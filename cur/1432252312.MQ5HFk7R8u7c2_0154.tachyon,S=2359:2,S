Although you probably do not know it, you are invoking the
rules of the peace of Westphalia.

The Soviet Union never respected the peace of Westphalia.
After the election of Ronald Reagan, neither did the US, and
the US has never resumed respecting it, so that stuff is
ancient history now.   National Sovereignty, like the divine
right of kings, just is not taken seriously any more, and the
only people weeping big salt tears about its passing are those
who enthusiastically hailed all the Soviet violations of it as
wars of national liberation.
