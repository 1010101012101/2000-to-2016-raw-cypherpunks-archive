Has anyone heard of an idea to use individual WiFi routers to communicate i=
n a mesh net? =C2=A0(Or, at least differently than it may have been done be=
fore.) =C2=A0 If you look at a map of WiFi routers (www.wigle.net) in any g=
iven area, you will see that the vast majority of routers are physically cl=
ose to many other routers, certainly close enough to communicate with each =
other, and ultimately over a long distance. =C2=A0A crowd-sourced communica=
tion system, one that wouldn't necessarily go through the Internet backbone=

"Wi-Fi Direct, initially called Wi-Fi P2P, is a=C2=A0Wi-Fi=C2=A0standard en=
