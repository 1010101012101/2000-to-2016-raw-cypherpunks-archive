My physics is fine.  I assume the reader can tell that I'm 
explaining the reason for using *individually lightweight flakes* 
separately from the trivial symmetric-reaction-mass part of the rifle.

After all, a reader would be asking themselves, why not just use
a slug of the same mass, or even some ball bearings (shot), since he 
indicates (by saying "equal mass") that this would work?

And I explain the safe dissipation of the flakes' *energy*, not momentum 
(which as you point out is what matters for the recoilless-ness) 
because the flakes dissipate their motion as *heat* via  
viscous drag through the atmosphere.

Picture yourself using one in cramped quarters.  The chaff 'flying off to
China'
is a practical concern.

Or read the book.  Plus, you can learn how to turn common household objects
into mortars.
