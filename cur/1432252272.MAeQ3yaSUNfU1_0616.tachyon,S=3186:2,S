this might benefit from a technique such as golay encoding or other ECC
(error recovery encoding as from the SIK1000 project)
https://github.com/tridge/SiK/blob/master/Firmware/radio/golay.c for
radio telemetry from drones..)   it seems ok on longer runs of bytes but
gets frequent errors on shorter runs


        gh
http://www.eccpage.com/ has most of the common ones
