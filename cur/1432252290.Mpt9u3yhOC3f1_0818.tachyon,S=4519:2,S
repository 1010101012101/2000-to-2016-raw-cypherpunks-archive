Logan to start express security program this summer
Participants register and pay yearly fee

By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff  |  January 20, 2006

Logan International Airport will implement a ''registered traveler"
program this summer that allows passengers who pass a screening check
and pay a yearly fee to use special express security lines.

Passengers will also have to submit fingerprints and eye scans to
qualify. Other key details of the program, including how much it will
cost and when it will start, are still being worked out.

To boost interest in the program, participants will probably get
benefits such as discounts on parking and dining at the airport,
according to Thomas J. Kinton Jr., director of aviation for the
Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan.

Logan was one of five US airports that conducted small-scale
registered-traveler program trials that ended in September. At Logan,
the program involved about 1,800 American Airlines frequent fliers.

Registered travelers show their boarding passes and get their
identities confirmed by a machine that checks either their iris or
index finger tip. They still have to go through metal detectors and
put their bags through X-ray scanners but often save several minutes
by avoiding security lines used by the general public that can get
crowded. And unless registered travelers set off a metal detector or
have a banned item in their carry-on luggage, they are also exempted
from so-called secondary screening patdowns by airport security
officials that involve a randomly selected percentage of all
travelers in general security lines.

Currently, among US airports only Orlando International Airport
offers a special registered traveler check-in, which has enrolled
13,000 people since June who pay $80 a year. Airports in
Indianapolis, Sacramento, Calif., and San Jose also plan to offer the
programs this summer.

People who get registered traveler cards from Massport will be able
to use them at all US airports that decide to offer the service,
Kinton said yesterday.
