Not entirely true.  Many socialist pursue a socialist economical party 
while adhering to democratic elective notions, I.E. Democratic Socialist
(used to be referred to as Troskietes)

Again not true.  The capitalist countries blandly overlooked the crimes of 
the Khmer Rouge and would have continued to do so if not for education and 
protest
by human rights activists (you would find a significant amount of socialist 
among activists).


>They worshipped the Sandinistas, while fiercely condemning Latin American 
>governments that were vastly less repressive.


Not true

You sure use a sweeping amount of those socialist blah blah blah statements.
You hang out with a lot of socialist?
