excerpt from http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/national/03POWD.html

The preliminary analysis of the powder
shows that it has the same extraordinarily high concentration of deadly
spores as the
anthrax produced in the American weapons program. While it is still
possible that the
anthrax could have a foreign source, the concentration is higher than
any stock publicly
known to be produced by other governments.

The similarity to the levels achieved by the United States military
lends support to the idea
that someone with ties to the old program may be behind the attacks that
have killed five
people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently expanded its
investigation of anthrax
suspects to include government and contractor laboratories as a possible
source of the
deadly powder itself, or of knowledge of how to make it.
