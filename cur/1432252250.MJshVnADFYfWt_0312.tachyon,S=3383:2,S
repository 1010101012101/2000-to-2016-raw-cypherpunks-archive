Agreed that John's "non-stop" doesn't sound anything like Tandem boxes
(which surely wouldn't be a secret code-wood anyway?)

They certainly used to run IBM 370 (a lot  heavier than Tandems both in
mass & power consumption!) in the air, probably to manage AWACS tape
filestore (I vaguely think they may even have used UCC1). That is unless
the US  & German airforce people I sometimes met on operating system
training courses back in the early 1980s  were *very* good at pulling
the wool over fellow-student's eyes.
