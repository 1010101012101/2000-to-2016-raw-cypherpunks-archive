Um, how do you know I wrote it without a snicker? ;)

Actually, I was referring to cable ducts which can act as a waveguide.
Of course, a fiber is rather thin, and it can be wrapped with adhesive
copper strips, so that it wouldn't be just a hole.

Renting time in HF testing facilities is expensive. Do you have
suggestions for a simple sniffer type of instrument, that detects the
amplitude of a radiated field? Do FETs pick up HF fine?

I intend to build me a wearable based on a LART type of board
	http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/

which will also house the crypto setup. Tempest proofing the rig will be
definitely part of the considerations. I see most problems with the
twiddler and the hud.
