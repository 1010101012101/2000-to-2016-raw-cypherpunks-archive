	Napster isn't a "market force", they produce no revenue, they 
make no money. Yet.

	I disagree with none of that, except that if an employee 
deliberately leaks a "Trade Secret" that they were bound by contract 
to keep, then the businesses bitch is with that employee.

	Wave a fist (even a small fist) of money in front of an 
Artist, and for the most part whatever brains they had in the first 
place disappear.

	Artists (musicians, writers, whatever) *sell* the rights to 
their work. It's their choice. Music labels then take the risk of 
packaging and distributing that music. Their choice.

	The "High" prices one pays for a CD make it possible for 
there to be a *lot* more artists work to be distributed (ok, it's 
often the "500 channels of shit on TV") since the profits from one 
artist will offset losses from a few others.
