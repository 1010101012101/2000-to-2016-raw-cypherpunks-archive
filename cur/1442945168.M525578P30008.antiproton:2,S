USG incompetence is hard to understand in these matters. I have no idea why
they fuck up like this, getting involved in a conflict, supporting a side
their are against to fight against the other side they are supposedly also
against, but always on paper, they will never go there be killed. So why
involve yourself in the first place other than to destroy what remains of
your reputations, what remains of your money and relevance? But it's
interesting nonetheless, to watch and see them fall, which they've been
invariably doing since Vietnam.
