The American people should remember that they pay taxes to their 
government, they elect their president, their government manufactures arms 
and gives them to Israel and Israel uses them to massacre Palestinians. The 
American Congress endorses all government measures and this proves that the 
entire America is responsible for the atrocities perpetrated against 
Muslims. The entire America, because they elect the Congress.
