Nyms are not as hard as most of you seem to assume.  Each instance 
of a nym's use is more data for traffic analysis, and writing styles 
contain "signature" usages that can identify particular writers 
with a high degree of probability.  

If the probability is ever deemed high enough that a search warrant 
can issue, and your nym is involved in all kinds of illicit deals 
which are verifiable through the reputation system, then  you have 
a problem because the lions are likely to come take your favorite 
toys away, and may even put you through a "trial" like the one that 
just happened to Mr. Bell.

Hmm.  A worthwhile hack; I should develop a program that uses the 
known techniques of identifying a writer by his/her style, and then 
create "styles" to conform to for each nym.  If I can fool my program, 
then there's at least a prayer of fooling other people's.
