I'm writing my article now, and you should check for it at Wired News 
tomorrow morning. In response to some queries, the highlights from today 
include:

* Both government & defense rested at about 3:30 pm today; Judge ordered 
jurors to be back at 9:30 Tues for closing arguments and deliberations.
* John Young and his companion did not show up on Monday, either to testify 
or as audience members.
* Jim Bell testified under oath that he stole mail from Jeff "not an agent" 
Gordon's mailbox and threw it in the trash at a nearby McDonald's.
* Bell accused his defense attorney of threatening his life.
* Judge Tanner refused, in considering jury instructions, to allow Bell to 
assert a First Amendment defense for any of his actions.

Details in Wired article tomorrow.
