I wrote to the author, he is planning some kind of editor which opens
in its own frame and is "outside" of webmail as iframe.

(see http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/13xhh9/finally_a_way_to_use_pgpgnupg_in_the_office/c78j3jk
- it's the author)

If he did that, it would be great.

Because really I stopped using classic mails in favor of
browser/webmail long time ago and this seems promising.
