Can we get a consensus that no one should be allowed to operate a
motor vehicle without proof of income, in the form of regular
payments to a privately owned casino?  And that this constraint
should be imposed by deadly force in the event that someone
persistently refuses to comply?

Now we have an "Affordable Care Act" that serves the sole purpose
of using State power to mandate payments to privately owned
casinos, again backed by deadly force in the event that someone
persistently refuses to play.

It's a matter of perspective.  A fear based world view that
imposes a constant 'need' for protection by ersatz parental
figures is the consensus reality in Amerika.  Should the State
service this need by violence or the threat of violence (same
thing actually) against those whose world view is not
predominantly fear based?  The victims of this grand deception
will of course say 'yes', as will the private backers of State
authority who realize massive profits guaranteed by the State.
