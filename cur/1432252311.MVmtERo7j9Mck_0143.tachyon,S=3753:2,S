So what they should do is fix those problems robustly.  Instead
they're using central control as a "fix".  They get to decide what is
abuse.  They probably don't appreciate the kinds of problems that can
arise from that (see my other comments about designer abuse and the
implied risks of assuming editorial control that some ISPs have faced
etc).

It's typically easier to design hierarchical or even single central
control systems than distributed systems.  DoS resistance is hard too.
The real solution to Distributed DoS is Distributed Service and
they're headed in the wrong direction with that.

Indeed.  They're probably relatively clue free also.  (Just downloaded
the tar ball to reverse engineer what they are actually doing).

The problem is central control not monitoring -- monitoring affects
privacy, central control affects free speech.

(It's in clear text already, and they're not proposing to do anything
about this -- and for the application -- public chat -- it's unclear
how well you can protect privacy -- any narcs can just join in the
discussion.)

So the low number of servers is bad for protecting free speech also.

Also on the plus side it's not that big a network to fork with a fork
keeping the old protocols, with robust distributed DoS fixes.  A
corrolorary of Lucky's comment that there's more demand for crypto
than people competent to do it -- there aren't enough crypto clueful
people to keep up with internet protocols and steer them in sensible
directions.
