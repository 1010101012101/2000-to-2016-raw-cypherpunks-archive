Reminds me of the first time I saw a guy with a "brick phone".
I'm in a bar eating a burger and drinking beer, and this guy sits
down one seat away from me, pulls out this huge cell phone, and
starts punching away.  10 seconds later he's saying "I'll be
late coming home, I have more work to do in the office".  Like she
can't here the background music!  Oh well, I was getting paid for
his air time :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
