Right, but the assumptions of the model are stated up front.

Whoa!  You have gone too far here.  The original assumptions
and the original model still hold, what changes are the
assumptions.  You get new models, but that doesn't mean
the old model doesn't work any more - it means you have to
be careful with assumptions.

We can be certain that we will learn more as time goes on.
Our present models work well for the assumptions we make
now, and as time goes on we'll learn how those assumptions
interfere with observations of how nature works.  How we
ask questions determines what kinds of answers we get -
so it's really important to understand the basic assumptions
behind any "law of physics".

Patience, persistence, truth,
