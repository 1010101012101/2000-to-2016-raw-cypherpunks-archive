No exit is really safe... some say pick an underdeveloped
clueless state, perhaps. But those states are fed from cables
that are monitored on the other end. As such, and since you
can do no better, your best bet is to limit your exposure by
picking an exit within the same jurisdiction as your target.
You might even get lucky if said state is externally paranoid
but does not care about its inside traffic.

Some people have a thing against Tor by default. That's probably
not a very useful idea. Tor is good at what it does well, such
as letting the average Jane surf out her irrelevant daily net life
in relative anonymity. Just don't try to put Tor to task for the
entire spectrum of what is possible without understanding what
isn't. For that, you need to read a lot about it. Just like any
other thing you might set up on your own.
