Rea||y Moving Lately.

More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its p|an to 
become a leading supplier of VoIP technology inc|uding the following 
milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Persona| Gateway from any ce|lular or |andline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,0OO 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|oba| sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
