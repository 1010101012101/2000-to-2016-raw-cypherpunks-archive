Well, provide any funds, at all, at least, then.

Glad we can agree here.

I would argue "that's not an easy answer". Depends on many variables, a=
nd=20
boils down to: are we hacking the system to have our way, or are we bei=
ng co-
opted by the system. It's never black or white, so it depends on a give=
n=20
situation.

And yet he helped arm the Black Panthers.

Of course.

Of course. Does it follow that the state necessarily will succeed in co=
=2Dopting=20
such projects? I would argue "no". The outcome is not so clear, and I d=
o find=20
the fact that these projects *are* funded and can continue to deliver t=
he=20
great tools they do deliver a rather positive one.

Until I see evidence of co-option (like backdoors in code or binaries, =
etc), I=20
will continue to be cautiously optimistic here.

The question is not if the state can use such a tactic, but if those pr=
ojects=20
will bow down to such a tactic. Again, until I see such a situation, I =
will=20
consider such funding an option, as long as there are no otehr options.=


I prefer good FLOSS that is funded by the state money than no FLOSS at =
all.

I'm sure you, my friend, have a steady cashflow that is in no way conne=
cted to=20
blood money, and I congratulate you on that. Not all of us are so fortu=
nate.=20
As long as these privacy activists do not bow down and bend over -- and=
 I have=20
not seen evidence of that as far as several projects discussed on this =
list=20
are concerned -- I don't see a huge problem.

It *would* be better to have them funded in some other way, but it's st=
ill=20
better to have them funded at all.

Cool. So let me ask you this: if you can either have (in large part) go=

funded FLOSS privacy-protecting projects, or next to none of such proje=

what do you choose?

=2D-=20
