Identi.ca is great in that it's open source, and uses open protocols like 
OpenMicroBlogging and XMPP - so anyone can make a service based on this 
code, or add identi.ca support to client code. But it's a client server 
setup - a central server recieves and processes the messages. You can also 
set up lots of servers, and maybe federate them together somehow, but it's 
still client/server based, not p2p. So yes it's more decentralised than 
twitter, but tahrir is a bit further along the way.

It's encrypted, anonymous, and p2p based. More detail here:  
https://github.com/sanity/tahrir/wiki/Overview

The benefits of tahrir over services like identi.ca would be that it  
avoids being shut down or censored in the way that twitter or identi.ca  
could be - or simply from problems on the server end - as identi.ca is  
suffering from now! http://status.net/2011/12/20/identi-ca-down

Also it's hard for prying governments and groups to find out who you are  
if you want to conceal your identity.

Tahrir is more like freenet - but for short bursts of text that degrade in 
utility as they get older, rather than for larger slightly more permanent 
data as freenet does now. As for using Java, I did initially think Tahrir 
was going to be rewritten in Swarm (  
http://blog.locut.us/2008/10/07/swarm-a-true-distributed-programming-language/ 
)- I asked Ian if that was why he'd not been updating the code so much  
recently. But no, I'm not sure why he picked Java other than that he knows 
the language well.

Hope that helps!

Ale
