sure, it was discussed multiple times on i2p forums:
http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?p=13603#13603
http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2547
http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2381

(the same could be done with tor and freenet, iirc
but you don't have tahoe over those, and even if
freenet is able to store content, it's fixed to
k=1 h=3 s=3 speaking in tahoe-lafs language, and
you don't really have a way to repair/check the
shares if not by redownloading the entire content
over time, it's more like a big cache... but
differences between tahoe and freenet were already
discussed by zooko in another post)
