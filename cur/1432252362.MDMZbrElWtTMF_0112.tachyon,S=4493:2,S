Sure.  And I'm glad you work with a small group of people who
understand that you don't read their documents.  After many years of
refusal, I finally gave up.  I work with lots of customers who expect
documents in MS formats, and look at you askance for giving them
anything else.  You only get so many explanations before customers go
elsewhere, and I chose not to spend them on this.  Similarly, I could
choose to speak to everyone I meet in, say, Russian.  And some folks
would understand.  Others would walk away.  So, you can argue that
you're effectively required to speak English to do business in North
America.  I would argue that you're similarly required to use MS
Office.

You'll be part of the problem when Nogsuccob is apon us, because the
documents you create won't be readable in OpenOffice, and Crossover
won't run.

Office Nogsuccob will only interoperate with itself.  Companies will end
up deploying it to interact with other versions, not for any real
feature.

You don't like the word force, I suggest quitting all use of .DOC,
.PPT, and .XLS formats.  Please educate the world on how much better
the alternatives are.  Me, I'll pay my $200 to not bother today, and
regret it tomorrow.

And by the way, do you have a driver's license, or other state-issued
ID card?

Adam
