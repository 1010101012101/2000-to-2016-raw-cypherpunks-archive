>Major Networks Refuse Front Sight's ARM PILOTS Commercial
>
>Las Vegas, Nevada: Major media networks have refused to air
>a 60 second commercial calling for President Bush, the FAA,
>and the airlines to arm commercial pilots.  The commercial,
>to run on prime time slots was produced and sponsored by
>Front Sight Founder's Society.
>
>Front Sight Firearm Training Institute's Founder and
>Director, Dr. Ignatius Piazza was surprised that major
>networks refused to air a commercial in which Front Sight
>encourages Americans to contact President Bush, the FAA, and
>the airlines to demand that our commercial pilots be armed.
>In the commercial Front Sight also offers to immediately
>train all commercial pilots and co-pilots FREE OF CHARGE
>that are authorized to carry a gun to defend the cockpit
>against terrorists.
>
>Piazza states, "It is unfortunate that the major networks
>would not air our 60 second commercials aimed at spreading
>the truth that the only solution to forever preventing
>another World Trade Center attack is to give pilots the
>ability and authority to defend the cockpit with a gun.
>Front Sight's solution is simple, efficient, effective and
>will not cost the taxpayers, air passengers, or airlines a
>dime. Our commercial demonstrated how easy and safe it is to
>stop cold a terrorist attempting to invade the doorway of
>the cockpit or take a hostage. Front Sight has the absolute
>solution. We are willing to provide our gift of up to 150
>million dollars in training free of charge and Front Sight
>Founder's Society is spending hundreds of thousands of
>dollars to spread the truth of our solution."
>
>To view the commercial that major media networks refused to
>air visit Front Sight's web site at
>http://www.frontsight.com/gun_school_for_pilots_complete.htm
>and support Front Sight's efforts to arm and train our
>commercial pilots by joining Front Sight Founder's Society.
>
>Front Sight Founder's Society is now producing a new 60
>second commercial to be ready by next week.  Says Piazza,
>"The next commercial, unfortunately must be more politically
>correct to get it aired, but will have the same message to
>arm our pilots and take back control of the skies.  Watch
>for it and support Front Sight's Founder's Society."
