I believe you, Peter, are fairly new to the list. At least I have only 
been seeing a lot of posts from you recently.

So, you being new, you apparently don't know that Jim Choate is a 
visitor from Choate Prime, a reality which is parallel to our own but 
"different" in many strange, but ultimately boring, ways.

In Choate Prime, the laws of physics are quite different from our own.

In Choate Prime, the prime numbers (the so-called Choate Prime primes, 
or CPPs) have substantially different properties than they have in our 
world. Mathematics and logic are generally quite different in Choate 
Prime than here on Earth.

In Choate Prime, naturally, history and law are substantially different 
from what we here on Earth see.

Many of us have found various ways to disconnect the signals coming in 
from Choate Prime. We see his signals only in the replies of others who 
have not yet realized what kind of weird place Choate Prime is.
