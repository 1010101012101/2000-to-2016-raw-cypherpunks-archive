Does this mean inbound to lne.com or to the backbone? It seems unclear.
In other words you will filter inbound mail that isn't a subscriber to
your node list? How will this be applied to mail on the backbone from
other nodes?

???? Man, you're dropping a lot of real traffic then. I'd say that I go
through a couple hundred a day and there are about 15-20 posts a day. Of
course there are days when there are almost zero non-spam mail.

So, if it's not PGP signed (ie has the appropriate ASCII string in it) and
it comes from somebody who isn't on your subscriber list then it's headed
for the bit bucket?

So this means no anonymous email through lne.com then? Pity.

I"m still not clear on how you're going to filter the backbone traffic.

I'd certainly like to put them on the SSZ CDR page for reference.

I'll move lne.com from 'non-moderated' to 'moderated' then?

Thanks for the explanation and heads up.
