&gt; follows<br>
&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s real? I think I walked into a language barrier.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Having in mind Snowden likely have large pile of slides, if =
he got<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; owned, likely all/the majority of them would likely be fake.=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this plausible?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Not necessarily, that&#39;s not how disinfo works a lot of the ti=
me.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And did you missed the us-natsec trolling about the eu appearing =

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; No, there just wasn&#39;t much to respond to.<br>
