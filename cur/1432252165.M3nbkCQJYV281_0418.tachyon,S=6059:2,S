	Well, that's their story, which I don't find too plausible.

	Regardless, even if karpeles and friends didn't steal the coins
themselves, other people did, thanks to mtgox's incompetence. The problem
here is not a 'bank run' in the ordinary sense, it's just theft.

	If the bank left the vault's door open, then there's something
fundamentally wrong with the bank, or there's some other funny business
going on. 

	Banks don't need 'regulators' telling them to keep their vaults closed...

	And in the long term they will be out of business. 

	Although that's not the whole picture. In this case, a different  problem
is that people are using a *centralized* exchange as a bank to keep their
supposedly *decentralized* e-money. 

	And that seems to be a trend. Seems to me that a lot of computer
illiterate people store their btc in online centralized wallets that have
access to the private keys?

	How could I have missed that? Government regulation is something created
by honest politicians taking into account the best interests of their
subjects =)
