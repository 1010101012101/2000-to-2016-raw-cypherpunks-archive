Well, one argument I'd bet had been ridden and will continue to ride under
Obama is that there is no eavesdropping unless a human actually listens in.

In other words, given that there's a giant vacuum cleaner, the first port of
call for that traffic is almost certainly some kind of keyword processor.
Traffic of high risk probably passes through successive layers of technology
until there's a decision to actually put a human ear on it. But the telcos
probably don't need/want to know the conditions under which a human is
actually invoked, and can deniably state that they were unaware, when they
gladly ripped out a copy of the traffic, that NSA, etc...was actually going to
break a law by having a human listen in sans warrant.

As a result, it's safe to say it's still occurring, though probably not in big
fat bundles and dedicated rooms. Back in the digital domain (as opposed to the
more obvious splitting out at the optical layer), it's easily possible for the
traffic to be routed in such a way as to grant the telcos complete plausible
deniability (eg, by leveraging CALEA in clever ways, or by merely grabbing
copies of protect traffic in UPSR rings).

Of course, this raises the spectre of the (impossible) Variola Suitcase,
meaning they probably have to do a lot more pre-filtering and dropping then
they would like.
