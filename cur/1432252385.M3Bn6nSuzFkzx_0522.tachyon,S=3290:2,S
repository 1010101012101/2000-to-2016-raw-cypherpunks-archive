Add your own 2nd alarm system.  You can even use the sensors of your
existing one to interface with a computer (just the sensors, mind you, not
the actual controllers.)  Got a DSL line?  Got a modem?  Got a cell phone?  
Got a pager?  Got network capable cameras?  

Got access to another computer outside your house that can also watch when
your DSL line is down and notify you?

Got a small computer you could hide somewhere non obvious?  Like inside a
wall?  Maybe a still useable old laptop with a broken screen that you
could pick up off ebay for cheap?

Got an imagination and some wiring/programming skills?
