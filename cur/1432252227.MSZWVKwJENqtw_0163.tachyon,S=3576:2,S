   No shit! I was in a canoe once on a very backwoods lake, nobody else
within miles -- a fucking F16 came over so low he spun my canoe around
almost swamped it. 
   Another time, in another state, a helicopter came into my yard so
low he went _around_ my house, not over it, did a power turn in the front
yard, and came back around the side of the house again. He was extremely
lucky, the only gun I could grab that quick was a .22 pistol. I put 6
rounds into his canopy. He was so close I could see his face clearly.
If I'd had my .44 mag, he'd of been one dead asshole. 
   I got a bit nervous afterwards, was wondering if the cops would 
show up, but then realized there was no way in hell he could 
report it, he would have lost his pilot's license for that cowboy
bullshit. They are required by law to stay 500' minimum above 
private property.
