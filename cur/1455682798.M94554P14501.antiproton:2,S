3) inflation rates exceed the demurrage cost of holding currency.

*every* real thing is subject to entropy. If your currency is not
subject to entropy, or theoretically magically increases in value
over time cause reasons (bitcoin), it's a wealth transfer from the
latercomers to early adopters.

Hyperinflation is generally massive failure of something, and a
wealth transfer from everyone to whomever's printing the money
(usually corrupt government officials).


Now maybe gold holds it's value, but it's still got a demurrage
cost. The gold holders have to pay gun holders to keep the non-
holders away from your gold, or you don't have anymore gold.

Bitcoin has to pay the miners, or you don't have any more 
transferrable bitcoin.


If you don't understand entropy, and how that impacts money, then
we'll never get any sort of consensus on the when inflation goes
from necessary evil to wanton corrupt wealth redistribion. This
number is far from precise, and has about as many values as there
are people that use money.

The real cypherpunk question is when are we going to have a
blockchain that allows a distributed and coercion-free market to
transparently set a consensus demurrage and/or inflation rate to
transfer wealth collectively from those that hold money to the
cryptographers and coders that collective maintain the blockchain's
value.
