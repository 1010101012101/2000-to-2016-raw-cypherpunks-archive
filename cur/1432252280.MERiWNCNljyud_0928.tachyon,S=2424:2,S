Appeals Court Lets Interior Computers Back Online, Despite Judge's
Security Concerns
By Robert Gehrke
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Interior Department will go back online after an
appeals court Wednesday blocked a judge's ruling that ordered most of
the department's computers disconnected from the Internet.
It took the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
just three hours to grant the government's request to restore the
Interior's Internet access. It had been shut down since March 15 to
protect money owed to American Indians from computer hackers.

The shutdown disrupted public's access to Interior Department Web pages,
land managers' communications, disbursement of mineral royalties to
states, and education of children in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools.

Interior Secretary Gale Norton said she was pleased with the appeals
court decision and will continue pushing for a permanent reversal of the
Internet shutdown.

"Meanwhile, tonight we have begun to restore our Internet connections
across all impacted agencies of the department and will work quickly to
restore them to pre-March 15 levels," she said.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the shutdown after the
Interior Department failed to show it had fixed security problems that
left vulnerable to Internet security breaches millions of dollars in
royalties from oil, gas, timber and grazing activities on American
Indian lands.
