Thank you! I think I can speak for both mrphs and myself when I say that
we are thrilled with the outcome. What we saw last night was an
incredible display of community support for free speech and Tor, and an
unequivocal rejection of unlawful government intrusion and FUD. The
Lebanon Libraries staff and community did something historic; I've been
an activist for a long time and I've never been a part of a direct
action quite like that. This is what happens when communities come
together to resist.

Please keep an eye out for more news coverage. The local news in NH has
already put something up with a few great quotes from community members
present: http://www.vnews.com/home/18620952-95/library-joins-privacy-network

If you're on twitter, say hi to @leblibraries or @nhleblibraries -- the
second one is library director Sean Fleming, and I know he'd be moved to
hear from folks in the Tor community about what his library community
did last night.

Thanks all for your support. We just had the world's first Tor protest,
and it was a wild success. Imagine all the library exit relays we're
gonna get now. :)

Alison (director of Library Freedom Project)
