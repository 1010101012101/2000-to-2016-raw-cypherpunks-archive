Wireless is the canonical case for geographic routing. Addresses as static
or dynamic positions in space (either mutual time of flight or deriving
refinable position from connection constraints), packet routing as the
crow flies, local-knowledge routing tables that only know about a few km
space around you, almost no admin traffic. Plus, routing logic thin enough
to fit into deep embedded footprint, or be cast in hardware for
relativistic speed cut-through.

IPv6 can't handle most this, especially on the scale required. There's
point in going IPv6, but at the same time one must be aware that this is
just a patch, not a fix.
