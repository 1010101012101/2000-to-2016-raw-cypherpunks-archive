This is why I personally think it's wise to carry just a skeleton system over
the border on a bootable USB stick, with full disk encryption.  Once on the
other side of the border, securely download the data required (as I said in last
post). 

Sticks are easier to throw away/hide and if your laptop is stolen/seized within
the country your data doesn't have to go with it - the stick's in your pocket or
in your sock when walking around. Before you cross the border again the stick
should be physically destroyed. This is better than trusting data deletion. 

It can be smart to have a stock standard Windows install on the physical
hard-disk that wakes from sleep on lid-open with a picture of you and a dog
laughing in the sunny grass. Invite them to browse around and find nothing.
Never use that Windows install, of course. Boot Debian GNU/Linux or BackTrack
Linux on the stick. 

I've been extensively questioned at the border on a few occassions over the
years /because/ my laptops don't have a Desktop as such, no icons either. Both
my arms were grabbed at the Australian border as I reached to type 'firefox' in
a terminal, to start the browser in an attempt to show them a normal looking
environment. 

Terminals at the border are not a good idea.

To avoid the machine being tampered with, invest in a solid state netbook and
super-glue the shell together. It's not a crime.

Cheers!
