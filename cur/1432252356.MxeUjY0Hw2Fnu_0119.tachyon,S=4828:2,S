Ray, or "Bear," you really need to think about these things more deeply.

There are many ways in which a buyer can signal approval...without 
even linking himself to a specific transaction. (Which is likely, in 
this "ten-cent transction" to be of any interest to LE anyway.)

A simple assertion of the form "I recommend Danny the Dealer" is not 
a statement implicating the speaker in any illicit transaction which 
is prosecutable.

You once said you were a law student...unless I'm misremembering. If 
so, how could you make such an elementary error?

There are other ways to make the same "word spreads" endorsements, 
too. From a nym, in an article, etc.

As to why someone like Declan might _want_ to help spread the word, 
there are multiple reasons: to encourage more such reputable dealers, 
to discourage bad dealers, as a kind of "attaboy" for the good 
dealings, and so on.

Isn't this all pretty obvious?
