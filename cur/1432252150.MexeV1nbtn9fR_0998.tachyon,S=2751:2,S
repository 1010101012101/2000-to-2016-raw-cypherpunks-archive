Hi,                                                                             

I reckon this is a good crowd to ask this of. 

I'm helping a Win98-using friend acquire some Internet usage security.  I
think he needs at least the following: 

1. An anti-virus package. (Google reports a free-for-personal-use one at
www.free-av.com.)

2. PGP, www.pgpi.org. My friend uses Eudora. What is a good Eudora PGP
shell? (I use GPG. I'm assuming GPG interoperates with, say, PGP 7.)

3. A disk/file encryption tool. Any to recommend? (Free for personal use
preferred.)

4. One of those personal firewall/anti-snoopware thingy?

5. Anything else?

TIA. Cheers.
