Well, by your standards, any journalist who makes an innocent mistake would 
be a liar. I think the truth is that the reporters honestly believed they 
had a solid story -- but their editors should have stepped in and killed it 
or postponed it until they had unearthed more evidence. Reporters can get 
carried away on a story and lose focus; this is why you have multiple 
layers of editors at most news organizations. I don't remember how the 
videotape was edited -- you may be right; I just don't remember the details.

Disclaimer: I worked at Time Inc. at the time but was not involved with the 
story -- I didn't see it until it hit the airwaves/newsstands.
