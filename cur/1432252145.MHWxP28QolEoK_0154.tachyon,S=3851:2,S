The flight was hijacked by a non secured flightplan upload to the flight management system.
It was then flown to Diego Garcia, where the passengers were disembarked by force, 
the selectees from the passenger list are in one of the US navy brig ships anchored since
9/11 at Diego Garcia, "chatting" with CIA interrogators. Disposition of the other 
detainees passengers NOT known at the present. The statement released by the malaysian
gov is false. They know where the detainees are.

The adsb xmissions aboard the 777 are handled by an older subsystem and are NOT so easily silenced from the cockpit.
By the same token  the flight management system flight plan upload capability
 aboard boeing planes has been shown to be insecure and vunerable by security researchers
since the B737. 

The worst part of all is that the "simulators" for the FMS are a windows based program
that is linked with the libraries either representing the windows environment of the
simulator OR thet are linked with the "production" libraries to produce the FMS firmware
for use on the aircraft itself.

Thing about programming in a windows environment? ALL the fucking calls are unique to the Microsoft windows environment and NOT portable at all to other runtime environments,
UNLESS that runtime is windows based.. say like windows mobile(big flop) or a proposed
hypothetical environment I am going to call Windows PLANE. 
Windows PLANE would have inherited the same crappy programming environment that 
caused the US Navy to do an abrupt 180 turnaround prom putting its firecontrol 
and navigation systems under control of windows after a near disaster in the
 mid alantic caused by windows domain failuresa

Windows PLANE would have all the same flaws as the crappy laptop you like to lug around

Fucking Boeing, all of those windows development asshats that did this need killin'
for putting their personal profit ahead of the lives of millions who fly.
