At The Fifth HOPE a talk will be given on how to break
anonymity networks. Some commonly used p2p code such as
Tor and the remailers will be covered.

I cannot attend the conference.  Is anyone on the list going
who could report back?  I'm interested to hear if anything
other than what's already been widely published is covered
in this talk.

I'm working on a p2p anonymity project.


Thanks,

How To Break Anonymity Networks
Nick Mathewson

Today's anonymous communication software (such as Mixmaster, Mixminion,
Nymservers, JAP, Tor, Anonymizer, etc.) allows people to communicate
while concealing their identities from each other and from external
attackers. But no deployed system is strong enough to protect every
pattern of user behavior against a sufficiently resourceful adversary,
and many of them fall to far simpler attacks. In this talk, Nick will
discuss working attacks against today's anonymity networks, drawing from
past technical and social attacks on deployed networks and from recent
academic research in traffic analysis, stylometry, and mix-net design.
He will present defenses to these attacks when such defenses are known
to exist.
