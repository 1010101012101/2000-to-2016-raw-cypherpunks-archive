A little while ago, it seemed that cypherpunks was dead.  There
was nothing on it except for spam from Nigeria, commies, and
lunatics.

Now I am reading email from various people who appear to be
making their living using cryptography in ways that undermine
the state, and who deal with the various practical real world
problems involved in such a living.

I find these troubles very encouraging.  The fact that people
encounter such predictable troubles shows they are really doing
what they talk about, and when they encounter these problems,
they seem to proceed with competent and effectual solutions.
