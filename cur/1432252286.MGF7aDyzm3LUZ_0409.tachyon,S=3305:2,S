Actually they do.  Sort of at http://www.e-gold.com/unsecure/alert.html
- Never click hypertext links in HTML formatted e-mail to access your account. 
- Confirm that you are on the e-gold website before entering your e-gold passphrase into either a logon form or a payment authorization form (see note below about e-gold shopping cart interface): 
- Verify the address/location/URL starts with: https://www.e-gold.com/ 
- Verify that the site certificate is issued by VeriSign to www.e-gold.com

Too few customers would know what to do with such a key.

They know about most of the fraudulent emails circulating. They don't want to hear about them from customers because it would exhaust what customer service resources they have.  

I have never received an email from e-gold following my account creation confirmation and I beleive its their policy not to send emails for just this reason.
