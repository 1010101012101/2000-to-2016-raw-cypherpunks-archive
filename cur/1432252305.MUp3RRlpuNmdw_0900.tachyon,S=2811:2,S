The San Francisco Chronicle reports that the University of
California at Berkeley has selected Janet Reno to speak at graduation.
The ceremony will be held at the Greek Theater on 9 May,
and is only open to graduating students and their families (oh, well :-)

The San Francisco Cacophany Society reports late-breaking news
that a draft of her speech has been leaked to the public.
	"Welcome to the Class of 2001 graduation.
	"You have the right to remain silent......"
