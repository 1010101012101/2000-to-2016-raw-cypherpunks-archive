(1) Whatever happened to simple concepts [and basic best 
practices] like airgapping?

(2) Despite _not_ having this kind of BS law in place yet (that we know of 
anyway, seeing as we now have secret laws<fsck!>), there hasn't been much 
of a problem backtracking major malware outbreaks as far back as the early 
aughts.  This crap about "wire speed" is pretty flimsy misdirection, even 
for the USG.

(2) Payback's a bitch. And it must hurt even more to know that your 
enemies are going to reverse engineer your own malware (stux et al) for 
return flights.  Maybe we should focus on the actual issue: getting our 
noses [and arms] out of the rest of the worlds businesses [and backyards].
