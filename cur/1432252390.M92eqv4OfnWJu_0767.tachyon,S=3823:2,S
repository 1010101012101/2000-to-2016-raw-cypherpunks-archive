Libertarians are propertarians.

Property rights are the boundaries between one man's plan and another 
man's plan.  If the ruling elite casually violate property rights, then, 
as with Obamacare, the result is chaos, which must be resolved by one 
plan imposed on all to restore order in order to avoid collapse. Terror 
follows in due course.  Should the terror ease, collapse follows.

This has been explained by Mises and Hayek, and colorfully dramatized by 
Ayn Rand.
