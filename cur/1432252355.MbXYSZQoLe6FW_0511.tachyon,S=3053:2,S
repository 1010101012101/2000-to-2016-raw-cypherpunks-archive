My back-of-the-computerized-envelope calculation shows that it would take
5900 metric tons (2200 lbs) to load a volume of 100km by 100km by 100 meters
of water with 100 nanomolar level of iron ion.  (weight counts only that of
iron, not the anion.)  Big supertankers hold approximately 400,000 tons of
oil, which happens to be much less dense than iron oxide.

I haven't read much on the results of the experiment done, but my impression
is that this kind of iron fertilizing is very much worth doing.
