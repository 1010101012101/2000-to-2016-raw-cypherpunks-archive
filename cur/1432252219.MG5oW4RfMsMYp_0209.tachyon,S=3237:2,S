That's for sure.

This is a later day example of a so called (in Sweden; French version?)
"Nigeria-letter". This kind of scam started in the 80s (possibly earlier in
a lesser scale) by snail and later by fax - it's probably been around in the
form of "private" email for quite a time. Presumably, because of cultural
and habitual phenomenons, Euorpeans have been prime targets. Really,
legions of fools have been ruined for the purpose of this oblique kind of
"band aid" to Africa. Obviously, some not so smart "Nigerian" has now
found out about old-fashioned capital-letter spamming. I doubt he'll get
anyone on the hook.
