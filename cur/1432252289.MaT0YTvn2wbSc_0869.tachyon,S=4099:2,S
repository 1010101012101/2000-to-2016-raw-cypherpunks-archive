I've seen these snips today...

In the US private security consultants have numerous licenses, variable by
state. ("C & G" licenses - guns, dogs, exec protect, PIs, etc.) Aren't ya'll

some interests could make a powerful argument for tech security licenses,
the same rationale would definitely apply.
