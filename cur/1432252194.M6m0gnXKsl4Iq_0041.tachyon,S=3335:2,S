http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/smart/gbu-28.htm says in part:

"The GBU-28 is a 5,000-pound laser-guided conventional munition..."

Later in the spec sheet, it cites the size of the bomb as 4,414 lbs.  
Perhaps the 5,000 lbs was a rough estimate.  Perhaps the spec sheet is in
error.

Current news stories are referring to it as the <5,000-pound GBU-28
"bunker buster" bomb>.

The B61-11 tactical nuke was a replacement for the B53, an 8,900 lb 9
megaton warhead, which could only be delivered by a B52.  I apparently
confused this with the B61-11 being an alternative to the GBU-28, which
can, as you point out, be delivered by a variety of aircraft.
