You want to use a 4096-bit key for SYMMETRICAL crypto? Hello? Not only I
don't know of ANY symmetrical algorithm with such a key, but why on Earth
would you need it for? What attack do you know against a 128-bit or even
256-bit key that doesn't work against a 4096-bit one?

What symmetric crypto algorithm is that?

Did I mention that I wrote a Yarrow implementation in Delphi? <g> It passes
DIEHARD, but it hasn't been otherwise checked. [Public domain, btw.]

I like this guy :) [All my code is public domain, but I hate the GPL for
*forcing* people to share. Communism at its best.]
