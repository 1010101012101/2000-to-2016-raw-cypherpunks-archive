As I recall, this was an open beta. The NSA would probably have ordered a
copy under a private individual's name (and had it sent to a residential
address) had ZKS denied them the sale.

(They didn't need a large number of copies to examine it for flaws.)

That's not the reasoning that anyone here is stating.

"They're going to obtain a copy of the software anyway, so why not make a
buck while we can," is what's being said, coupled with "they shouldn't be
able to break the software even if they have the source, so if we've done
our jobs there is no reason not so sell it to them."

Please. If you are going to participate in this debate, possess the
ability to paraphrase the opponent's arguements correctly.
