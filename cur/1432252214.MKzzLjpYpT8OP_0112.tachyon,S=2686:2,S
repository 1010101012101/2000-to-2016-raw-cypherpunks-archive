Bullshit on all points.

If you don't believe businesses don't use guns then you should check
around. Hell, my local grocery has an armed guard at the front entrance
when it's open (and other times I suspect). Tell this to your local
mid-level drug dealer.

Most people encounter a gun at least daily within say 50 ft. of their
person, thought they may not be aware of it or individualy handle it.

Most people, industrial country or not, are controlled by the beliefs they
hold and what they believe is acceptable. Corporations and governments are
as much a victim of this as the individual is.
