You can't, in general, assume the compiler won't optimise this away
(it's just been zeroised, there's no need to check for zero).  You 
could make it volatile *and* do the check, which should be safe from 
being optimised.

It's worth reading the full thread on vuln-dev, which starts at
http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/82/297827/2002-10-29/2002-11-04/0.
This discusses lots of fool-the-compiler tricks, along with rebuttals
on why they could fail.

Peter.
