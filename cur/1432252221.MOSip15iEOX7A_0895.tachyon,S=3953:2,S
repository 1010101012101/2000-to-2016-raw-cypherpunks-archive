Maybe.  Just so I'll know for sure,  are you agreeing with me or
ridiculing me?  I'm well aware that my own style makes it difficult
to tell when (if ever) I'm serious.  I mean,  I'm not stupid enough
to actually tell a judge, "you're an insane, ignorant idiot,  facts are
wasted on you, so instead of getting a lawyer that actually
knows something about this area of law, I went looking for the 
hottest chick I can find who is legally qualified to practice law in
this district,  in hopes that you'll drool over her and find in my
favor".  I'm not stupid enough to SAY it,  but I just might
be stupid enough to TRY it,  if I felt that that was my best chance of
reaching a favorable verdict. 

As for unamused judges,  if I were to tell a judge that a judge is
just a law student who gets to grade his own papers, do you
think he'd say that's
1) not funny at all
2) maybe funny the first time,  but this is like the 200th
or
3) a real knee slapper?

Thanks,
	George
