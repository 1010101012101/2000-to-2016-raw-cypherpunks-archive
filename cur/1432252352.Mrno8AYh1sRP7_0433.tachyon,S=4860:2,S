The second beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is now available from the
OpenSSL FTP site <URL: ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/>. Quite a lot
of code changed between the 0.9.6 release and the 0.9.7 release, so
a series of 3 or 4 beta releases is planned before the final release.

To make sure that it will work correctly, please test this version
(especially on less common platforms), and report any problems to
<openssl-bugs@openssl.org>.
Application developers that use OpenSSL to provide cryptographic
routines or SSL/TLS support are kindly requested to test their
software against this new release to make sure that necessary adaptions
can be made.

Changes between 0.9.6x and 0.9.7 include:

      o New library section OCSP.
      o Complete rewrite of ASN1 code.
      o CRL checking in verify code and openssl utility.
      o Extension copying in 'ca' utility.
      o Flexible display options in 'ca' utility.
      o Provisional support for international characters with UTF8.
      o Support for external crypto devices ('engine') is no longer
        a separate distribution.
      o New elliptic curve library section.
      o New AES (Rijndael) library section.
      o Change DES API to clean up the namespace (some applications link also
        against libdes providing similar functions having the same name).
        Provide macros for backward compatibility (will be removed in the
        future).
      o Unifiy handling of cryptographic algorithms (software and
        engine) to be available via EVP routines for asymmetric and
        symmetric ciphers.
      o NCONF: new configuration handling routines.
      o Change API to use more 'const' modifiers to improve error checking
        and help optimizers.
      o Finally remove references to RSAref.
      o Reworked parts of the BIGNUM code.
      o Support for new engines: Broadcom ubsec, Accelerated Encryption
        Processing, IBM 4758.
      o Extended and corrected OID (object identifier) table.
      o PRNG: query at more locations for a random device, automatic query for
        EGD style random sources at several locations.
      o SSL/TLS: allow optional cipher choice according to server's preference.
      o SSL/TLS: allow server to explicitly set new session ids.
      o SSL/TLS: support Kerberos cipher suites (RFC2712).
      o SSL/TLS: allow more precise control of renegotiations and sessions.
      o SSL/TLS: add callback to retrieve SSL/TLS messages.
      o SSL/TLS: add draft AES ciphersuites (disabled unless explicitly requested).
