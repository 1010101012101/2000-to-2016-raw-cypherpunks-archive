Nations with imperial aspirations, invariably, throughout History change th=
eir conscript based army in favor of an army of paid soldiers. Today euphim=
isticaly called 'profesional' soldiers, but know also as mercenaries and so=
ldiers of fortune in the not-so-distant past. (Note: Ligustically a "soldie=
r" is 'someone-who-is-SOLD' anyway).
Now this trend is well documented in past history and definately has its ow=
n Psychohistorical significance as it's one of the notable 'landmarks' of a=
n Imperium (ie. a nation/state pursuing local/regional/global hegemony - do=
minance).

What I find interesting and relating with the above 'historical' symptom in=
 todays' US history making actions, are two choices made by the current US =
administration. I call those choices 'mistakes' for a number of reasons. Bo=
th can be atributed to the so-called 'Vietnam Syndrom' of the US society, b=
ut IMO they go deeper than that, into the effects and side-effects of profe=
sional armies.

The first is choice is a call for minimal US military casualties. OK the ge=
neral public might have not liked it before 9/11, but in retrospect after 9=
/11 things look different. Think about it.=20
First In an imaginary situation. Before, but after as well, 9/11 even a 'wh=
at's-his-name' journalist could arrange a meeting with Bin Laden should we =
belive that he eluded the US inteligence? The answer is that they probably =
knew Bin Laden's location but could not just send 1,000 troops in to get hi=
m because of the very real probability of high casualties. Of course profes=
ional soldiers are in for the money and generally do not look forward to a =
glorious death in Afganistan, but 6,000 civilians died because of this US a=
my inaction. In retrospect the general public would be far more willing to =
'understand' the need of high arny casualties in order to save civilian liv=
es.
Second in today's real situation. The US army is stil reluctant to go in ev=
en though their projected casualties are still far less than the 6,000 civi=
lian deat toll. Instead they resort an air campain that cannot distinguise =
between guilty and inocent, slowly making the US look more and more like th=
e terrorists, at least in the common Afganis' eyes and not only.
6,000 civilians dead and the US military still fights a war without the abi=
lity to 'afford' military casualties. That's the combination af a profesion=
al army with the Vietnam Syndrome. Extremely unproductive too, thus, a mist=
ake.

The other choice is that they make this 'War-on-terror' a non-hero war, at =
a time that heroes are needed.
First here we can note the overlooking of the first heroes, the passengers =
of Flight 95. They received far less laurels than they deserved - unless th=
e US administration 'knows' something we don't abt. the termination of Flig=
ht 95 (Was it shot down by an F-16 or and F-15 fighter?). Firefighters etc.=
 received a heroes treatment for doing their duty, but a hero is someone wh=
o does beyond duty, like the passengers of Flight 95.
Then there is the choice to keep the two dead servicemen who died in Pakist=
an, nameless. The US administration let pass a unique opportunity to make n=
ew heroes and show that not only US civilians die in this war, but, this fe=
ar for casualties struck again and the two dead Americans do not receive an=
y heroes treatment. OK they were pros, in for the money, not for death 'n g=
lory, but still they could be treated better. Additionaly, I don't think th=
at their comrades haven't noticed that their 'sacrifices' do not weight muc=
h. That can and will affect their morale. Angain a mistake.

It is in the best interests of the US and their allies go in and finish wha=
t they started. This is a time where the general public will allow for mili=
tary casualties, but this 'window' will close, sooner than later, and the i=
mage of the US will be more damaged than anything else.
