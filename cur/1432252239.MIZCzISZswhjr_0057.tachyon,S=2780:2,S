Everyone knows that he committed suicide.  Just like Vince Foster.

Incidentally, last Tuesday the Supreme Court ruled that the Vince Foster
death-scene photos are not subject to FOIA requests.  Kennedy even cited
_Antigone_ as reason to protect already-taken death-scene photos of a
scandal-embroiled public official (p. 9).

The claimed rationale was that people requesting such photos must have
some evidence (presumably a witness who claims knowledge that Foster was
murdered) rather than just an unsubstantiated hunch.  Otherwise, says
Kennedy, privacy interests of the family outweigh public right to know.

It's amusing the Supreme Court is unwilling to extend it's fear of
"appearance of corruption" to cases like this.  It's also amusing that
they can't seem to find any difference between FOIA requests for
death-scene photos of a public official mixed up in a scandal and, as
Kennedy suggests, FOIA requests by murderers of death-scene photos of
their victims, private citizens.

The Appeals court had ordered the release of four of the (11?) pictures.
