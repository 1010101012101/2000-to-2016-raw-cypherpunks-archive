I'm confused, but maybe missing something?  The article says:

'''
The stakes rose when more technology companies adopted RSA's methods
and Internet use began to soar. The Clinton administration embraced
the Clipper Chip, envisioned as a mandatory component in phones and
computers to enable officials to overcome encryption with a warrant.

RSA led a fierce public campaign against the effort, distributing
posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words "Sink Clipper!"

A key argument against the chip was that overseas buyers would shun
U.S. technology products if they were ready-made for spying. Some
companies say that is just what has happened in the wake of the
Snowden disclosures.

The White House abandoned the Clipper Chip and instead relied on
export controls to prevent the best cryptography from crossing U.S.
borders. RSA once again rallied the industry, and it set up an
Australian division that could ship what it wanted.

"We became the tip of the spear, so to speak, in this fight against
government efforts," Bidzos recalled in an oral history.
'''

'''
RSA, meanwhile, was changing. Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999 to
concentrate on VeriSign, a security certificate company that had been
spun out of RSA. The elite lab Bidzos had founded in Silicon Valley
moved east to Massachusetts, and many top engineers left the company,
several former employees said.
'''

It seems like Bidzous was out of RSA long before DUAL EC PRNG was even
proposed, and was in fact campaigning and strategizing against RSA
while he was there.  Where are references to other accusations or
behavior?
