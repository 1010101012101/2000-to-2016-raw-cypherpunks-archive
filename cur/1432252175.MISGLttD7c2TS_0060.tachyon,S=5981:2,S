Depends on how it's used.  Hammers can be dangerous.

Yup.  I suspect they won't get paid until after the 2 weeks is up
to ensure that too.

Maybe.

Or al-quida like operations.  By accident of course!

Seems like you're assuming the cracker is pointed at a specific
target to begin with.  I think it's more of a crap shoot, and iDEFENSE
is hoping a few will be really worth while for the 100's that aren't.
iDEFENSE has to find the subscriber after the fact, not before (I think).

If I were HP I'd have done the same thing they did - why be pushed
around when you can fight back?  I think the crackers screwed up,
they should have given a presentation to HP with a proof that there's
a crack, and then request (politely) some compensation for where
it was.  by making it a reasonable request, HP saves engineering time
and their software, and the crackers get into business.  If they'd
gone in with a "win-win" attitude, the crackers would have made money,
HP would have saved a lot of money, and everyone would be a lot happier.

"moral obligation" and "mental attitude" are not the same thing, but
I think the right attitude would make the morals a lot simpler.

So rather than paying paltry sums to crackers, iDEFENSE might do better
as a agency for crackers.  If they do the business to business end
for the crackers, and negotiate contracts, then they get a cut, and
the crackers get a lot more motivation to go find problems.  I think
everybody can win then, so long as the exploits are in fact published.

Patience, persistence, truth,
