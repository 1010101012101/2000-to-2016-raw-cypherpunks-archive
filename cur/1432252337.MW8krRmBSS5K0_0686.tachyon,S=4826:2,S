This was a very small, and inconsequential, part of the debate/discussion.

Had George Bush called for _Internet licensing_ in some concrete way, 
comparable to the way Al Gore called for gun licensing, I would be 
more concerned about Bush's comments. But he did not.

Throwing in a line about the Columbine creeps being influenced by the 
Internet (or by Quake and Doom and other games, or by "The Matrix," 
or by being spoiled suburban brats) is not the same as calling for 
unconstitutional abridgments of freedoms.

Normally I vote Libertarian. This year I may vote for Bush as a vote 
for who will do me, us, and the Constitution the lesser damage of the 
two. (All voting is about bang for the buck, about effectiveness of a 
vote...an election is not about "voting for the best man," it is 
instead about minimizing damage.)
