And here I was thinking we were talking about signing your life away
to be owned by some land and take on the task of surviving in a market
that is more often than not pays below what it costs to grow the product.

I suppose that's why they call it 'buy the farm', the only way a true
farmer retires is having a date with Death[1]

OT: Have we turned into cyphergoths here? Not that I'm complaining, I
do like a woman in Black.
