I can think of two innocuous reasons, though the real reason is
probably something else altogether:

1.  Defending copyright enforcement is extremely unpopular because
it seemingly puts you on the side of the hollywood cabal, but in
fact TCPA/Paladium, if it works as described, and if it is not
integrated with legal enforcement, does not over reach in the
fashion that most recent intellectual property legislation, and
most recent policy decisions by the patent office over reach.

2..  Legal departments are full of people who are, among their
many other grievious faults, technologically illiterate.
Therefore when an insider is talking about something, they cannot
tell when he is leaking inside information or not, and tend to
have kittens, because they have to trust him (being unable to tell
if he is leaking information covered by NDA), and are
constitutionally incapable of trusting anyone.
