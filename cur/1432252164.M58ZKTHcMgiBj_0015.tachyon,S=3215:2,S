LAUREL, Md., 1:40 p.m. EDT September 20, 2001 -- An FBI spokesman said a
1992 Dodge conversion van owned by the agency and containing radio
equipment was stolen early Thursday
morning in Laurel.

Agents have been in the area to investigate ties to last week's
terrorist attacks in New York andWashington. Laurel residents and
employees have told agents that some of the suspected terrorists spent
their final days in Laurel, Greenbelt and Beltsville.

                                  FBI spokesman Peter Gulotta declined
to say why the van was in the area. He says that to the best of
                                  his knowledge, the van didn't have
evidence connected to the terrorist attacks.

                                  Gulotta says the van was stolen about
4:30 a.m. while it was unattended. The suspects are two men
                                  who pulled up to the FBI van in a
white van with stolen tags. The blue FBI van was last seen heading
                                  south on Interstate 295 toward
Washington.
