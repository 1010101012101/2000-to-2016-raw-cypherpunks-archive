New slogan for these urban community gardens: "Hoes fo da hoes!"

Life in NYC is radically different and, I trhink, poses some interesting 
questions to purer libertarians.

In NYC there are many community gardens in poorer neighborhoods. These 
community gardens receive no meny from either state or city governments, and 
occur on lots that have been abandoned for (sometimes) decades. In many 
cases the lot has come under the technical ownership of the city, which left 
the lot basically a field of bricks and illegally dumped garbage, which the 
locals transformed into a thing of relative beauty..

Recently, for the purposes of building low-income housing, the city has 
decvided to bulldoze some of these gardens, which the locals have put a lot 
of sweat into over the years.  Needless to say, the locals don't want their 
garden bulldozed and, despite the fact that they are often of very low 
income themselves, don't want additional housing built on the garden's lot. 
However, the cost of buying the land is normaly well beyond the reach of 
even a large group of such locals (though a couple of years ago there was a 
move among some celebs to buy up the land and donate it to the community, 
but I think that only occured in Manhattan.)

So, one could make he argument that "they should have found private property 
to make their garden", but this misses the point that part of the purpose of 
the garden is to greatly increase the visual livability of the neighborhood. 
(Also, these people simply could not afford to buy up such land.) And now, 
after creating a nice space in those lots for so many years the city wants 
to bulldoze them. Should thery be allowed to do so? Should the city be 
forced to sign over such land to the locals for them to "own"? Or should 
active resistance be utilized tostop the bulldozers? (Or is bulldozing the 
right thing to do?)

I really don't know the answer. Anyone care to comment?
