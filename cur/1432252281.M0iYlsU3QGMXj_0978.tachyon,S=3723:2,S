And you might mention for the nuclearly impaired that the fuel used in
RTGs is not the same as the fissionables used in reactors and weapons.

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
