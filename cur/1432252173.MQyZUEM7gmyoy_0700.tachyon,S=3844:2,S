  You're assuming that there's endpoint anonymity and that no one could
correlate you connecting to Server A and a piece of traffic coming from
Server A at the same time.

  At a basic level, this type of correlation is responsible for Jeremy
Hammond's arrest (his VPN disconnected from IRC right as he lost
internet -- deniability is useless here).  And any iOS device is likely
keeping track of your recent server connections.

  If I had a week, I couldn't list all the cases where someone mislaid
their trust in a service provider to protect them.

  Deniability is dead.  What Tor provides is unlinkability.

best,
Griffin
