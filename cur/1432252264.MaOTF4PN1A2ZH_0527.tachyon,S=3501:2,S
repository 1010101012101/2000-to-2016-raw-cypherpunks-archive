Platinum costs vary, but I've never seen it above $500/oz,
and I think it's more often about $300, e.g. about the price of
good marijuana, which far more than 1 in 1000 hobbyists can afford :-)
How much of it do you need for a can-sat engine's catalyst?

That's separate from questions of whether it's easy to work with,
or whether you can get the catalyst into the form you need,
e.g. wire mesh or particles spread on fiberglass or whatever.
