Hmm.  Oddly enough, I agree with that.  And yet, I doubt we are thinking of
the same thing.  Because I ALSO agree with the Usual Suspect in a way -- I
don't think professional journalists should be "treated by the law" any
differently than the rest of us mere sheeple.  If this makes any sense, I'm
not saying professional journalists shouldn't get special breaks, I'm saying
we should ALL get 'em and they shouldn't be special.  If freedom of the
press is to have any meaning, we can't have a gatekeeper empowered to say
"you are legitimate press and you, scoundrel, yes you, the guy with the
wireless Palm Pilot, you don't count!"

Of course, since we live in an age where the rule of law is a fast-fading
memory, it doesn't matter very much.  As Declan is discovering, the usual
protocols are not observed when the government is conducting show trials of
the randomly selected politically incorrect loser of the month.
