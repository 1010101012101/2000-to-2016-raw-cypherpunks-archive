That is quite a presumption there.  "If you're not with US, you're with the 
terrorists", eh? Same old sorry ass script, dug up but unoriginal dullards 
as the boilerplate world domination scam.  You know, the Nazis were just 
make the world safe for freedom, fighting those pesky Commies, and oh yeah, 
those "terrorists" who burned down the Reichstag...

WTC-Reichstag 2.  Same old story.  Yep, just no decent boogymen, since the 
commies gave up the good fight.  They tried replacing them with "the drug 
menace", but that never quite took the same way.  People were yet too 
skeptical because too many people like gettin' high themselves.  Oh ok, 
here we go kiddies on our neverland joyride interminable "war on 
terror".  Oh yeah, that's a REAL good one, that'll keep the proles cowering 
for the protection of the feudal state's protection.  O. Protect Me, Thine 
Lord, and I shall prostrate my ass to your minions at the airports!  Pucker 
up to prove you don't a bomb hidden up yo ass, boy.

"Uncle Ho" was the leader of the Indochinese resistance, leader of a 
popular anti-colonial nationalist movement (remember, Indochina was a 
French colony, before the Japanese seized it from them).  The original viet 
cong tunnel complexes, dated back to the nationalist resistance movement 
which was fighting the Imperial Japanese occupation of 
Indochina.  Eisenhower actually considered Ho to be a great ally in the 
region at the time, for giving the Japs such hell.  After the War, however, 
the Frenchys wanted their old colony back so they could rape it some more 
of it's cheap natural resources, and well, Ho having fought the dickens out 
of the Japs, wasn't having any of it.  Eventually the French gave up (ever 
hear of dienbienphu?)  Then WE got involved in that mess (under the pretext 
of "anticommunism proxy warism"), and rather than just let them have their 
own country, killed a lot of peasants and made big defense contractors some 
mega money, before the Amerikan youth finally rebelled at being sent off to 
be slaughtered for defense contractor profiteering.  Ho had actually 
admitted to being an avid admirer of the founding fathers of the US, I seem 
to recall.


>And now the guys on this list are weeping big salt tears about
>poor victimized Saddam.

Saddam is irrelevant, and the real joke on US will be when we come to 
understand it.  OK, whoopy-dee-do, "We Got Him!"  (nevermind that WE MADE 
HIM, nevermind that we built up his bio-chem WMD proggies, to counter the 
reaction in Iran after our tyrant Shah THERE got his ass kicked out by the 
people).  A CIA puppet who got out of control.  Don't want to believe it, 
look for how he was part of a CIA team recruited to assassinate Kassem.  He 
was useful while he did US bidding.  Once he outlived his usefulness, we 
set him up ("the greenlighting of kuwait invasion, ala April Gillespie and 
Poppy Bush), so we had a great excuse to dump our obsolete inventories of 
older military hardware, as well as battle-test our latest weapons 
technologies at the same time.

Chickens always come home to roost.   This is the case with Saddam, same as 
it was for Bin Laden as well (another CIA Frankenstein, run amok on 
Master).  Do you not see a PATTERN here, of building up and tearing down, 
and making monster profits every step of the way, and the hell with those 
useless eater peasants by the millions?  Look at all the Panamanians we 
slaughtered, so Poppy Bush could "take out" a noncompliant Noriega, who was 
threatening to spill the sloppy details or Poppy's CIA cocaine 
trafficking.  Silenced him real good, didn't we.  Now he can talk to the 
wall in a Fed prison if he wants to talk...

Why the insecure need to dominate others?  You think "American culture" has 
no flaws?  You think Islam has nothing of value?  Do you not see the logic 
of actions and reactions (and chain reactions ad infinitum)?  Why should 
one have to dominate/annihilate the other?  How about 
symbiosis?  Coexistence?  How about finding a balance where we become more 
self-sufficient, so that we do not need their oil, and therefore do not get 
"in their faces".  You know, picking sides, like the Israeli-Palestinian 
mess.  Oh yeah, I guess you just swallowed the Bush lie hook line and 
sinker about how they "did it because they hate our freedom".  Oh yeah, 
well, Bush and Nazi Asscroft have taken the most important freedoms, and 
undermine daily anything left, so they shouldn't have any reason to hate us 
anymore.  I'm surprised Bush didn't claim Osama got a bad burger once at 
the Riyadh McDonald's, and just then and there decided that we've just 
simply "got to be destroyed".

Gotta stop watching so much TV, it's rotting your brain.  You think the USA 
can do NO wrong, we ALWAYS have only the truly noblest intents, eh?  Look 
at history, look at how we have related and treated others.  Oh, sometimes 
we have done the right things, but at least as often if not more we have 
done the wrong things, to the tune of millions of dead foreign peasants 
usually.  Look at all the genocidal CIA installed dictators... Suharto in 
Indonesia, Saddam... etc etc etc

WHY THEY HATE US--DUH!

in particular: In the quotations collected below, the name of the leader 
who was assassinated is spelled variously as Qasim, Qassim and Kassem. But, 
however you spell his name, when he took power in a popularly-backed coup 
in 1958, he certainly got recognized in Washington. He carried out such 
anti-American and anti-corporatist policies as starting the process of 
nationalizing foreign oil companies in Iraq, withdrawing Iraq from the 
US-initiated right-wing Baghdad Pact (which included another military-run, 
US-puppet state, i.e., Pakistan) and decriminalizing the Iraqi Communist 
Party. Despite these actions, and more likely because of them, he was 
Iraq's most popular leader. He had to go! In 1959, there was a failed 
assassination attempt on Qasim. The failed assassin was none other than a 
young Saddam Hussein. In 1963, a CIA-organized coup did successfully 
assassinate Qasim and Saddam's Ba'ath Party came to power for the first 
time. Saddam returned from exile in Egypt and took up the key post as head 
of Iraq's secret service. The CIA then provided the new pliant, Iraqi 
regime with the names of thousands of communists, and other leftist 
activists and organizers. Thousands of these supporters of Qasim and his 
policies were soon dead in a rampage of mass murder carried out by the 
CIA's close friends in Iraq.

The people in the Towers were innocent victims, like most palestinians in 
the occupied territories, like oppressed peasants everywhere, and any and 
all "collateral casualties" to our militarist ventures and 
CIA-coup-installed-corporate friendly dictators.  And if the "people" in 
the US will not face the reality of what our "illustrious" leaders in 
Washington inflict upon others around the world, then we will unfortunately 
become "collateral casualties" ourselves in such reprisal attacks.  Is it 
right, is it good?  Of course not, but at the same time, will it stop if 
"we the people" can not learn our "lesson" and correct the inhuman policies 
our leaders pursue in our names?

You are not facing logical reality if you fail to account for these 
facts.  In fact, your position, as you state it, is vacuous, and devoid of 
logic.  The usual "treat the symptoms but never acknowledge or deal with 
the underlying cause" mentality, which is so prevalently marketed to the 
Amerikan consumer by the corporate "bread and circuses" media controllers 
who profit most from failed militaristic policies.

The only way to "win" will be in respect, in humility, in dignity.  That 
"all life has value, even the lives of non-Americans.  That all people want 
the same things, family, happiness, love.  And that an American life has no 
greater or lesser value than that of any other".  But instead, we spiral 
into accellerating degeneracy, destroying ourselves and taking the whole 
world along for the ride to the bottom.  Another historic failure of 
culture and civilization, a needless waste of physical resources and human 
life.  But how could it be otherwise, when most can not conceive it's true 
nature?
