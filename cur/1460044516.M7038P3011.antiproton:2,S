I've seen: "...bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon, with mother
finally ******,"

    I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving
    hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at
    dawn looking for an angry fix,

    ...angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection
    to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and
    tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural
    darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities
    contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to Heaven under the El
    and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
    who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating
    Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war, who were
    expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on
    the windows of the skull, who cowered in unshaven rooms in
    underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the
    Terror through the wall, who got busted in their pubic beards
    returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, who
    ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley,
    death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams,
    with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless
    balls, incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning
    in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating
    all the motionless world of Time between, Peyote solidities of
    halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the
    rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking
    traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring
    winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of
    mind, who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from
    Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and
    children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered
    bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

    windowsills off Empire State out of the moon, yacketayakking
    screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and
    eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, whole
    intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with
    brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement, who
    vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous

    were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked
    themselves up out of basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and
    horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment
    offices, who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the
    snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a
    room full of steam-heat and opium, who created great suicidal dramas
    on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blur
    floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in
    oblivion, who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the
    crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery, who wept at the
    romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad
    music, who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge,
    and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts, who coughed on the
    sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky
    surrounded by orange crates of theology, who scribbled all night
    rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow
    morning were stanzas of gibberish, who cooked rotten animals lung

    kingdom, who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an
    egg, who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for
    Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every
    day for the next decade, who cut their wrists three times
    successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique
    stores where they thought they were growing old and cried, who were
    burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid
    blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments
    of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of
    advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or

    jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked
    away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup
    alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer, who sang out of
    their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in
    the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street,
    danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of
    nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw
    up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the

    consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens
    Aeterna Deus to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose
    and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with
    shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm
    of thought in his naked and endless head, the madman bum and angel
    beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to

      dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out
      of basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third
      Avenue iron dreams &amp; stumbled to unemployment offices, who
      walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank
      docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full
      of steam-heat and opium, who created great suicidal dramas on the
      apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blur
      floodlight of the moon &amp; their heads shall be crowned with
      laurel in oblivion, who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or
      digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery, who
      wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of
      onions and bad music, who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness
      under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their
      lofts, who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame
      under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,
      who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty
      incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of
      gibberish, who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht
      &amp; tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom, who
      plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg, who threw
      their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity
      outside of Time, &amp; alarm clocks fell on their heads every day
      for the next decade, who cut their wrists three times successively
      unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores
      where they thought they were growing old and cried, who were
      burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue
      amid blasts of leaden verse &amp; the tanked-up clatter of the
      iron regiments of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the
      fairies of advertising &amp; the mustard gas of sinister
      intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of
      Absolute Reality, who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually
      happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly
      daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one
      free beer, who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of
      the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on
      negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses
      barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s
      German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the
      bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal

      cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to
      boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to
      Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave, who demanded
      sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism &amp; were left with
      their insanity &amp; their hands &amp; a hung jury, who threw
      potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently
      presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with
      shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding
      instantaneous lobotomy, and who were given instead the concrete
      void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy

      protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting

      door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall
      in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last
      piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire

      images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of
      consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens
      Aeterna Deus to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human
      prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking
      with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the
      rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head, the madman bum
      and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might
      be left to say in time come after death, and rose reincarnate in
