	Yes, it rather does doesn't it.

	There are other words. The difference between the USA and the 
USSR was the difference between "socialism" and "fascism". The 
difference between Spain under Franco and the US is "Democracy" v.s. 
"Autocracy" (or Democratic Republic v.s. Autocratic Dictatorship).

	No, just the most *important* things.

	Most people believe that the government should control <x>. 
You get enough people together you wind up with a whole lot of <x>s.

	Taking the easy way isn't always the most productive, the 
most interesting or the most accurate.

	Capitalism is an economic system where the owners of the 
capital choose where and how to use their capital, and reap the 
results of those choices.

	Socialism is where the state--in whatever form that state 
is--owns and controls the capital in that society.

	Fascism is where the state *controls* the capital, but allows 
the "owners" to reap the results of the states decisions of where and 
how to use that capitol.
