"Online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without
going through a financial institution" is indeed what Satoshi
intended, and so you could ask, "but what about all the fiat and how
do you deal with 'the bank problem?'" Well and good... Satoshi was
apparently thinking about that same issue, of a decentralized market
within bitcoin, but it just didn't get finished.

And in February of 2010, it was stripped out of bitcoin.

(Insert ripping sound here.)

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab77fab1995ede03fb934edd
67f1359ba8

Go OpenBazaar, etc.  They (and some other similar projects) are
carrying the torch of decentralized marketplaces that don't require
legacy institutions to operate.
