Good work with the DPL! I visited the site a few weeks ago and saw it
was coming along very nicely. I do have a concern about buy-in costs
though. Are you planning on ever lowering the costs to cheaper than 1
bitcoin? At the current price, many can't afford to make a prediction.
If you lowered, more people would participate and the pool would grow
larger, more quickly.

Just a thought.
