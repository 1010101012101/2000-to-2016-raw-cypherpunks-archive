Misappropriation, not theft.  These aren't material goods.  You might
also read the Wind Done Gone ruling and reexamine exlusive rights to see
what you own under copyright in a work -- hint:  it's not the work.

I'd also recommend for reading 17 USC 115, "Scope of exclusive rights in
nondramatic musical works: Compulsory license for making and
distributing phonorecords", providing for compulsory licensing for
distribution and making arrangements (covers) of a work.

Peace.
