Bullshit. Live in New York for a while and you'll see there's a "we".

>b. cops have guns.

So do we, and guns they're not allowed to have. (Well, we're not allowed to 
have 'em either...)

This ain't Red China. We're armed and not peaceful. We're not cream of the 
crop, true-believer Beijing DaXue types like the Chinese kids in TianAnMen 
Fang. If we grew up here we know how to fight back, and we will after a 
certain point.

Well, I didn't say it was going to be a downhill ride. But you're clearly 
"not from around here, are you boy"? Try growing up in Washington Heights 
and Brooklyn, and you'll understand why the cops were nervous enough to even 
try this kind of shit. This ain't the nice little suburb you do your 
contract programming in...this is New York City. We only obey the law 
because we know there's a thin line between order and chaos in this town.
