Yup.  We all know that photo recognition technology exists.  What is your
EVIDENCE that right now, today, in the USA, this technology is on-line, and
in use such that your claim that someone who buys a money order can be
identified in three days.  No coulda, woulda, shoulda, but documentation
that supports this fanciful claim.  I don't think you have that evidence,
because I don't think it exists.  Jim, as usual, you are talking through
your hat.  Put up or shut up, big mouth.
