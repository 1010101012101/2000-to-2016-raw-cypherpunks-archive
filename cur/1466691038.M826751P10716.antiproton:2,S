Im saying "ok, so we agree folks have the right to create private clubs
(private/ authoritarian/ moderated lists)" - what do you think about my
expectation that Tor Inc actually live a bit of what it preaches and
provide at least one "free speech, go for it guys and gals" list?

I don't know who you're referring to - I've seen no threats to rejoin,
but I did see Cecilia respectful (if painfully submissive) request to be
allowed to rejoin under her own provisio then she keep herself
"on-topic". It seems evident she cannot even contact Boyce since he has
kill filed her.

Would you agree that users who are about to be banned, ought be given,
say, AT LEAST ONE CHANCE to comply with a request to "stop posting off
topic, if you continue we will ban you"?

To my mind, that would be a sane foundation for the development of
anything I would consider "community", but most "communities"
administrators/ censors/ democratic dictators don't seem to give a
rats...

I'm guessing you're talking about "we" as in America and Americans?
Because that does not include me, and says to me, more about you.

Perhaps that happened. I did not see that, and so your assertion seems
to me to be taken out of context of reality, and with a healthy dose of
USA laws bias/ prejudice.

Wow. You're really hard core here. Intended or not by you, you are
coming across to me as pretty hard core fascist. If not intended, I
grant you may just be modern-classicly schooled.
