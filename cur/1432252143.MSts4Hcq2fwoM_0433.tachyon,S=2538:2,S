Hi!  My name is Stephen, what's yours?

I found you on http://www.mt.net/~watcher/cooper1998.html.  I assume you wouldn't mind the email, since you posted your address, and I'm not asking you for money or trying to sell you a product.

Here's a poem I wrote about D-Day (available on my site www.e-s.cc with a thousand others);

'DOG TAGS'
04/93



These names of long winters speak,
for days of green summers mourn,
on crosses in rows,
the grave's granite voice,
these names give meaning to bones.
Where lie your young murdered brothers?
How found you your fathers afield?
What marker betrayed
their sun bleached remains?
Names,
remembered in steel.

Regards,

Stephen
