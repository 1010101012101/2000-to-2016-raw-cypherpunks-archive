Absolutely.

A person has the right to do whatever they want.

-Until- it interferes with anothers expression of their wants.

Then everybody stops until a solution can be worked out.

There are two, and only two paths to -any- solution. Cooperation and
consent, or coercion.

If one believes in equality then -any- solution involving coercion is a
priori -wrong- and invokes further expressions of self-defence.
