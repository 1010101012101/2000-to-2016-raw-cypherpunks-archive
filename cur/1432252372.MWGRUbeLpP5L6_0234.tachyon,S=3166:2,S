RE: Metalstorm.As they can be made e-specific to one owner,I think we 
should all be able to have a liscenced version along with stingers in case 
rouge airliners get loose in our skies.

An acquaintance has come up with what he thinks is a novel and practical 
design for a liquid propellent rocket engine. Although his initial tests 
were not conclusive he thinks he can build an under 50 lb LOX-Propane 
rocket which can put 20 lbs or more into LEO. See 
http://www.halfwaytoanywhere.com/rocket/ Interestingly, he found that 
ordinary plastic quart size Coke bottles (esp. the rounded bottom types 
often capped with a black base) were very flexible at LOX temperatures and 
were able to withstand enough pressure to make them practical as fuel and 
oxidizer tanks. The ISP is greater than 300 and Mass Ratio even more 
impressive. If he can get some funding an amateur single-stage to orbit is 
a very real possibility. It could also have a variety of commercial and 
military uses ;-)
