It doesn't have much effect on passive blocking, but what it stops (or at
least makes lot harder) is two things: Active attacks (penetration of botnet
servers by security people is a serious problem for the botherders, and I
assume competing botherders find this an easy target as well), and leeching of
botnet-collected data by others.  It's mostly back to enterprise DRM again.
