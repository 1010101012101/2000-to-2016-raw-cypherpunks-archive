Beware of one gotcha. Faraday cage will shield only the electrical 
component. Low-frequency tags (125 kHz, typically) are magnetically 
coupled. Experiments shown that such tag is readable, even if entirely 
wrapped in aluminum foil. Laying a tag on top of a feromagnetic surface 
(iron sheet) does not help (probably only diminishes the range, didn't do 
the exact measurements yet); the sheet has to be between the tag's coil 
and the reader coil to be effective.

Putting the tag into an enclosure made of a feromagnetic material helps, 
though. Altoids can proved to be a pretty effective shielding.
