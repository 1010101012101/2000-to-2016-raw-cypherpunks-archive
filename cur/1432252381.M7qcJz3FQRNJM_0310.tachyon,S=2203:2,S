<SNIP>

Last October, the agency referred to ECC as one of the few public-key 
systems that could meet equivalent security standards to the private-key 
AES.

NSA (Fort Meade, Md.) is recommending a series of algorithms called 
"Suite B" for securing sensitive and unclassified data. Suite B includes 
Elliptic-Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone and Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman for 
key agreement, along with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm 
for digital signatures.

AES and Secure Hashing Algorithm also are included in Suite B.
