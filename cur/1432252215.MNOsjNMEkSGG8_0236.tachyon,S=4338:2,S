In California, smoke detectors for homes are required AS PART OF A 
SALE, but not before or after. That is, there is no requirement 
placed on an ordinary homeowner.

As usual, rules for landlords are much different. Enforcement being 
through the usual method of renters suing for large sums because the 
landlord let the $7.99 smoke detector run low on battery power.

On the point of a law requiring guns, I just can't think of anything 
the law requires me to have in my house. As it should be.
