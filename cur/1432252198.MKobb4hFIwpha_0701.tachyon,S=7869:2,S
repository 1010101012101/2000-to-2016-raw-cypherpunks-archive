Proven tradition out in the wild. I gather there are SSH honeypots that 
allow logins with trivial attempts (pi/raspberry, admin/admin..), then 
simply record which commands the attacker runs first. Usually they'll be 
scripted commands to scope out the compromised system, and if it passes 
muster it dials home.

I don't think those honeypots are designed to make much of a human 
attacker, but they allow rapid identification and classification of 
who's attacking and offer some scope for countermeasures.

For example, if your attacker is running a certain command and capturing 
a certain form of expected output, what happens if your honeypot gives 
it too much, or a different kind of output? :)
Is your automated attacker using SQL to store attack data? I hope it's 
escaping input.. Is your attacker using stars in any commands ('grep 
foobar *')? Did you know you can have filenames that look like shell 
command flags and bash will uncritically pass them as arguments?
