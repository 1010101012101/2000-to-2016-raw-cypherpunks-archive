It's flatly weird to me to see which people are getting 
dragged into this and which ones aren't and which ones 
aren't *yet*. Something in the back of my brain is going, 
There's a Pattern Here.  And I even think the pattern is 
based on public communications. And I think the pattern 
applies in such a way that there are people it requires 
to get dragged into this, that haven't gotten dragged into 
it yet.  But I can't quite put my finger on what the pattern 
is.  So I've been digging through the cypherpunks archives 
trying to figure it out.  

Nothing yet.  Just a feeling.  And it could be purely 
subjective at that. It's a weird feeling, like trying to 
solve a really short vignere cryptogram; not really enough 
information to use anything but intuition, but something is 
there, right beneath the surface, that shows a pattern if 
you can only figure out what the pattern is.
