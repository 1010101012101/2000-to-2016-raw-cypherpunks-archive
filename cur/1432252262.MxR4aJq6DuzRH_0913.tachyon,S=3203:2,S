 >>I got back to the email universe to find 440 cypherpunks postings from
mattd.  Much as I love Ozzy anarchists I wasn't tempted to read them. Ken<<

Did you see the ones on 20/20? I haven't read them yet.Some Ozzie 
anarchists think I'm 'right-wing' for championing Jim Bell's APster.When 
the going gets weird...If you only read one make it the mattblog that ate 
cypherpunks...Oh and thanks for rubbing Peter traitor's and declan Mc 
Crapfest's (he's contributing to the security thread's even now!) names in 
it.We may house train them yet.

We've got to fight them in America, and one of the best ways to combat your 
enemy is to be alert and be mindful -- be situationally aware.
