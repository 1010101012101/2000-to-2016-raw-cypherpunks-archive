No, you're missing the point. The idea is not to just get _bodies_ 
paying their $600 or $1000 or whatever. That's just business as usual, 
with suits with Powerpoint on their laptops displaying pretty charts.

When I said get the main architects together in a room, with lots of 
beer, I meant that literally. I didn't mean a presentation at the 
Airport Hilton or wherever. I meant an intense brain-storming session. 
The beer to lubricate the "bullshits!" and "here's a better way"s.

Instead, you're just describing a "that's a start" scenario which is 
actually just a snooze-a-thon.

Little point in them just presenting a set of dry slides on what 
Morpheus is intended to do, blah blah blah.

This is what is missing from so many conferences: pizazz! Controversy, 
yelling, bullshit claims being denounced. (I'm not saying the Morpheus 
or Freenet or Mojo people are making bullshit claims, but it's clear 
that _some_ of the P2P/crypto players JUST DON'T GET IT.)

Rooms filled with comped (and bored) journalists, suits giving summaries 
of product plans, spooks from Washington outlining policy initiatives.

Fuck that noise.
