Man With Bin Laden Tattoo Being Held in O.C.
Inquiry: Authorities are trying to learn his identity. They won't say
whether charges have been filed.

Orange County investigators said Wednesday that they are trying to
determine the identity of a man arrested after the Sept. 11 hijacking
attacks who has a portrait of terrorist Osama bin Laden tattooed on his
chest.

Authorities released few details about the man, including where he is
being held and whether criminal charges have been filed against him.

But Orange County sheriff's officials said the man, who was allegedly
carrying false identification when arrested, was brought to the county
jail in the days after the attacks. There, deputies discovered a large
portrait of the terrorist emblazoned on his chest with the name "Osama
bin Laden" written below. Local and federal authorities are working to
determine whether the man is associated with Bin Laden or with the
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, said Orange County
Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo.
