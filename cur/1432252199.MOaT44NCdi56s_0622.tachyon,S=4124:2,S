I agree with what you say, especially regarding the frustration with 
TOR, but I am not sure it contradicts the message I tried to lay out 
in my post.

Secure browsing is one instance of anonymity applications, which, as 
I mentioned, is used. I completely agree that technology may not be 
mature enough for this other instance of anonymity applications, 
which is anonymous file sharing. My point was that there is a lot of 
anonymity-related technology that is not used, especially in the 
field of finance; I did not claim that there are technological 
solutions available for each and every anonymity problem out there. I 
apologize if this spirit was not communicated well.

It's not that we have everything - it's that we don't use most of 
what we do have, although we once spent a lot of efforts designing it.

Regards,
Hagai.
