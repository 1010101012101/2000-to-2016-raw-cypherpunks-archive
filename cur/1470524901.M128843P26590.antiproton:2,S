	OK. Mine was mostly a rhetorical question. Those 'measurements'
	are meaningful only for QM charlatans.

	This is what's going on : 

	You have a 'theory'. You make some 'measurements'. Now when you
	put together your 'theory' and your interpreted(!!)
	'measurements' you come to the conclusion that 'reality' is
	'absurd' or 'magical' or 'weird' or any other similar bullshit.

	You know what the problem is, and why you arrive to those
	conclusions? It is because your FUCKING theory is ABSURD, not
	reality. 

	The problem is the PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHICAL underlying
	assumptions, not 'reality'.

	No it isn't. Quantum mechanics is supposedly a branch of
	mechanics which in turn is a branch of PHYSICS. 

	I 'hinted' at the connection between math and physics
	above. Looks like you royally ignored my point.

	Anyway, considering that our premises premises are radically
	different, the discussion is rather pointless.

	See above.

	There are no 'paradoxes' - those are logical flaws in the
	FUCKING theories.

	My remark was sarcasm. There's only one kind of realism - the
	real one.
