Since I have no idea how old the "Jim" you cite is, and since I suspect 
you are less than 25 years old,  your claims are not very impressive.

We have had (and may still have) list members who were developing 
systems for the NSA in 1963, fully 37 years ago. (Cf. "Harvest" in 
Bamford's 1983 book. A hardy reader will known what I'm talking about.)

You twentysomething grad student should be very careful when talking 
about 'before either one of us was born." While probably true, of little 
significance.
