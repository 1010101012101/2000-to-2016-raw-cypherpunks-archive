Excerpt:

"Cryptocat is an enabling, positive technology, and its an alternative," 
said Jacob Appelbaum, a developer with the Tor project, which routes 
Web traffic in ways that help disguise sites that people have visited. 
"A key thing here is that it is an experiment, with valid criticisms. Its 
not perfect. But it is important that we have people who are interested 
and knowledgeable about computer security who are working on these 
things, not just for money, and not just to break into peoples computers."

The group met over the weekend at a code-a-thon organized by 
Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal, which has chronicled the 
spread of commercial surveillance in everyday technology in a vital 
series of articles and engaging online demonstrations called What 
They Know. A recent article in Wired magazine detailed big advances 
in United States government surveillance capabilities. Mr. Appelbaum 
and a documentary filmmaker, Laura Poitras, are holding a teach-in 
Friday evening at the Whitney Museum of American Art on the 
subject of surveillance. [Tony museum to host tony geeks!]

The invention of powerful tools to thwart the commercial and governmental 
collection of personal data has been criticized as creating hiding places 
for terrorists and online sexual predators. Mr. Kobeissi said he had been 
startled by those complaints. "Evil people have been evil forever," he said. 
"I dont think theyre going to stop being evil or become more evil because 
of Cryptocat."

He appears to be wide open and unguarded about himself.

"I love it when people criticize me," he said, pausing for a second and 
then amending his words. "When they criticize me technically."

His ambitions with Cryptocat are not financial, though he is trying to 
raise $2,000 to cover his costs for the next year. "Money is great, money 
is amazing," he said. "Its not like money is something I dont understand. 
I understand what it is. I care more about making something nice that 
people can use, and its free and it makes a difference."
