Subject: Freematt Interviews Financial Cryptographer Ian Grigg

It's too bad you didn't ask the juicy questions.  Systemics has recently
become embroiled in a lawsuit with e-gold and/or DigiGold, as the emails
below describe.  Former Friends Become Enemies!  Servers Being Seized!
Ian Trapped in Anguilla!

And all you can think of to ask is, where do you think you'll be in
ten years?  which authors influenced you?

You call this journalism?  Come on, enquiring minds want to know the dirt.
