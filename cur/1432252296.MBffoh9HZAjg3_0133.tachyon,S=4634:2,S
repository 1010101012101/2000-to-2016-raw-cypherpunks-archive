They'd love that, but know better.

Well, my wife has gotten 2 (!) flower pots for being the "in top 10
spenders" at our local grocery store.  They delivered to our door.
Couldn't do that if it wasn't a real address.

They do print out coupons based on products purchased - they try to
get you to buy competitors brands.  I don't know how much the competitors
pay for this service, but it's definitly tied into purchase patterns.

What will Ridge do with that info?  Who knows, but it ain't good.

But we have a military division devoted to psychowar.  I would assume
they'd use brand and product tracing to get a handle on how to freak
people out.

It will.  The dictatorship isn't quite as complete as they'd like.

Patience, persistence, truth,
