[Warning in advance: I don't run a remailer, and never have, so what
follows could be labled uninformed speculation].

I would like to suggest that a remailer could eliminate nearly all it's 
problems by only sending out encrypted mails - that is, if after 
removing the encryption that was applied using it's own private
key, it finds that the result is plaintext, it simply drops the message.

This has some neat and useful properties.

* It eliminates spam. Spammers would have to encrypt each individual
message with the key of the recipient, which is too much hassle.

* It eliminates any possibility of the remailer knowing the content, which
alleiviates him/her of responsibility for that content. 

* The remailer still operates fine as a mid-chain remailer.

* All recipients need to have keypairs. They are thus at least somewhat
crypto-savvy people, and unlikely to place unreasonable requests on
the remailer or his/her ISP.

The only bad point:

* All recipients need to have key pairs. Thus, a crypto-only remailer 
can't be a terminal remailer to mailing lists, newsgroups, or 
individuals without keypairs.
