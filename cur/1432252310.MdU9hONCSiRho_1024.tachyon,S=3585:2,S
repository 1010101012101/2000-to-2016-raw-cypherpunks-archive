Irrelevant. What the user wants strictly speaking is irrelevant at this
layer. This is the relationship between publishers and how they will
operate. The user requirements are a factor here but direct user input
isn't needed.

Your position is akin to saying that I as a book publisher must somehow
limit my activities with respect to content selection to only what the
customer or specific list of agents will allow. This violates my right
of ownership with respect to 'the press'.
