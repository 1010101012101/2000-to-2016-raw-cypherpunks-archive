This was the Pionner Venus Orbiter, built by Hughes and 
launched in 1978.

Wow, you TRW-government-contracting-no-holds-barred-
success-at-any-cost-if-you-have-to-ask-you-can't-afford-it guys have all the
fun.

Hughes Aircraft bought the diamond window on the Venus probe
nephelometer from DeBeers.  I remember that it was suggested to
the principle investigator that he could save a lot of money if he
used two smaller windows, but he was worried that they might  not
be the same temperature, so he splurged. I also remember that when
the probe landed on Venus the US Customs people refunded the
customs duty, since the diamond had been re-exported.
