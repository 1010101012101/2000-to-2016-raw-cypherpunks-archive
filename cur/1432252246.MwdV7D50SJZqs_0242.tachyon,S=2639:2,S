This may best be accomplished by placing the data offshore and empowering 
the db operators with some non-repudiatable right of disclosure (especially 
under duress of a warrant).

Some months back I discussed a procedural methodology where patrons could 
find out if their records hand been accessed in a way that circumvented 
court orders.  I was told that it might work but that frustrated 
prosecutors might press charges of conspiracy before the fact to evade 
lawful orders that 'might' be issued, even if the defendant had no 
reasonable expectation that this might occur.
