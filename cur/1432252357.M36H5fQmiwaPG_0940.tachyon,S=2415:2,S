I should've said: only in the 9th circuit, in states that
don't have a state constitutional provision regarding right
to keep and bear arms.  I believe the only state that falls
in that category is CA. 

Every other state in the 9th circuit has a constitutional 
provision that is usually even more explicit than the 2nd ammendment. 
Most explicitly state the /individual/ has the 
right to keep and bear arms (as opposed to "the people" which 
some courts have interpreted to mean "the state" or
state-approved/regulated militias). 

For example, NV is typical: "Every citizen has the right to keep 
and bear arms for security and defense, for lawful hunting and
recreational use and for other lawful purposes." Article 1, 
Section 11, Paragraph 1.
