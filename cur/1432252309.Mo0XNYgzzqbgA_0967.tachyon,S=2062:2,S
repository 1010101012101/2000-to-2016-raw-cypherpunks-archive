I remember a software company in my home town in the late '80's  that had it 
figured out.

They sold accounting software, it wasn't as spiffy as their competitor's 
(Quicken) but they sold it for .... $14.

For $14 dollars most any company would buy a copy just to try it out.

The owner made a handsome profit before selling the company to larger outfit.

I think they also sold other software the same way, they sold it cheap enough 
that people just spent the money to see if it was worth it.

to do)
