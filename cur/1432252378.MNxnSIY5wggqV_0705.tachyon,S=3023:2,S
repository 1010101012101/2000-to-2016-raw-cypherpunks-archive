	Yes. It is too much to ask.

	Those who will not learn from history are doomed to repeat 
the same questions.

	Which would be understandable if by "history" you meant a 2 
day discussion back in 1995.

	In this case, history was a 2 week long thread *LAST MONTH*.

A quote from Petro's Archives:   **********************************************
Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
