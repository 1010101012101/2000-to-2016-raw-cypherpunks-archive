<p><b><font color="#FF00FF" size="4">THE SCALE MOVED!!!</font></b><br>
<br>
Hello! My name is Marie Babbit and I would like to share my experience as an 
inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope.<br>
<br>
It’s amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simply 
don’t want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight problem for the better 
part of a decade.<br>
<br>
My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the 
refrigerator.<br>
<br>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked. 
At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or energy to 
respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder — If that thin, sexy,
 woman, in that short black dress — was really me? (My husband proposed to me 
in that dress 10 years ago) I didn’t even feel like that happy woman in the 
picture – I was exhausted and so depressed.<br>
<br>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I was 
too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I was 
tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day.<br>
<br>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting "career. 
" Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, &amp; even Phen-Phen, and 
the list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few days, then it was only 
a matter of time until I reached my breaking point and ended up eating vast 
quantities of the very foods I’d been denying myself. NOTHING worked for me 
until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try a product that was 
nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That product was called
<b><font color="#FF0000"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b>.<br>
<br>
After about five days on BerryTrim Plus, I began to experience a sense of 
"well being" with increased energy - I didn’t feel tired, irritable or 
sluggish. More Importantly, I didn't feel Hungry - something I hadn't felt for 
months, maybe years.<br>
<br>
I've been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought I had 
tried<br>
everything when...<br>
<br>
The Scale Moved!! I mean, really Moved! .<br>
<br>
I lost 126 pounds in 6 months.<br>
Within 6 months I dropped down to 156 pounds.<br>
<br>
Today, I can do many activities that I couldn't when I weighed 282 pounds. 
The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was! My doctor has examined me, 
and my weight loss has blown his mind! People that I used to work with and 
even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas! I truly wish everyone 
who is overweight knew about this program ... I plan to tell everyone I can 
who has struggled with his or her weight, like I have. I can feel your pain, 
believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the BerryTrim Plus program! It has given 
me a new lease on life… After losing 126 pounds so far, I feel very confident, 
happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I recently wore that same black cocktail dress I 
wore when my husband proposed - 10 years ago! (I guess that woman in the 
picture really was me!) I thought I would never look and feel like that again!
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#FF0000">BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b> is a powerful gift from 
nature that has touched every aspect of my life! And from the bottom of my 
heart, I will always thank my dear friend Judy for telling me about this 
wonderful product and giving me back the joy of living.<br>
<br>
IF I COULD DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT TOO!<br>
<br>
I was sick of being fat. I didn’t like the way I looked and I didn’t like the 
way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my four children,and myself 
to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you need to lose a few pounds, 
more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, click through this website 
thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for so many 
people like you and me!.The proof is in the pudding (so to speak) so take a 
look at the many success stories from others who have gained better health, 
improved their relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it 
off for good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this is 
something you are willing to try — GO FOR IT!!!!! You won't be sorry.. Do take 
the time to read them. Many are simply AMAZING!<br>
