I guess I don't think that's right.

Sooner, hopefully rather than later, machines will be able to buy things
from other machines using on-line cash.

The risk will be absorbed by having a multitude of underwriters of cash
instead of a single issuer for all cash, so you're partly right.

But the point is, you can have an authenticated on-line transaction, at
least at a risk low enough to move all kinds of money around safely.

Cheers,
RAH
