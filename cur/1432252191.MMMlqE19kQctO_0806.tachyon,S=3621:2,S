It comes from 'precede' to 'come first or before' as in importance or
scope of coverage (with respect to court authority).

The Constitution is clearly superior in authority over any and all courts
in America. Therefore any ruling they may emit must comply with the
Constitution. Quibling over whether that fits the strictest legal
definition of 'precedence' is nothing more than a strawman.

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
