If a sufficiently repressive government doesn't like what you say, you end
up with your ears lopped off, or you're dead and your family is tortured.

If the Corporate Media Barons don't like what you say, you get to keep
saying it.

Hope that helps put things in perspective.

It is true that there are government-imposed barriers to entry that
aid in keeping the media megaliths in power. But it is also true that
a heck of lot of Americans like what they get from the MMs (which must
respond to market demand at some level, after all), and it is also
true that the claims of MM appear to be loudest from leftist quarters
that have little novel to say anyway.
