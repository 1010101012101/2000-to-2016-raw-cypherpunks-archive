TBS Superstation Offers Unprecedented Look at U.S. Military Combat
  Scenarios in WAR GAMES.

  ATLANTA--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2000
  
  Reality television takes an exciting turn when TBS Superstation presents the
  first-ever in-depth original entertainment production detailing authentic
  combat-readiness military exercises.
  
  WAR GAMES offers a rare, up-close look at military competitions including
  air-to-air dogfighting, submarine warfare, urban combat and "live fire" 
  fighting
  exercises.
  
  This action-packed, two-hour original special, premiering in March 2001, is 
  being
  produced with the full cooperation of the United States military.
  
  "The unprecedented access and cooperation that TBS Superstation's cameras
  have received from the U.S. military will take our viewers to the front 
  lines of
  authentic combat exercises," said Jim Head, senior vice president of 
original
  programming for the Superstation. "WAR GAMES fits perfectly into our 
strategy
  of providing exciting, high-profile and provocative original programming 
that
  appeals to the Regular Guy and the people in his life. We are already 
  looking at
  this special as a pilot for a potential series."
  
  WAR GAMES will present four different combat scenarios, with commentators
  reporting from each competition, as well as personal stories from the
  participating military troops.
  
  The following are descriptions of the four games scheduled to be included 
  in TBS
  Superstation's WAR GAMES:
  
  RED FLAG
  
  After Vietnam, the United States Air Force created Red Flag, an air-to-air 
and
  air-to-ground military exercise designed to better train pilots for the 
  high-stress,
  high-action situations they often confront in combat. In this scenario, 
pilots
  engage in a dogfight over the Nevada desert before diving into "enemy" 
  territory in
  an attempt to bomb an airfield.
  
  WOLF HUNT
  
  Enemy submarines claimed 80 percent of the ships sunk in World War II--and
  the threat of subs is just as potent today. The United States Navy conducts
  critical anti-submarine warfare exercises off the coast of San Diego in this
  exercise, in which two helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft must locate 
and
  sink an enemy submarine before the submarine sinks our battleship.
  
  JRTC (Joint Readiness Training Center)
  
  Increasingly, military operations are conducted in cities and towns. 
  Recognizing
  this, the United States Army built an entire mock town to train troops in
  urbanized warfare. In this realistic 11-day war game, U.S. forces must 
rescue a
  town and its residents from hostile forces, as soldiers are exposed to the
  hazards of urbanized warfare, including civilians and media on the field of 
  battle.
  
  CAX (COMBINED ARMED EXERCISES)
  
  CAX features the United States Marine Corps in a three-day, locked and 
loaded,
  live-fire deployment involving thousands of Marines. In this exercise, 
Marines
  must first assault and occupy enemy territory, then defend it against a
  counter-assault in the California desert.
  
  Executive producers for War Games are J.J. Jamieson and John Barchilon. Mike
  Sears is directing and David Hudson is producing. WAR GAMES is produced by
  Grindstone Productions and Avenue Pictures Television.
  
  TBS Superstation is the TV Haven for the Regular Guy. Turner Broadcasting
  System, Inc.'s flagship entertainment network, the Superstation reaches 80.7
  million households and is cable's most-watched network, a position it has 
held
  for 23 consecutive years. TBS Superstation offers high-profile original 
  movies and
  series, blockbuster movies, popular series and sports, all reflecting the 
  attitudes,
  tastes, values and beliefs of the Regular Guy and the people in his life. 
The
  Superstation's Web site is located at TBSsuperstation.com.
