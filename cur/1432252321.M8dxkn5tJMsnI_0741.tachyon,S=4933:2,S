"distort the forces ..."   Lord!  No!  Don't let them do that!

Geez, Tim.  What happened to personal responsibility?  Who gives two
bits what "forces" will be upon them.  They will ultimately still
have to cast a vote which they were casting just days earlier.  Who
cares if idiots spend billions to sway a few thousand votes.  That's
THEIR problem.  It's free speech, as you have claimed in the past.

I still don't get this uproar over re-doing something that was fishy.
Who's rights are being trampled upon by this?

Ern
