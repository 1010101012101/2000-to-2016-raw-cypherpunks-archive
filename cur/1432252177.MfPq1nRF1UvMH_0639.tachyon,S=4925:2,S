Classification are internal handling rules. The gov can stamp top
secret on their copy of my private or public doc and do what they
want with it (subject possibly to my copyright/license/patent/etc
stamp, charges of theft/1stAmend etc to copy/take my copy,).
They don't have any purview over my copy, unless mine is
stolen, copied, etc where it might be a crime itself.
It's not been tried because it seems covered by the 1stAmend.
Ref also: Banned books lists, cypherpunks list, Cryptome, etc.
So besides the usual "we'd really like if you didn't publish that" and
co-op'd self-censor, has forced classification ever been done, links?

I don't think his work was gov funded and/or classified, and believe
it was cooperatively self-censored, with no known full release (JYA
would have been all over that if so, and was not party to the media
or quasi-gov  consultations/releases). The funding part would be
noted in the uncensored version of the papers, which also seem
hard to find... ie: where is the canonical distribution point?
