Quoting your own source:

"Donald Bagart of Texas became the first professional software engineer in
the U.S. on September 4, 1998 or October 9, 1998. As of May 2002, Texas
had issued 44 professional enginering licenses for software engineers.

"The professional movement has been criticized for many reasons.

"* Licensed software engineers must learn years of physics and
chemistry to pass the exams, which is irrelevant to most software
practitioners."

This is exactly what the ACM gripes about.  In order to use the title
"engineer" in the Great State of Texas you have to pass examinations
relevant to classical engineering (civil, mechanical, etc) but wholly
irrelevant to software engineering.
