When someone initiates force, they have "earned" a physical reaction.

So?  That people are coerced shows only that they value coerced life
more than resistance at that point.  This is how the coercers exist.

That is called losing a war.  Historically, males were killed, children
and women enslaved.  It has nothing to do with morality, only with what
the winners can get way with.

You're mistaking the long and continuing history of force-based atrocities
with 
morality.

I still maintain: the transition from an dispersed agricultural to urban
'civilization' does not need central control or forceful coercion.

[And this bums me out --I loathe cities.]

Similarly the transition to 'service' economy, as other 'civilizations' take
over industrial production because they can do so more efficiently
("cheaper"), 
and intercivilization trade is somewhat free, is *natural*.
