AN anti-corruption authority yesterday raised the alarm on security of 
computerised student records at universities around the nation after it 
spotted weaknesses at all 10 public universities in NSW.
The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption report on university 
security was based on an inquiry into the unauthorised cancellation of 
students' failed subjects in their academic records at the University of 
Technology Sydney. All other NSW universities were surveyed as part of the 
inquiry into 21 academic record changes for 11 fee-paying Indonesian 
students, which found corruption in the cases of nine of the students.
Deficiencies such as "too many staff with access to modify or create 
records", infrequent checks of access and removing ex-employees' access 
were found in the universities in NSW.
ICAC recommended that state prosecutors consider charging a former employee 
of the UTS Graduate School of Business, Toto Sujanto, with bribery and 
unlawfully altering computer records.
He allegedly obtained $8000 in cash for changing subject failures to 
cancellations.
ICAC commissioner Irene Moss said the report "does raise questions for 
other Australian universities".
