On the PostgreSQL database mailing list <a href=3D"mailto:pgsql-general@pos=
tgresql.org">pgsql-general@postgresql.org</a> ,<br>
they are discussing a Code of Conduct.<br>
<br>
A reference and discussion came up around <a href=3D"http://contributor-cov=
enant.org" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">contributor-covenant.org</a=
> and<br>
it seems many (allegedly 1000&#39;s of &quot;open source projects&quot; hav=
e<br>
&quot;adopted&quot; it, and there appears to quite the campaign to &quot;en=
courage&quot;<br>
the PostgreSQL project to likewise adopt that particular agreement.<br>
<br>
The pgsql old hands appear to have rejected it. This is a rare thing<br>
AFAICT. There are a few issues raised about the so-called &quot;contributor=
<br>
covenant&quot; which have very clearly, and repeatedly, not been responded<=
br>
to, and this has been pointed out, more than once.<br>
<br>
Those who chaperone one or more &quot;open source&quot; project mailing lis=
ts<br>
may wish to bring themselves up to speed with this so-called<br>
&quot;covenant&quot; before the steamroller hits your group/ list/ communit=
y,<br>
since it seems inevitable at this point.<br>
<br>
Being riveted and enraptured by concepts of &quot;enforcement&quot;,<br>
&quot;protection&quot; of &quot;the marginalized peoples&quot; and as y&#39=
;all know, my<br>
raving crusade to further promote &quot;political correctness&quot;, I figu=
red I<br>
should go and read this &quot;covenant&quot; to find out what all the fuss =
might<br>
be about and add some scare quotes at appropriate places.<br>
<br>
So I went and read it.<br>
<br>
It simply, abso-firetruckingly, demands a response, and beyond what<br>
appears to have currently been tippy toe on eggshells burped out so<br>
far.<br>
<br>
Here is my first draft to respond to it, I encourage others to refine<br>
my oh-so-subtle analysis, but most importantly to bring yourself up to<br>
speed with the PC-speak which might freight train into one or more of<br>
your &quot;open source&quot; worlds in the relatively near future; informed=
<br>
ahead of time may be enough to be armed against long and actually<br>
divisive email discussions, as internet searching sadly tells.<br>
<br>
The below is my second woeful attempt to bring some sanity to that<br>
&quot;covenant&quot;. It needs your improvements.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; Contributor Covenant<br>
&gt;&gt; A Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects.<br>
<br>
Sounds reasonable.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Open Source has always been a foundation of the Internet, and with=
 the advent<br>
&gt;&gt; of social open source networks this is more true than ever.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s hope free libre and open source software - FLOSS, stays as the fo=
undation<br>
of the Internet!<br>
<br>
&quot;social open source networks&quot; - what?? Facebook social network??<=
br>
<br>
Use of new terminology, without explaining that terminology, and<br>
presuming it is known and well understood terminology, in a document<br>
you are pushing as a new and additional &quot;social contract&quot; which o=
thers<br>
are pressed upon to adopt and enforce, is IMHO passive aggressive.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; But free, libre, and open source projects suffer from a startling =
lack of<br>
&gt;&gt; diversity, with dramatically low participation by women, people of=
 color, and<br>
&gt;&gt; other marginalized populations.<br>
<br>
Those who have an interest in promoting, assisting, sponsoring and generall=
y<br>
facilitating &quot;the diversity&quot; within this particular libre softwar=
e<br>
project or mailing list,<br>
are welcome to do so and in general, ought be supported to the extent that =
their<br>
actions and words are neither actively nor passively aggressive towards any=
<br>
member of this mailing list, and are actually supportive of the<br>
technical goals of<br>
this project.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Part of this problem<br>
<br>
Lack of diversity may be viewed as a problem.<br>
<br>
Such a viewpoint is a personal, individual matter. Your personal, individua=
l<br>
opinion on this matter may be discussed, but in general is off topic for th=
is<br>
mailing list.<br>
<br>
Speaking or writing that &quot;lack of diversity is a problem&quot;, and ev=
en moreso,<br>
building the presumption into the words of a so-called &quot;social covenan=
t&quot;, where<br>
that presumption is almost hidden and &quot;not up for debate&quot;, is a p=
assive<br>
aggressive approach to communication with others who may or may not<br>
disagree with this position.<br>
<br>
Passive aggressive communication is not welcome on this mailing list.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; lies with the very structure of some projects:<br>
<br>
What is &quot;the very structure of a project&quot;? This phrase is too gen=
eric, and not<br>
explained, despite the next part of that sentence which follows below, whic=
h<br>
appears to pretend to answer (or define) the phrase - it does not.<br>
<br>
Phrases and terminologies used out of context and having indefinite and vag=
ue<br>
meanings, is a sign of passive aggressive communication and all<br>
members of this mailing list are encourage to ridicule such<br>
communication.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; the use of insensitive language, thoughtless use of pronouns, assu=
mptions of<br>
&gt;&gt; gender, and even sexualized or culturally insensitive names.<br>
<br>
Although certain social niceties are encouraged on this mailing list, they =
are<br>
not required and indeed firm, clear and precise languaging is valued and<br=
>
encouraged.<br>
<br>
If you are overly sensitive, or in need (or desire) of an emotionally sensi=
tive<br>
environment, then consider another mailing list - this mailing list is like=
ly<br>
not for you, and if you are in need of any professional help, you are encou=
raged<br>
and indeed required to seek professional medical and or psychological advic=
e<br>
and or support.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Marginalized people also suffer some of the unintended consequence=
s of<br>
&gt;&gt; dogmatic insistence on meritocratic principles of governance.<br>
<br>
There are forums and mailing lists which are suitable for those who have<br=
>
learning difficulties (reference?), for those who need an emotionally sensi=
tive<br>
environment (be sure to check if you need professional medical or<br>
psychological support), and for those who are beginniners in the field of<b=
r>
technology discussed on this mailing list.<br>
<br>
In all of these cases, this mailing list is not for you, and you will be<br=
>
encouraged to leave if we discover that any of these conditions apply to yo=
u.<br>
<br>
Take note, we heartily welcome the opportunity to joust against your best<b=
r>
attempts to otherwise deceive us in regards to such conditions applying to =
you,<br>
although in general in such cases, please expect derision and ridicule for<=
br>
wasting our time in such circumstances.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Studies have shown that organizational cultures that value meritoc=
racy often<br>
&gt;&gt; result in greater inequality.<br>
<br>
This is a baseless assertion. Provide the references or go away. Such<br>
an unsupported, unreferenced and &#39;plastic&#39; attempt to dominate our<=
br>
community into conforming, acting and behaving according to your<br>
standards is unwelcome in the extreme, and grounds for the ridicule of<br>
you.<br>
<br>
In any case, this mailing list is for those who have a minimum intermediate=
<br>
skill and understanding in the programming languages and technologies for<b=
r>
which it has been established, and is explicitly not for those who are over=
ly<br>
sensitive and need an emotionally supportive environment - we might have<br=
>
a laugh, and it may be at your expense, so if you can&#39;t laugh at yourse=
lf,<br>
this mailing list is definitely not for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; People with &quot;merit&quot; are often excused for their bad beha=
vior in public spaces<br>
&gt;&gt; based on the value of their technical contributions.<br>
<br>
You may join this mailing list, but by doing so you agree to speak clearly =
and<br>
assertively if you feel offended, or otherwise to respectfully leave the ma=
iling<br>
list, as it is unmoderated and uncensored, although discussion is generally=
<br>
sought to be on topic, and for offtopic digressions to be kept short and ta=
ken<br>
offlist or to an alternate list if they persist.<br>
<br>
Additionally, your consideration that this mailing list is a public<br>
space, is only partially correct. This mailing list is a list which is<br>
open to conditional membership, and the list administrator reserves<br>
the right to ban you temporarily and or permanently at any time, but<br>
with prior notice and opportunity for discussion given on this mailing<br>
list.<br>
<br>
Take Notice further that the discussions had by members of this<br>
mailing list are archived publicly, so to this extent the list may be<br>
considered public, whilst it is strictly a members only mailing list<br>
who choose to have certain public discussions, which may include<br>
attempting to ridicule -you-, so obtain a temporary membership to this<br>
email mailing list only after very careful consideration by you. If<br>
you are at all unsure of your suitability to our list, we are happy to<br>
help you decide by analysing your proposed introduction email of<br>
yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Meritocracy also naively assumes a level playing field, in which e=
veryone has<br>
&gt;&gt; access to the same resources, free time, and common life experienc=
es to draw<br>
&gt;&gt; upon.<br>
<br>
The sentence above is another passive-aggressive, presumption filled projec=
ted<br>
assertion.<br>
<br>
Such communication has no place on this mailing list, except as the target =
of<br>
naming the presumptions, highlighting the passive aggressive nature and<br>
generally tearing it to shreads and providing an opportunity for the<br>
mailing list members to laugh like hyenas.<br>
<br>
- &gt;&gt; &quot;Meritocracy naively assumes&quot;<br>
<br>
Meritocracy does no such thing - it is not a person.<br>
<br>
- &gt;&gt; &quot;Meritocracy also naively assumes a level playing field,&qu=
ot;<br>
<br>
Meritocracy does no such thing - in fact it is the opposite - meritocracy i=
s a<br>
socio political agreement, contract=C2=A0 and or requirement that participa=
nts in the<br>
system shall be judged based on their technical merit and or<br>
performance. In our case, slow performance is entirely acceptable, you<br>
are under no requirement nor expectation to make contributions<br>
according to any schedule, only on your own free time and personal<br>
pleasure.<br>
<br>
Making any assertion to the contrary is passive aggressive,<br>
manipulative, and shall be joyously and most light heartedly<br>
attacked in words.<br>
<br>
- &gt;&gt; &quot;in which everyone has access to the same resources, free t=
ime,&quot;<br>
<br>
No such assumptions are made on this mailing list, and quite the contrary<b=
r>
- if you have very little free time for example, or a slow computer, then w=
e<br>
will certainly expect that your contributions may be few and far between<br=
>
as compared with someone who has loads of free time or a faster computer<br=
>
than you.<br>
<br>
If you are experiencing free time and resources problems, then this list is=
<br>
DEFINITELY not the place for you - you are explicitly instructed to seek<br=
>
professional time management advice as well as professional financial<br>
counselling. DO NOT bring such personal problems to this mailing list, as t=
hey<br>
will be used as instant grounds for removal and for barring from the<br>
list, although more likely simply as grounds for ridicule and laughing<br>
like hyenas.<br>
<br>
- &gt;&gt; &quot;and common life experiences to draw upon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, &quot;meritocracy&quot; (to the extent we can personify a socio=
 political<br>
system), and &quot;we&quot; the members of this mailing list in particular,=
 make no such<br>
assumptions whatsoever, and we more importantly, put no such requirements u=
pon<br>
you.<br>
<br>
So sleep tight, it&#39;s all alright, we won&#39;t hold your differing life=
<br>
experiences against you, in fact we may be intrigued, but if a<br>
particular experience you share starts to cause an extended off topic<br>
discussion, take notice that we reserve the right to calmly let you<br>
know this so that we can get back to the topics intended for this<br>
mailing list.<br>
<br>
This list may be a platform, but at most only for those robust enough<br>
to hold their own on the topic they make a post about.<br>
<br>
If you join this mailing list, you are strongly encouraged to communicate y=
our<br>
personal concerns and problems, needs and requirements at the earliest stag=
e<br>
possible, preferably in in your introduction email with a well<br>
identified subject<br>
line.<br>
<br>
Then we will be able to readily assess whether this mailing list is<br>
suitable for you or whether you need to find another, more appropriate<br>
environment in which to express yourself and or to find a &quot;contributio=
n<br>
space&quot; which is suitable for your needs.<br>
<br>
If you are unsure, then you are welcome to introduce yourself in this way,<=
br>
and we will respectfully assess your suitability to the mailing list as bes=
t<br>
we can.<br>
<br>
Take notice that we are not professionals in any field, indeed we are<br>
amateurs that might be in your personal medical or other interests to<br>
NOT associate with, and that if you require any professional advice,<br>
medical or otherwise, then you are required to seek such advice from<br>
suitably certificated professionals in your area - we on this mailing<br>
list cannot help you in such circumstances and if you fail to inform<br>
us of any such problems and or issues you may have that you consider<br>
we would otherwise be responsible for, then you may be in breech of<br>
the legislation in your jurisdiction - deceive the members of this<br>
mailing list at your own legal liability.<br>
<br>
On this mailing list, robust communication is a prime valued<br>
contribution - if you are actively wanting to improve your emotional<br>
robustness, this mailing list could possibly be a suitable place for<br>
you - feel free to ask us about this specifically in relation to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; These factors and more make contributing to open<br>
&gt;&gt; source a daunting prospect for many people,<br>
<br>
If your emotional strength, your social and or communication capacity, and =
or<br>
your psychological needs are an issue in any way, you are not welcome on th=
is<br>
mailing list and we require you to seek professional medical advice.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; especially women and other underrepresented people. (For more crit=
ical<br>
&gt;&gt; analysis of meritocracy, refer to this entry on the Geek Feminism =
wiki.)<br>
<br>
If you have any trigger words, emotional weaknesses and or sensitivities wh=
ich<br>
may cause you to have any reaction whatsoever, you are required to inform t=
he<br>
members of this mailing list in an introduction email if you do join the li=
st,<br>
and if you are required to do so, you must seek professional medical and or=
<br>
psychological advice and support - this mailing list is most likely an<br>
inappropriate place for you to join, and we continue to encourage ourselves=
<br>
to not hold back in reminding you this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; A Small Step Forward<br>
&gt;&gt; An easy way to begin addressing this problem<br>
<br>
You may have some problem, and this mailing list not the place for you to f=
ix<br>
your problem. Only technical matters related to the technical topic of this=
<br>
mailing list are appropriate problems for fixing in discussions on this<br>
mailing list.<br>
<br>
Seek professional advice when you need it, including professional<br>
advice regarding the technical topic of this mailing list if that is what y=
ou<br>
require - this mailing list is for non professionals with at least moderate=
<br>
technical competence, all members are volunteers, all members participate a=
t<br>
their own discretion and with no obligations upon them and with no obligati=
ons<br>
whatsoever to you, including courtesy which is valued, but not<br>
required - enter at your own risk.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; is to be overt in our openness, welcoming all people to contribute=
, and<br>
&gt;&gt; pledging in return to value them as human beings and to foster an =
atmosphere<br>
&gt;&gt; of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.<br>
<br>
This we agree with - we, the members of this mailing list, proclaim our<br>
intention to welcome all people to contribute, and to value each member as =
a<br>
human being. We encourage each other to foster an atmosphere of kindness,<b=
r>
cooperation and understanding, and robustness in communication -<br>
passive aggressive communication, despite the best intentions of the<br>
one making such passive aggressive communication, has no place in our<br>
community.<br>
<br>
And take notice - persistent bad behaviour, &#39;bad&#39; by the assessment=
 of<br>
the members alone and discussed publicly on this mailing list, shall<br>
be cause for temporary and or permanent banning from this mailing<br>
list.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The Contributor Covenant can be one way to express these values. P=
ledge your<br>
&gt;&gt; respect and appreciation for contributors and participants in your=
 open<br>
&gt;&gt; source project by adding an explicit CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to your pr=
oject<br>
&gt;&gt; repository.<br>
<br>
Respect, kindness and cooperation are good things, but this<br>
&quot;<a href=3D"http://contributor-covenant.org/" rel=3D"noreferrer" targe=
t=3D"_blank">http://contributor-covenant.org/</a>&quot; &quot;contributor c=
ovenant&quot; to which we hereby<br>
respond, is in no way or shape getting into our project&#39;s repository wi=
thout<br>
this our response.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The Contributor Covenant uses semantic versioning for revisions so=
 all URLs<br>
&gt;&gt; are permanent. Previous versions are available here: 1.0, 1.1, and=
 1.2<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Using the Contributor Covenant<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; We recommend that you add the Markdown or text version of the Cont=
ributor<br>
&gt;&gt; Covenant to your source code repository at the root level.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks to Simon Vansintjan there is an automated way to add Contri=
butor<br>
&gt;&gt; Covenant to your project. Assuming that you have node installed, s=
imply run<br>
&gt;&gt; the following two commands from your project folder:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0npm install -g covgen<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0covgen your_email_address<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; You may want to add language similar to this to introduce your cod=
e of conduct:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Please note that this project is released with =
a Contributor Code of<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Conduct. By participating in this project you a=
gree to abide by its<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0terms.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; You may also use the permalinks given above to reference from your=
 project<br>
&gt;&gt; home page.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Important! You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the=
 document<br>
&gt;&gt; so that people know how to report violations.=C2=A0 Enforcing the =
Contributor<br>
&gt;&gt; Covenant<br>
<br>
This above paragraph does not quite feel right. If the members of this mail=
ing<br>
list are so anti-social that genuine &quot;social problems&quot; cannot be =
resolved on the<br>
mailing list itself, then this &quot;community&quot; of members is quite li=
kely beyond<br>
repair without substantial work by robust individuals with a passion to hea=
l the<br>
community - if you are not such an individual, then you best leave that job=
 to<br>
comeone who is, and take yourself to a kinder, gentler happy place.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Do not simply add the Contributor Covenant to your project and ass=
ume that<br>
&gt;&gt; any problems with civility, harassment, or discrimination will be =
solved. As<br>
&gt;&gt; a project maintainer you must be committed to enforcing the code o=
f conduct.<br>
<br>
There may be a time and place for banning members from this mailing list,<b=
r>
temporarily and or permanently, but such discussions shall continue to be<b=
r>
public, on the mailing list itself and open to discussion and<br>
contribution by all members. No duty is incumbent upon any member,<br>
including the &quot;project maintainer&quot; - if the community can&#39;t w=
ork out<br>
its problems, it is unfair to place such a burden upon such a one<br>
individual.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; A code of conduct without enforcement sends a false signal that yo=
ur project<br>
&gt;&gt; is welcoming and inclusive, and can create a dangerous situation f=
or<br>
&gt;&gt; marginalized people who participate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marginalized people&quot; who are not competent to contribute on some=
<br>
technical level (which includes documentation writing, testing as well<br>
as programming), are not welcome - we the members of this mailing list<br>
are volunteers and, on this particular mailing list, are not willing<br>
to tutor those who have special needs - do not join the mailing list<br>
in such circumstances, there are other, appropriate forums, mailing<br>
lists and learning institutions which you ought apply to.<br>
<br>
Genuinely anti-social communication is actively discouraged, and this inclu=
des<br>
those who communicate deceptively regarding their own needs and or social<b=
r>
environment requirements, as well as those who communicate in a passive<br>
aggressive way. If you this any of these types of communication may apply t=
o<br>
you, then be prepared to suffer the consequences should you join this maili=
ng<br>
list - we shall roast you in words, with glee!<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Adding the Contributor Covenant to a project places responsibility=
 on the<br>
&gt;&gt; project team that must not be taken lightly.<br>
<br>
Since the archives of this mailing list are public, should you have even th=
e<br>
smallest concern regarding your own robustness in public communication, the=
n you<br>
are invited to browse those archives and make an assessment as to whether y=
ou<br>
are a suitable candidate to join this mailing list. If you do decide to joi=
n,<br>
you are required to make your first email an introduction, which introducti=
on<br>
includes a reference to your assessment of the archives as well as any need=
s you<br>
feel that the members of this list ought be able to meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Before adopting the Contributor Covenant take the time to discuss =
and decide<br>
&gt;&gt; how to deal with problems as they emerge. Document the policy and =
procedure<br>
<br>
Oh, we&#39;ve taken the time, and &quot;problems as they emerge&quot; shall=
 be<br>
handled publicly, on this mailing list! To the extent we the members<br>
of this maliing list consider you a problem, passive aggressive or<br>
otherwise, we WILL handle you, publicly, with the one caveat that all<br>
members are in general expected to show respectful consideration in<br>
respect of all private or &quot;off-list&quot; communications.<br>
<br>
If you are uncomfortable with this policy, you are encouraged to find a mor=
e<br>
suitable community to join.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; for enforcement, and add it to your README or in another visible, =
appropriate<br>
&gt;&gt; place. Consider if your project team has the willingness and matur=
ity to<br>
&gt;&gt; follow through on your enforcement procedures.<br>
<br>
A &quot;community&quot; that requires any significant policing, particularl=
y<br>
clandestine policing, has lost its way - the tyranny of the majority<br>
is not the healthiest way, in the opinion of some members - speak<br>
clearly, speak the truth, and seek a fair response; if you don&#39;t<br>
receive a fair response, another community might be much less work for<br>
you, even if it provides less opportunities for emotional growth for<br>
you.<br>
