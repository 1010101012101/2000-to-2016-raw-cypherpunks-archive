That herd behavior is disappointing but customary cowardice.

Worse happened after 9/11. Many once valiant FOI fighters cleansed
their websites and heralded the need to obey the war-mongerers, and
urgently cautioned others as if the propaganda was believable.

No doubt, this self-censorship is market-driven to please
funders, advertizers and publishers who dare not displease their
dinner companions at Aspen, Davos, Bohemian Grove, and for
sure the DC centroid of privileged access to valuable information,
much of it spy boosting leakage of the Snowden type.

The heavy censorship of the Snowden documents by the hoarders
and their extremely slow pace of release while rhetorizing and
hyping the minimalist product fits this spy-favorite marketing
schemata.

NPR is not what it used to appear to be. It has booted and censored
a slew of its reporters, editors and contributors. Not alone, the
journalism industry is panicked at loss of customers and is rushing
to cleanse its harem. Poor discards are deperately seeking Omidyar
and Soros invitation to their opium dens as if from frying pan into
the fire.
