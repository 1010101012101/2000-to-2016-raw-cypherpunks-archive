It seems that Qualcomm is bouncing all multipart mime messages. I have bounces of PGP/MIME messages, multipart/alternative messages (text & html), & a poorly formatted multipart/mixed that only had one part which was the text of the message.

This seems to be a rather anal approach to filtering out potential virus. Considering that Qualcomm is a member of the IMC (Internet Mail Consortium) it would be funny if not so sad.
