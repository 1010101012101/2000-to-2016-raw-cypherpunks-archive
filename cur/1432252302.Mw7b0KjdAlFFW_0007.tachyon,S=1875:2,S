"A way that works *in theory* would involve ...".  The chances of any vendor
of mass-market software shipping an MUA where the user has to enter a password
just to send mail are approximately... zero.

In that case you can just filter by sender IP address or something (anything)
that's simpler than requiring a PKI.  Again though, that's just another
variant of the "Build a big wall" dream.  In order to have perimeter security
you first need a perimeter.  If the spammer you're trying to defend against is
your own mother (because she clicked on an attachment you sent her, it says so
in the From: address, that's actually a spam-bot), you don't have a perimeter.
All you have is a big pile of Manchurian candidates waiting to bite you.

Peter.
