Everyone does this openly over here.  Anything less than $500k or so
isn't even worth thinking about, since as a kidnap victim, you're sold
for about that much.

I really don't see why it's worthy of an article.

I've been buying cash from other contractors, as well as providing
cash on a short-term loan or wire basis, and these activities are
common as well.

It would be a good environment to deploy various electronic payment
systems, but nothing is really up to snuff for the kind of things
people do here -- large sums, and making purchases from existing
online vendors.
