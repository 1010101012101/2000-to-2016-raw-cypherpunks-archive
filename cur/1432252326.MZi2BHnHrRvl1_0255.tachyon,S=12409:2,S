Subject: [FD] Wall of Sheep Speaker Workshops at DEF CON 23 CFP Now Open
To: undisclosed-recipients:;

#Overview
The Wall of Sheep would like to announce a call for presentations at DEF
CON 23 at the Paris and Bally's Hotels in Las Vegas, NV from Friday, August
7th to Sunday, August 9th. The Wall of Sheep will be delivering talks that
increase security awareness and provide skills that can be immediately
applied after the conference. Our audience ranges from those who are new to
security to the most seasoned practitioners in the security industry.
Introductory talks are welcome.

Topics of interest include:
* Tools on network sniffing, intrusion detection and monitoring, forensics
* Tools for data collection (e.g., Yara, Cuckoo Sandbox)
* Python or Ruby programming for security practitioners
* Hardening the enterprise using open source tools
* Getting multi-vendor tools working together
* Tool/task automation and optimization
* Incident response process and procedures

This year, all accepted talks will be announced, recorded, and published by
DEF CON Communications, Inc (yes, by the conference).

The Wall of Sheep will not accept product or vendor related pitches. If
your talk is a thinly-veiled advertisement for a product or service your
company is offering, please do not apply!

#Speaking Format
Each presentation slot is 1 hour, including time for Q&A.  If we have time
and it is in line with our goals mentioned above, then there is a good
chance you will be selected.

##To submit a presentation, please provide the following information in the
form below to cfp2015[at]wallofsheep[dot]com

Primary Speaker Name:

Primary Speaker Title and Company (if applicable):

Primary Speaker Email Address:

Primary Speaker Phone Number (to contact you if necessary during the
conference):

Primary Speaker Twitter name (if you want it known if you are accepted):

Primary Speaker Facebook page (if you want it known if you are accepted):

Additional Speakers' name(s), titles, and social information:

Additional Email Addresses:

Is there a specific day or time you MUST speak by?

Name of Presentation:

Abstract:
Your abstract will be used for the website and printed materials. Summarize
what your presentation will cover. Attendees will read this to get an idea
of what they should know before your presentation, and what they will learn
after. Use this to inform about how technical your talk is. This abstract
is the primary way people will be drawn to your session. CFP reviews like
to see what tools will be used and what materials you suggest to read in
advance to get the most out of your presentation.

Equipment Needs & Special Requests:
The Wall of Sheep will provide 1 projector feed, and microphones. If you
need to use multiple outputs for a demo, please mention this below.

Speaker's Bio(s):
This text will be used for the website and printed materials and should be
written in the third person. Cover any professional history that is
relevant to the presentation, including past jobs, tools that you have
written, etc. Let people know who you are and why you are qualified to
speak on your topic. Presentations that are submitted without biographies
will not be considered.

Detailed Outline:
You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and
navigation through your talk.  Show how you intend to begin, where you
intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. The outline may
be provided in a separate attachment and may be as simple as a text file or
as detailed as a "bare bones" presentation. The better your outline then
the better we are able to best review your presentation against other
submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).  SUBMISSION
NOTE: Presentations that are submitted without abstracts, outlines, or
speaker bios (e.g., that have only PDFs, PPTs, or white papers attached or
only point to a URL) will not be considered.

Supporting File(s):
Additional supporting materials such as code, white papers, proof of
concept, etc. should be sent along with this email to
cfp2015[at]wallofsheep[dot]com. Note that additional files that may help in
the selection process should be included. We are not asking for a complete
presentation for this initial submission.  That will only be required if
you are selected for presenting.

accept these terms by inserting your name in the appropriate area,
