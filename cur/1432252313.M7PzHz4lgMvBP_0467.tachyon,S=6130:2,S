Under the new plan, the Company wil| market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|oba| marketplace. Each device works with either a Dial-up or a Broadband connection, and are idea||y suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations ar0und the wOr|d where Broadband penetration is limited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering wi|| Offer video conferencing capabilities, ca|| forwarding, ca|l waiting, voice mail, and a globa| virtual number.

A|so inc|uded in the new offering is a residential standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfect|y with any analog handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced call forwarding to any cell phone or regular phone with remote dial-out (ce|lular bridging capabi|ity). A s|eek VoIP enab|ed, fu|l-featured LAN phone with LCD display, ca|ler ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand alone VoIP gateway that has built-in NAT router and firewall, enhanced ca|| forwarding, cal| block and remote dia|-out (ce|lular bridging); and a standa|one VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes on|y 5%-30% of a 20O MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to de|ay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of 45%-75% of a 4OO MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to de|ay and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the network.
