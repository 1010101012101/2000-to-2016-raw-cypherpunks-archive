   I'm reading a book called "Bangkok 8" by John Burdett, it's a mystery, and I
don't usually read them, but heard a review on npr and picked it up at the
library, main character is a Thai detective who'se mother was a Bangkok
prostitute and father an American GI on leave from VietNam. Fun read. 
   Anyway, there's one part where the cop is remembering the teachings of his
abbot -- he was a Buddhist monk before becoming a cop, a drug dealer before
becoming a monk -- where the abbot says: 
  "There will be a massive shift of power from West to East in the middle of the
twenty-first century, caused not by war or economics, but by a suble alteration
of consciousness....the internal destruction of Western society will have
reached such a pass that most of your resources will be concentrated on managing
loonies."
