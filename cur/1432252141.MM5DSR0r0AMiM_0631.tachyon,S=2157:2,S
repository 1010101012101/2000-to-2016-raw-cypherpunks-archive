For this kind of system, I think it's really hard to get much security from 
the people at the endpoints of the chain of anonymizers.  Specifically, if 
the attacker has control of both the entry and exit anonymizer, or if he 
has control of, say, a target site and the entry anonymizer, he can pretty 
reliably unmask the user's identity with just a few minutes of 
browsing.  Wei Dai discussed this idea several years ago, and I later 
reinvented the same idea.
