blink blink.  Bell?  "followers?"  

While I'm willing to be polite to most people on mailing lists, 
and occasionally find interest in the things (especially the 
things contrary to established rules of "sanity") that they say, 
I cannot *imagine* anyone actually becoming a "follower" of a 
person such as Jim Bell.  Even setting aside for a few moments 
the inherent goofiness of AP (which they seem to be implying that 
this is about) Bell simply doesn't exhibit any leadership 
characteristics.  At least not in anything I've read.  

His writings give me the impression of a man too antisocial to 
remain on good terms with any would-be "followers."
