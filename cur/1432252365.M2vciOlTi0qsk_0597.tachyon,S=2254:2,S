Two Cultures

Gamma ray blues. Astrophysicist Peter Usher had never heard of
hip-hop music until
last week when the Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA) announced that it
was sending the Pennsylvania State University professor emeritus
an album and T-shirt
featuring rhythm-and-blues singer Usher Raymond. RIAA says it's
mailing the gifts to
apologize for having erroneously sent out a copyright infringement
notice to Usher's department on 8 May.
The notice said that the department's FTP server was illegally
distributing songs by the Grammy Award-winning artist. The reason for
the error was traced to Usher's research
papers on the server and a song about the Swift gamma ray
satellite, which was in part
designed by Penn State. The combination of "Usher" and the "mp3"
suffix raised a red
flag for RIAA's Web-snooping bots, which routinely trawl the
Internet to monitor
unlawful trafficking of music files. RIAA withdrew the notice and
apologized to Penn
State last week.

Usher, who now lives in Durham, North Carolina, after retiring in
1999, is annoyed by the
ruckus but volunteers to "wear the T-shirt on Halloween."
