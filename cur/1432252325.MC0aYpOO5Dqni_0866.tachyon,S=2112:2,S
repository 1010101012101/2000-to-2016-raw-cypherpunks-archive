During the past couple of days I have been arguing with someone 
on usenet who cites as evidence for the extravagant 
untruthfullness of the mainstream press, Robert Fisk's report 
that the coalition troops were nowhere near Saddam Hussein 
airport.  (As it was then called)

For his very similar work in Kosovo, Fisk was named "foreign 
correspondent of the year"  (presumably by a committee of lying 
commies who share his ideology)

Looks like Fisk is becoming the new Chomsky.
