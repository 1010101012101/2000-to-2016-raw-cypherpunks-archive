Sorry, I should have mentioned that Leidos are in the same building as
us. However, they are not on our floor and are seperated by a few
floors, so he had zero business being on our level. We're considering
getting building management to setup swipe access to our level.

Yes, you need RFID to get into our office space.

Yes. This was our main concern. Seeing the antennas made me immediately
think that it was some sort of pentest into our wifi.

Already done. I've shown the video to the other tenants on the same
floor and they have all turned on the awareness.

Management were as suspicious as I was. Since Snowden, we (I work at
FastMail) have upped our paranoia for obvious reasons as I would
consider us to be in the same boat as the other targets.

This makes sense. Never considered it before.

Yeah, that's why I was asking for info on the device. We wanted to know
what it was so we knew how to approach them.

Yep. Considering our options.

Thanks for your response.
