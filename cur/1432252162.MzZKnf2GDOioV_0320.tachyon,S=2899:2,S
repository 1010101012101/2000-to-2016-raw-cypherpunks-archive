And there has been creditable prototyping in this area, e.g., Camram.  But 
not many skilled coders seem to have jumped on these projects to help out.

I know people who still do.

I think the U.S. Constitution will stand in the way of widespread adoption 
of NDLs.  They may have regulated firearms, though these laws are widely 
ignored by citizens, but I have yet to see a license for owning a 
typewriter or PC proposed.  They have already ruled numerous times that the 
Internet is deserving of at least as free and access as print media and 
political flyers (which can be anonymnous and still pass legal muster).
