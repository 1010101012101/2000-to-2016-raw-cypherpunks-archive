Here's the most comprehensive source of case law covering the subject I've 
ever seen: 

Computer Crime and
Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS)  

Searching and Seizing Computers 
and Obtaining Electronic Evidence 
in Criminal Investigations

"This publication provides a comprehensive guide to the legal issues that 
arise when federal law enforcement agents search and seize computers and 
obtain electronic evidence in criminal investigations. The topics covered 
include the application of the Fourth Amendment to computers and the 
Internet, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, workplace privacy, the 
law of electronic surveillance, and evidentiary issues. This publication 
supersedes "Federal Guidelines for Searching and Seizing Computers" (1994), 
as well as the Guidelines' 1997 and 1999 Supplements."
