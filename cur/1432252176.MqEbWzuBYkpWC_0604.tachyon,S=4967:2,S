	I've been thinking it would be nice to post my entire paper here (and
maybe on sci.crypt.research) before sending it off to the journals.  What are
the issues surrounding that, though?

	The academic folks here seem uncomfortable when I talk about it, like
I'd be leaking something secret.  AFAICT, nobody else would be able to apply
for a patent on the idea without telling a lot of lies in the process.  So
that leaves the possibility that somebody whips out another paper on the topic
before mine's all the way done.  Are the journals going to be snippy about
copyright issues?  Why haven't I seen other papers published on usenet and
such before going to press?

	I get around that by having the issuer issue a new random value for
each issuing session which gets hashed several times along with some other
data before going into the blinded messages.  You have to prove that the value
properly descends from the issuer's random value, which makes it tough to
reuse values from a previous session.
