That's exactly it. Deuterium-Flourine (and I think Deuterium-Iodine) have a 
prominent emission line which matches up nicely with CO2.  In practice, the 
DeF/DeI are hypergolically combined in the combustion chamber (that is they 
combust immediately upon contact) producing an impressive power 
output.  Somewhere inside or just outside the nozzle CO2 is injected and 
turbulently mixed.  Two parallel mirrors perpendicular to the exhaust lase 
the pumped up C02 and other (tracking) mirrors direct it to the 
target.  Unlike most other high power lasers these babies are CW, not 
pulsed, and capable of generating multi-megawatt beams. (They work 
exceptionally well in space if you can keep the fuel/oxidizer from leaking 
and make sure the exhaust doesn't dissolve the weapon)

This was a major Naval project when I worked at TRW in the 80s called 
Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL)
