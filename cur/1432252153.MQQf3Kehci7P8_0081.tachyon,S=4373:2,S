it also makes me wonder, given the insane speed vs. infinitesimal distance
if *information* could operate as a kind of cognitive pressure on the mind,
(as with predictive Random Event Generator (REG) vs RNG where patterns
organize/emerge out of quantum-noisefield) thus corollary perhaps to the
analogy of water pressure for electrical circuits and flow based on pneuma-
tic dynamics in a potentially bounded or closed system). that may enter
into questions of 'where information actually exists', perhaps stored outside
the brain in noosphere as patterns or forms (invisible constellation/structure)
that is referenced or linked to rather than contained within a brain, and thus
boundary of brain vs. mind. same: digital computer vs.quantum processor,
perhaps. thus issue of channeling or tuning into versus as origin of truth.
what if a fundamentally different data model, thus security model, etc.

this conceptualization has the individual person modeled as an antenna,
tuning into various structures based on what resonates, aligns correctly,
what circuits or feedback loops or environments exist. versus machine
of clockwork, rote memorization, and processor speed of read/write.
