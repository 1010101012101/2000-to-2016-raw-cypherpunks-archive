Absolutely.  Even things which are from the outside dysfunctional should
not be treated if the person doesn't want it treated.  Masochism is legal.

And yes, mental traits vary will a normal curve much like any other
trait.  (A rather un PC observation, but true)

My idiosyncracies are not the issue here, Bear.

Yep, *whether or not* I feel endangered.

Whatever.  In any case, I'm asserting only that certain 
(modern-med & layperson) defined syndromes exist.  And that
their identification and treatment is not political witchcraft,
no matter how abused for political witchhunting it may be.
A biological mechanic (ie, doctor) is obligated to use the history
of human experience (ie, clustering of symptoms) in classifying and
treating disease.   If you know how to do better, pray tell.
