The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparab|y sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
