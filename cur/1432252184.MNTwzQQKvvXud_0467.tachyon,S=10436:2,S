a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed calls from any telephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any ce|lular or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH
