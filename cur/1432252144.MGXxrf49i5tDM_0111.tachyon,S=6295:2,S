I think if anything the processor market would be made more
competitive yet by removal of patents as competitors with the
fabrication technology could just outright copy other companies
processors, after reverse-engineering them.  (If it was cheaper to
reverse-engineer than design one).

But that's a symptom of a corrupt government and laws against the
public interest.  Companies in many areas have more political power
than individuals.  For example the DMCA.  This to me doesn't argue for
more government, but for less government and system reform.

I agree: I think anonymous file sharing should be the next generation
in p2p evolution.

I don't think Palladium and other DRM hardware such as recently
proposed by Paul Kocher et al can realistically make any difference to
file sharing.  It seems unrealistic to think that hardware in the
hands of it's attackers (p2p file rippers) can withstand long term
attack.  And anyway the content will always be amenable to re-encoding
from the analog output, or digital signal.  Kocher's scheme is
essentially hardware-tamper resistant watermarking -- it encodes the
hardware identifier in the analog output to trace who ripped content.
However it is vunlerable to collusion over some parameter of colluders
(5 with the example system parameters).  Even then it can't be too
hard to obtain hardware anonymously removing the tracing risk even if
you don't bother colluding to avoid the tracing risk; the remaining
risk is that the player may be unable to decode new content if the
player keys are revoked after it is detected as a source of ripped
content.

I agree.

But I think IP is something created, subsidized and only made possible
by governments.

Correct.  But at least they're trying to be profitable, which most of
the time means keeping their customers happy.  Governments on the
other hand have no such objective, and most governments burn off 25%+
of GDP -- that's a lot of money to do evil with.

While I agree political reform is badly needed in many aspects of
government and law, it's difficult to see how one can get there from
here using only the political process.  Your only chance is individual
mobility -- individuals voting with their feet to create competition
in government.  I guess it's a similar situation in some respects --
government is a virtual monopoly, in the sense that you don't have to
accept your current government, you can move.  However people have
ties to their country, they have friends and relatives who live there;
plus the alternatives have disadvantages too.

While IP laws do vary, it's a pity there are no major governments that
compete on IP -- by providing a copyright and patent free environment.


So while governments and corporations, and corporations buying
government favor are frequently against the interests of the
individual lobbying for reform doesn't seem likely to improve things
much.
