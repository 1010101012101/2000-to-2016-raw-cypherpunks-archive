come the case isn't over yet,  with the 2600 people victorious.

I'm not certain the judges will see things that way.  The fact that
you need something like DeCSS to view DVDs ON A LINUX BOX
might not prove decisive to a judge who might consider the 
possibility that you could view them some other way,  say,
with a DVD player.  Alternatively,  Linus Torvalds could sell his
soul and say that source for linux DVD players will NOT be open.

I'm not justifying this kind of logic,  mind you,  just saying that
I think it's quite likely that that's the way the ruling is likely to
come out.
