I noticed this the other day whilst buying something at Amazon: 
allegedly, Amazon doesn't store your CC number in a network readable 
database:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/518224/002-9740615-3944845

"To provide you with an additional layer of security, all credit card 
numbers provided to Amazon.com are stored on a computer that is not 
connected to the Internet. After you type or call it in, your complete 
credit card number is transferred to this secure machine across a 
proprietary one-way interface. This computer is not accessible by 
network or modem, and the number is not stored anywhere else."

Now I'm not sure how they get to use the number during the billing 
process but hey... :)

I don't know if I'd feel much better if Amazon didn't have my CC on 
file. The danger of a disgruntled sysadmin snarfing the numbers while 
they pass trough the system for one time use during a single billing 
cycle seems to real for me.

War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague
brings. The earthquake means good business for construction workers,
and cholera improves the business of physicians, pharmacists, and
undertakers; but no one has for that reason yet sought to celebrate
earthquakes and cholera as stimulators of the productive forces in
the general interest. -- Ludwig von Mises
