	Heh. Indeed =) 

	I didn't mean to suggest that there was any disruptive
	technology that could solve the basic political problem (I
	guess in that regard I'm just not a cypherpunk)


	What I was getting at is that if there were real 'terrorists'
	out there, they could easily communicate using an apparently
	unbreakable cypher. So, all the resources that governments
	spend trying to read 'terrorist mail' are wasted. Furthermore,
	I'm assuming that any organization ('legal'  or 'ilegal') that
	want allegedly secure communications use OTPs. So, it seems to
	me that at some ('high' or 'very high') level all cryptoanalysis
	is basically bullshit.

	Yes, and in the short run they might argue that things are not
	so bad, but they seem unable to understand long term
	trends...or as you note above...and below...they just don't
	care. 

	I guess we are not feeling too optimistic today =P
