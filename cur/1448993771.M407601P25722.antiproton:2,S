There was a lot of digital ink spilled over the topic of smartcontracts. If
anyone is interested to have a look at them contracts (in Solidity) being
built and deployed to the chain live - there is an online smartcontracts
hackathon here http://hack.ether.camp/ for the next 5 days.
People usually use npm packages to compile and web3 package to send a
contract to the chain via http rpc or lpc socket. In this case it is a bit
of a smartcontract peepshow -each team IDE is open for viewers. Will be
interesting to see what comes out of it, and what challenges people are
actually experiencing etc. The registration stays open towards the end, if
anyone wants to give it a go.
