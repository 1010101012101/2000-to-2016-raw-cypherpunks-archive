Now, who would just *love *to get people off something secure, and onto
something insecure. All the while making them believe it's secure.

I suppose the more secure countries are Iran, Cuba, Russia. Those are
(*should be) isolated from NSA developments and should be at about public
level. Russia might not be that ignorant though, best stick with Cuba. Iran
and North Korea should be 100% monitored and likely don't run any Tor
nodes. This is on the basis of their hostility towards America (&friends)
and with that the assumption of isolation from their developments and no
cooperation. China is hard to judge but might also be better than anything
else. Hong Kong might be the best in China. HK is in China's womb yet, like
a baby, it isn't China.

All of the less-than-stable Africa seems like a good target. Too busy
running crime or trying to keep stuff together to have developed
international spy agencies. South Africa might have an agreement with GB/US
(doesn't actually matter which) so I'd avoid them. The northern
"dictator-band" has been/is being disassembled. The US is likely only
involved to protect its interests now that the obedient dummy dictators are
gone. That means there's no telling what the status of surveillance is, but
it might be very good (iow: absent). Regardless the Internet connections
are unreliable and the security will likely be US-colors soon enough.

Asia except for China is hard to judge (for me). Taiwan (aka "Republic of
China", hilarious story that is) is developed and connected but has had
trouble getting recognition/allegiance due to the People's Republic of
China.  No clue about security allegiances. Can imagine it's been declaring
its independence so hard it doesn't have any, and might be a good target.
Any of the not-that-developed countries should be decent exit points (the
whole Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos (esp. Laos), Myanmar,  Philippines,
Indonesia group). (There's quite some difference between those countries,
but I *think* they still end up in the same category). Singapore is a total
no-go.

The whole region around India I have no knowledge off. India and Pakistan
are both very mixed in their level of development to a point where
mass-surveillance just doesn't make sense. They're also nuclear powers,
which does testify to their willingness and ability to stand up to world
powers. Probably good exit points.

All the middle east is probably bad because of oil/militairy interests.
Special mention of Isreal as being extremely bad.

Turkey too is subject to military interests and wants to be EU and whatnot
so let's just avoid them. EU is all surveillance or wants to be
surveillance. Eastern Europe has the developmental backlog that might've
caused them to push it further down the to-do list. Greece, Italy, Spain,
might be so busy not going bankrupt that they've skimped on the
surveillance. Morocco and Algeria are oddballs, close to the EU but nothing
else (deserts) they might've not had purpose for surveillance, yet have
better connections than the rest of Africa. (Tunisia?)

The world feels pretty good about the Nordic countries but I think they
just tie into the US+ spynet so that makes them useless. Iceland's small
population and distance to everything made it really nice, now I'm not so
sure. The amount of attention means the pressure should be rising. No idea
how that'll work out. The population is small enough to be smart. I suppose
they're observed in any non-politically approved but still possible way.
Err.. Nevermind.

Enough mind games. You have to pass the wires anyway, encrypt and trust the
endpoints. (and encrypt hard)
