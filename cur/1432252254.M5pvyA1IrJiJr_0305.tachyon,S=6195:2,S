A colleague is looking into this venture. I gave him a synopsis of their
additions to SPDZ. There is a white paper describing their technology at
their website which talks about the other two related protocols, Yao and
Tiny-OT.

One interesting use that occurred to me was the ability to split the two
nodes in their implementation across jurisdictions. Especially those who
are unlikely to ever collaborate. That giving you an advantage over a
typical HSM which could live in a jurisdiction that could be seized.
