Recently I received the Anonymizer "PrivacyShield Alert", as an Anonymizer 
user, and was distressed to note that it appears Anonymizer has now 
outsourced its mail and marketing infrastructure.

Partial headers from new mail system:

Return-Path: <bounce-XXX-XXXXX@anonymizer.lyris.net>
Received: from anonymizer.lyris.net ([64.62.197.139])
From: "Anonymizer.com" <news@anonymizer.com>
Subject: PrivacyShield Alert - July 2004

[....]

The previous mail messages appeared to have "local to Anonymizer" mail 
delivery systems sending them.

Does it bother anyone else that Anonymizer is outsourcing its customer 
information?
