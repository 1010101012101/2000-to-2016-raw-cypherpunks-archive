Likely just somebody using the Hotmail web interface via Safeweb, 
possibly in turn through a Triangle Boy proxy.

You're last paragraph's supposition is interesting, but the whole RIAA 
thing looks more like an rtmark action, maybe. Which would be funded 
from within the ranks of Disney-Sony-AOL/TimeWarner-IG-Coca-Farben et 
al. Not DOD/CIA. Sure they could snoop, (but they'd have to be running 
some kind of heavy duty RC4 cracking engine for SSL targets. How 
vulnerable is RC4 to MITM attacks? Never mind, I'll go do my homework.) 
and they could certainly do traffic analysis, but odds are the cache is 
on a DOD network primarily so that they know with more confidence that 
nobody else has breached security. Analysis could reveal asset 
locations, etc. I'n guessing this is what they bought with their 
investment. Anyway, I'm going to set up a tboy server and play with it.

You want to some see devious shit, check out rtmark. This is the 
cointelpro arm of the bait-and-switch artists who give us RATM and the 
Matrix on the one hand, and DMCA et al. on the other.  Not that the RIAA 
wouldn't hold this kind of secret meeting, but they're all on the same 
wavelength and don't need to. .
