I wouldn't believe this for a picosecond. Lots of reasons. For one 
thing, most of their needs are for building fairly low-tech (designed 
long ago) PALs, PLAs, gate arrays, ROMs, etc.

Cutting edge communications or CPU chips _are_ extremely 
yield-sensitive, even for a "cost is no object" fab. No way that a 
little tiny fab on Ft. Meade property, as we understand the NSA fab 
to be, is making processing chips to compete with Alphas, Pentiums, 
and UltraSparc IIIs.

Lots of other reasons.

Frankly, we're seeing _way_ too many articles forwarded from the "UK 
Register." This is an entertaining Web site, but well over half of 
the stuff they publish is flaky speculation. The "journalists" who 
write for the Register often don't even get the names of 
industry-standard terms right.
