Speaking of which do you find chocolate agar to be a better culture
medium
than uncooked blood agar?  And when oxygenating the culture
can you just bubble air or do you see better results from pure O2?

Presumably there is a lot of causal evidence that can't be shown.
Making videos is never a crime.  (Vs. coercing actors, or using the

The most dangerous psychotics are the elected ones.

BTW Gordon you use "we" far too much, as if you are speaking
for others than your lil' ole self.  We find this annoying.
