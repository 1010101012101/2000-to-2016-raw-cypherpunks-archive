Yes, in these cases, they should _NOT_ be able to file lawsuits.

-- If an employee doesn't like the calendar that another employee has 
on his desk, she can talk to others in the company. Maybe they'll 
have it removed. But she CANNOT use the courts to intervene in a 
matter of how the company's owners deal with their property.

-- and so on, for other examples I could construct.

Lawsuits should only be "allowed" when some matter of law is involved.

Sure, one of them may have to go. Such was it 20 years ago, such was 
it 100 years ago. But the court system and EEOC sorts of offices were 
not involved until in recent decades.

Whether I as a business owner allow "girlie calendars" on the walls 
of my shop is no business of the State.

Such "possible cost in productivity" issues are matters for the 
business owners to decide upon, not the courts, and not regulatory 
agencies.

I give up. Reading your stuff here makes me realize why it is 
hopeless to argue with those infected with legalitus.

You will make a fine lawyer.


Meanwhile, I have decided life is too short to waste it by reading 
your legalisms, so I am must put you in my filter file.
