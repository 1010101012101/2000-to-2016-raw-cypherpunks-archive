Not a plausible claim, to anyone who recalls the situation at the
top of the WTC on those days.  The incredible heat and smoke from
an entire jetliner full of fuel a hundred feet below would make
helicopter operations impossible.  Trying to land on the roof under
those circumstances would be suicide.  Helicopters circled, but they
could not approach.
