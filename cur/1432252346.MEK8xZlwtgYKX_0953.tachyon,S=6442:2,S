I keep hoping I'll run across a 'new' creationist theory, but they all
boil down to the same old same old. I don't remember the last time
I finished one of the books . Of course the same can be said about most
books, technical or not. And no, I'm not a creationist of any bent outside
of the pantheist sort (ie Gaia). I'd say that only about 10% of all books
are worth reading. Of those 10%, 90% of their content is wrong (and hence
interesting in the sense of why they are wrong)..which really gets down to
the crux of the matter for me. Not why they got it right, but why they failed.
Unfortunately most readers focus on what they like, the positive aspect of
the experience, and not the negative. Which from an analytic/comprehension
perspective is a stronger viewpoint (or at least seems so to me).

I disagree, see Newtons comments about hypothesis and playing with stones
on a beach.

That's not what he meant by that. He was saying that what he did was not
in and of itself his creation. He was objecting to credit being given the
'Lion of England' when it wasn't the Lion's due (why in his later life he 
began to publish anonymously). Unfortunately this can't be said of most
people. Most people will take credit for whatever they can and then
advertise it widely. One of the most popular strategies is to 'let them
think it was their idea'.

I'm not saying you shouldn't spread it around. I disagree on your 'mental
context'. I don't suggest that another person should read a book to
understand me per se, but rather to escape the singular view point we all
have. For me, the best thing that could happen is that somebody else read
it and comes to a different conclusion. It is the dialog that follows that
gives the book worth. Something greater than the authors intent, or my own
personality happens then. The problem is that many equate reading (even a lot)
with understanding, and in actuality too few people question vigorously
enough to ever really 'understand' anything. It's not uncommon in our
society to hear people say 'He said ...' but they themselves can't explain
it in their own terms and context. They can regurgitate, they can't
cogitate. Dogma and pedantry. It's why 'arguments from authority are
useless' is such a strong tool with respect to deductive/synthetic
analysis.
