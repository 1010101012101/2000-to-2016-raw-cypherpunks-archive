RTF Webmaster Pleads Guilty

      RTF Webmaster to be Convicted on Monday, Sept 23rd

      Raisethefist.com, Sherman Austin will be convicted on Monday,
      Sept 23rd as he pleads guilty to felony count: 18 U.S.C. 842
      (p)(2)(A): DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION RELATING TO
      EXPLOSIVES, DESTRUCTIVE DEVICES, AND WEAPONS OF MASS
      DESTRUCTION WITH THE INTENT THAT SUCH INFORMATION BE USED IN
      FURTHERANCE OF A FEDERAL CRIME OF VIOLENCE.

      The plea bargain gives Austin a felony conviction with 1
      month in jail, 5 months in a half-way home and 3 years
      supervised release. Austin does not start his sentencing on
      Monday, but will find out the exact date at his court
      appearance.

      The arraignment is at the downtown federal building in Los
      Angeles on 255 east temple on the 3rd floor at 8:30am


Another one of those unfortunate chicken defendants we seem to get. He
would have got a max of 4-5 at trial. So now he has a felony conviction
anyway plus endless parole supervision which gives the Feds way too much
control over you. And he gives up a chance to challenge the "Publish Bomb
Plans" go to jail law.

If you go to trial and lose and do your time you are then free of
supervision. Plus you never admitted any crime. A plea is an admission.
When you are in custody, your cooperation is the only thing you can deny
your captors.
