The Zero-Knowledge Systems Press Release http://www.zeroknowledge.com
======================================================================

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
IBM Announces An Enterprise Privacy Architecture
Protecting Brand, Building Customer Trust And Adding Business Value Through
Privacy Protection

SOMERS, NY -- 06/29/2001 -- IBM today unveiled a comprehensive Enterprise
Privacy Architecture (EPA) to address the complex privacy challenges facing
21st century businesses, governments and other organizations. The
patent-pending EPA provides a road map for privacy management and solutions
to help companies protect customer, employee and partner information.

"The Enterprise Privacy Architecture we're announcing today is a significant
privacy and business development. It affords organizations a framework for
efficiently imbedding their privacy requirements into every level of the
business, while integrating with existing e-business initiatives," said Mike
Bilger, global practice leader, security and privacy, IBM Global Services.

This architecture responds to business demand for tailored enterprise
privacy controls. It is designed to help organizations manage and protect
their three most vital assets -- data, customer relationships, and brand.
IBM's privacy blueprint balances growing needs for information with the
privacy concerns of individuals, thereby permitting integration of business
and external privacy rules, customer preferences, and privacy best practices
into line-of-business and customer-centric business processes. IBM developed
the EPA in response to client needs to move privacy beyond policy and to
align IT and management to make privacy work for businesses and their
customers.

"IBM's Tivoli Systems management team has been key contributors to the EPA,
and our Tivoli SecureWay Privacy Manager product serves as a major component
of the EPA road map initiative," said Jeff Smith, Senior Vice-President,
Application Products, Tivoli Systems Inc. "Combining the EPA with Tivoli
SecureWay Policy Director and Tivoli SecureWay Privacy Manager, security and
privacy policies can be monitored and enforced consistently across the
enterprise."

Zero-Knowledge Systems' Privacy Rights Management (PRM) technologies will
complement IBM's EPA, and help accelerate industry's ability to implement
the EPA vision.

"Zero-Knowledge(r) Systems' Privacy Rights Management technologies, in
concert with IBM's EPA, will for the first time provide businesses with the
privacy tools, methodology and expertise required to close the gap between
stated policies, customer preferences and operational realities," said John
Beans, Vice-President, Product Marketing, Enterprise Products,
Zero-Knowledge Systems.

The development of the EPA is based on the growing number of companies that
understand privacy as an essential element to cultivating strong
relationships by using information effectively and appropriately. The EPA
takes organizations a step further by helping to transform privacy from a
cost of doing business to a business value with strong return on investment
(ROI).
"The combination of the EPA blueprint and consulting services, together with
the technology capabilities of companies like Tivoli and Zero-Knowledge
Systems, will enable leaders around the world to approach the privacy
challenge strategically and efficiently," said Harriet Pearson, Chief
Privacy Officer, IBM.

Through a mix of consulting methodology and technology integration, the EPA
aligns corporate-level policy with practices and appropriate technologies
through rigorous EPA-based analysis of infrastructure, processes,
information flows, and practices. EPA identifies selected privacy risks and
opportunities to improve core business functions across an enterprise. EPA
can also be used assist enterprises in addressing and leveraging privacy for
e-business initiatives such as customer relationship management and business
intelligence implementations. An important part of the EPA privacy ROI is in
its scalability, flexibility and ability to leverage the best
privacy-enabling technologies available in the marketplace today -- such as
those from Tivoli and Zero-Knowledge Systems.

The Enterprise Privacy Architecture was designed by a cross-IBM team,
including expert privacy consultants from IBM's Privacy Center of
Competence, representatives of IBM's Research Division, IBM's Chief Privacy
Officer, and Tivoli Systems, alongside IBM's knowledge management and
pervasive computing teams and its customer database management group.

IBM Security and Privacy Consulting is part of IBM Global Services, the
world's largest information technology services provider. With nearly
150,000 professionals serving customers in 160 countries, IBM Global
Services reached revenue of more than $33 billion in 2000. IBM Global
