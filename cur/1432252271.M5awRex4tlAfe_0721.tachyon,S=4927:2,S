So it's an insult to be American, is it? Who's being bigoted now. If you 
really have something interesting to contribute, why not bypass the 
namecalling and stick to the issues.

Huh? 

Speaking for myself, I'm not "owned" by anyone. I obey state and federal 
laws though, if that's what you mean. You don't need a gun to enforce 
ownership, what do you think contract and property law is all about. 
Sometimes words or a fist do just as well... What any of this has to do 
with supporting the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms is totally unclear. 

By the way, why don't you think people have a right to defend their own 
lives and property? When I'm attacked, why shouldn't I fight back? A nation 
state that adopted a foreign policy based on "turning the other cheek" 
wouldn't last a month. So why should I as an individual citizen? 

Nobody said you have to relish the idea of mowing people down to believe in 
the principle of defending yourself. In fact, I don't think it's going too 
far to say that if you don't take reasonable measures to provide for your 
own safety, you're a contemptible fool and a coward. 

What would you do in a situation where no one from the state is around to 
help you? Run? Pray? Roll over and die? If you can't or won't defend 
yourself, those are about the only options you'll have.

In my case, I'm lucky enough to be able to decide that "providing for my 
own safety" doesn't involve owning a gun at all. But who am I to make that 
decision for anyone else? Who are you?


>You really whine only because you are not on top - 

Define "on top". 

No matter where you are intellectually or financially, the botttom line is 
that you deserve to defend yourself when people are trying to harm you.


>you do not really have problem with those below you (I understand you live

Define "below". 

Let's see, who's "below" me, criminals? I think criminals realize better 
than most the advantages of superior firepower. So why not wake up, take 
the hint, and quit living like a lamb waiting for the slaughter. But go 
ahead, it's entirely your choice.
