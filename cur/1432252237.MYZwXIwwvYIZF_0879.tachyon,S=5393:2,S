#    Akamai isn't a DoubleClick type of service -
#    it's a distributed caching system that allows web sites
#    to get better performance by caching static web content
#    on large ISPs and other sites likely to be nearer to readers
#    than the content owner's web site.

Thank you for the LART, apologies (or is that regrets ;-) to Declan.

Good thing porno sites don't use it, the URL would be hard to block
without taking out non-porno sites.

One of the very few really cool URLs the Jimster sent to
the list was for a home-made plasma ball. I wanted to
tell others about it, but the URL stopped working shortly
after the Jimster gave it out. I heard he doesn't like to
receive mail from people (individuals), so I didn't email
him. Anyone have a working URL for the plasmoid ball?

NTP root security hole?

#    All Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and any other users who administer Unix
#    machines at their home or in their workplace please take note:
#    
#    The xntpd and ntpd daemons, which are used for synchronizing time between
#    multiple machines over a network, have a security vulnerability that
#    allows remote attackers to gain root access.
#    
#    If you are using NTP on your Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, or any other
#    Unix-ish operating system which you keep connected to the Internet
#    on a regular basis, you should shut down the NTP daemon now and
#    examine your machine for evidence of a remote attack.  We have already
#    received one report from a Panix customer who was probed Thursday night/
#    Friday morning.
#    
#    Users with commercial vendor versions of Unix (i.e. Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
#    etc) should contact their vendor for more information to find out if
#    they are affected (I suspect they are, though it will take a while before
#    someone puts together an exploit).  In the meantime, you should stop
#    running xntpd/ntpd until your vendor addresses the problem.
#    
#    For further discussion, please post in panix.questions.
#    
#    Windows and Mac users can safely ignore this message.
#    
#    	-- Ed
#    
#    PS: We've received reports of Panix customers with Linux machines being
#    hacked at the rate of 1-2 per week for the couple of weeks - if you have
#    ANY Linux or *BSD system that you have not updated with security fixes
#    since January 1, or if you installed ANY Linux or *BSD system directly
#    from the CD and have not updated it (like RedHat 6.2 or 7.0), that system
#    is probably vulnerable to remote exploits.
