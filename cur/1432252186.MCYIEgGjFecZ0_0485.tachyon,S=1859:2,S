Well, once you get past the invalid and dishonest parts of
Bush's 57 reasons We Need to Invade Iraq Right Now
(WMDs, Al-Qaeda, Tried to kill Bush's Daddy, etc.)
you're pretty much left with "Saddam tried to kill Bush's Daddy"
and "Replacing the EEEVil dictator Saddam with a Democracy
to protect the Iraqi people".  Pulling off the latter
requires that you leave them with something better
than a civil war, though it's not clear that
what they're getting right now _is_ better than a civil war.
