	I guess? On the other hand, remailers(to use a classic cpunk
	term) can't be trusted too much (understatement), especially
	tor.

	commerce of physical goods and services has this little problem
	known as delivery...

	Not really. You get the best anonimity when everybody uses the
	same null 'key' and the same nickname, like, I don't know,
	"anonymous coward". Of course, in that case it's impossible to
	attach any reputation to anybody...

	Sure, it may be possible to keep your online reputation not too
	linked to your physical self but doing so is not trivial.

	Well, if you are specifically talking about car drivers (and
	passengers) it's pretty obvious that there can be no anonimity. 
	
	Decentralized protocols are still desirable for a number of
	reasons, but they won't solve the underlying political
	problem : the existence of a group of psychos who call
	themselves 'the government'.
