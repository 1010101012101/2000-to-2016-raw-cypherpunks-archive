Ahh-oops!  That particular reply was scrappily written
late at night and wasn't meant to be sent!  Apologies
belatedly, I'd since actually come to the conclusion
that Steve's statement was strictly correct, in that
we won't ever *see* sniffing because SSL is in place,
whereas I interpreted this incorrectly perhaps as
SSL *stopped* sniffing.  Subtle distinctions can
sometimes matter.

So please ignore the previous email, unless a cruel
and unusual punishment is demanded...
