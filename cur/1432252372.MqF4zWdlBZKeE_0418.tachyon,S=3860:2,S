Okay, I am starting to think that my description was not entirely
perfect. It was reworked on the phone late last night by a copy editor
who didn't understand the original wording (but I'm not trying to
assign blame, since she read me her edited version back on the phone
and I probably should have objected).

I'll spend more time on this section in my next piece.

Or the bank could require 999,999 transactions and prosecute for fraud
if they're getting hoodwinked.  Or, as you say, limit the
denomination.
