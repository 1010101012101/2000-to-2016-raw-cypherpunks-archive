MIT is not as cohesive as people seem to think.  Some groups might as well
be at DARPA while others don't take military funding.  The university
really doesn't care.  On that basis, I don't think the MIT name is enough
to credit or discredit a project.  You really have to look at the history
of the research group.

Additionally this was a grad student's project for a thesis requirement so
by department policy it can't contain any confidential information.
