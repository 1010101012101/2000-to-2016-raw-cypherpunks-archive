Yes, we have heard here (or at a physical meeting, I forget which). I 
don't buy many DVDs, but this was discussed. Apparently the trailers and 
ads cannot be fast-forwarded through...something built into the DVD spec 
which allows this.

So an ad-buster which "circumvented" this would violate the DMCA, 
presumably.
