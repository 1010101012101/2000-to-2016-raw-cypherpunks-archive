A colleague in San Francisco just sent this to me after seeing it on the
evening news.

http://kxtv.com/news-story/October2001/100401/MARIJUANA-DECISION.htm

Federal agents seized all patient and client records from a doctor and a
lawyer who gave out medical marijuana licenses and legal advice,
respectively.

I wonder if this stunt would have been pulled in more peaceful times.
Public outcry will not be nearly as great as it would have been, simply
because we're distracted by other news.

Lovely.
