oh great another person that thinks they know everything because they
punched some letters into a search engine

i worked at indymedia in new york city democracy now and pbs > wnet in the
field in the middle east so... and other weird journo watchdoggie things on
immi in iceland and on documentaries but besides that i am an activist and
but also cover that in different places

frankly i have no clue why you are making such a big deal out of all of
this - maybe ask yourself ... you take cheap base shots at people that are
boring and have no place in advanced thinking debate
