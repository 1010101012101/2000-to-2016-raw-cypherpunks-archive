It sounds to me like you mean "data protection," not "privacy."  By
data protection, I mean the ability of the state to tell you not to
use information about certain people in certain ways.  See, for
example, the EU Data Protection Directive.

I find its really useful to not use the word privacy in debates about
privacy; it simply means too many things to too many people.

Bob Blakely once defined privacy as "The ability to lie about
yourself and get away with it" which is an interesting definition.
Other good ones include untracability, the inability to trace from a
message to a person; unlinkability, the inability to link two
instances of "theres a person here" to the same person;
and unobservability, which is the ability to not be observed doing
something (think curtains, my current favorite privacy technology.)

| That's secrecy technology, not privacy technology.

I'm not getting into this one. :)
