Hello Frank,

I have used Adium for at least 4-5 years. It is a very good piece of open 
source software.

It is possible to secure all communications through Adium using OTR  
(Off-The-Record) crypto. [1]
I would leave commenting about the security of OTR to others, but in my  
view it is secure (except multiuser chats, and file transfers).

I have Facebook chat, and GTalk configured on Adium, but do not use them as 
preferred communications channels.

GTalk certainly was working this morning when I was using my Mac (if it  
wasn't it would notify me with an error). You can configure it for GTalk  
by following the steps. [2]

I hope that helps.

Bernard
