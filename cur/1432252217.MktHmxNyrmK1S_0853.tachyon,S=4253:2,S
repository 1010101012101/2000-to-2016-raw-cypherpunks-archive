Grrr. I know. But making the effort to put some viable alternatives on the
table is preferable to watching it all go to hell without so much as squeaking
a peep. Sure, it's a given that people are going to do something; if we can
pack the range of options with more freedom-friendly alternatives, maybe
they'll help crowd out the disasterously statist ones. Maybe. And if nothing
else, at least I'll know I squeaked my peep, damn it...

Good ideas about private sector security practices, but does anyone have any
suggestions that particularly pertain to technology that might serve to slow up
the biometrics bandwagon? Deperessingly enough, that's the way it seems to be
going, and I reallly don't see a way out of it.

"The two contenders met, with all their troops, on the field of Camlan to
negotiate.  Both sides were fully armed, and desperately suspicious that the
other side was going to try some ruse or stratagem.  The negotiations were
going along smoothly until one of the knights was stung by an asp, and drew his
sword to kill the reptile.  The others saw the sword being drawn and
immediately fell upon each other.  A tremendous slaughter ensued.  The
chronicle is quite specific about the point that the slaughter was excessive
chiefly because the battle took place without preparations or premeditation."
