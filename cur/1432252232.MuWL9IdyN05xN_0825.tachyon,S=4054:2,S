Subject: New ID system keeps tabs on kids

Students have their ID Cards scanned at the start of the school
day at Bensalem High School

By Denise Clay
SPECIAL TO THE PREMIERE
dclay@calkinsnewspapers.com

Getting into Bensalem High School now requires identification,
but not any card will do.

Students have begun using photo identification cards connected to
the school's new Comprehensive Attendance Administration and
Security System.

The cards have the student's name and other information encoded n
them. A computerized reader scans them.

The systen is designed to help school officials monitor students'
comings and goings. In the future, the electronic screens at the
ID stations will show if a student has been suspended and
shouldn't be in school. The monitors will also sing "Happy
Birthday" to a student on the appropriate day.

Six identification stations are located at the front entrance of
the school, said Princial Elliott Lewis. One station is staffed
with a hall monitor all day.

Students have been adjusting to the Windows 95-based system and
the additional responsibilities connected to it, officials say.

"The kids have been responding well," said Natalie Knable,
assistant principal. "They've been carrying their IDs."

Those who forget are given a temporary pass after signing in at
the ID station.
