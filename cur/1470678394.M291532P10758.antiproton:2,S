Yes, but when you say "mercantilistic device" I think "device used by
mercantilism," not "device that is inherently mercantilistic by its
nature". If you mean the latter, I don't think the generic concept of a
corporation qualifies, since it's just "a group of people who have chosen
to operate as a single entity and are recognized as such under some legal
system, voluntary or otherwise".
