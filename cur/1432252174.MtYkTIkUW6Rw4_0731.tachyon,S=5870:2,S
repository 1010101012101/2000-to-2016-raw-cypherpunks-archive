No, it's not.

Given. So are all the remailers in between.

No they don't. They have at most the sender or the receiver (never both
unless they've already cracked both of them in which case this entire
exercise is moot).

How do you shut a program down that is running independently in a
distributed process space? A process space that is distributed in such a
way that the hardware that executes a particular image of the remailer for
one message is NOT the same hardware that would be used for the next
message. In fact neither the owner of the process or the owner of the
individual boxes necessarily have a say in the selection process. The only 
way to take that down is take 'em all down at once. Not possible.

Can the US government shut the entire Internet down? No. Can they shut
down just the US based infra-structure in toto? No.

Not hardly. You really, really should read more 9P documentation.

Fortunately encryption software enjoys enough of a 1st amendment shield
that isn't going to happen. A moot point.

Not hardly. Sending an encrypted message to a friend across the country
is not a 'circumvention device' because we aren't doing anything related
to copyrighted material. An anonymous remailer is not a 'circumvention
device' within the context of DMCA.

Hell, if they could manufacture it at will they already would have.

Not hardly. But I'll gladly look at a more fleshed out scenario when you
provide it...

Which Plan 9 and 'small world' networks ain't.
