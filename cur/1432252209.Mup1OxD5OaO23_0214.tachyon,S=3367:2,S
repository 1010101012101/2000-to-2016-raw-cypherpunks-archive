All,

Welcome back to the Cypherpunks mailing list. You've received a
subscription notice and are receiving this message now because you were
a member of the cypherpunks@al-qaeda.net or cypherpunks@jfet.org mailing
list before it went offline several (?) weeks ago.

First, my sincerest apologies for having failed to notice that messages
were silently dropping. All the bounces were still dropping into my
"cypherpunks bounces" mailbox, so from what I could tell all was running
normally (if perhaps at slightly low SNR). It turns out that some
package upgrade, most likely a new version of perl, broke majordomo.

(And of course, could I have picked a worse time to break everything?)

Well, that's the bad news. The good news is that cypherpunks is now
powered by Mailman, and should be a bit more reliable, easier to
maintain, and less Rube-Goldbergian. (I say this with all respect to my
cpunk admin predecessors; the CDR was a useful and interesting piece of
software, but---at least, in its most recent form---it was certainly not
a *pretty* piece of software.)

Nevertheless, since I haven't actually done much other than port the old
majordomo list over to mailman, the Distributed Remailer functionality
no longer obtains. Practically, this hasn't mattered for at least the
last 6 or 8 years, but perhaps that would change if I would just
modernize the software a bit. I'm planning on putting some thought into
that in the near future, but for now I figured it was more important to
just get *something* back up and running.

Once again, welcome back!
