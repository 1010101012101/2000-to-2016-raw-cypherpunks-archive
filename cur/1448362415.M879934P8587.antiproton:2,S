Hillary Clinton Showed How the Government Still Doesn't Understand 
the Encryption Debate

>"develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy"

This is the agreed upon script for national security, encryption, commerce,
education,politics,religion, since the Internet was invented and long before.

But neither safety nor privacy have been satisfactorily provided during the
time this script has been incessantly spoken, written, broadcast, legislated.

Crypto advocates as well as those for national security have 
conspired to follow
a script that both agree cannot be fulfilled. Edward Snowden is merely the
latest to preach this impossible dream so successful, lucrative and risk-free
by advocates and marketers of crypto and natsec.

None of the opportunistic companies and cryptographers marching in lockstep
to this script with authorities expect the dream to be realized, so they agree
to keep repeating the sales and dangerless script for doomed-to-fail national
security and encryption and then demand more funding and trust for better
solutions.

Whether doomed to fail is deliberate to assure markets, media and lecture fees
could be debated, and will be debated, and is being debated. This debate
fosters the notion of opposition rather than complicity. As seen in the
Snowden affair, dribble non-threatening information, call for debate,
pretend risk-taking in consultation with authorities.

So Manning and Snowden and a few others are left hanging in the wind,
in jail, in exile. The smartest and least gullible are on the run, 
keeping away
from publicity and foolish leaking, avoiding honey pots of secure drops
and ratting to law enforcement and spies, and disbelieving anyone who
promotes and monetizes the script of safety and privacy. Nobody like
that is here nor on any fora on crypto and natsec suffused with tattletales,
fora run for that very purpose.
