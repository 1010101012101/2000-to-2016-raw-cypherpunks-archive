>> You may update your antivirus software religiously, immediately

>> new Windows security patches, and refuse to click any e-mail links
>> ostensibly
>> sent by your bank, but even if your computer is running exactly the
>> way its
>> supposed to, a motivated attacker can still glean a shocking amount
>> of
>> private information from it. The time it takes to store data in
>> memory,
>> fluctuations in power consumption, even the sounds your computer

>> betray its secrets. MIT researchers centered at the Computer
>> Science and
>> Artificial Intelligence Labs Cryptography and Information Security
>> Group
>> (CIS) study such subtle security holes and how to close them.
>>
>> In 2005, Eran Tromer, now a postdoc at CIS, and colleagues at the
>> Weizmann
>> Institute in Rehovot, Israel, showed that without any breach of
>> security in
>> the ordinary sense, a seemingly harmless computer program could
>> eavesdrop on
>> other programs and steal the type of secret cryptographic key used
>> by one of
>> the most common Internet encryption schemes. Armed with the key, an
>> attacker
>> could steal a computer users credit card number, bank account
>> password 
>> whatever the encryption scheme was invoked to protect.
>>
>> Computer operating systems are supposed to prevent any given
>> program from
>> looking at the data stored by another. But when two programs are
>> running at
>> the same time, they sometimes end up sharing the same cache  a small
>> allotment of high-speed memory where the operating system stores
>> frequently
>> used information. Tromer and his colleagues showed that simply by
>> measuring
>> how long it took to store data at a number of different cache
>> locations, a
>> malicious program could determine how frequently a cryptographic
>> system was
>> using those same locations. The memory access patterns  that is,
>> which
>> memory addresses are accessed  are heavily influenced by the
>> specific secret
>> key being used in that operation, Tromer says. We demonstrated a
>> concise
>> and efficient procedure for learning the secret keys given just
>> this crude
>> information about the memory access patterns. Complete extraction
>> of the
>> private key, Tromer says, takes merely seconds, and the
>> measurements that
>> are needed, of the actual cryptographic process being attacked, can
>> be
>> carried out in milliseconds.
>>
>> The encryption system that Tromer was attacking, called AES, was
>> particularly
>> vulnerable because it used tables of precalculated values as a
>> computational
>> short cut, so that encoding and decoding messages wouldnt be
>> prohibitively
>> time consuming. Since Tromer and his colleagues published their
>> results,
>> Intel has added hardware support for AES to its chips, so that
>> Internet
>> encryption software wont have to rely on such lookup tables.
>>
>> In a statement, Intel told the MIT News Office that its decision
>> was mainly
>> motivated by the performance/efficiency benefits achieved, but
>> that in
>> addition, there is a potential security benefit since these new
>> instructions
>> can mitigate the possibility of software side channel attacks on
>> AES that
>> have been described in research papers, including those discovered
>> by Tromer,
>> Percival, and Bernstein.
>>
>> I think its fair to say that its a direct response to the cache-
>> timing
>> attacks against AES, Pankaj Rohatgi, director of hardware security
>> at the
>> data security firm Cryptography Research, says of Intels move.
>>
>> Together with CIS cofounder Ron Rivest and CSAILs Saman
>> Amarasinghe, Tromer
>> is trying to develop further techniques for thwarting cache attacks
>> by
>> disrupting the correlations between encryption keys and memory access
>> patterns. A couple weeks ago, at the Association for Computing
>> Machinerys
>> Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, the researchers
>> announced that
>> they had a proof-of-concept prototype of a defense system, but
>> they plan to
>> continue testing and refining it before publishing any papers.
>>
>> Tromer has also been investigating whether cloud computing  the
>> subcontracting of computational tasks to networked servers
>> maintained by
>> companies like Amazon and Google  is susceptible to cache attacks.
>> Many web
>> sites rely on cloud computing to handle sudden surges in their
>> popularity:
>> renting added server space for a few hours at a time can be much
>> cheaper than
>> maintaining large banks of proprietary servers that frequently
>> stand idle.
>>
>> The word cloud is supposed to suggest that this vast
>> agglomeration of
>> computing power is amorphous and constantly shifting, but Tromer and
>> colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, were able to
>> load
>> their eavesdropping software onto precisely the same servers that
>> were
>> hosting websites theyd targeted in advance. In part, their
>> approach involved
>> spreading their software across a number of servers, then assailing a
>> targeted website with traffic. By spying on the caches of the
>> servers hosting
>> their software, they could determine which were also trying to keep
>> pace with
>> their fake traffic spikes. Once theyd identified the target sites
>> servers,
>> they could use cache monitoring to try to steal secrets.
>>
>> Imagine a stock broker that specializes in a specific company,
>> Tromer says.
>> If you observe that his virtual machine is particularly active,
>> that could
>> be valuable information. Or you may want to know how popular your
>> competitors website is. Weve actually demonstrated that we can very
>> robustly estimate web server popularity.
>>
>> This has sparked the imagination of both the research community and
>> industry, Rohatgi says. I interact with a lot of people in
>> industry, and
>> when they say, Give me the technical basis for this, I point to
>> [Tromer and
>> colleagues] papers.
>>
>> Finally, Tromer is continuing work he began as a graduate student,
>> on the use
>> of a hundred-dollar commodity microphone to record the very
>> sounds emitted
>> by a computer and analyze them for information about cryptographic
>> keys. So
>> far, Tromer hasnt been able to demonstrate complete key
>> extraction, but he
>> believes hes getting close.
>>
>> Any information at all about a computers internal workings is
>> actually
>> fairly damaging, Rohatgi says. In some sense, some of these
>> cryptographic
>> algorithms are fairly brittle, and with a little extra information,
>> you can
>> break them.
