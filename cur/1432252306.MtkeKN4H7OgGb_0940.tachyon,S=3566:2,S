I saw the Sturgeon General explaining that "we now have better treatment 
methods."

I thought he might have been right, inasmuch as we had heard that Victim 
#2, in Florida, was mending nicely from inhalation anthrax. Ah, but it 
now looks like #2 was not a real case of inhalational anthrax.

(I don't count the half dozen subcutaneous cases, or any of the "one 
spore was picked up on a swab" cases.)

It looks like this Maryland case is a real Case #2. If he survives, 
it'll mean the Sturgeon General was right to say we now can handle 
anthrax. But I expect he's a goner.
