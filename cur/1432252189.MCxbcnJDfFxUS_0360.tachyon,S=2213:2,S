There's actually been quantum error correction for as long as ten years 
already, so I suspect that somewhere deep underground in the greater DC-area 
there's a giant QC that's actually starting to do some interesting things. 
But I'd also bet any amount of $$$ it's more than a decade behind anything 
in the electronic domain. The knee in the curve is several years away.

The mapping between elliptical curve crypto and quantum algorithms is a very 
interesting question that I have no idea of. No doubt, however, the 
affinities (or lack thereof) is already known. Look for telltale odd 
standards-bodies pushes towards certain approaches.
