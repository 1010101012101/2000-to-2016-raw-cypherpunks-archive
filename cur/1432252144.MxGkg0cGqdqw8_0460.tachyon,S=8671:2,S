Drone War Exposed b the complete picture of CIA strikes in Pakistan

August 10th, 2011 | by Chris Woods | Published in All Stories, Covert Drone
War, Drones carousel  |  1 Comment Pakistani villagers at funeral of drone
victim - December 29 2010- AP

CIA drone strikes have led to far more deaths in Pakistan than previously
understood, according to extensive new research published by the Bureau. More
than 160 children are among at least 2,292 people reported killed in US
attacks since 2004. There are credible reports of at least 385 civilians
among the dead.

In a surprise move, a counter-terrorism official has also released US
government estimates of the numbers killed. These state that an estimated
2,050 people have been killed in drone strikes b of whom all but an estimated
50 are combatants.

Reassessment

The Bureaubs fundamental reassessment of the covert US campaign involved a
complete re-examination of all that is known about each US drone strike.

bThe Obama administration must explain the legal basis for drone strikes in
Pakistan to avoid the perception that it acts with impunity. The Pakistan
government must also ensure accountability for indiscriminate killing, in
violation of international law, that occurs inside Pakistan,b Sam Zarifi,
Amnesty International

The study is based on close analysis of credible materials: some 2,000 media
reports; witness testimonies; field reports of NGOs and lawyers; secret US
government cables; leaked intelligence documents, and relevant accounts by
journalists, politicians and former intelligence officers.

The Bureaubs findings are published in a 22,000-word database which covers
each individual strike in Pakistan in detail. A powerful search engine, an
extensive timeline and searchable maps accompany the data.

The result is the clearest public understanding so far of the CIAbs covert
drone war against the militants. Yet US intelligence officials are understood
to be briefing against the Bureaubs work, claiming bsignificant problems with
its numbers and methodologies.b

Iain Overton, the Bureaubs editor said: bIt comes as no surprise that the US
intelligence services would attack our findings in this way.  But to claim
our methodology is problematic before we had even published reveals how they
really operate. A revelation that is reinforced by the fact that they cannot
bring themselves to refer to non-combatants as what they really are:
civilians and, all too often, childrenb.

Many more strikes

The Bureaubs data reveals many more CIA attacks on alleged militant targets
than previously reported. At least 291 US drone strikes are now known to have
taken place since 2004.

The intended targets b militants in the tribal areas b appear to make up the
majority of those killed. There are 126 named militants among the dead since
2004, though hundreds are unknown, low-ranking fighters. But as many as 168
children have also been reported killed among at least 385 civilians.

More than 1,100 people are also revealed to have been injured in the US drone
attacks b the first time this number has been collated.

In the wake of the Bureaubs findings Amnesty International has called for
more CIA transparency. bThe Obama administration must explain the legal basis
for drone strikes in Pakistan to avoid the perception that it acts with
impunity. The Pakistan government must also ensure accountability for
indiscriminate killing, in violation of international law, that occurs inside
Pakistan,b said Amnestybs Director of Asia Pacific Sam Zarifi.

The Bureaubs key findings

    291 CIA attacks have taken place in Pakistan b 8% more than previously
reported. Under President Obama alone there have been 236 strikes b one every
four days.

    Between 2,292 and 2,863 people are reported to have died in the attacks b
most of them militants

    The minimum number of reported deaths is far higher than previously
believed b with 40% more recorded casualties. Most of those killed are likely
to be low-ranking militants.

    126 named militants have so far been killed.

    The Bureau has collated credible news reports of 385-775 civilians being
killed in the attacks.

    The Bureau has identified credible reports of 164 children killed in the
drone strikes. Under President Bush, one in three of all attacks is reported
to have killed a child.

    For the first time the Bureau has compiled accurate details of recorded
injuries in drone strikes, revealing that at least 1,114 people have been
wounded.

Civilian deaths

With the US military unable to operate overtly inside Pakistan, the Obama
administration has come to rely heavily on CIA drone strikes to attack
alleged militants in the countrybs western tribal areas. To date, at least
236 drone attacks have been ordered in Obamabs name, the Bureaubs research
shows.

At least 1,842 people have been reported killed in the Obama strikes, most of
them militants.

Recently, Obamabs chief counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan stated that
the president has binsistedb that Pakistan drone strikes bdo not putb&
innocent men, women and children in dangerb. Yet at least 218 of those killed
in drone attacks in Obamabs time in office may have been civilians.

More than 160 children are among at least 2,292 people reported killed in US
attacks since 2004. There are credible reports of at least 385 civilians
among the dead.

Civilian casualties do seem to have declined in the past year. Yet the Bureau
still found credible evidence of at least 45 civilians killed in some ten
strikes in this time.  The US continues to insist that it bcanbt confirm any
noncombatant casualtiesb in the past year.

The most recently reported civilian fatality was on July 12.  Abdul Jalil, a
migrant worker home on leave from Dubai, was bcollateral damageb when the CIA
attacked a car carrying eight alleged militants, the Bureaubs researchers in
Waziristan report.

Internal US figures

The US governmentbs own internal estimates of those killed in the drone
strikes total about 2,050, the Bureau has learnt. All but 50 of these are
militants, and that no bnon-combatantsb have died in the past year, a US
counter-terrorism official noted. The Bureaubs own minimum suggested casualty
figure is 2,292.

Yet a US counter-terrorism official told the Bureau that its numbers were
bway off the markb. The Washington-based official said: bThese actions target
militants planning actively to kill Afghans, Pakistanis, Europeans, and
Americans among others, and most often the operations occur when theybre
training or on the move, getting ready to attack. Over 4,000 Pakistani
civilians have been killed by terrorists since 2009bthe threat is clear and
real.b

Reprieve, the legal action charity which campaigns on human rights issues
said:  bWith the Bureaubs findings, at last we have a hard and comprehensive
look at the facts.  It is a great start. From now on, Reprieve hopes people
will read official propaganda about drone warfare with a grain of saltband
ask themselves whether drones are radicalizing as many young men as
GuantC!namo did.b
