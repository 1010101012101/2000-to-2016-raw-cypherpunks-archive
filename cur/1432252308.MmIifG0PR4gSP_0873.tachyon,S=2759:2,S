Hi all,

This is not biology related. I recall that a lot of cypherpunks are
hanging out on this list. While this is hardly encryption and
cyphering, it's still up their alley.

It's an exploration of IE 0day CVE-2010-0249, the exploit that was
used in China by malicious users to gain access to Google's documents,
data, etc. I found the analysis very thorough and educational.
