Army Wants Grenade bBots to Fly, Spy, Then Kill

Categories: Army and Marines

The militarybs already got grenades that do plenty more than detonate: They
can spray rubber pellets, obliterate underwater opponents and even, uh, be
catapulted from the air in a tiny robocopter.  But the next generation of
grenade? Oh, no biggie, itbll just navigate through the sky on-command, spy
on our enemiesb& and then blow them all up.

At least, if the Armybs latest bright idea moves forward. In their new round
of small business solicitations, top brass are asking for proposals thatbd
yield what amounts to a very deadly grenade-drone love child. Or, as the
Armybs calling it, bA Hovering Tube-Launched Micromunition.b

Already, the Armybs made some impressive advances where grenade munitions are
concerned. Just last year, they ordered up hundreds of bMen in Blackb grenade
launchers, capable of shooting bsmartb grenades loaded with sensors and
microchips that communicate with a guidance system. And of course, drone
development is so hot right now. Used in surveillance for years, the unmanned
vehicles are now getting loaded up with missiles b or, as the newly developed
Switchblade Drone illustrates, turning into missiles themselves.

The Armybs grenade-of-tomorrow would be capable of being fired off from a
launcher before it would bhover/loiter by using propulsion and glideb
according to navigational instructions sent by on-the-ground operators. The
loitering grenade would be able to maneuver itself for 10 minutes and up to
0.6 miles. Of course, the grenades wouldnbt just mosey around. Each one could
bsurvey enemy targets by using a miniature day/night camerab and offer video
feed and GPS coordinates to troops.

Itbs easy to see how that kind of intel b taken inside compound walls, on the
12th floor of a building or anywhere else troops canbt readily, safely access
b could be incredibly valuable. Not to mention that once soldiers have the
info they need, the hovering grenade can make the ultimate sacrifice. The
Army wants each one loaded with ba lethal payloadb to blow whateverbs spied
by the grenadebs cameras to smithereens. Sounds a lot like the Switchblade,
which will offer surveillance and lethality in a bbackpack sizedb device,
except presumably even smaller. At this rate, itbs only a matter of time
before death-from-above shrinks enough to turn the Air Forcebs adorable
micro-aviary into an extremely deadly one.
