Sterling makes a comment betraying what Ludwig Von Mises called the 
anti-capitalist mentality when he quipped to Godwin: "Sure, we hate Exxon because 
they're huge and they're everywhere."

Sterling is a capitalist in the same way that Brin is a libertarian. I think 
what it is, both are uncomfortable with really labeling what their true 
ideology is and therefore feel some need to candy coat their statism.
