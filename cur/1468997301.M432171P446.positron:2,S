Not to mention our Aussie post 9/11 gestapo legislation which has snuck
under the radar and never been repealed. Australia is now just awaiting
a modern Hitler to "put it to good use" - detention without lawyer
because "terrorist", no right to say you are detained, or why, to your
family, indefinite detainment, no right to trial by jury, no nothing. If
you're a terrst, you're gone! Pretty sure we have similarly bad comms
legislation to Russia.

I proposed an cypherPlusPunks list (or "politicopunks" or
"anythingpunks"), but a few folks suggested it probably would not be
useful, and that this list, being anarchist and all, was not really up
for censoship of any kind.

My thesis is that everything we do, everything we say, everything we
code, -is- politics to a greater degree. The geopolitical status today
is hectic, and possibly getting worse by the month. And so, we need to
focus on whatever we can possibly do to bring this beast called the USA
down to a soft landing for the rest of the world.

Whatever it takes, this is our primary goal.

After that, we can get back to our lives in general.
