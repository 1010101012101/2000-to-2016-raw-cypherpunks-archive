I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.

So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.

This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)
