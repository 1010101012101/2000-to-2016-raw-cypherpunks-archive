Miller wasn't prosecuted.  She was not charged with a crime.  She was not in 
danger of being charged if she had "revealed the identity". She was jailed 
for contempt of court for obstructing a grand jury investigation by refusing 
to testify.  Perhaps no one should be required to testify but current law 
here is that when subpoenaed by a grand jury investigating a possible crime, 
one is obliged to answer their questions except in a small number of 
exceptional circumstances (self-incrimination would be one example).  Miller 
is seeking to be placed above the law that applies to the rest of us.

You're confused.  AFAIK, no one has suggested that Novak commited a crime in 
this case. The "actual crime (of revealing)" is what the grand jury was 
attempting to investigate; Miller was jailed for obstructing that 
investigation.
