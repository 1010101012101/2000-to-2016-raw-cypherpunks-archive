I'm a little unease with all these labels you use to portrait people.
Our paths in life are not in our complete control neither are our
conditions. These labels seem only to bring unfairness to their cases
and do not help ours. The things for which they became targets are more
important to us all than a moralized narrative of their public
characters.

Manning for me is far from insane. These kind of words I'd use to
describe some pompous pricks who could never understand Hans C.
Andersen.
