An unsubscribe command sent to the lne.com administrivia address was 
rejected as spam?

I find that hard to believe, as that is one of the normal commands, 
ones which the lne regular message lists.

Perhaps you tried to send an unsubscribe message to the actual lne.com 
list site, rather than the administrivia address.


Check which address you mailed to.
