Maybe I'm oversimplifying, but it seems to me that Godel's
theorem follows trivilaly once you've heard of Cantor's
diagonal slash.  As I understand it, Godel's theorem says
in essence that in any system complex enough to include the
irrational numbers there must be statements which are true in that
system but which cannot be proven in that sytem.  But since
there are uncountably many irrational numbers,
there are uncountably many statements of the form
A=A  which are true but which cannot be expressed with a finite
number of symbols.
