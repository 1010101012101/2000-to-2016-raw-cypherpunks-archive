Is it me, or is there something sadly desperate in the recent actions of
various government prosecutors in their efforts to censure anyone remotely
weak enough to be safely attacked?

I suppose that students in Florida must now go before a Judge and obtain a
warrant if they wish to tape their classes.

If that succeeds, the next kid may get charged with loitering.
