The Supreme Court isn't supposed to be interpreting the Constitution per
se, they're supposed to be deciding if laws passed by Congress are
constitutional. Two different animals.

Last time I checked Scalia had no problem ignoring ...shall make no law...

He certainly isn't bitching about the IR search violations of the 4th.

I don't believe he was in the opposition to the 'assisted suicide' ruling
which states that there is no right in the Constition in this regards. In
direct contradiction to both the 9th and 10th.

Scalia is a hypocrite.
