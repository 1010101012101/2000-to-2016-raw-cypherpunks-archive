Isn't it within the Official Charter to explore the limits of social
crypto?  The constraints imposed by possible states?

Bingo.

Why do you think this would stop certain states?  Look at the
content-filters used in public libraries and schools.  (Can't
find poultry recipes or oncology info because of mammary glands.)

They can't control crypto, which is math; and they can't control
individual
behavior, even if they can control bulk behavior.  But they do control
commerce and mass
production and the physical bit-handlers.  The FCC has vans.

Your mesh won't work so well when the only meshers are afraid of being
caught, and sparse besides.

Don't you regard the limits of the (e.g., cypherpunk) model as part of
the study?

When I say "the FCC has vans" (etc) it is sometimes only representative
of
precursors of trends and possibilities, if it isn't obvious.

You are projecting.  I don't have goals of anarchy.  (I'm a lib.)
I'm interested in the social implications of, and tech behind, crypto
things.
I assume most are like this, though some are socialist, and you are
a troll.

AP is sci-fi (for now) precisely because of the control over the
physical
implementations of bits and currency.

That some here predicted, even advocated that such a technical system
would be used
to clean up the civil servant population is another matter entirely.

Both are valid if orthogonal points.  (Civilian-authorities get fragged
even without compooters)

And IMHO you'd be immoral, for some possible future (and past) civil
servant populations, to object to this encouragement, to feel a little
hope
that one possible future isn't a boot stomping a face, forever (even if
that face
is reading uncensorable news while being stomped)

I don't think my membership card requires me to believe that there is
only
one possible future outcome.   It requires me to understand how such
a system works, including how it might work on a social level.

Get off the assassination thang.  Yes, uncensorable news & views
will be possible.  That's not sufficient.

Freedom of expression (bits) is one of many rights.  Crypto can do the
most here.
But bits don't exist outside of physical implementations, so they rely
on physical rights.
Also, most rights are physical rights ("the right to be left alone" is
more general than
"the right to be free of compelled speech").

That is what needs

Um, we're talking about meshing radios, not guns or AP.  And social
(govt) control of things like those radios, and networks, and the
devices
that use them.  And how such physical control might affect reaching the
cypherpunk-predicted future.

Sorry that I pissed on your orthodoxy by doubting that everything was
inevitable in its strongest form..
