Widespread black markets, for drugs, betting, etc., suggest otherwise.

There are many markets out there which do not rely on the official 
court system to enforce contracts for.

Besides Mafia markets, there are international trade systems which 
typically don't invoke the laws of Fiji or Botswana or even the U.S. 
to make them work.

In fact, most of our ordinary decisions and dealings are done 
"anarchically," from deciding which restaurants to visit to the 
buying of books and whatnot. The laws that exist have almost no role 
in such decisions (lest anyone cite "health standards" for 
restaurants, this is both secondary to decisions and has historically 
been handled without governmental regulation).

As with Aimee, you haven't thought outside the box.

You being a lawyer larvae, and Aimee being an official lawyer, is 
this something that _comes_ from being a lawyer, or is this something 
that causes a person to give up doing something real, like 
programming or designing chips, to _become_ a lawyer?
