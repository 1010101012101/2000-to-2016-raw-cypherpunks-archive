I would suggest that Al Jazeera's Management consider is a live english
translation service carried over the internet.  You simply broadcast you
video through an existing software product like read video while
providing simultaneous translation in english.  I think that would be more
cost effective and will reach more people then an english service on an
additional satelite transponder.

Many Americans and other westerners are searching for answers and were not
getting much attention from our local broadcasters.  All we end up getting
is propaganda and not much else.

In closing thank you for the consideration you have given my request.
