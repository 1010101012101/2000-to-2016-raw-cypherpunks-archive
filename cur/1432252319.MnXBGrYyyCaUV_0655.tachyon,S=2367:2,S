   from the do-you-want-to-play-a-game dept.
   ScentCone writes "The CIA has booked some conference rooms and is
   [1]working through a simulated 'digital Pearl Harbor' to see how
   government and industry handle a monster net attack from an imaginary
   future foe composed of anti-American and anti-globalization hackers.
   Having been accused of lacking imagination about potential terror
   attacks, they're using the exercise to better shape the government's
   roles in a variety of attack scenarios. The networking industry, it
   seems, is expected to always play a big part in detecting and
   thwarting such threats, as 9/11-scale economic disruption is a likely
   bad-guy objective."
