You little piece of shit, don't you "we" us.

I have no quarrel with anyone just because some shithead wrote or said something.

My direct experience with Taliban (zero) and US government (a lot) makes latter a much bigger problem. Your handlers are trying to embed this "taliban" thing into sheeple's heads so that dogs of war can be let loose.

But just looking at WHO GAINED the most (see criminology 101), it's the US government that is the prime suspect here. I don't see ANY real gain for islam/jihad whatsoever.

>up the wall.

We ?

Fuck you.
