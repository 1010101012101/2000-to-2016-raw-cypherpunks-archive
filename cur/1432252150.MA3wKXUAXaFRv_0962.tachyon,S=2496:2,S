Trivially uninteresting, because of the "fax effect."

Until the overwhelming percentage of those I really need to get through 
to me have started using such a system, too many messages lost.

Which is a side effect of the important fact that currency varies from 
person to person. There is no fixed value of either money or access.

As a data point, subject to change, nobody I really care to communicate 
with at this time either has (to the best of my knowledge) a PayPal 
account nor is hep to the idea of spending a few hours trying to learn 
how to pay to send me messages. Perhaps they know that I neither have a 
PayPal account nor will spend the time to figure out how to receive 
their paid messages.

Q.E.D.
