Well, the basic idea is to co-encrypt some "fake" data that looks like the 
real data, so that when they find it (using the key to the fake data of 
course) they'll figure you gave them the real key, because they won't know 
that there ever was a fake key leading to fake data. (And I suppose there's 
no reason not to allow for mutliple batches of fake data that get encrypted 
along with the real data.)

And depending on the situation, the key-holder will decide whether to give 
them a key that destroys the real data, or that doesn't (and hides it).

In some situations, the fake data could be something completely innocuous 
and unrelated to what "they" were looking for, or in other cases it could 
look like what they were looking for albeit with doctored information.
