Publishing via an anonymous Internet connection directly to P2P
makes sense, and scanning for such information does also make
sense, as you can't notify Wikileaks about a document published
without drawing even more scrutiny to you.

Whether this is happening, or the Tiversa is just being a blowhard
will be difficult to say without further evidence, either from WL
or from Tiversa.
