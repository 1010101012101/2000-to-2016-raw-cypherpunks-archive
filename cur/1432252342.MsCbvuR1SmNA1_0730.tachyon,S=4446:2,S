> Synopsis
> One of the Second World War's most fascinating stories is that of  
> the Enigma machine, a portable encryption device widely used by the  
> Germans, whose ciphers they believed to be totally secure.  
> Nevertheless, by mathematical analysis and modern technology (and a  
> certain amount of good luck), the Allies devised techniques for  
> 'breaking' Enigma ciphers, and thus read several million German  
> messages, providing a wealth of reliable Intelligence. The attack on  
> Enigma, initiated by the Poles in the 1930s, was later perfected by  
> the British at Bletchley Park, today open to the public as a museum  
> site.
>
> The Intelligence gained was of immense value to the Allies in  
> virtually every theatre of war, but nowhere more so than in the  
> Battle of the Atlantic, that fierce conflict which lasted nearly six  
> years and cost over 60,000 lives. Dr Baldwin uses the Battle of the  
> Atlantic to exemplify the importance of codebreaking in winning the  
> war.
>
> After the presentation, the audience are invited to take part in a  
> hands-on practical demonstration of one of the few surviving Enigma  
> machines. Only about 200 are known to survive worldwide; of these,  
> only about a dozen are in public collections in Britain. As these  
> machines are so rare, Dr Baldwin is providing a unusual opportunity  
> for the audience not just to view, but also to operate, an original  
> 4-rotor Enigma machine (i.e. the more sophisticated model, developed  
> for the U-Boat service in 1942). This is of particular interest, as  
> there is no working machine on permanent public display anywhere in  
> England north of Bletchley Park, and nowhere at all in Wales,  
> Scotland or Ireland.
