So I got the email below in my inbox. From a well meaning person but
to me personally it's just spam - the well-paved road to hell of
course.

So then I thinks "what might be useful to the other recipients of this
well-meaning email sender?"

And I almost hit reply-all to whip up something which might actually
be useful to folks.

But "install CyanogenMod" is probably, may be, just slightly tiny bit
too technical for most people. They'd have to figure out how to sync/
backup their contacts, text messages, etc etc, let alone any sort of
"anti "dance of the pope" software :)

Sorry about my ignorance, perhaps cyanogen does all that via google,
I've no idea really - anyway, it's a real issue if I go running about
making recommendations to people.

So my conclusion is "right now, we have no ready answers for Joe SixPack".

Am I wrong?

TIA,
Zenaan

the dance of the Pope. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it
is very dangerous. They announced it today on the radio. Pass  on to as
many as you can. It was announced on the radio in USA.
