Come on! This is a May trollTale!

You're telling me that the dumb m*therf*ckers that program these systems 
allowed for a mere test to fully replicate the voting identity of the 
Governer? Seems to me too that the original test vote will count.

Maybe doesn't "need killing" (as that would reinforce state legitimacy in 
this case) but someone  surely needs a bad beating.

Like I said: 1984 is not the most probable future. "Brazil" is.
