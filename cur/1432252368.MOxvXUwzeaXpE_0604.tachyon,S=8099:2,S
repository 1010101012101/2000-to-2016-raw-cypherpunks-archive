- data and application security
- data integrity
- denial of service attacks
- dependability
- digital right managament
- firewalls
- formal methods in security
- identity management
- inference control
- information dissemination control
- information flow control
- information warfare
- intellectual property protection
- intrusion tolerance
- language-based security
- network security
- non-interference
- peer-to-peer security
- privacy-enhancing technology
- pseudonymity
- secure electronic commerce
- security administration
- security as quality of service
- security evaluation
- security management
- security models
- security requirements engineering
- security verification

The primary focus is on high-quality original unpublished research,
case studies and implementation experiences. We encourage submissions
of papers discussing industrial research and development. Proceedings
will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Papers should be at most 15 pages
excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point
font), and at most 20 pages total. Committee members are not required
to read the appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible
without them.

To submit a paper, send to esorics05@dti.unimi.it a plain ASCII text
email containing the title and abstract of your paper, the authors'
names, email and postal addresses, phone and fax numbers, and
identification of the contact author. To the same message, attach
your submission (as a MIME attachment) in PDF or portable postscript
format. Do NOT send files formatted for word processing packages
(e.g., Microsoft Word or WordPerfect files). Submissions not meeting
these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

Submissions must be received by March 25, 2005 in order to be
considered. Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to
authors by May 30, 2005. Authors of accepted papers must be prepared
to sign a copyright statement and must guarantee that their paper
will be presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers must
follow the Springer Information for Authors' guidelines for the
preparation of the manuscript and use the templates provided there.
