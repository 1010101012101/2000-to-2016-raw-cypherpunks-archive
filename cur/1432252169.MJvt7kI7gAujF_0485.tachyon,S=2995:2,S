I am seeking information on a CIA operation known as
CPIC/West located in Bend, Oregon. This is a sister
station of CPIC/Miami, or OC/Miami, or CPIC/East, which 
was described on this list in 1998 by Kenneth C. Stahl, 
a former communications specialist for the Agency.

The Oregon operation may be known also as CIA-ISTAC,
also possibly located in Bend, Oregon, which was a subject
of a recent federal trial in Tacoma, Washington.
