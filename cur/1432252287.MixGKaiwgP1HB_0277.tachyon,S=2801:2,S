Huh? any implantable is removeable...  What, kidnappers, in Mexico don't
have access to alumium foil, faraday cages, frequency counters and
{hatchets,knives,scalpels,chain saws}, etc?

Which means it's transmitting, and to do so, it's not an RFID, it's a bug 
with a battery.  If if it doesn't transmit at all times, there's a scar 
somewhere which points where it is.

This ploy would have only worked if the kidnappers didn't know about it in
advance.  Now they do.  It will stop the lame ones.  The hardass criminals
know how to deal with it.

IMHO, this is a publicity op - not much else, designed to discourage 
potential kidnappers, and enourage the public to get chipped.


"What's the frequency Kenneth?" comes to mind.  ROTFL!
