KESQ NewsChannel 3 Palm Springs, CA:

Bush backs banks' appeal of Calif's financial privacy law

SACRAMENTO The Bush administration stepped into a lawsuit challenging
California's landmark financial privacy law today.
The administration is urging a federal judge to side with banks that want
to overturn restrictions on how they can share customer information.

The new state law requires banks to get permission from customers before
giving nonaffiliated companies customers' financial information like their
bank balance or spending habits.
