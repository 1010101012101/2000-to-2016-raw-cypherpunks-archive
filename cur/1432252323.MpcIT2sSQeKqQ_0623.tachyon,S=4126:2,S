Now - i've replied to you below - but I think were missing the point of
the post.  So i'll repeat - it's easy to do harm when you have the will to
die to rally your cause - as we have seen on sept 11.  and i find it
regrettable that conditions exist in which people use extreme methods
to focus the people of this planet on the fact that western governments
are basically evil.

Now the remainder of my reply is not much more then having a physics
discussion - which i think is not the point - but --

I said it was malleable - it can be worked.  maybe not the same way or
gold or silver - but as you can see from the periodic table it is
malleable.  I personally have never worked it.  But i have seen a few
pelets in my lifetime.

Possible - never build one myself.  I would assume that if it is harder to
work then gold - then just get very thick stanless steel bowls.  I'm sure
you'd need a few trials to figure it out.

just what it means - so your right - it shares that characteristic with
other metals.

sounds unrefined or badly oxidized.  I've never seen chunks of
uranium.  Was this in it's unrefined state.  What was it
exactly.  Pitchblende?
