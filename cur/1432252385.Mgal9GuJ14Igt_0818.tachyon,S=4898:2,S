Yes we currently default to using BATMAN to generate the route's
between nodes on the network. We also support olsr as the underlying
mesh routing protocol. And we can run our software with a network of
just an access point and its clients, mainly to support clients that
don't allow the right wifi modes for mesh networking. And longer term
we intend to replace the mesh routing layer with our own protocol
layer.

Our long term goals also include removing the need for running a full
blown asterisk installation, and SIP client, on a phone with
effectively only one extension. This would also drastically reduce our
installation size.

The main pieces of work that will need to be done for any port as I see them;
- see if we can connect to, or start, an adhoc wifi network. May be impossible.
- compile and run dna for number -> network address resolution.
- minimal VOIP server, perhaps with simplified network protocol, to
handle in/out call state. Porting asterisk might work, but is
overkill.
- UI layer for user interaction, dialing, answering and configuration.
