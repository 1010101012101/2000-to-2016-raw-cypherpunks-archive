	Source? And even if that were true, then that would be how he
	got caught? using tor?  Hardly good advertising for tor. I know
	that allegedly he was betrayed, but, you know, "parallel
	construction".


	Truth is, it would have been a lot better for him to copy any
	data he wanted to 'leak' and mail it using 'snail mail'.

	How? Not meaning to badmouth manning, it's not his fault that
	the US is a fascist cesspool, but americans either don't give a
	fuck about their mass murdering government, or cheer for it.
