Hi everyone

I want to announce to the list that a new rlease of tor-ramdisk is out.
Tor-ramdisk is a uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only
purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes
security and privacy.  Security is enhenced by hardening the kernel and
binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be off at all
levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal
information.  Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no
information survives a reboot, except for the Tor configuration file and
the private RSA key, which may be exported/imported by FTP.

Changelog:

This release incorporates an important security fix from upstream
following a breach of some Tor project servers.  Only tor was bumped to
version 0.2.1.22 while everything else remain the same as the 20100115
release.  The change was made to the i686, MIPS, and x86_64 images.
