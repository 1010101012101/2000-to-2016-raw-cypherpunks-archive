In the latest issue of 2600 Quarterly, a reader writes in to brag about how
he recently drove around his neighborhood with the receiver-half of a
wireless camera (a la the X-10 camera... you know, you've seen those
relentless X-10 pop-up ads recently) connected to a portable TV, and
discovered that many of his neighbors had spy cameras set up in all kinds
of fun places. Apparently lots more people than you might think like to spy
on other members of their own families... or themselves... or their pets...
children... baby sitters, etcetera. And of course, that his activity,
intercepting publicly broadcast, unencrypted video, (probably) isn't even
illegal. Every one of those people was inadvertently entering the business
of broadcast media.
