Although your examples are important, anyone who
has or has known someone with depression,
schizophrenia, or ADD [1] will argue that *subjectively unpleasant*
mental ills are as worth fixing as bad teeth.  If not more so.

Agreed, as with the rest of your post.  There are real
horrorshow future possibilities.

One more point.  What is "adaptive" depends on
your environment.  As I try to explain to my
more pigmented wife (it comes up because my
3.8 year old is in the "why" phase) while I'd get skin cancer
in tropical zones, she'd get rickets in more
northerly areas.

Extrapolate to personality properties like
"inhibition" (recently shown to be persistant
from 2 to 20 year olds ie genetic)  "aggression", etc.

[1] Please don't lets start the flame about chemical coercion
in mandatory youth education camps.  Real ADD
fucks people up.  Which is not to say that M.Y.E.C.
are well designed nor that ADD treatments are abused.
