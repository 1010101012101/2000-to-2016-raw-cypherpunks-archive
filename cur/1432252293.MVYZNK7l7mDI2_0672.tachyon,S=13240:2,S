You forwarded one of my messages to my upstream provider (and someone 
else's upstream provider), complaining about my alleged spam. This has led 
my network provider to contact me, and has introduced friction into our 
relationship.

I understand now this was a mistake on your part. But I'm not sure if the 
conclusion from this episode is that I should be one who should be more 
careful -- shouldn't you be more careful before accusing someone of spamming?
