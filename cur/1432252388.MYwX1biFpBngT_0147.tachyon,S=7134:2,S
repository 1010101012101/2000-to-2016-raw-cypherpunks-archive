"Edward Snowden will be answering questions submitted by the public on 
his official support site, freesnowden.is <http://www.freesnowden.is>, 
this Thursday 23 January at 8pm GMT, 3pm EST. The support site is run by 
The Courage Foundation and is the only endorsed Snowden Defence Fund. 
<http://freesnowden.is/donate/index.html>

This is the first Snowden live chat since June 2013 and will last for an 
hour starting at 8pm GMT, 3pm EST. Questions can be submitted on twitter 
on the day of the event using the #AskSnowden hashtag. Edward Snowden's 
responses will appear at http://www.freesnowden.is/asksnowden

The live chat comes exactly a week after US President Barack Obama gave 
an address in response to the public concerns raised by Edward Snowden's 
revelations about US surveillance practices. In the live chat, Edward 
Snowden is expected to give his first reaction to the President's speech.

Courage (formerly the Journalistic Source Protection Defence Fund) is a 
trust, audited by accountants Derek Rothera & Company in the UK, for the 
purpose of providing legal defence and campaign aid to journalistic 
sources. It is overseen by an unrenumerated committee of trustees. 
Edward Snowden is its first recipient.

freesnowden.is <http://www.freesnowden.is> was commissioned by the 
trustees of Courage to provide information on the threats Edward Snowden 
faces and what can be done to support him, and details all revelations 
made to date <http://freesnowden.is/revelations/index.html> in a 
convenient central archive."
