How difficult it is to wait for a sunny day, wire a digital camera to take 
two pictures per second with very short exposition time, ducttape it on 
the dashboard or at the side or the back window in suitable angle, and 
then drive by in normal speed? If you screw up the angle, you can do it 
again (and again, and again...), because nobody pays attention to the 
"normally" behaving vehicles.

That way, no suspicion is ever aroused.

Or, use a big-lens camera from long distance.

The person in question was just somebody with a weakness for industrial 
architecture.
