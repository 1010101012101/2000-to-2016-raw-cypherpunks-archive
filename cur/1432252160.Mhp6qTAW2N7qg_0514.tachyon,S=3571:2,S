My bets are the Sandia folks will be there first, with their (whether SOS
or plain silicon) MEMS microturbine generator. I think they mentioned they
hoped to scale power density beyond 30 W in a cm^3 volume.

Otoh, such technology is prime candidate for powering military hardware in
the field, so maybe perhaps that's why they suddenly went mum on it.
