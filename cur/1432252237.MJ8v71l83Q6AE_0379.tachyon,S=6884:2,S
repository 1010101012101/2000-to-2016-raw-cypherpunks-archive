There seems to be a feeding frenzy of these "you're going to get in 
trouble!" posts.

Several weeks ago, it was the "spoliation" thread, with Aimee assuring 
us that using certain technologies must be illegal. She could say why, 
in real terms (real as opposed to "maybe in the future"), but she 
implied we would be on thin ice. Oddly, Black Unicorn added a blizzard 
of cites he claimed showed that using some technologies, even long in 
advance of a any charges being filed or orders issued, would be 
"taunting Happy Fun Court." Apparently the First, Fourth, Fifth, and 
Sixth Amendments are made moot when Mr. Happy Fun Court decides he is 
"not amused" by people using encryption.

Then we had Sandy Sandfort weighing in with his comment that some 
Cypherpunks are going to be in deep trouble with The Man. I think Sandy 
even forecast my death in a shootout.

About the same time, Aimee chided _us_ for allowing the "help me make 
bombz, d00dz!" posts, showing no sense of who is likely posting these 
formulaic attempts at entrapment. When we told her we can't stop the 
AOLers and WebTV script kiddies and cops, she said that merely talking 
about explosives is taunting happy fun court. (One wonders what Aimee 
thinks should happen to the publishers of "Encyclopedia Britannica" for 
helping so my pyrotechnics hobbyists and freedom fighters. Not to 
mention CNN, for reporting in detail how to safely manufacture Oklahoma 
City-grade Astrolite.)

And when we refused to stop the bombz posts to Aimee's satisfaction, she 
established her own "Bomb Law Reporter." Well, she'd _better_ be a Fed 
or a Fed helper, as she's connected herself and her newsletter out of 
Crawford and Waco to the construction of bombs. Ka-Boom!

Next, we started seeing sissies like Ray Dillinger, er, "Bear," some 
sort of polyamoristic wuss-ninny from northern California, urging us to 
change the subject, to talk about the nurturing and children-friendly 
aspects of crypto. Fuck that. This is not some list for leftie greens 
and wuss-ninnies.

Choate finds an ally in "Nomen Nescio," who bemoans the libertarian 
focus.

And Aimee is still rambling, talking to her snails, apologizing, 
blithering, and hinting that she is so worried about out our dangerous 
ideas that she may have to talk to her SS buddies (her "prime rib") 
about the threat we pose to the New World Order.

(Frankly, I think the odds are better than 50-50 that Aimee's sudden 
appearance on a bunch of liberty-oriented lists in late 2000, is not 
just because of her sudden interest in PGP, liberty, data havens, and 
Cypherpunks topics. Her clueless provocations on several of these lists 
match the M.O. of past list infiltrators. Whether she's actually a Fed, 
or is just borrowing the name of one of the Farrs from Waco or Caddo 
Mills (Hi, Gene Farr!) is not so important. She/he has ZERO, none, nada, 
nil Web presence prior to her/his sudden activism and encitement on 
several mailing lists in late 2000, around the time of the actions 
against Bell and the election. Maybe she's just a cut-out. Maybe she's 
just free-lancing for the Feds. Maybe she's just what she pretends to 
be, a twit who says she "represents the Establishment" when she's not 
talking to her snails. Sure is suspicious, though.)

So, bottom line, we seem to have a new faction of about half a dozen 
singing variants of these songs:

"But you can't say things like that!"

"Say what you want, it's your funeral."

"Do not taunt Happy Fun Court!"

"I'm gonna _tell_!"

"Tim May is a scary guy with a lot of guns who says he's going to defend 
his rights. I think you should raid his house and that of all of the 
other CACLs!"

"There are limits to free speech."

"Dig your own grave. My friends in Crawford are on to you."

"Blacknet is an interesting idea, but only if it used by Steele and his 
CIA friends. Can you assure us it will not be used except for good uses, 
such as those by the CIA and DEA?"

"I said I was gonna tell. I just did."

"This list used to be about peace and brotherhood and community and 
bliss. Unless Saint Eric returns to save the list, I'm, like, _so_ outta 
here!"

"Do not taunt Happy Fun Court!"


--Tim May
