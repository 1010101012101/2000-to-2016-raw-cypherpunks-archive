FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS

DoveBid believes that transaction support services are an integral element of our marketplace. In order to enhance the DoveBid customer experience, we have formed strategic alliances with industry leading service providers to offer buyers access to a variety of financial-related solutions, including financing, warranties and credit reports.

FINANCING
DoveBid has established relationships with LENDX and SierraCities, Inc., some of the world's largest asset-backed lenders. These lenders have financed the purchase of thousands of assets through auctions. In many cases, these financial service providers can provide instant access to needed capital required to make asset purchases.

LENDX 
 As a one-stop financing solution for the $233 billion corporate equipment finance market, the LENDX Exchange offers a simple to use yet powerful online equipment financing exchange, along with value-added information and services for both lenders/lessors and corporate borrowers/lessees.  LENDX works closely with medium and large-sized lessees seeking at least $1 million annually in equipment financing and with the lessors who serve their needs. 

SierraCities Inc. 
SierraCites.com has created an end-to-end automated credit engine that is paperless, speedy and built specifically for fulfilling & settling on-line transactions.  With terms ranging from 12-72 months and customer payment structures, SierraCities has the ability to satisfy any financing need. SierraCities' on-line format will accommodate transactions under $100,000 in a matter of minutes. 

WARRANTIES
For peace of mind when buying an asset, purchase an extended service plan from WarrantyNow,Inc. With each plan you receive access to 24-hour customer service, over 62,000 service centers in North America and an unlimited number of repairs for any warranted item (or a new one if it can't be fixed).  You also get a free SmartDrawer™ - a personal online administrative assistant and filing system. Use it to store and categorize assets or file claims electronically from any computer. 

CREDIT REPORTS
DoveBid provides easy access to Dun & Bradstreet credit reports.  Dun & Bradstreet reports are renowned for the up-to-date company and credit information they provide on over 11 million U.S. businesses. Find the financial, payment activity or corporate background information you need to make your credit decisions, sales calls and other business activities more profitable.
