A NEW elite crime-fighting body will lead the fight against serious and 
organised crime in a major overhaul of law enforcement being considered by 
the State Government.
A Victorian Crime Commission could be handed coercive powers.
This would remove the ability of a person it questions not to answer on the 
grounds of self-incrimination or legal professional privilege.
MORE ON
Usually its the 'conservatives' that love laura Norder,now in a race to the 
bottom on crime to rival that of the race to prostitute the State for 
Corporate criminals,the Labor party Tweedledum now outbids the Right on 
crime and even has them calling some of their Nazi like proposals what the 
are,a direct threat to long standing human and civil rights.At the same 
time more police powers are being proposed half the drug squad is under 
investigation for serious and longstandingcorruption.A 2 billion dollar 
drug case was just aborted due to this inquiry.
It is not a great enviroment to go on trial for death threats but there is 
no evidence,so...

I hope to lap up freedom before the year is out.
