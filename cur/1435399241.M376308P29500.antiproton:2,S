It will never be level once info leaves your personal space.
Left unrestricted, others will collect and collude against you.

That't why you must have control over your information.
So that you are not controlled.

work to expose and nullify attempted collection, collusion, and control.

Institutions are different from personal... many here could
make the case that the world would be better if those two lose
their privacy.

things that need no control.
