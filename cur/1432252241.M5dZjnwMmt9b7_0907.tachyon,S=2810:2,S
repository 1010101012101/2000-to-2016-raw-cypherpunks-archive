It is a badly bungled implementation of a really old idea.

An idea, which however, was never implemented on a large scale,
resulting in the mass use of phishing attacks.

Mutual authentication and password management should have been
designed into SSH/PKI from the beginning, but instead they
designed it to rely wholly on everyone registering themselves
with a centralized authority, which of course failed.

SSH/PKI is dead in the water, and causing a major crisis on
internet transactions.  Needs fixing - needs to be fixed by
implementing cryptographic procedures that are so old that they
are in danger of being forgetten.
