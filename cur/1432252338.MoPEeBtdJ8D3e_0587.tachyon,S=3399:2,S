Somewhere it has been written that it is high chickenshit to
post a claim that it will be "my last in the thread" rather than
just not shit that last pile and then walk away a little distance 
to spy who comes to sniff and shit on yours thus requiring 
yet one more dollop of numero uno grafitti, usually a while 
later when it can be done without calling attention to 
mirror-image idiocy of last word authoritarian fart-biters.

Still, no chickenshit behavior is more idiotic than plonking 
and kill-filing and bragging about them and recommending 
them ad pukem, rather just taking up doily crochet.

Time to lay off Jim Choate, too, Sandy, smells like hysteria.
And a bad provoke for mass hysteria which breaks out
here at the barest of fangs. Which never happened in the
golden days of comfort thinking.

Hope nobody agrees with this spit bomb. Spit.
