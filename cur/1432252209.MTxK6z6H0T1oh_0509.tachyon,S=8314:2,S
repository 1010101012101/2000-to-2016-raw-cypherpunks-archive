Greetings from Amazon.com! 

My name is Lisa Lindberg, and I'm from the Amazon.com Associates Program. 

The purpose of my letter is to promote the Amazon.com Associates Program to 
Web sites featuring books, music, and videos. If your site does just that, 
please read on as I'd like to discuss with you the benefits of joining our 
program. 

How can you benefit from the Associates Program? 

o Earn 5-15% of each sale every time you send us a customer from your site. 

o Easily link any of your site's content to a huge, complementary selection 
of products at Amazon.com. 
o Give your site visitors an instant purchase option they can trust.

What do you have to do to become a successful Associate? 

o Register your site with the program today by clicking the link 
below--it's FREE and only takes 5 minutes!
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/stores/ISBN2-20
o Build links from your homepage to Amazon.com. Or, link your content to 
any product on our site including specialized titles like Applied 
Cryptography : Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C that may appeal 
to your unique site visitors. 
o Use our easy reporting tools to check your earnings at any time.

Why should you join our Associates Program? 

o We have over 30 million customers. Visitors to your site are already 
customers of Amazon.com. When you join our program, we pay you when your 
visitors shop with us. 
o We have a strong, internationally recognized brand name. 
o We even feature state-of-the-art dynamic links--the Amazon.com 
Recommends(TM) Service. These powerful links change over time, 
automatically populating your Web site with fresh, new material--thus 
saving you extra work.

Click below to learn more about becoming an Amazon.com Associate. We'd love 
to have you join us!
