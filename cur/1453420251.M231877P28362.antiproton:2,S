You want insurance against loss or injury from motor vehicle
accidents, therefore I will pay for that insurance.  And if I
don't, hired thugs will kidnap or kill me on your behalf.

As long as I choose to obey traffic laws in a manner consistent
with public safety, I can not be held liable for any injury to you
resulting from my operation of a motor vehicle.  Therefore, I must
pay for your insurance.  The logic is inescapable:  You are a thief.

This "extrapolation" suggests that my position can not be disputed
by rational argument.

Demonstrating that an argument is dependent on a forced,
irrational context refutes the said argument.

Nice try, but I am not obligated to refute an argument while
staying within the bounds of the irrational context from which it
emerges.  Relevance is always grounds for objection.  Calling an
automobile a "weapon of mass destruction" does not do much for
your argument except to show that it emerges from a context of
irrational fear.

It can steal your money, on behalf of the industry that lobbied to
have it put in place.  Exactly like compulsory motor vehicle
insurance.

Progress!  We agree that you are arguing within a context where a
constant need for protection by (armed) third party authorities is
assumed.
