I completely support the idea of disloyalty oaths. The only problem I
see is that they simply wouldn't work. What we'd see is the government
putting increased threat of criminal prosecution on the corporate chain
and not enough corporate officers willing to risk going to jail in order
to do the right thing. Marissa Mayer from Yahoo said as much in her
Techcrunch interview last week.

The only option I see is that the public simply refuse to do business
with the offending companies and do business with their foreign
counterparts; take the money out of the US and do real harm to the US
economy in the process. When major companies start failing and everyone
knows it's because they betrayed their customers, the government will
have to respond. It's already starting to a degree. Microsoft and Google
have already said they're experiencing real financial loss because of
the NSA revelations.

We need to vote with our money. And we need to be willing to accept
'less viable' solutions for a time while other companies ramp up their
services. Are Americans willing to go that far? I'm not too sure. We
want comfort and convenience. Often, principles take a back seat to those.
