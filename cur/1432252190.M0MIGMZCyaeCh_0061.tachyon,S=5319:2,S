This suggestion turned up on Kuro5hin, a web discussion site (Slashdot's
baby brother):

    If you want to sterilize your mail, simply place the unopened
    envelope on an ironing board and place a damp, thin cloth on top of
    it. Then iron it. Yes, iron it. Just like you would iron your pants.
    The damp heat will kill any bacteria, including anthrax, inside the
    envelope, and you will be safe.

Probably more accessible to most of the population (and workplaces) than
claves, pressure cookers, or irradiation equipment.

Anyone have thoughts or (?) knowledge on efficacy, or guidelines on how
long the heating should last for decontamination?

The obvious terrorist counter-countermeasure would be to add a
heat-activated agent to the weapon.

Peace.
