Well, I don't trust the cloud and don't use it.
(I don't trust my boxen in a different way).

The cloud owns the CPU and this is enough for me.

You should be aware of the numerous virtualization
sploits -- Xen, Qemu, possibly others.

Exploiting a virtualization bug is just the fee
"to be in cloud" and I _suspect_ more efforts
are needed for my boxen.
