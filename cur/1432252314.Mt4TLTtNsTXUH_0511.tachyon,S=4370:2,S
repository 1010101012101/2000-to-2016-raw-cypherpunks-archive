My opinion on this is:
	No, we should not, as a society, offer any "safe harbor
to those that draw the short straws".

If you (as an individual) feel that these people should be helped,
then you should help them.

You are of course welcome to join with other like minded people and
form a "Indigent Aid Society" to help them in larger numbers.

Myself, I feel no compulsion to help "people".
My help is directed at individuals, whom I have personal knowledge of.
I don't contract out my charity to some faceless bureaucrat.

That one's easy. As much as each person wants to spend, individually decided.
If you want to spend 90% of your wealth on this, that your business.

Before the state got into the "do-gooding" business, there were many more
private charities.  Most of them couldn't compete with the state-sponsored ones,
for obvious reasons.
