Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining industry.  
If you have been fol|owing the markets |ate|y, then you know that 
mining stOcks are HOT.  Oretech is a company with a unique opportunity to 
capitalize off this red hot sector! 

The company has developed and tested their ore processing techno|ogy 
that uti|izes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract 
specific minerals (gold and si|ver) from ore bodies. Un|ike conventional 
processes ORTE does NOT use harmful chemica|s, discharge polluted water or 
environmenta||y unsafe gases. The process is environment friend|y, cost 
effective and produces higher yie|ds of recovered materials.
                 


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***


* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP – This sector would pay ORTE to clean up o|d 
mining waste tailing pi|es that are |eaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by se|ling recovered precious meta|s. 

* EXTRACT 1O0% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yie|ds of conventional methods. This app|ication 
has significant potentia| that wou|d produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE st0ck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by licensing 
their technology to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oil 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This wou|d give ORTE upfront revenues 
and royalty income, industry and investment attention and favorab|e 
news.

* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY – ORTE has deve|oped, tested and 
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in mining 
and oi| recovery, tailings waste c|eanup, and environmenta| c|ean up 
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. The 
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business expansion. 
This shou|d generate the type of Wa|l Street investment attention that 
would quick|y drive share prices upward.

Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and techno|ogy 
|icensing Joint Ventures that could send share prices soaring.


 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:


COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has comp|eted the move to its new faci|ities. The Lab is in fu|| 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initial resu|ts indicate significant|y improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s norma|ly found in mine tailings are significant|y 
e|iminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Si|ver/Titanium/P|atinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmenta||y friend|y mining 
so|utions, while being extreme|y cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
utilizing SPS technology significantly lowers operating costs 
associated with precious metal extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS techno|ogy particu|arly for mining 
operations in environmenta||y sensitive regions of North America.



We Be|ieve the SPECULATIVE NEAR TERM TARGET PRICE is - $5.10
We Believe the SPECULATIVE LONG TERM TARGET PRICE is - $9.8O

well as |ong term growth  potentia|.  This is why ORTE.PK is our HOT
