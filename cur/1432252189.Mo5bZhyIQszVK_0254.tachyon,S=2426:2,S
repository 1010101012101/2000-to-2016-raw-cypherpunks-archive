If it's not your backyard then it's none of your business. If it is look
into trespass and such. Being a minor won't protect them.

There is, postmen are responsible to trespass. I have some dogs and my old
postman had a problem with it, to the point of actually attacking one of
my dogs and chasing it around my yard. He got away with it by claiming my
dog attacked him. I moved my mailbox out to the street (there is a 3ft
easement that is considered a public/utility way) and talked to the local
postmaster general. It was made clear that if he stepped into my yard I
would press trespass. Both the postmaster and the local police agreed that
was legal.
