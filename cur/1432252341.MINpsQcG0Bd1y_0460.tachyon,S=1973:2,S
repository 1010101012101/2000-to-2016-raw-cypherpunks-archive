One of the early web anonymizing systems was the Web Canadianizer, eh?
It retrieved and dialectized web pages, and while it wasn't as thorough
as the Anonymizer, it worked pretty well, eh?

By the way, it's amusing and sad to see that one of the features
of the current Zero Knowledge Systems products is a Content Filtering
feature which not only blocks Sex and Violence but also Criminal Skills.
Presumably this means that it would block any access to ZKS Freedom,
the Anonymizer, and most other pages with Hacker information,
unless they've hacked it to whitelist their own services.
