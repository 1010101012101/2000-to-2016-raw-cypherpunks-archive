While I don't exactly know why the list died, I suspect it
was the fact that most list nodes offered a feed full of spam,
dropped dead quite frequently, and also overusing that "needs
killing" thing (okay, it was funny for a while).

The list needs not to stay dead, with some finite effort on our
part (all of us) we can well resurrect it. If there's a real content
there's even no need from all those forwards, to just fake
a heartbeat.
