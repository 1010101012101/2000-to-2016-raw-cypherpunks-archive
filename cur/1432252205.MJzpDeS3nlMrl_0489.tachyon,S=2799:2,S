Yeah, about as brilliant as a turd.  Didn't they recently call Al-Qaeda's 
network a hydra?  correct me if I don't recall my Ancient Greek myths, but 
when you cut off one head on the hydra, two more grow back, so are we to 
assume that future heads that grow back will carry such bounties?

A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real 
money.

I guess they do realize that these guys are idologists and the allmighty 
dollar is anathema to them, so they have to raise the bounty in order to 
get someone to betray him...   Never discount greed, no matter how 
ideological someone may be, at some ridiculous sum, someone somewhere will 
rat him out... perhaps just before the elections.
