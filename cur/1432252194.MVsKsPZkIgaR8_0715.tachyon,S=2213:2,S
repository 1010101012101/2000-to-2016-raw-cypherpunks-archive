Crypto AG's website denies the allegation of its machines being 
compromised. Its FAQ claims the false the story got started in 
1992 by a disgruntled employee.

There, that reassures Iran, Botswana, Nigeria and Uganda.

NSA never had those meetings with the machine designers.

Now, how about that story of Phil Zimmermann getting out
of prosecution by agreeing to a backdoor in PGP after 2.0?
A man swears Phil told him that face-to-face, man says
he disassembled the source code to see the damning hole.

And the one about PK being rigged at birth, not the Brit version,
the one made in the USA. A drunk ex-NSA had that on a 
ready-to-lose laptop bar-lifted by A. Melon.

And the uncrackability of crypto-mathematics, need only to worry 
about faulty implementation and poor passwords and black bag 
jobs and key loggers and insiders and EM leakage.

Heard the one about TEMPEST being a long-running 
tail-chaser?
