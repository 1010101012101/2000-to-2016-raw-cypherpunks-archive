Nope. The courts have upheld the right under the First to publish 
untraceably. (I think it was Talley, but I might be 
misremembering--someone will know the cite offhand.)

To be sure, setting up newspaper stands in public places will trigger 
various business, rental, tax, etc. rules.

But publishing a broadsheet or a newsletter or even a 300-page newspaper 
qua a _publication_ needs no permission slip or "ownership info."

There are those in local governments who claim it does, but they are 
wrong. Their killing is left as an exercise for the marksmen here.


As to the space cadet idea that space should be bought in newspapers so 
that CJ or Toto or Jimbell or Choate or Vulis or Detweiler or mattd or 
any of our other mental cases, knock yourself out. I wouldn't contribute 
a microcent.
