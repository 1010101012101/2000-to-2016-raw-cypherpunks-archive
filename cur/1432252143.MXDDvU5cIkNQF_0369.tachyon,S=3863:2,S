the usability is poor, compared to things like off the record [0] and
opportunistic keying, etc.  while i use encrypted mail daily in a
professional context, i never use it in a personal one.  sooner or
later the dinosaurs will drop it too.

it always tastes best when you cook it yourself.  (or at least, have
looked at the recipe and confirmed no cyanide or arsenic was
intentionally added *g*

[this, is my one complaint about OTR, building from source into a
useful client can be tedious compared to other methods...]

0. oh the hoops i had to jump to import an old otr 2.x key in gaim to
otr3.0.x in pidgin.  the friends list is also an interesting study in
use and frequency of re-key; while i can no longer recall when
A59CDCB3 46468A16 27D21678 270AF0B5 0B0477CF was originally generated
others appear to cycle as frequently as weekly or so.  interesting how
the same tool can span the key management spectrum from anonymous
opportunistic to strong mutually authenticated.
