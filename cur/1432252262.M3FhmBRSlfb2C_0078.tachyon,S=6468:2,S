Try expanding the idea to a more formal or longer paper
with diagrams.

Your suggested adversaries can and will run a 'receiver' to get the
contents. They are in the 'receiver's ISP and use netflow or other means
to trace back the spoofed packets. It's basic network administration.

Unless sender A is aware that final delivery was made to Z (or knows
the net is reliable), broadcast models will fail to deliver reliably due
to being clogged out of the links or aging. To be reliable, broadcast
needs control, knowledge, or maybe unavailably large time/space.

Packet sizes must also be the same throughout the network. And
must be detectably immutable at each layer of link and onion-ish
path encapsulation, or be dropped. ~1500 mtu minus layers = data
capacity.

Related... redundancy to the destination could serve as chaff. Yet with
underlying privacy, unclear on the need for redundancy (as chaff), unless
the redundancy solves full path (or node) reliability issues. Otherwise
'control as chaff' seems more valuable.
