We describe a new simple but more power-
ful form of linear cryptanalysis. It appears to break AES
(and undoubtably other cryptosystems too, e.g. SKIP-
JACK). The break is "nonconstructive," i.e. we make it
plausible (e.g. prove it in certain approximate probabilis-
tic models) that a small algorithm for quickly determining
AES-256 keys from plaintext-ciphertext pairs exists b but
without constructing the algorithm. The attack's runtime
is comparable to performing 64w encryptions where w is
the (unknown) minimum Hamming weight in certain bi-
nary linear error-correcting codes (BLECCs) associated
with AES-256. If w < 43 then our attack is faster than ex-
haustive key search; probably w < 10. (Also there should
be ciphertext-only attacks if the plaintext is natural En-
glish.)
...
AES's current status. In view of both (a) Bernstein's tim-
ing attack, (b) our nonconstructive argument for a cracking
algorithm, (c) the possibility of a "'trapdoor," we believe that
   1. AES should be abandoned
   2. cryptosystems provably immune to these attacks should
      be investigated, and
   3. our argument for crack-existence, since it is nonrigor-
      ous5 , should be investigated more carefully.
...
3.6    Now get paranoid

Suppose AES-256's designers had evilly arranged matters so
that some "code of the code" (known to them) unexpectedly,
contained a remarkably low-weight word (known to them),
with say, w 10. That would constitute a trapdoor enabling
cracking it with much smaller eo,ort 64w . If w = 10, they
could crack AES with 6410 = 260 pc-pairs. If w = 7 then
AES-256 would be as easy to crack as the cited attacks on
DES (only 242 pc-pairs needed)!

This could be the case even if the random codes approxima-
tion underlying our crude analysis in B'3.3 was invalid.
...
4 What now?

Obviously, B'2's strengthened form of linear cryptanalysis will
attack a wide variety of secret key cryptosystems, not just
AES-256, and will quite often raise the worry that there might
exist some intentionally or unintentionally inserted "trap-
door." I currently see no feasible way for AES's designers
to disprove the existence of this kind of trapdoor. And Bern-
stein's cache-timing attack [4] seems applicable against es-
sentially any system that employs Sboxes. That's a lot of
territory.

In short, almost every secret key cryptosystem yet proposed is
now busted or at least suspect. We need to design new kinds
of cryptosystems immune to both kinds of attack.
