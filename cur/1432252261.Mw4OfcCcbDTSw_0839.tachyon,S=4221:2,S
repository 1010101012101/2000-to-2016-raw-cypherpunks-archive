Because of changes in US living patterns, the FBI has found neighbor
interviews to be mostly useless in determining trustworthiness for
purposes of security clearances. They're putting more weight on lie
detectors now. As of a year ago, anyway, they'd still try to talk to
neighbors, but the chance of finding one who knew enough to inform a
decision on whether to entrust someone with a clearance was much worse
than in decades gone by. The contaminated reports from "bluehairs and
busybodies" was a problem in the 80's, and is probably worse now.

That doesn't take into account the people who no longer will talk to the
Feebs under any circumstances. IIRC, in the late 80's, the Feebs
wouldn't tell the neighbors and coworkers why they were investigating
someone. I don't know if that was official policy, or just the policy of
the investigators who asked me about some of my coworkers. On
reflection, I agree with you: unless the investigator told me exactly
why he was investigating my neighbor, I'd refuse to give him the time of
day.

The questionable usefulness of lie detectors is a topic for another
diatribe.
