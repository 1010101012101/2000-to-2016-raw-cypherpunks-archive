Music. CDs are rarely restricted...DATs are probably uncommon, though.

A typical 700 MB CD carries 43 MB in the LSBs. The LSBs are at the 
microphone/cabe/preamp noise levels..probably even the 2nd least 
significant bits as well.

This is, of course, vastly more storage space than nearly any user 
might need. (Folks may recall that audio stego was one of my main 
examples for crypto anarchy a decade or so ago, where I cited the 
example of the B-2 bomber blueprints packed into the LSB of a Michael 
Jackson DAT.)

Audio editing programs are common, for mixing tracks, altering 
compressions, etc. Many of these are freeware or readily available, 
for Windows, etc.

It should be feasible to write the glue stuff to insert and extract 
bitstrreams into the LSBs.
