If you got that out of the quote you left in the email I am lost ;-p
But as a general rule, no. Keeping in mind of course that "value" is
subjective, because arbitrary regulations are in fact very valuable,
ask the Kennedys. The problem with prohibitions (which are never
arbitrary) is that they make for an uneven playing field in the
great game of "The free Market" thus hurting the whole, but often
there are those (few though they may be) who profit from
prohibitions. --Gabe

to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to
