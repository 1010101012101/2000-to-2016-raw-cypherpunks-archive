That's wishful thinking, Declan.  After, all, this is a capatilist
society.  What's in it for me? [1]

| What? You're talking nonsense here. Of course they make part of their
| living selling crops --- what's all the bs about "forging his own
| metals" etc. Total straw man arguement. The point was that they aren't
| "starving" for one thing, and, if it were up to them, they'd stay put.
| 
| Look, I'll try to explain it in terms that perhaps even a city boy like
| you can understand. You don't have to go to the 3rd world, just go talk
| to small american family farmers. There are thousands of them out there
| who simply don't care that they aren't making lots of money -- the
| important thing is that they can keep their farms and do their own
| thing. What's wrong with that?
| 
| You know what destroyed the small family farm in this country? Education
| -- ag schools and the county extension agent. Funded, for the most part,
| by large chemical companies. The old story of the country bumpkin
| getting conned by the city-slicker salesman. Kids went off to ag school,
| came home and told Dad to do things the "modern" way, factory farming
| with modern chemicals -- sure, go into debt, buy all those new tractors
| and fancy equipment and we'll be rich.
| 
| And then, of course, that little trick the Fed Reserve and the banks
| pulled back in the 70's with manipulating the economy so that rural land
| prices went thru the roof, farmers who had been mortgage free for
| generations got duped into borrowing money on their land to buy that
| fancy new equipment that the ag schools and extension agents told them
| they needed, then bingo -- the Fed played some more tricks, land values
| dropped back down, and a whole lot of farmers lost their land.
| 
| Is that what you call free-market economics? I call it fascism -- state
| and industry working in concert to whipsaw the masses and get more
| control over peoples lives. People who were very free and independant
| are suddenly wage slaves in the city because they listened to the
| "experts" from industry and government. And got duped.
| 
| I know one heck of a lot of people who much prefer living in rural
| "poverty" to living in a city making big bucks. Although my wife and I
| have been making a whole lot more money in recent years than we ever
| thought we would, and live in a big fancy house in the city, we consider
| it a serious mistake. Money isn't everything. We were one heck of a lot
| happier when we earned about $4000.00 a year.  We will soon rectify
| that. Why make a bunch money and feed the fascist machine?
| 
| One of my favorite cartoons was one of Snuffy Smith and his wife --- she
| says "Pa, the world is passing us by." Snuffy replies, "It sure better!"
| Damn straight!
| 
| "Tune in, turn on, and drop out."  Now that's real free market economics.
