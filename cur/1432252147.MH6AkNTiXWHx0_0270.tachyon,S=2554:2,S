People cause politics. And people are perfectly capable of cheerfully
disregarding that financial reality (more consensual hallucination, like).
If it's different in your model, then your model is inaccurate,
and needs adjusting.

As to physical models for people, we're not nearly there with
a statistical peopledynamics -- it's a nonlinear system to start with,
so there will never be a good descriptor.

Protests do work. So do lobbies. Motivating people and cultivating
contacts is hard -- and of course money helps here, too. All true,
all orthogonal to writing code.

I'm really surprised I had to diagram that for you.
