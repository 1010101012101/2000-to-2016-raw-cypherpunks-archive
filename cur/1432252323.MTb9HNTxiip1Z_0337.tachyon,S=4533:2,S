A far more productive application of corporate welfare would be if that 
money were spent on engineering research and development of 
geosynchronous solar power microwave relays, fusion and advanced fission 
reactors, permanent manned statons on the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc. 
The planet and its politics would likely be a lot cleaner. Just one 
beneficial side effect.

If govts. didn't insist on scarfing up so much in taxes and thwarting 
markets at the behest of vested interests, private parties probably 
would already be doing most of this by now.

But what else is new?
