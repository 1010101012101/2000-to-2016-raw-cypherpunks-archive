I dunno...a lot of it made sense to me.

You don't have to be a Commie in order to believe that someone ELSE believes 
there's a "class war", and that they gotta keep us black folks po', or else 
we'll soon be having sex with their wives and daughters and competing with 
their sons for decent jobs. And as long as that somebody else believes 
there's a class war, they're probably going to vote like there's one, and 
try to dupe as many others as they can into voting like there's one, and 
that they're in the in-crowd.

And then of course they'll open a military base everynow and then to 
demonstrate their largesse.
