One of the major components of the va|ue attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a |arge grOup of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,OOO different known 
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the wa||s of the b|ood vessels inc|uding capi||aries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2O04-2OO5 are more then  $10O milliOn USD

Further deve|opments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
