Which speaks right into the socialist cause - we thus need an instance to
take care of the many genetically defective asses out there, without concern
for money.

OK. So how about preventative care? It might well be that by insuring
everyone and keeping them in health, the total risk per dollars paid for
coverage actually goes down. Especially if infectious diseases can be kept
in check. Plus, the sum total of money paid by the insurees goes up as they
stay healthier for longer, thus giving more money for the insurance company
to invest into more profitable ventures. This is what governments do now.
