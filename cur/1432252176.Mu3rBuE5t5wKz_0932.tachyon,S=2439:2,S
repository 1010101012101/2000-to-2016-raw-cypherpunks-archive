At this stage I think a small question is in order. Is there any Big Red
Button software out there to complement this level of paranoia?

What I mean is, after you've got everything in your system under
industrial strength crypto, you have exactly one weak spot, that being a
whole lot of people charging through your door when your system is already
running hot and accessible. At that point the only thing that can save you
is a one-touch mechanism to effect a swift (i.e. at most two or three
seconds), dirty, no-matter-what shutdown, with guaranteed loss of key
material.

Is there open source software out there to effect that sort of thing?
