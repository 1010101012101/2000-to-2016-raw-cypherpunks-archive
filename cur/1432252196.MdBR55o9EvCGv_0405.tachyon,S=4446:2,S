Yes, they referred to it a as a "link", and it works.
Haven't you seen this crap before?  Many spammers use it
for just the reason you suggest, dodging complaints,
because it's too annoying to look up "3638141293" in whois
or write to "abuse" there, unlike looking up stupid.user.bigisp.net.
Netscape accepts it just fine; I assume Internet Exploiter does too,
even though I've never seen it used except by spammers.

Joe Baptista points out that Unix traceroute accepts it:
> # traceroute 3638141293
> traceroute to 3638141293 (216.217.161.109), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
which I found new and interesting news.
So I checked and Win98's MS-DOS ping and tracert both also support it,
and with tracert, you get name lookup as well.

I disagree with Joe's comment that 
"The decimal format is part of the way the internet works."
It's not.  It's part of the way the dns name resolver libraries
used by several popular operating systems or application packages work.
The Internet works on DNS name resolution and on IP addresses that are
32-bit binary numbers, and while the standards say you're *supposed* to
display those as dotted-quad decimal for human readability,
they probably don't exactly *require* you not to also accept other formats,
though hex would be much less rude than decimal :-)

I found the following chunk of traceroute interesting:
> 7  wbb1-pos2-0.pop1.ut.home.net (24.7.75.142)  72.083 ms  69.725 ms 59.08 ms
> 8  10.253.92.34 (10.253.92.34)  63.26 ms  65.591 ms  86.966 ms
> 9  216.217.161.109 (216.217.161.109)  62.396 ms  58.283 ms  60.437 ms

Looks like either the spammer's got a machine that's using multiple addresses,
one of them a non-routable 10.x address, which makes checking on it hard,
or else it's a NAT box, or else @Home's playing cute tricks to reduce
crackers, using a 10.x network internally so they and their customers
can access their head end routers but people from the real world can't.
