     Anonymous vs. HBGary



One of the effects of writing a book is that I don't have the time to  
devote to other writing.  So while I've been wanting to write about  
Anonymous vs. HBGary, I don't think I will have time.  Here's an excellent 
series of posts on the topic from ArsTechnica.

In cyberspace, the balance of power is on the side of the attacker.  
Attacking a network is *much* easier than defending a network.  That may  
change eventually -- there might someday be the cyberspace equivalent of  
trench warfare, where the defender has the natural advantage -- but not  
anytime soon.

the tactics or the politics, but what HBGary demonstrates about the IT  
security industry.

I don't think I understand the threat model.  If your wallet is stolen,  
you're going to replace all your ID cards and credit cards and you're not 
going to get your cash back -- whether it's a normal wallet or this  
wallet.  I suppose this wallet makes it less likely that someone will use 
your stolen credit cards quickly, before you cancel them.  But you're not 
going to be liable for costs incurred during that delay in any case.

Interesting research in using animals to detect substances.  Basically,  
sniffer dogs respond to unconscious cues from their handlers, and generate 
false alarms because of them.  It makes sense, as dogs are so attuned to 
humans.  I'll bet bomb-sniffing bees don't make the same mistakes.

     NIST Defines New Versions of SHA-512



NIST has just defined two new versions of SHA-512.  They're SHA-512/224  
and SHA-512/256: 224- and 256-bit truncations of SHA-512 with a new IV.  
They've done this because SHA-512 is faster than SHA-256 on 64-bit CPUs, so 
these new SHA variants will be faster.

This is a good thing, and exactly what we did in the design of Skein. We 
defined different outputs for the same state size, because it makes sense 
to decouple the internal workings of the hash function from the output 
size.
