Trio climbs parliament flagpole
20aug02
THREE Greenpeace protesters have climbed the Parliament House flagpole to 
protest against government policy on climate change.			
The protesters had reached the halfway point of the flagpole using 
industrial and rock-climbing climbing equipment, with four support crew at 
the base of the pole, by 11am (AEST).
"It's quite a slow process because as you can imagine they are having to be 
very careful and it's quite a difficult climb," Greenpeace spokesman Shane 
Rattenbury said.
"So at this stage it might take them a bit longer to actually climb the 
flagpole."
Security staff were nearby, talking to the support crew, but were unable to 
stop them, with the climbers in an inaccessible position.
The protesters planned to unfurl a banner voicing concern about government 
climate change policy.
"The reason Greenpeace is doing this today is to protest against the Howard 
government's failure on climate change," Mr Rattenbury said.
"The rejection by the Howard Government of the Kyoto Protocol is a backward 
step for Australia; it's ignoring Australia's responsibilities to act on 
climate change.
"Opinion polling has shown that 80 per cent of Australians support 
ratification of Kyoto."
The protest comes just days ahead of the United Nations-sponsored World 
Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa, where the Government 
will face world pressure to ratify the protocol to combat climate change.
