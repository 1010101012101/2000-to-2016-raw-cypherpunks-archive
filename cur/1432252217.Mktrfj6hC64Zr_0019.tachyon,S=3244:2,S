Oh! There is a little misunderstanding here!

I proposed using Jabber for the presence/location/directory thing, and for
negotiation between the clients about what method to use, if they can do
direct peer-to-peer call or have to use a reflector (and what one), what
cipher and key to use, etc. - the Jabber protocol is rather unsuitable for
VoIP.

That's true - but it can be implemented with relative ease, with lots of
infrastructure already existing. Next generation of the system then can
be built atop this.

But it's closed-source and so can't be fully trusted :(
