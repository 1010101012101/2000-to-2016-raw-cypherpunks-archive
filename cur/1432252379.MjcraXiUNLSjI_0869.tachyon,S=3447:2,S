This entire view misses the(!) one most important component of Unix's (and
Linux's) success, they were first.

There was NO credible competition. The same thing can be said for Apache
and BIND and many other apps. It isn't that they were the best, they were
simply the first - and get to reap market inertia as a result.

However, and it's a doozy, this won't last. As the Open Source market
expands and takes over pretty much completely you'll see this dominance
begin to decrease.

Why? 

Because of the component nature of the software.
