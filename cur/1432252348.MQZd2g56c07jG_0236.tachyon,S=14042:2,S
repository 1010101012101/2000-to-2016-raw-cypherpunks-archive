<h2>Annotations

<p>
<strong>Purpose of the Amendment
</strong> =

<p> The Senate Committee on the Judiciary in its report suggested several=
 reasons for the proposed Twentieth Amendment. It said in part:
<p> ''[W]hen our Constitution was adopted there was some reason for such =
a long intervention of time between the election and the actual commencem=
ent of work by the new Congress. . . . Under present conditions [of commu=
nication and transportation] the result of elections is known all over th=
e country within a few hours after the polls close, and the Capital City =
is within a few days' travel of the remotest portions of the country. . .=
 .
<p> ''Another effect of the amendment would be to abolish the so- called =
short session of Congress. . . . Every other year, under our Constitution=
, the terms of Members of the House and one-third of the Members of the S=
enate expire on the 4th day of March. . . . Experience has shown that thi=
s brings about a very undesirable legislative condition. It is a physical=
 impossibility during such a short session for Congress to give attention=
 to much general legislation for the reason that it requires practically =
all of the time to dispose of the regular appropriation bills. . . . The =
result is a congested condition that brings about either no legislation o=
r illy considered legislation. . . .
<p> ''If it should happen that in the general election in November in pre=
sidential years no candidate for President had received a majority of all=
 the electoral votes, the election of a President would then be thrown in=
to the House of Representatives and the memberships of the House of Repre=
sentatives called upon to elect a President would be the old Congress and=
 not the new one just elected   by the people. It might easily happen tha=
t the Members of the House of Representative, upon whom devolved the sole=
mn duty of electing a Chief Magistrate for 4 years, had themselves been r=
epudiated at the election that had just occurred, and the country would b=
e confronted with the fact that a repudiated House, defeated by the peopl=
e themselves at the general election, would still have the power to elect=
 a President who would be in control of the country for the next 4 years.=
 It is quite apparent that such a power ought not to exist, and that the =
people having expressed themselves at the ballot box should through the R=
epresentatives then selected, be able to select the President for the ens=
uing term. . . .
<p> ''The question is sometimes asked, Why is an amendment to the Constit=
ution necessary to bring about this desirable change? The Constitution [b=
efore this amendment] does not provide the date when the terms of Senator=
s and Representatives shall begin. It does fix the term of Senators at 6 =
years and of Members of the House of Representatives at 2 years. The comm=
encement of the terms of the first President and Vice President and of Se=
nators and Representatives composing the First Congress was fixed by an a=
ct of [the Continental] Congress adopted September 13, 1788, and that act=
 provided 'that the first Wednesday in March next to be the time for comm=
encing proceedings under the Constitution.' It happened that the first We=
dnesday in March was the 4th day of March, and hence the terms of the Pre=
sident and Vice President and Members of Congress began on the 4th day of=
 March. Since the Constitution provides that the term of Senators shall b=
e 6 years and the term of Members of the House of Representatives 2 years=
, it follows that this change cannot be made without changing the terms o=
f office of Senators and Representatives, which would in effect be a chan=
ge of the Constitution. By another act (the act of March 1, 1792) Congres=
s provided that the terms of President and Vice President should commence=
 on the 4th day of March after their election. It seems clear, therefore,=
 that an amendment to the Constitution is necessary to give relief from e=
xisting conditions.''
<a name=3Dt1 href=3D#f1>1
</a>&nbsp;
<p>
<p> As thus stated, the exact term of the President and Vice President wa=
s fixed by the Constitution, Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 1, at 4 years, and beca=
me actually effective, by resolution of the Continental Congress, on the =
4th of March 1789. Since this amendment was declared adopted on February =
6, 1933, Sec. 1 in effect shortened, by the interval between January 20 a=
nd March 4, 1937, the terms of the President and Vice President elected i=
n 1932.   =

<p> Similarly, it shortened, by the intervals between January 3 and March=
 4, the terms of Senators elected for terms ending March 4, 1935, 1937, a=
nd 1939; and thus temporarily modified the Seventeenth Amendment, fixing =
the terms of Senators at 6 years. It also shortened the terms of Represen=
tatives elected to the Seventy-third Congress, by the interval between Ja=
nuary 3 and March 4, 1935, and temporarily modified Article I, Sec. 2, cl=
ause 1, fixing the terms of Representatives at 2 years.
<p> Section 1 further modifies the Twelfth Amendment in its reference to =
March 4 as the date by which the House must exercise its choice of a Pres=
ident.
<p> Section 2 supersedes clause 2 of Sec. 4 of Article I. The setting of =
an exact hour for meeting constitutes a recognition of the long practice =
of Congress, which in 1867 was for the first time enacted into permanent =
law,
<a name=3Dt2 href=3D#f2>2
</a> only to be repealed in 1871.
<a name=3Dt3 href=3D#f3>3
</a>&nbsp;
<p>
<p> When the 3d of January fell on Sunday (in 1937), Congress did by law =
appoint a different day for its assemblage.
<a name=3Dt4 href=3D#f4>4
</a>&nbsp;
<p>
<p> Pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Sec. 3 of this amendme=
nt, Congress shaped the Presidential Succession Act of 1948 =

<a name=3Dt5 href=3D#f5>5
</a> to meet the situation which would arise from the failure of both Pre=
sident elect and Vice President elect to qualify on or before the time fi=
xed for the beginning of the new Presidential term.
