A fair number of cpunks subscribers hid their true names
from the gitgo. The gitgo varied among subscribers, with most
of the earliest using what seemed to be true names but who
knows for sure who is.

As the list infame grew there were more of those hiding identity.
And deploying deeper levels of hide from lessons learned from
the list and other sources about how hidden identities are tracked
and faked and misrepresented and packaged alluringly as foolproof
protection.

Then there were strategies and strategems to become more
wily and more deceptive, one being the advocacy of open
sources in order to gull the gullible into revealing themselves
and their hides.

No doubt the wily knew this ploy and pretended to be open
while asymmetrically siphoning far more then offered, the
model used by official and business spies and intimate
lovers.

The rigged jury is still out on whether public key crypto was
a grand deception, if not wittingly by the inventors, then by
those who would benefit from widespread faith in its
trustworthiness. Mindful that the most successful mindfucks
work best against the smartest people who cannot conceive
of being oufoxed by those they consider to be the dumbest.

I always liked PZ's "pretty good" candor for its understated
corniness. Nothing absolutely reliable over the top bullshit
like those who have tried to market it as The Best Ever.
Symantec will probably sell it back to him to cleanse its
besmeared trust.

What will become of all those archived PGP PKs capable of
tracking and cracking SKs? What, you had not heard of that?
