I had a very interesting conversation today with a pair of cops who work
under the PA - a real mindblower.

While the ALA, ACLU, and everyone else I can think of is screaming for the PA
to be withdrawn, preferably *now*, I found it interesting that the cops had
pretty much the same opinion, although for different reasons.

LEAs, according to these guys, were able to get a *lot* more information,
with a lot less hassle, *prior* to the PA.  The reasoning went something like
this: Before the PA, they could grab a routine subpoena, "practically
preprinted, from damn near any prosecutor [they] could find", serve it on a
library/bank/<fill in your favorite target here>, and get anything they
wanted.  Now, they have to get an "investigative subpoena" (I believe I
remember this term correctly, but if not, anyone with more accurate info
please correct me), and have this subpoena signed off on by both a federal
persecutor *and* a federal judge in the correct district, and then serve on
the appropriate party: and this new "investigative subpoena" can request far
less data than the old ones, as they have to be strictly PA-compliant.

Needless to say, the thought that LEOs find the the PA to be "way to
restrictive compared to before" struck me as one of the most bizzarre things
I'd ever heard.  But they were quite adamant that given a choice, they would
gladly go back to the "old way".

The only thing that could possibly, IMHO, make this more understandable, was
that the two LEAs I was speaking to were not themselves fedz.  

I find it exquisitely amusing that I and my neighbor LEOs share the common
goal of seeing the PA rot in hell :-)
