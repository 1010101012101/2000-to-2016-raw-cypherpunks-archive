You make a good argument for dropping the non_U.S. only restriction. 
The risk may be worth the benefits of kernel integration.  That could 
result in wider corporate use of IPSec to fight real security threats 
and make it much more difficult, politically, to suppress.

My point was just that one cannot rely on the U.S. courts striking 
down any future crypto regulations. They should and I hope they 
would, but it not a sure thing. The most recent ruling is not 
favorable. I also wouldn't underestimate the U.S. government's 
ability to stifle crypto development if they choose to do so and get 
a green light from the courts.  Note today's Warez crackdown.

Maybe there is some compromise possible where a core crypto library 
is kept free of U.S. contributions?
