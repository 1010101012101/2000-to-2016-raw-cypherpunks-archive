Generally in security analysis you want to list threat models and how
you resist (or not) them.
>From this you can derive a spec.  Often threats *not* considered provide
easy attacks
simply because the design didn't consider them.   You will always find
some attacks
that will work, but are expensive for the adversary.  Checked your
keyboard
for keystroke loggers recently, Mr. Scarfo?  Swept your room for video
bugs?  Got a guy
with a gun and a dog watching what gets pressed against the fingerprint
scanner?
And how much does he get paid?  (CIA CI chief Aldritch was under $2e6,
FBI CI
mole Hanssen was cheaper, but his wife wasn't included in the deal,
though his
stripper got some.)

This leads to the conclusion that security is economics + physics.  The
goal is
to make attacks more expensive to your adversary, at "reasonable" cost
to you.

Subpeonas are cheap to some.
