"How to get targeted visitors for 1.2 cents per visitor"
by Dan Millman

Would you like to drive targeted quality traffic to your site for between .2 cents and 1.49 cents per visitor? You can. On the internet, quality targeted traffic is the lifeblood of any online business. One of the reasons so many don't succeed is that 10% of the websites get 90% of the traffic. With this method, your site can become one of those 10% and as a result, your business will grow.
How can you do it? How can you get targeted visitors for under 2 cents per visitor? By optimizing and submitting your site to the top 20 search engines using proprietary optimization methods. The strategies and techniques I will talk about can get you top 10 rankings on virtually all the free search engines for your targeted keywords. 

Q. What is the cost per visitor with this method?
The cost per visitor with this method generally varies between .2 cents per visitor and 1.49 cents per visitor. This is less than the paid search engines (which have a minimum cost of 5 cents per visitor), banners (minimum cost 30 to 35 cents per visitor) and other methods such as lists (50 cents to $2.00 or more per visitor). The free search engines are simply the best, most effective and affordable way to advertise online. For this reason, more web-based entrepreneurs have made money from the search engines than from all other methods combined. 
Lets take a look at the numbers. There is no "typical" website with average traffic. However, most websites with good rankings on the search engines will get anywhere from 50 to 1000 or more visitors a day depending on the number of keyword targeted, the keyword's popularity, and how attractive the website's title is. Lets say you're on the low end of that spectrum only getting 100 visitors a day. My company charges $395 for 1 year's worth of search engine submission. It is reasonable to assume that it will take 2-3 months to get your listings ranked well on all the engines(the engines take time to reindex their rankings-you will start to get traffic within 3 to 5 days, some will begin delivering traffic after two to three weeks and others will take 2-3 months). 
You'll be up to speed before that but to take the most negative possible assumption, if it takes 3 months to get fully up to speed and the total service lasts for 12 months, that leaves 9 months of ranking well on the engines. We've said you get about 100 targeted visitors a day, so 9 months of ranking well means you get: 
9 months * 30 days per month * 100 visitors per day = 27,000 targeted visitors per year 
$395 (total cost) divided by 27,000 (total # of visitors) = 1.46 cents cost per visitor 
That means you are paying 1.46 cents for each targeted visitor for that year. No other method of marketing has costs that low. The second lowest cost per targeted visitor will be found in the pay-per-click search engines which charge a minimum of 5 cents per targeted visitor. Other methods of advertising such as banner advertising, lists, etc. will cost several times that-- anywhere from 30 cents to $2.00 or more per targeted visitor (see my discussion of these methods elsewhere on this site). 
Therefore, the free search engines are the cheapest, most cost effective way to advertise. More web-based entrepreneurs make money from the search engines than from all other advertising methods combined. 

Q. How hard or easy is it to be profitable with the search engines at .2 cents to 1.49 cents per targeted visitor?
Lets assume you sell a product with a profit margin of $50 per new customer (most entrepreneurs products have higher profit margins-more on that below). At $50 profit per sale and 1.43 cents per targeted visitor your breakeven conversion rate will be: 
$50 (profit) divided by $0.0143 (cost per targeted visitor) = 3417 breakeven conversion rate 
That means that you need to make a sale to 1 in 3417 targeted visitors to break even(or a 0.029% conversion rate). If you can sell one visitor in 3416 targeted visitors or more, you will make a profit. It is safe to say that if your site is at all capable of selling products, you will get a conversion rate better than this. A typical sales conversion rate for a good web site is anywhere from 1 in 75 to 1 in 500 depending on what it sells, the sales process, the content, the sales letter, the price, the site, and other factors. 
Also, your profitability in this equation is the total profitability of getting a new customer. For example, if you sell a vitamin and make $50 profit on the first sale, but 80% of your customers come back to reorder, your total profitability is $250 per new customer (an 80% reorder rate means the average customer buys 5 times so 5 * $50 = $250). Similarly, if you sell a newsletter subscription for a $69 profit and the average person subscribes for 2 years, your average profitability is $69 * 2 or $138 per customer. 

Q. How many targeted visitors can I expect with this method?
That will vary depending on your site's title, description, keywords you go after, etc. Our clients typically get anywhere from 50 to 1000 visitors a day based on their site's title, description, the keywords targeted and other factors. 

Q. How long will it take?
You can be submitted within 48 hours. The speed with which the engines will index your site varies. Most engines take between 2 weeks and 2 months. 

Q. Why do you submit sites to over 3500 search engines if most of the traffic goes through the top 30?
Two reasons. First, the 3500 smaller engines account for about 20% of search engine traffic and that traffic is easy to get. Two, the top 30 engines rely on what's called 'link popularity'. That is, the number of other websites linking to yours. The more links there are to a page, the higher it will rank. By submitting the site to 3500 small engines, the site's link popularity will shoot up. Over 3500 small engines will link to your site, and this will help boost your rankings on the top engines. 

Q. Are all search engine submission services the same?
No. The only companies which offer services comparable to ours charge between $800 to $3000 or more. They will usually optimize your site for 30 to 50 keywords. We will optimize your site for an unlimited number of keywords. The cheaper submission services you find on the net for between $29 and $99 will mass submit your site with off-the-shelf submission software. They will not optimize your site or use any kind of proprietary strategies. These services will typically get your site ranked around below the top 50 rankings-for example, between 4000 to 5000 for your keywords. If your site ranks say 4611 for a given keyword, you will get little or no traffic. 
We encourage you to check and even try our competitors. If you try one of the cheap services, chances are very good you won't be satisfied. If you try one of the competitors who charge $3000 or more, you will have wasted over $2500.

Q. Is there a money-back guarantee?
Yes. We offer a 12 month no questions asked satisfaction guarantee. Only one of our competitors offers a guarantee like ours(he charges $45,000 a year-- see price comparison chart below). Some of our competitors offer guaranteed rankings but only one other one offers a no-questions-asked full money back satisfaction-based guarantee. We can do this because to date, less than .1% of our clients in the past 7 years have ever asked for a refund. 12 months is a good amount of time to see the kind of traffic you'll get. If our past experiences with our clients are any indicator, you'll be so happy with the traffic you get and your sales that you'll want to continue the service. 

Q. Is there a limit on the number of keywords I can go after?
No. Most of the search engines will only look at the first 25 keywords in your metatags on each of your pages. We will submit every page on your site so this gives you the opportunity to go after an unlimited number of keywords. 

Q. How does your service work?
We will submit and resubmit your entire site every 48 hours. This does three things. One, if you make any changes or target any new keywords, we will go after those within 48 hours and the changes will be updated in the search engines as fast as possible. Two, if the search engines ranking algorithms change, we will alter the optimization and submission strategy for your site accordingly to tailor it to the engines. Three, there is always a downward pull on most sites because other companies are trying to take your position at the top of the engines. By reoptimizing and resubmitting your site over and over again every 48 hours, we make sure your site does not move down in rankings. 

Q. Can you guarantee me a specific ranking like #2 on Google for the keyword "horseshoes"?
No, no one in the industry can guarantee you a specific ranking on the free (non-pay-per-click) search engines. Anyone who says they can isn't being completely honest-- legitimate search engine services don't guarantee a specific ranking. There are just too many factors involved in ranking such as the number of competitors you have, your link popularity, your keywords, your metatags, your content, and various others to be able to predict with certainty a specific ranking. Furthermore, the same site will sometimes fluctuate in the rankings-ie. Going from #2 to #5, etc. Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to guarantee you a specific ranking. We do the next best thing which is to completely guarantee your satisfaction with our service or your money back. A satisfaction based no question asked 100% money-back guarantee is the best anyone can do at this time.

Q. Which search engines will I be submitted to?
You will be submitted to all of the top free search engines. These include Yahoo, Google, MSN, AOL, Lycos and others. These engines get lots of searches. Therefore, if your page ranks well, you will be able to get lots of quality targeted traffic for people who do searches on your keywords. In addition, you will also be submitted to about 3500 smaller search engines. These search engines will deliver some traffic to your site because they are much easier to rank high on. 

Q. What are the drawbacks of your service?
There are two. One is that it takes time to get ranked on the engines. Different engines take different lengths of time to re-index their rankings. You will start to see some traffic in the first 4 to 5 days, but most of the engines won't index you until 2 weeks to 2 months after you've been submitted. The other drawback is price. Even though we charge between 13% and 50% of what our competitors charge, our service is still not inexpensive. 

Q. How good are you guys at getting top rankings?
We are among the best in the industry. We know countless tricks about the search engines. For example, that most search engines will only look at the first 25 keywords in your metatags, that the search engines prefer domain names of three words or less, that the search engine spiders will often only look at the beginning of the web page, and on and on and on. There are 62 factors in our optimization and submission process. All of these factors are used to optimize your page to a degree that few of our competitors especially the low price ones are capable of replicating

Q. What if my site can't sell?
Many people are unsure if their site can sell before they get a good amount of quality targeted traffic. Our 12 month, no-questions-asked money back guarantee allows you to see if your site can sell without taking any risk. This is a great way to test to see if your site can sell with no risk. 

Q. How do you guys compare in price to your competitors?
Here is a comparison chart: 
Company name-------------------------------Price--------------------------------# of Keywords 

Search Engine Experts---------------------$395/year-------------------------------Unlimited 
Ezrankings.com-------------------------------$750 setup plus $125/month----10 
Positioned1.com------------------------------$1000-$1500 plus $100/month--30 
CustomerMagnetism.com-----------------$2995/year-----------------------------15
$5995/year-----------------------------45
$9995/year-----------------------------100
TopTenRanking.com------------------------$7,198 setup plus $1,199/month--100 
Reinventbusiness.com---------------------$45,000/year---------------------------Unlimited 
SEOInk.com-----------------------------------$3,500/6 months----------------------25 
Iprospect.com---------------------------------$12,500/month to $40,000/month--Depends on package 

Q. How can you afford to offer such a bargain compared to your competitors?
We can afford to offer a bargain compared to our competitors for several reasons: 
1. Some of our competitors spend upwards of $5 per click on the pay-per-click search engines like Overture to attract business. As of this writing, the top bid for the keyword "Search Engine Optimization" on Overture is $8.56. If we did that, we would have to raise our prices as well. But we rely on our own search engine expertise to drive almost all of our business although we do use other methods as well.
2. Some competitors have large sales staffs that will spend hours on the phone with you trying to convince you to part with over $1000. The way they operate is by making you fill out a form on their website to get a pricing quote. This form asks for your phone number and other personal information. Their price is usually so high that they will not publish it on their website. A few days after you give your phone number, you receive a call and you are then quoted the astronomical price. That's not the way we do business-- we have no sales staff and you will not be getting any sales calls from us.
3. Good old-fashioned greed. We can make a good profit at this price and just because others charge over $800 doesn't mean we need to.
Imagine getting tons of quality traffic and a dozen or more sales a week. Our service will more than pay for itself ten times over. If it doesn't happen, you can cancel, even if you've used our service for 11 months and 2 weeks and there are only 2 weeks of the service left. We will refund all of your money back no questions asked.
