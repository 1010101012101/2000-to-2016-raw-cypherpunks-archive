This isn't clear.  The proposals I've seen call for recording "transaction 
data" -- i.e., the SMTP "envelope" information, plus maybe the From: 
line.  It does not call for retention of content.

Apart from practicality, there are constitutional issues.  Envelope 
data is "given" to the ISP in typical client/server email scenarios, 
while content is end-to-end, in that it's not processed by the ISP.  A 
different type of warrant is therefore needed to retrieve the latter.  
The former falls under the "pen register" law (as amended by the 
Patriot Act), and requires a really cheap warrant.  Email content is 
considered a full-fledged wiretap, and requires a hard-to-get court 
order, with lots of notice requirements, etc.  Mandating that a third 
party record email in this situation, in the absence of a pre-existing
warrant citing probable cause, would be very chancy.  I don't think 
even the current Supreme Court would buy it.
