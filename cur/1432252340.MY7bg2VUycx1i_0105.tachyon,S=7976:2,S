Subject: Re: crypto flaw in secure mail standards

This is not a crypto flaw.  This is an engineering flaw.

First, the timestamp of the message is certainly encoded in the
signature.  This is protection against your first suggested attack.
The recipient, upon verifying the signature, notices that it was made,
e.g., two months previously.  Then one would have to wonder why a
two-month-old message was being sent.

The other obvious problem is that although the sender's identity is
encoded in the message's signature (as well as the time the signature
is purported to be made), the original intended recipient's are not
encoded within the signed portion of the message.  The simple fix
would be to include the appropriate mail headers withing the signed
portion of the message.  In particular, including the 'To' and 'Cc'
fields would immediately protect against both of these attacks.

The problem is not at all with the crypto.  The problem is with the
integration of the crypto with applications like e-mail.

Have a nice day,
