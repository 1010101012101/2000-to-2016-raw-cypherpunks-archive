I have a website (www.algebra.com) that makes money from banners. I have
a suspicion that a small percentage of my users uses Junkbusters proxy
in order to avoid seeing my banners.

I do not want to serve such users at all and I do not want them to use
my bandwidth.

Is there any way to detect a user of Junkbusters in a CGI/mod_perl script?

Thanks

	- Igor.
