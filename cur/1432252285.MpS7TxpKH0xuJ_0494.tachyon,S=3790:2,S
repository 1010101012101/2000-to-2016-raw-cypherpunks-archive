True so far   Well, al-qaeda.net is a DNS record, and the list includes
social issues related to crypto-related tech, but lets start off by
giving you the point.

Sorry, but the prefix "Real" is the intellectual property of an IRA (tm)
spinoff in this
context.  Our lawyers will be contacting you.

The name al-qaeda is, I suspect, more or less

Getting pretty heavy there Tyler

Ever consider that it might be a *reminder* that if isn't good enough
for
Osama, its not good enough for you?


However, there does not

Everyone, search your wallet for official Al Q membership cards.
(I suppose female members may have trouble telling if its themselves
under the scarves on the ID.. except for the Florida branch of Al Q)

Really?

What binds us together (if

to

or

*Way* too specific dude.  Also interested in opsec generally.  (All your

crypto is belong to us if I can get to your machine..)  Communications
can be
smoke signals.  (Would that be optical comms?)  Or the positions of
cards
in a deck.   Or the positions of hands in a shipment of watches.

Another thing that seems to bind us (and again
>"bind" is probably a poor choice of words) is an extreme tolerance to

What the fuck are you ingesting tonight?  "extreme tolerance to
opinions"??  Its only because it would be self-parodying that
accusations of nazihood don't fly.  Even with Tim gone, praise be unto
him.

On the other hand, in our better moods we try to educate each other.

Not here.

>Otherwise, please fuck off.

If you've been getting this kind of cameldung *personally*, this is yet
another reward
of using a 1-way pseudonym.
