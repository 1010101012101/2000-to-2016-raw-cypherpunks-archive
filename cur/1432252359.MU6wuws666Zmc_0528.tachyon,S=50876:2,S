so maybe nothing is this simple, the previous statements and hypothesis
themselves by default ungrounded, unrelated to the complexity involved in
the existing context for social relations.

what if the control of 'sexual code' and its programming via advertisement
and industries is what formats consciousness and social relations and thus
establishes the false 'common value' which is based on pseudo-truth and in
that inaccuracy, the exploits can occur which turn a situation against
itself by these very dynamics, if not via signs that represent them.

for instance, if every female model walking down a global catwalk starts
resembling Mick Jagger, you gotta wonder if the fake god is a narcissist
who cannot get enough of their own image, even in an opposite sex form. and
what that does to male-female dynamic relations likewise, whose ideal mate
is really this, or is it precisely the vulgarity it involves the corruption
itself, the information warfare and psychological ops against humanity.

for instance, how do you know the object of desire is not a man dressed up
or sex-changed into a woman, and what if paired keys does not address this
or there is deception going on, where female appearance is camouflage to
exploit those with natural desires, turning this connection of potential
love into one subverted by hate, using love against a person as their
weakness. and what if this covert, hostile agenda is normalized instead.
and thus even a woman-hating male psyche could be representing if not also
standing in for women, via simulation or substitution, for social relation.

how do you know the difference between the patterns, how to verify and
validate and secure a connection in truth, versus relying on pseudo-truth
and ultimately what could be lies, then allowing the exploit the access it
needs to corrupt and takeover systems. perhaps most especially in terms of
blackmail or setting up a person for a takedown via these methods.

it is proposed that the deceptions in those domain rely upon lies and
structures of falsehood, and 'iconic' expectations such that, like modular
code and programming, can provide predictable behaviors to exploit as if
based on rulesets that can program step by step the interaction according
to a preordained pattern. and that as long as truth is secondary to this,
whether via money or shared ideology or bias, that in that zone these other
activities could be masked or hidden as an agenda, opaque, in waiting.

whereas in grounded truth and intimate connection, truth is the transparent
shared condition of being, honest and error-correcting and forms the basis
for trust between people, not some other framework. perhaps the only way to
know would be a genuine connection in love, removed of illusion, and from
here to proceed- anything else could be an illusion, about images, and in
this way mirages in the desert of unshared reality, tricksters all around.

love as grounding for intimate social relations and beyond, as it relates
with fundamental and foundation truth, as it establishes solid relations
between people and within society via shared empirical agenda. one, many.

versus its subversion, mimicking of love, exploiting it, to serve some
other end or hidden agenda, and thus false confirmations and shared lies
that enable alternate worlds of deception which can occupy houses, entire
neighborhoods and cities and states via networks, and beyond, to which a
person may find themselves someday lost, every direction misinformation,
every sign post a false indication, leading further and further into doom.

thus the assumption of physical connection and the terror of its subversion
may create a gap between the shared mind and awareness, and the physical
relation with another, even though cryptic communication could occur. and
thus asynchronous relations could exist in their place, as if each person
is on the other side of a boundary that cannot be surpassed without losing
the connection, because it cannot be sustained in the given environment.
and yet entanglement could be present in this sharing of truth, especially
in that erotic charge where worlds align, and in this, the same issue of
keys and secure connection though in a realm of shared memory instead, as
the intimate relation, and thus grounding could occur by validating this
and securing it as a shared truth, in the realm of atmosphere it occupies.

archetypes, jungian psychology, transference of S -> S' and S' -> S'. a
woman walks around with her luscious shoes and wet gleaming nail polish
until another turns a corner and becomes transfixed at the beauty, the
circuit completed, switches turned on in the shared erotic connection and
the alter finds its devote worshipper who receives this extreme pleasure.

the economics of lust and love, these forms of hidden exchange, full of
meaning and insight into the prime motivation that moves the world in its
health and through its dysfunction, sickness. a terror to not have these
dynamics liberated while the ugliness and grotesque can do anything while
those so devoted are trapped and confined by rules and regulations as if
natural instinct and affections area illegal, while regressions, sadism and
misogyny are normalized. impossible for healthy balanced sexual dynamics
when they are not allowed for humans, including the full range connections.
instead all of this is middle-managed, bureaucratized and exploited by an
instilled set of beliefs, at least on the outside, in the world of images.

it is as if there are components of a circuitboard that are made to work
with one another, that have collaborative and beneficial dynamics yet are
not allowed in proximity to one another based on the components that are by
comparison rigged, cheating and taking over the space and rewiring it only
for their kinds, leaving areas of isolation and malfunctioning due to the
inability to access the other, beyond the structural frameworks that seek
to subvert and exploit the connection due to a corruption of its truth.
what is unshared or partly true must be adapted to in order to survive. and
then only to find later on what is missing, where it is located, and the
distance between that may only be temporarily bridged in passing, via a
quick glimpse of recognition of what has been lost in the everyday. and
this can be the truth of love itself, intimacy, grounded connections.

as with a simulation that seeks to replicate another situation, the fakery
can be revealed in its errors, where resolution or detail is lacking and
thus whether via inadequate computation or malmodeling, the framework based
on and supporting this falsity may begin to warp and skew, potentially to
cause accidents and crashes as its compass does not align with the larger
circumstance of shared awareness that it seeks to control and to replace.
so too with fake men and women, shallow and without depth of imagination,
of limited and rigid reasoning, and while 'saying all the right things' it
is these 'ideas' that have already and must always have been said before,
as if referencing a memory database for fake-insight, correct perspective.
again the binary viewpoint is ideal for such a simulative social substitute
whereas a paradoxical situation would throw loop after loop into basic
functioning and become a turing test to figure out to what degree the
internal mechanism can actually calculate something beyond its boundary or
threshold of interpretation. thus pregnant pause one thing, silence another
as the system reboots and tries to brute force the situation again and
again, as if something would be different by merely repeating the trials,
trying to look for an error to exploit to retain old existing worldview as
shared reality, albeit ungrounded and based upon deception, cloak dagger.

the alchemy of relations, natural with natural, artificial with artificial,
and virtual with virtual; yet in their recombination the dynamic exchange
of natural with artificial, or natural with virtual, either tending toward
the cyborg and in their composite, perhaps something akin to an advanced
humanity yet removed of the human and grounded truth as the central value,
the antihuman which seeks to destroy and replace the nature at its heart.

typologies and permutations, chemical models and their transformations and
relations within a geometric context -- not only in terms of being, and
thus identity -- ideas themselves: models, hypotheses, awareness.

in this way, understanding such cryptic code and programming can result in
capturing pieces, turning positions and players via seeding truth and
threshold access, putting the labyrinth on autopilot via these dynamics.

it is thus in symbolic communication that observation often occurs and in
awareness of self and others in this context, within existing or potential
dimensions. and yet to also perhaps be ungrounded, illiterate in this same
way as to how the observations are generated, validated, achieving 'truth'
or does it begin as a fiction until removed of all accompanying errors...

again to language and signs, the ecological relation amongst things, the
associational structures inherent in perception whether or not conscious of
them. to see a sign above a store with stalks of wheat, indicating bread.
or grapes, wine. green grapes, white wine, red grapes red wine and so on,
to whatever level of detail. infrastructural signage. bees as they relate
to flowers and pollination, as this relates to honey. ideas, concepts,
dynamics involved in these structural interrelations. massive code as it
were, societies envisioned structured around the bee, for instance, by
analogy. spiritual significance. deep knowledge of nature and industry, as
systems relate and exchange their shared truth.

and so too, in the more profane and superficial realm, viagra and an male
male virility and breast implants and signs of hyper-feminine nurturing and
the ecosystems of advertising, mass media entertainment, and social
relations based on what becomes a structural pseudo-truth, as if mimicry,
by which to 'shared consciousness' which can be a false perspective and
unsustainable except as artifice, which then is further developed and built
upon as if normal and solid when instead it is not of this same nature or
instinct. it has different parameters of interaction, including detached
sign-based relations where error-correction may be ignored and create a
realm of ideological commerce detached from its physical reality, where
womens breasts become detached from the sex itself via imposters or female
substitutes which stand-in as representers or signs of female being yet
seek to subvert the feminine by doing so, that depth of evil hacking, as it
also relates breast cancer or other defacements, cutting and scarring of
the body and its replacement via another plastic aesthetic, barbie doll,
yet potentially Edward in drag, giving come hither looks on the street.

the point is that -belief is not truth-. yet it can function as this if not
aware of what is being perceived, having an understanding of the idea and a
way of evaluating its integrity. can the belief even be questioned- or is
it beyond the boundary of interpretation. and if so, what might it mean if
a world of children is released into a world of masquerade, and the basic
relations between boys and girls are forged in a world of imposters and
exploiters who seek to destroy these very connections via their subversion.
or short-circuit development of individuals and their relations via abuse
that makes it certain they cannot function in these dynamics, healthily.
what if that code is important too, for security in the state, protecting
shared value, yet exists outside of software and hardware systems today, or
rather- is enabling these types of exchanges via an ideological fortress
built of binary religion and schemes that ride alongside the deception,
providing tools and carrying water and making change at the sideshows.

what if this is the same context for mass surveillance and these are also
'the politics' on the inside, mapping to the same corruption that becomes
oppression of ordinary citizens.

(cf. false perspective in relation to false economy via pseudo-truth, false
reality sustained by maintaining status quo; code as facade.)

what if the government spying of the public is being used to secure a
private ideology as a perpetual, unchecked, governing power via corrupt
language with no accounting for truth in its onesided reasoning.

that is, it is deemed "legal" within a warped and skewed constitution and
is essentially BAD FAITH, functioning against citizens, its subtext
political domination and removing of enemies via guiding to cattle chutes.

the programmatic aspect of this- you say certain things and they, like code
words automatically trigger certain dynamics, as if via mechanism. and thus
the [sign] of something, merely referencing 'the constitution' by someone
who is a 'constitutional lawyer' could be viewed legitimate because what
they declare cannot be overpowered by another interpretation in binary
terms, yet similarly *ignores* all contrary and falsifying facts via
ideology, and therefore relies upon, adds and extends errors into the
shared state framework (like bugs and malicious code) that can be further
exploited by subsequent policy actions -- yet which are never held to
account in an empirical framework of shared truth - beyond language (!)
meaning that the [signs], words and letters equate with this grounded truth
instead of the ones and zeros of truth and falsity via logical reasoning,
whereby acts of state become acts of literature, via private interpretation
said to be and validated as 'the reading' though based upon these flaws
that, in this A=3DB subjectivity, deteriorate the state in its functioning
due to the loss of accurate grounding and accountability in truth, of and
as truth, and instead only and increasingly partial, serving fewer and
fewer. it is not that someone cannot propose ideas, it is that there is no
error-correction mechanism to stop false perspectives from taking over the
interpretation and thus an imbalanced framework, a corrupted code results.
and mass surveillance contrary to privacy and businesses, franchises and
supermarkets and shoe stores surveilling citizens is a vast obscenity to
the laws of the shared state-- and yet a certain empowered population
likewise seems to believe this is their right and proper managerial place,
providing oversight of others, and thus tangibly 'represents their will' to
promote and succeed in such an agenda.

beneath this is the problem of reasoning in binary terms, as if a fencing
competition, points scored and one side is victorious. or jousting match,
someone brutally dismounted from their vehicle if not impaled. thus fear of
losing and losing face, in binary terms.

versus the greatness of ideas, of truth and concepts and modeling, the
activity of considering things and sharing discoveries and knowledge and
how terrible it has become in an age of universalized communication tools,
the limit becoming ourselves, our limits and lack of imagination and the
ability to think beyond flawed approaches while stuck in serial (binary)
language. perhaps most notable is the role of theory, both in negative
consequences yet also the metaphysical and tacit knowledge developed in
tentative frameworks of interpretation that could and should be salvaged
and brought into common empirical error-corrected realms, for what is true
of what is theorized remains true, yet should not be reliant on falsity or
errored-structures to maintain the hypotheses. because the gap between pT
and T, and pT and F is the realm of the exploit, the subversion, which can
change the stated direction of inquiry via its effects, whether knowingly
by subversion or accident, hijacked by other unaccounted hidden forces.

(note: it is this realm of partial truth or pseudo-truth that is the realm
of paradox. essentially up until now it has been referenced as an
inaccuracy, whereby A=3DB is considered false, due to limits of explanation
in email format- more likely it would be said B=3DB equals not-A and thus
would be false, though perhaps this should occur beyond a,b notation and
just use t,f, such that T=3DF is the paradoxical condition, whereby what is
true about it (T) would need to separated from what is false (F) within a
realm of pseudo-truth, such that:

   1 <--- T --- (pT) --- F ---> 0

and in doing this via a perpetual looping testing of the hypothesis, remove
falsity and error from pseudo-truth, distilling the truth to only what is
true (1) so that what remains of pseudo-truth is as near absolute as
possible (towards 100% true, or 1 in probabalistic terms). in this way, a
minor truth embedded in falsity that exists as ungrounded pseudo-truth, say
a tiny fragment of truth to recover from an inaccurate error reliant
perspective (1% or .01) could by this process be isolated and purified,
moving towards 100% or 1 (T). thus the issue of paradox exists in an A=3DB =
or
T=3DF scenario though removes the known falsity from the modeling, such tha=
t:

   (1)  A <--- pT ----> B (0)           therefore:   (~1 <-- .01)    T <=3D=
=3D
pT

...in terms of addressing and resolving paradox via hypotheses and testing
models and concepts via multiple observers and shared empirical
observations of the common event from as many angles as available.

   A =3D A  (tending towards truth)

   A =E2=89=85 B  (tending toward paradox)

   A =3D B  (tending towards falsity)

or so it is proposed there is a nuanced delineation required that has been
missing in previous explanation about the ambiguity involved.)

ideas are like molecules, having edges and vertices and yet this is a
nonlinear approach requiring to some degree a computational context for
such 'conceptual language' to exist within, beyond the alphabetic as a
means to communicate, outside the book, into the circuit and diagram and
empirical model. panoptics central, many observers of a given event and
tallying and error correcting the shared view, removing falsity and thus
distortion and arriving at structures and scaffolding within and between
concepts. truth at its core, logic as the basis for reasoned connections,
and then referencing this model from any point and perspective and moving
through it and making various interconnections as a way of conveying ideas,
truth, perception, experience. school children to grandparents referencing
the same modeling, developing and refining it over a lifetime.

the same idea in part as hypertext^1, in this way such point-line-plane
constellations of data could be mapped into its multidimensional structure
and a single common instance of a concept referenced by all documents, such
that [crypto] links to the concept, error-corrected, hypothesis challenged
model of crypto maintained by tens of thousands of people and debated, in
its entirety, as to its integrity and validity in terms of grounded truth,
where every truth must be accounted for, via probabilistic looping of data
and new data that remains contingent, able to be falsified, error-checked
and corrected as part of the process of logical reasoning / programming.

it would then be possible to develop a periodic table of 'ideas', models
and concepts that are /forms/ that are aligned and grounded in the shared
awareness of empirical truth and thus as code, and can be used for debate.
not a negative interaction of win-lose, instead the intellectual challenge
and joy of sharing views and observations and working-through differences
and learning from one another and incorporating what is true within a model
of shared truth and verifying and refining it as part of this 'reasoning'
that has been lost to private relativistic dialogue in binary terms. in
this way, all ideas, my own completely error-ridden and yet like others,
whatever is true in them would survive the edits in shared evaluation as
'truth' and not just a private observation that functions only as fiction.
whereas what is false would be removed, and what is partially true would
need to be separated into what is true and what is unknown and what is
false, and thus the room for potential hypotheses and further evidence, and
also for the richness in previous outdated modeling that may correlate with
an ecosystem of discovery, providing indications of a process involved that
moves from earliest stages to refinement of these conceptual models. again,
literacy is required, the ability to think and be aware and communicate and
relate in a shared framework, as human observers.

(basically modeling ideas as circuits, formed into molecules. individuals
as circuits, tasks and routines for a new model of personal computing based
on an AI data furnace approach)

---
random notes: voting through digital money, taxes for representation,
steering and percentage weighting towards certain policy priorities and-or
approaches, say funding basic and applied research. also: greatest threat
to tax system is subversion of policy  which justifies rebellion against
taxes to fund private state oppression of public, financing own holocaust.

work as info/value, correlated to money/currency via data model. accounting
for work in a realm of symbolic processing, versus manual labor standard.

issue of observing and accounting for crypto state viewed as treasonous by
the binary ideologues, revealing deception of traitors, moles, liars and
deceivers. becomes basis for criminalizing citizens as if perpetrators, use
of surveillance blackmail in this context, free speech and expression the
means to justify further police state tactics to protect those on inside
and in administrative and managerial roles. social hierarchy involved and
protected or secured bureaucratic structures these activities occur within.

 the outside, in the world of images.<br>
<br>it is as if there are components of a circuitboard that are made to=20
work with one another, that have collaborative and beneficial dynamics=20
yet are not allowed in proximity to one another based on the components=20
that are by comparison rigged, cheating and taking over the space and=20
rewiring it only for their kinds, leaving areas of isolation and=20
malfunctioning due to the inability to access the other, beyond the=20
structural frameworks that seek to subvert and exploit the connection=20
due to a corruption of its truth. what is unshared or partly true must=20
be adapted to in order to survive. and then only to find later on what=20
is missing, where it is located, and the distance between that may only=20
be temporarily bridged in passing, via a quick glimpse of recognition of
 what has been lost in the everyday. and this can be the truth of love=20
itself, intimacy, grounded connections.<br>
<br>as with a simulation that seeks to replicate another situation, the=20
fakery can be revealed in its errors, where resolution or detail is=20
lacking and thus whether via inadequate computation or malmodeling, the=20
framework based on and supporting this falsity may begin to warp and=20
skew, potentially to cause accidents and crashes as its compass does not
 align with the larger circumstance of shared awareness that it seeks to
 control and to replace. so too with fake men and women, shallow and=20
without depth of imagination, of limited and rigid reasoning, and while=20
&#39;saying all the right things&#39; it is these &#39;ideas&#39; that have=
 already and=20
must always have been said before, as if referencing a memory database=20
for fake-insight, correct perspective. again the binary viewpoint is=20
ideal for such a simulative social substitute whereas a paradoxical=20
situation would throw loop after loop into basic functioning and become a
 turing test to figure out to what degree the internal mechanism can=20
actually calculate something beyond its boundary or threshold of=20
interpretation. thus pregnant pause one thing, silence another as the=20
system reboots and tries to brute force the situation again and again,=20
as if something would be different by merely repeating the trials,=20
trying to look for an error to exploit to retain old existing worldview=20
as shared reality, albeit ungrounded and based upon deception, cloak=20
dagger.<br>
<br>the alchemy of relations, natural with natural, artificial with=20
artificial, and virtual with virtual; yet in their recombination the=20
dynamic exchange of natural with artificial, or natural with virtual,=20
either tending toward the cyborg and in their composite, perhaps=20
something akin to an advanced humanity yet removed of the human and=20
grounded truth as the central value, the antihuman which seeks to=20
destroy and replace the nature at its heart.<br>
=C2=A0<br>typologies and permutations, chemical models and their=20
transformations and relations within a geometric context -- not only in=20
terms of being, and thus identity -- ideas themselves: models,=20
hypotheses, awareness.<br>
<br>in this way, understanding such cryptic code and programming can=20
result in capturing pieces, turning positions and players via seeding=20
truth and threshold access, putting the labyrinth on autopilot via these
 dynamics.<br>
<br>it is thus in symbolic communication that observation often occurs=20
and in awareness of self and others in this context, within existing or=20
potential dimensions. and yet to also perhaps be ungrounded, illiterate=20
in this same way as to how the observations are generated, validated,=20
achieving &#39;truth&#39; or does it begin as a fiction until removed of al=

<br>again to language and signs, the ecological relation amongst things,
 the associational structures inherent in perception whether or not=20
conscious of them. to see a sign above a store with stalks of wheat,=20
indicating bread. or grapes, wine. green grapes, white wine, red grapes=20
red wine and so on, to whatever level of detail. infrastructural=20
signage. bees as they relate to flowers and pollination, as this relates
 to honey. ideas, concepts, dynamics involved in these structural=20
interrelations. massive code as it were, societies envisioned structured
 around the bee, for instance, by analogy. spiritual significance. deep=20
knowledge of nature and industry, as systems relate and exchange their=20
shared truth. <br>
<br>and so too, in the more profane and superficial realm, viagra and an
 male male virility and breast implants and signs of hyper-feminine=20
nurturing and the ecosystems of advertising, mass media entertainment,=20
and social relations based on what becomes a structural pseudo-truth, as

developed and built upon as if normal and solid when instead it is not=20
of this same nature or instinct. it has different parameters of=20
interaction, including detached sign-based relations where=20
error-correction may be ignored and create a realm of ideological=20
commerce detached from its physical reality, where womens breasts become
 detached from the sex itself via imposters or female substitutes which=20
stand-in as representers or signs of female being yet seek to subvert=20
the feminine by doing so, that depth of evil hacking, as it also relates
 breast cancer or other defacements, cutting and scarring of the body=20
and its replacement via another plastic aesthetic, barbie doll, yet=20
potentially Edward in drag, giving come hither looks on the street. <br>
<br>the point is that -belief is not truth-. yet it can function as this
 if not aware of what is being perceived, having an understanding of the
 idea and a way of evaluating its integrity. can the belief even be=20
questioned- or is it beyond the boundary of interpretation. and if so,=20
what might it mean if a world of children is released into a world of=20
masquerade, and the basic relations between boys and girls are forged in
 a world of imposters and exploiters who seek to destroy these very=20
connections via their subversion. or short-circuit development of=20
individuals and their relations via abuse that makes it certain they=20
cannot function in these dynamics, healthily. what if that code is=20
important too, for security in the state, protecting shared value, yet=20
exists outside of software and hardware systems today, or rather- is=20
enabling these types of exchanges via an ideological fortress built of=20
binary religion and schemes that ride alongside the deception, providing
 tools and carrying water and making change at the sideshows.<br>
<br>what if this is the same context for mass surveillance and these are
 also &#39;the politics&#39; on the inside, mapping to the same corruption =
that=20
becomes oppression of ordinary citizens. <br><br>(cf. false perspective=20
in relation to false economy via pseudo-truth, false reality sustained=20
by maintaining status quo; code as facade.)<br>
<br>what if the government spying of the public is being used to secure a
 private ideology as a perpetual, unchecked, governing power via corrupt
 language with no accounting for truth in its onesided reasoning.<br><br>th=

 is, it is deemed &quot;legal&quot; within a warped and skewed constitution=
 and is
 essentially BAD FAITH, functioning against citizens, its subtext=20
political domination and removing of enemies via guiding to cattle=20
chutes.<br>
<br>the programmatic aspect of this- you say certain things and they,=20
like code words automatically trigger certain dynamics, as if via=20
mechanism. and thus the [sign] of something, merely referencing &#39;the=20
constitution&#39; by someone who is a &#39;constitutional lawyer&#39; could=
 be=20
viewed legitimate because what they declare cannot be overpowered by=20
another interpretation in binary terms, yet similarly *ignores* all=20
contrary and falsifying facts via ideology, and therefore relies upon,=20
adds and extends errors into the shared state framework (like bugs and=20
malicious code) that can be further exploited by subsequent policy=20
actions -- yet which are never held to account in an empirical framework
 of shared truth - beyond language (!) meaning that the [signs], words=20
and letters equate with this grounded truth instead of the ones and=20
zeros of truth and falsity via logical reasoning, whereby acts of state=20
become acts of literature, via private interpretation said to be and=20
validated as &#39;the reading&#39; though based upon these flaws that, in t=
his=20
A=3DB subjectivity, deteriorate the state in its functioning due to the=20
loss of accurate grounding and accountability in truth, of and as truth,
 and instead only and increasingly partial, serving fewer and fewer. it=20
is not that someone cannot propose ideas, it is that there is no=20
error-correction mechanism to stop false perspectives from taking over=20
the interpretation and thus an imbalanced framework, a corrupted code=20
results. and mass surveillance contrary to privacy and businesses,=20
franchises and supermarkets and shoe stores surveilling citizens is a=20
vast obscenity to the laws of the shared state-- and yet a certain=20
empowered population likewise seems to believe this is their right and=20
proper managerial place, providing oversight of others, and thus=20
tangibly &#39;represents their will&#39; to promote and succeed in such an=
=20
agenda.<br>
<br>beneath this is the problem of reasoning in binary terms, as if a=20
fencing competition, points scored and one side is victorious. or=20
jousting match, someone brutally dismounted from their vehicle if not=20
impaled. thus fear of losing and losing face, in binary terms.<br>
<br>versus the greatness of ideas, of truth and concepts and modeling,=20
the activity of considering things and sharing discoveries and knowledge
 and how terrible it has become in an age of universalized communication
 tools, the limit becoming ourselves, our limits and lack of imagination
 and the ability to think beyond flawed approaches while stuck in serial
 (binary) language. perhaps most notable is the role of theory, both in=20
negative consequences yet also the metaphysical and tacit knowledge=20
developed in tentative frameworks of interpretation that could and=20
should be salvaged and brought into common empirical error-corrected=20
realms, for what is true of what is theorized remains true, yet should=20
not be reliant on falsity or errored-structures to maintain the=20
hypotheses. because the gap between pT and T, and pT and F is the realm=20
of the exploit, the subversion, which can change the stated direction of
 inquiry via its effects, whether knowingly by subversion or accident,=20
hijacked by other unaccounted hidden forces.<br>
<br>(note: it is this realm of partial truth or pseudo-truth that is the
 realm of paradox. essentially up until now it has been referenced as an
 inaccuracy, whereby A=3DB is considered false, due to limits of=20
explanation in email format- more likely it would be said B=3DB equals=20
not-A and thus would be false, though perhaps this should occur beyond=20
a,b notation and just use t,f, such that T=3DF is the paradoxical=20
condition, whereby what is true about it (T) would need to separated=20
from what is false (F) within a realm of pseudo-truth, such that: <br>
<br></div>=C2=A0=C2=A0 1 &lt;--- T --- (pT) --- F ---&gt; 0<br><br></div>an=

doing this via a perpetual looping testing of the hypothesis, remove=20
falsity and error from pseudo-truth, distilling the truth to only what=20
is true (1) so that what remains of pseudo-truth is as near absolute as=20
possible (towards 100% true, or 1 in probabalistic terms). in this way, a
 minor truth embedded in falsity that exists as ungrounded pseudo-truth,
 say a tiny fragment of truth to recover from an inaccurate error=20
reliant perspective (1% or .01) could by this process be isolated and=20
purified, moving towards 100% or 1 (T). thus the issue of paradox exists
 in an A=3DB or T=3DF scenario though removes the known falsity from the=20
