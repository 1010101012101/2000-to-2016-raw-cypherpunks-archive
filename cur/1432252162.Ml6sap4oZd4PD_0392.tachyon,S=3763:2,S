This is really crappy logic.  Any law that restricts speech or the 
press is presumably unconstitutional.

Actually it's a really crappy analogy.  Arguing that "it's kind of like 
this hypothetical thing that doesn't exist and therefore ought to
be treated as I imagine this hypothetical thing would probably be 
treated if it did exist" is an incredibly poor use of the device of 
analogy.

You're fucking kidding, right? Do you think "Ann Landers" and her 
ilk actually know the "true names" of all the morons who write
in to her?

That's funny,  just a week or two ago you were saying any ethical
person in the journalistic profession should be willing to go to
jail rather than compromise the identity of his sources.
Someone who writes in a ltter is precluded from being a "source"?
