	Bush winning is bad, AlGore winning is worse. This insane 
infighting over the spoils is too much to stomach.

	It really doesn't matter which one wins, the damage is done. 
There is significantly less faith in the *voting* system this week 
than there was 7 days ago. This will mean even more trouble--more 
shitbags calling for "direct democracy" (hint folks, the problem 
isn't the electoral college it's a broken fucked up corrupt 
*balloting* system) more scum trying to fuck with the constitution or 
insisting that it be ignored.

	I'm not laughing because I really don't *want* to die in a fire-fight.
