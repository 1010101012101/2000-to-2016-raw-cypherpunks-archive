Sort of.  The first remailer in the chain will see something like an
IP address.  This might or might not be enough to identify the
indvidual using it in principle (gee,  it's somebody posting from a
public library or internet cafe) and almost certainly isn't in
practice (how many remaler operators bother keeping something
like a reverse DNS table on their servers).

If the remailer operators decided they wanted to deny "baddies" 
use of their services, they would not only have to unanimously 
agree as to who the "baddies" are, they would also have to deny
their services in all cases where the client cannot be positovely 
identified.  Neither of which strikes me as being plausible.

In the old style numbered swiss bank account,  you give them
a suitcase full of cash and you get an account number.  They know
who you are if the recognize you when you go in to set up the 
account, if not not.

I stand by my earlier statement.  The fact that you may be 
identifiable at the point of entry to an anonymity system is
a weakness, not a desired feature, and if it can be avoided, it
should be.
