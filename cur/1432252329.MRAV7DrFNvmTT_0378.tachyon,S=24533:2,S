     Status Report: "The Dishonest Minority"



Three months ago, I announced that I was writing a book on why security  
exists in human societies.  This is basically the book's thesis statement:

    All complex systems contain parasites.  In any system of
    cooperative behavior, an uncooperative strategy will be effective
    -- and the system will tolerate the uncooperatives -- as long as
    they're not too numerous or too effective.	Thus, as a species
    evolves cooperative behavior, it also evolves a dishonest minority
    that takes advantage of the honest majority.  If individuals
    within a species have the ability to switch strategies, the
    dishonest minority will never be reduced to zero.  As a result,
    the species simultaneously evolves two things: 1) security systems
    to protect itself from this dishonest minority, and 2) deception
    systems to successfully be parasitic.

    Humans evolved along this path.  The basic mechanism can be
    modeled simply.  It is in our collective group interest for
    everyone to cooperate. It is in any given individual's short-term
    self-interest not to cooperate: to defect, in game theory terms.
    But if everyone defects, society falls apart.  To ensure
    widespread cooperation and minimal defection, we collectively
    implement a variety of societal security systems.

    Two of these systems evolved in prehistory: morals and reputation.
    Two others evolved as our social groups became larger and more
    formal: laws and technical security systems.  What these security
    systems do, effectively, is give individuals incentives to act in
    the group interest.  But none of these systems, with the possible
    exception of some fanciful science-fiction technologies, can ever
    bring that dishonest minority down to zero.

    In complex modern societies, many complications intrude on this
    simple model of societal security.	Decisions to cooperate or
    defect are often made by groups of people -- governments,
    corporations, and so on -- and there are important differences
    because of dynamics inside and outside the groups.	Much of our
    societal security is delegated -- to the police, for example --
    and becomes institutionalized; the dynamics of this are also
    important.

    Power struggles over who controls the mechanisms of societal
    security are inherent: "group interest" rapidly devolves to "the
    king's interest."  Societal security can become a tool for those
    in power to remain in power, with the definition of "honest
    majority" being simply the people who follow the rules.

    The term "dishonest minority" is not a moral judgment; it simply
    describes the minority who does not follow societal norm.  Since
    many societal norms are in fact immoral, sometimes the dishonest
    minority serves as a catalyst for social change.  Societies
    without a reservoir of people who don't follow the rules lack an
    important mechanism for societal evolution.  Vibrant societies
    need a dishonest minority; if society makes its dishonest minority
    too small, it stifles dissent as well as common crime.

At this point, I have most of a first draft: 75,000 words.  The tentative 
title is still "The Dishonest Minority: Security and its Role in Modern 
Society."  I have signed a contract with Wiley to deliver a final 
manuscript in November for February 2012 publication.  Writing a book is a 
process of exploration for me, and the final book will certainly be a 
little different -- and maybe even very different -- from what I wrote 
above.  But that's where I am today.

And it's why my other writings -- and the issues of Crypto-Gram --  
continue to be sparse.

Lots of comments -- over 200 -- to the blog post.  Please comment there; I 
want the feedback.

     RFID Tags Protecting Hotel Towels



The stealing of hotel towels isn't a big problem in the scheme of world  
problems, but it can be expensive for hotels.  Sure, we have moral  
prohibitions against stealing -- that'll prevent most people from stealing 
the towels.  Many hotels put their name or logo on the towels.  That works 
as a reputational societal security system; most people don't want their 
friends to see obviously stolen hotel towels in their bathrooms.  
Sometimes, though, this has the opposite effect: making towels and other 
items into souvenirs of the hotel and thus more desirable to steal.  It's 
against the law to steal hotel towels, of course, but with the exception of 
large-scale thefts, the crime will never be prosecuted.  (This might be 
different in third world countries.  In 2010, someone was sentenced to 
three months in jail for stealing two towels from a Nigerian hotel.)  The 
result is that more towels are stolen than hotels want.  And for expensive 
resort hotels, those towels are expensive to replace.

The only thing left for hotels to do is take security into their own  
hands.  One system that has become increasingly common is to set prices  
for towels and other items -- this is particularly common with bathrobes  
-- and charge the guest for them if they disappear from the rooms.  This  
works with some things, but it's too easy for the hotel to lose track of  
how many towels a guest has in his room, especially if piles of them are  
available at the pool.

A more recent system, still not widespread, is to embed washable RFID  
chips into the towels and track them that way.  The one data point I have 
for this is an anonymous Hawaii hotel that claims they've reduced towel 
theft from 4,000 a month to 750, saving $16,000 in replacement costs 
monthly.

Assuming the RFID tags are relatively inexpensive and don't wear out too  
quickly, that's a pretty good security trade-off.

WikiLeaks cable about Chinese hacking of U.S. networks:
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/wikileaks_cable.html

Increasingly, chains of evidence include software steps.  It's not just  
the RIAA suing people -- and getting it wrong -- based on automatic  
systems to detect and identify file sharers.  It's forensic programs used 
to collect and analyze data from computers and smart phones.  It's audit 
logs saved and stored by ISPs and websites.  It's location data from cell 
phones.  It's e-mails and IMs and comments posted to social networking 
sites.  It's tallies from digital voting machines.  It's images and 
meta-data from surveillance cameras.  The list goes on and on.  We in the 
security field know the risks associated with trusting digital data, but 
this evidence is routinely assumed by courts to be accurate.  Sergey Bratus 
is starting to look at this problem.  His paper, written with Ashlyn 
Lembree and Anna Shubina, is "Software on the Witness Stand: What Should it 
Take for Us to Trust it?."

According to this article, students are no longer learning how to write in 
cursive.  And, if they are learning it, they're forgetting how. Certainly 
the ubiquity of keyboards is leading to a decrease in writing by hand.  
Relevant to security, the article claims that this is making signatures 
easier to forge.  I'm skeptical.  Everyone has a scrawl of some sort; mine 
has been completely illegible for years.  But I don't see document forgery 
as a big risk; far bigger is the automatic authentication systems that 
don't have anything to do with traditional forgery.

In online hacking, we've moved to the world of "steal everything."  As  
both data storage and data processing becomes cheaper, more and more data 
is collected and stored.  An unanticipated effect of this is that more and 
more data can be stolen and used.  As the article says, data minimization 
is the most effective security tool against this sort of thing.  But -- of 
course -- it's not in the database owner's interest to limit the data it 
collects; it's in the interests of those whom the data is about.

     Hijacking the Coreflood Botnet



Earlier this month, the FBI seized control of the Coreflood botnet and  
shut it down:  "According to the filing, ISC, under law enforcement  
supervision, planned to replace the servers with servers that it  
controlled, then collect the IP addresses of all infected machines  
communicating with the criminal servers, and send a remote 'stop' command 
to infected machines to disable the Coreflood malware operating on them."

This is a big deal; it's the first time the FBI has done something like  
this.  My guess is that we're going to see a lot more of this sort of  
thing in the future; it's the obvious solution for botnets.

Not that the approach is without risks:  "'Even if we could absolutely be 
sure that all of the infected Coreflood botnet machines were running the 
exact code that we reverse-engineered and convinced ourselves that we 
understood,' said Chris Palmer, technology director for the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, 'this would still be an extremely sketchy action to 
take. It's other people's computers and you don't know what's going to 
happen for sure. You might blow up some important machine.'"

I just don't see this argument convincing very many people.  Leaving  
Coreflood in place could blow up some important machine.  And leaving  
Coreflood in place not only puts the infected computers at risk; it puts  
the whole Internet at risk.  Minimizing the collateral damage is  
important, but this feels like a place where the interest of the Internet 
as a whole trumps the interest of those affected by shutting down 
Coreflood.

The problem as I see it is the slippery slope.  Because next, the RIAA is 
going to want to remotely disable computers they feel are engaged in  
illegal file sharing.  And the FBI is going to want to remotely disable  
computers they feel are encouraging terrorism.  And so on.  It's important 
to have serious legal controls on this counterattack sort of defense.

Interviews with Me About the Sony Hack



These two interviews are what I get for giving interviews when I'm in a  
bad mood. For the record, I think Sony did a terrible job with its  
customers' security. I also think that most companies do a terrible job  
with customers' security, simply because there isn't a financial incentive 
to do better. And that most of us are pretty secure, despite that.

One of my biggest complaints with these stories is how little actual  
information we have. We often don't know if any data was actually stolen, 
only that hackers had access to it. We rarely know how the data was 
accessed: what sort of vulnerability was used by the hackers. We rarely 
know the motivations of the hackers: were they criminals, spies, kids, or 
someone else? We rarely know if the data is actually used for any nefarious 
purposes; it's generally impossible to connect a data breach with a 
corresponding fraud incident. Given all of that, it's impossible to say 
anything useful or definitive about the attack. But the press always wants 
definitive statements.

     Drugging People and Then Robbing Them



This is a pretty scary criminal tactic from Turkey.  Burglars dress up as 
doctors, and ring doorbells handing out pills under some pretense or  
another.  They're actually powerful sedatives, and when people take them  
they pass out, and the burglars can ransack the house.

According to the article, when the police tried the same trick with  
placebos, they got an 86% compliance rate.

Kind of like a real-world version of those fake anti-virus programs that  
actually contain malware.
