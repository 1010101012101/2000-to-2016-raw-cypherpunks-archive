    Yes, we can protect you from those eeeeeeeeeeeevil commie pirates.  
Our product is a "flexible solution that combines programmable security 
and 'smart content' with risk management techniques such as forensic 
marking and attack response capabilities."  And yes, the icon comes in 
cornflower blue.

    Meanwhile, Bittorrent now takes up 35% of global bandwidth 
(http://in.tech.yahoo.com/041103/137/2ho4i.html) and 4Mb DSL lines are 
now available in the UK mass market 
(http://www.bulldogbroadband.com/general/landing.asp) for #40 ($73) per 
month with T&Cs that scream 'P2P-OK'.

    Good luck with those 'attack response capabilities'.
