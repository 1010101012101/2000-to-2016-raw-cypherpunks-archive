	Because it allegedly came from Bell's own mouth. Note some of
Bell's messages are part of the Federal Complaint.

	Be of good cheer. I suspect that if you conducted an interview
with Jim Bell, where you claimed he made incriminating admissions,
then wrote-up and posted the results, the prosecution would in general
be just as willing to have you testify as a witness as they would an
"official" journalist. You could test this :-).

	Umm, why? Remember they didn't evaporate the first time
around, from the Carl Johnson trial. And there's no government
"fishing expedition" here. The prosecution has set out exactly the
evidence it's seeking. Or were you referring to this part of the motion?

  "Put simply, Bell's likely cross-examination of McCullagh will be a
   fishing expedition in its purest form. The "mere hope" of obtaining
   exculpatory evidence is not sufficient for enforcement of a Rule 17
   subpoena."

	I think I'm finally getting the answer to my question ...
