What I find interesting is how we can have a war without a Congressional 
    declaration, which out of practical if not legal necessity requires 
something at least approximating a foreign power as the enemy. It would 
be extremely helpful if there were some overt state action or at least a 
smoking gun to publicly identify such party.

Bin Laden and crew are not a foreign power, unless we are stupid enough 
to turn them into one, a  hostile one. Sheer folly when their precise 
complicity and the extent of their involvement in the attacks has yet to 
  be demostrated outside of their self-promotion and our desire to find 
the guilty parties. Who, I don't believe, give a shit about the Islam 
rampant bs. except as expedient, and as much as about selecting the toll 
collectors for the pipelines to be built through places like Afghanistan 
to China, the former Soviet Republics, etc.

I don't rule out a war. There are grounds for it. That'll be folly, too, 
though, if we pick the wrong enemy, or support the wrong side again. Not 
speaking of Bin Laden now. Or cut another deal with a devil who'll bite 
us in the ass again a few years down the road. If not sooner. If we have 
to have Americans dying in remote, already blown-up, mine-laden poppy 
fields etc. as postulated, kindly let's not do it out of crass political 
expediency. Again. Nothing wrong with revenge for 5000+ dead, either, 
but don't let's get more killed going after the wrong motherfuckers, or 
trying to buy the right ones off.

There, is that cryptic enough?
