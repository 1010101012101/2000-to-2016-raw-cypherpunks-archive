Subject: ALA Senate candidate Bernard Gaynor struts his stuff in a
powerful speech.

FW: ALA SENATE CANDIDATE STRUTS HIS STUFFThis is one of the best
political speeches I have read from a man who is a true Australian
patriot and not a typical brain-dead Australian politician. Bernard's
speech is full of facts and truth about Islam and politics in
Australia. He was given a rough deal by the ADF and NSW
Anti-Discrimination Board and successfully defended himself against
both of them.

My only criticism is that Bernard didn't go far enough in calling out
the Liberal and Labor parties as the Islamic lap dogs, gutless
snivelling cowards and traitors they truly are.

Get ready for the major parties and the slimy Greens to launch attacks
against Bernard Gaynor, the ALA and Pauline Hanson. I hope they have
have the determination, resilience and endurance for a long political
battle to win seats in Parliament. I don't think the Liberal party
will be able to have the leader of ALA imprisoned on trumped up
charges like they did with Pauline. With today's social media it will
be far more difficult to substantiate false claims against Gaynor and
the ALA.

ALA SENATE CANDIDATE STRUTS HIS STUFF

THE PICKERING POST
Larry Pickering
Fri 27 Nov 2015

http://pickeringpost.com/story/-ala-senate-candidate-struts-his-stuff/5620




Outspoken ex-military Senate candidate, Bernard Gaynor, faced a large
crowd on Queensland’s Gold Coast this week to launch his campaign for
the newly-formed Australian Liberty Alliance party which is looming as
a force in the upcoming Federal election.

Mr Gaynor spoke mainly about public concern over Islamic immigration.
There is certainly a world-wide movement gaining political momentum on
this issue and the current Labor and liberal parties are certain to
join in moving against any viable threat to their comfortable duopoly,
as they have with ruthless efficiency in the past.

This is the text of what Mr Gaynor had to say:

Ladies and gentleman, Australia is facing a crisis.

It is a crisis that threatens all of us right now. And it is a crisis
that threatens our children most of all because they will have to live
with the decisions we make today.

This crisis comes from Islamic ideology.

For far too long, our government has pretended that Islamic ideology
is peaceful. Our political leaders have pretended that this ideology
can be integrated safely into our society.

But they have been wrong.

Any student of history knows that this belief is wrong. Islam was
founded by a man who brilliantly merged politics with religion and
created an empire where the church was the state. In the process, an
army was raised, wars were fought, and populations were enslaved,
forcibly converted or executed.

This man was Mohammad and the Islamic religion teaches that he was
perfect and that his example is to be followed. There should be no
surprises, therefore, that the Islamic religion leads to violence. It
idolises a warlord.

It should also come as no surprise that this religion advocates
immigration into non-Islamic lands as a means of conquering them. The
Islamic calendar itself is based on the first successful conquest
undertaken by Islamic immigration: the conquest of Medina.

For much of the last three centuries, all of this has been forgotten.

Then September 11 happened.

Unfortunately, the Western world believed that September 11 was
something new. But it was not. It was something old.

In fact, in the first battle of September 11 was in 1683. This was the
first September 11.

On that first September 11, European forces defeated an invading
Islamic army that had been besieging Vienna for two months. Those of
you who know Europe will know that the city of Vienna is right in the
middle of the continent. It is not an understatement to say that this
victory saved Europe.

After this first battle of September 11, the Islamic threat to Europe
receded due to the efforts of those who protected Western
civilisation, until it was forgotten. But before this first battle of
September 11, Europe was constantly threatened by Islam, just as it is
today.

In fact, Vienna was under constant attack for 150 years prior to that
first battle of September 11 in 1683.

The Battle of Lepanto occurred in 1571. It saved Europe from an
Islamic fleet sent to invade Italy.

In 1453, the city of Constantinople fell. It has been the capital of
the Byzantine Empire since Roman days. It finally succumbed after a
700 year fight against Islamic aggression. Now this empire and its
culture is gone.

The Spanish also battled Islam for about 700 years. That’s how long it
took to remove Islam after it arrived with the Caliph’s armies shortly
after Mohammad’s death. The year that Columbus discovered America was
also the year that Islam was eventually removed from Spain. Now it is
walking in again via Europe’s open borders.

Mohammad died in the year 632. Within five years, Jerusalem had been
captured and in the next century Islam had conquered the Persians, the
Egyptians, all of North Africa, Spain and had even reached into the
heart of France.

In 732, at a place called Tours in Northern France, this first Islamic
invasion was finally stopped but as we can see through history, it was
not the last.

We face another invasion today.

September 11 shows that we are once again under attack.

So does Bali. And Madrid. And London.

So do the terrorist atrocities on our home soil, in Melbourne, in
Sydney’s Martin Place and at Parramatta.

And two attacks in Paris this year show that appeasing the enemy only
makes things worse.

Yet our politicians, our government and our security organisations
remain obstinately and wilfully determined to ignore the reality of
this crisis and the threat that we face.

Let me give you three examples.

The first example is that of our Prime Minister.

Our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has been talking a lot about
Islam lately. And every time he does, he shows how ill-equipped and
unprepared he is for the task at hand of protecting Australia and
Australians.

In early October, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that he was going
to ‘reset’ relations with the Islamic community. By the end of the
day, a police worker lay dead outside Parramatta police station as a
result of an attack launched from the Parramatta mosque.

Undeterred, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a National Day
of Unity in late October, where Australians were invited to welcome
the Islamic community. The very next day, Hizb ut Tahrir held a
conference attended by nearly 1000 people and announced that they
rejected Australia, and rejected our values, our laws, our flag and
our anthem.

Just so you know, this organisation, Hizb ut Tahrir, has been
supported by almost every Islamic organisation or imam in Australia,
including the Grand Mufti, Australia’s highest ranking Islamic figure.

The truth is that Hizb ut Tahrir is the political wing of an Islamic
insurgency intent on overthrowing our system of government.

Then the Prime Minister flew to Europe and rejected calls for European
nations to shut their borders to an Islamic invasion.

Within a couple of days, 130 people lay dead in Paris and hundreds
more were wounded. These attacks were carried out by immigrants who
lived in France, but who never became French.

And now, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wants us to negotiate a
political settlement in Syria. He thinks the Islamic State can be
dealt with by nothing more than words.

As such, it is clear that the Prime Minister, installed by the
majority of his Liberal party colleagues, has simply no idea about the
nature of Islamic ideology or how we should confront its attacks on
us.

The second example relates to government funding of Islam in this
country. This is just a small example of how your taxes are spent:

The federal government has provided millions over the last five years
to ‘deradicalisation’ programs. Only one out of 87 of these programs
actually deals with radicalised individuals. The remainder actually
promote Islam. Some of these programs over the last 12 months are:

$120,000 has been provided for an Australian Rules Football
competition open only to Islamic schools.

$114,820 has been provided to tackle violence between Islamic sects
within the Islamic community.

$115,700 has been allocated to a program called People Against Violent
Extremism. It tackles extremism by trying to ‘deradicalise’ those who
oppose the construction of new mosques in their local community.

$56,500 was allocated to SalamCare. This group is led by a person who
wrote Allahu Akbar on their Facebook page when the Islamic State
announced that it had formed the caliphate and it campaigns against
radicalisation by trying to stop people like the courageous Dutch
politician, Geert Wilders, from coming to Australia.

Over $1 million has been allocated by the Attorney-General’s
Department to pay for the legal fees of those facing terrorism charges
or who are being questioned by ASIO.

Over $15 million was allocated to improve school security last year.
Islamic schools made up the vast majority of schools to receive
funding for this project.

$66,000 was provided by the Australian Federal Police to the Lebanese
Muslim Association. This organisation has hosted a US-based imam who
has stated:

“If we put a nationwide infrastructure in place and marshalled our
resources, we’d take over this country in a very short time….What a
great victory it will be for Islam to have this country in the fold
and ranks of the Muslims.”

Over $165 million was given to Islam-sympathetic groups by Centrelink
to help resettle migrants in Australia in the last 12 months.

And the Queensland government is now funding mosque open days.

The list goes on. The Prime Minister doesn’t understand the threat.
And our government uses our taxes to fund and promote Islam. This
helps to explain why, despite the billions that we spend on this
problem, it is only getting worse.

The third example is that of our Australian Army.

It is now removing a motto from the hat badges of its Christian
chaplains because it has been deemed offensive to Muslims.

This motto is “In this sign conquer”.

The appeasement within the military comes just a few months after the
appointment of the first imam in the Australian Defence Force, Sheikh
Mohammadu Nawas Saleem.

Saleem is one of Australia’s most prominent imams. He is the treasurer
of the Australian National Imams Council and works very closely with
the Grand Mufti.

And Sheikh Saleem has called for Sharia law to implemented in Australia.

He has supported Hizb ut Tahrir publicly. This is the same Hizb ut
Tahrir that says Muslims must not attend Anzac Day because it
represents an attack on the caliphate. This is the same Hizb ut Tahrir
that defends the concept of honour killings.

Sheikh Saleem has opposed military action against the Islamic State.
And he has condemned laws that prohibit the advocation of terrorism on
the basis that they limit the free speech of Islamic preachers.

And the Liberal government appointed this imam to the military. His
job is to help increase recruitment from the Islamic community.

Just so you know, the Islamic community has more of its sons fighting
for the Islamic State than for Australia.

All of these examples highlight how unprepared our political leaders,
our government and our military is to deal with the threat of Islamic
violence.

And if they won’t defend against Islamic violence, then we are also
wide open for subversion in other ways: through the implementation of
halal certification, through the acceptance of polygamy via
Centrelink, through the indoctrination of our children in the national
curriculum.

If our government cannot bring itself to understand the violence of
Islam, it will never be able to defend itself against the non-violent
but equally subversive political threat that Islam poses in a
democracy.

But I have not come here today to tell you how bad things are.

You already know it. Australians everywhere already understand this.

What we desperately need is a solution and that is why I am here
because the Australian Liberty Alliance is that solution.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will stand up to the threat of Islam
and we will do this while Australia still has time to act. It is
important to understand this. The problems in Australia are there, but
they are not as great as those faced by Europe.

So we have a window of opportunity to act and for the future of our
children, we must.

This is the Australian Liberty Alliance’s plan.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will stop Islamic immigration.

It will do this by imposing a moratorium on immigration from any
countries that are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,
with exceptions only for persecuted non-Muslims from those countries.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will axe the halal certification tax.

It will do this by scrapping all halal certification fees and forcing
the Islamic community to pay for its own religious offices. That will
kill the profit taking. And it will force producers to clearly label
their products and explain to Australians that the food they buy –
especially meat – has been produced as part of an Islamic animal
sacrifice. This will kill demand and halal certification will simply
disappear.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will reject any government support for
Sharia law, in law and in practice.

That means there will be no more welfare for polygamous Islamic
families, no segregation of women, no female genital mutilation and
none of the other Islamic practices that are incompatible with
Australian culture and society.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will put an end to the construction of
dangerous new mosques and Islamic schools.

It will force Islamic organisations to sign up to a Charter of Muslim
Understanding, which will require these organisations to reform Islam
so that it no longer acts as a violent political ideology, if they
wish to be classified as religious organisations. And the party will
work with local governments to introduce proper and stringent risk
assessments into the development planning process.

This means that without reform of Islam, and I doubt that will ever
happen, there will be no new mosques and existing mosques will face
the prospect of being shut down.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will also address the threat of
terrorism by addressing the problem: Islam.

Our intelligence and security agencies will be directed to gain a true
understanding of Islam, rather than the politically-correct version
that they pretend into existence today. These organisations will no
longer be allowed to promote this religion or its ideas.

And the Australian Liberty Alliance will start using treachery laws
against those who support the Islamic State and other Islamic
terrorist groups against our own Defence Force.

All of these measures could be implemented today. And if they were,
the problem we face would not grow and the serious troublemakers
within the Islamic community would be neutralised, while the remainder
of the Islamic community would soon get the message: get on board with
Team Australia, or face the full force of the law. Most of them want
to and we welcome that.

The situation within Australia is containable if we act today. If we
wait until 2020 or 2025, it may well be too late.

Unfortunately, these decisions are not being taken because our current
leaders do not understand the problem and they do not have the will to
act. They are lethargic in the face of the enemy.

Australians deserve much better and that is what the Australian
Liberty Alliance will provide: an energy to act, driven by a proud and
uncompromising belief in our Western Christian civilisation.

Unlike the others, the Australian Liberty Alliance is proud that it is
proud of Australia.

As a result, the Australian Liberty Alliance is not just addressing
the big picture. Its policies, intent and resolve will also address
the problems that Australians face in their local communities: like
right here on the Gold Coast.

For instance, the Gold Coast Mayor, Tom Tate, has been quoted in
Islamic webpages outlining a vision where entire suburbs convert to
Islam in order to bring in Islamic tourists.

I say this: Tom Tate might as well strap a suicide vest to the Gold
Coast’s tourism industry. I grew up in Southport. I love this city and
I know why people come here. It is not because of Islam. Sharia
tourism will kill the Gold Coast. These ideas must be stopped and as
the Australian Liberty Alliance grows it will work with local Gold
Coast residents to run strong campaigns for good local representatives
to be elected to council so that they can fight this dangerous
political correctness.

This is how we must protect ourselves from Islam: and not just Islam’s
threat of violence, but the danger it also offers against our economic
security and our social fabric.

Of course, the Australian Liberty Alliance is more than a party
focused on Islam.

It is not a single issue party. It has a conservative philosophy and
policies that will help Australians in other ways. Its vision is for a
smaller, decentralised government that does not leave a legacy of debt
for future generations.

It believes in reform of the tax system. At the moment debate is
focused solely on new taxes. The Australian Liberty Alliance believes
that it is more important to look at how current taxes are spent and
how the grants system allows government funds to flow into projects
that have no responsibility, accountability or oversight.

It will sell the SBS to the highest bidder and put a broom through the ABC.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will support natural families and
reform welfare so that it is not used as a substitute for work, but so
that it also provides Australian families with more choice and
opportunity to spend time with their children raising them.

It will not waste billions trying to control the level of the oceans,
yet the Australian Liberty Alliance’s environmental policies will have
the exact same impact on the climate as those of other parties.

The Australian Liberty Alliance will address the flaws in our
education system and refocus our schools so that they teach the basics
exceptionally well and this will set the foundation for exceptional
higher educational studies.

These are all ideas that the Australian Liberty Alliance will
champion. And our political system needs debate about these ideas.

At the moment, the major parties have a monopoly on debate. They are
the Coles and Woolworths of politics, screwing down on the voters.

Their efforts and endeavours are not about providing customer service
or better products. Instead, they focused solely on maintain their
monopoly on power. We desperately need an Aldi to come and shake up
the system.

That is what the Australian Liberty Alliance will do and by doing so,
it will provide Australians with a brighter future.

That future starts at the next election. Between now and then I will
be working night and day to campaign for the Australian Liberty
Alliance and I hope you will join me in that campaign.

We need to build a strong team on the Gold Coast and across
Queensland. This campaign will not be successful if it is a one man
band. But it will succeed if we work as a team and the turn out
tonight shows that we are well and truly on the way to building this
team, this army of patriotic Australians. I look forward to growing
that team on the Gold Coast from tonight.

I also thank you for coming tonight. I thank for you for already
standing tall and fighting hard for Australia. And I thank you for
your support of the Australian Liberty Alliance.
