In preparation for a demo next week we've started working on a new
round of release candidate (RC) .iso images.  We've added some of the
more stable network apps back into Byzantium Linux (namely,
Etherpad-Lite and ngircd/QwebIRC), and we've added the OLSR network
visualization utility, which shows the topology of the mesh as the
node in question knows it as well as network dynamics.

What we don't have yet is the service directory (which will be a
static HTML file with links to all of the services).  For the sake of
brevity we also have not put back the Avahi stuff.

However, this might change depending on how to AWMH (Aaron Swartz
Memorial Hackathon) goes tomorrow.  We'll let everyone know.

The latest and greatest can be downloaded from here:

http://project-byzantium.org/downloads/v0.3a/byzantium-v0.3a-RC-20130201-2144.iso

SHA-1 hash: 3da4db0ad345a475c20d88390e1c8fc57fe4c033

If anybody has time, download this .iso and give it a shot!  Let us
know what works, what doesn't, and what could use cleaned up and we'll
get to it tomorrow!
