this would be a fun exercise.  i wonder how much dark fiber is truly
"dark" these days...

a friend and i had a discussion on this very subject recently.  if you
don't mind the social network analysis but desire privacy of content,
does it matter if your encrypted comms stand out assuming they can't
break the cipher?

strong anonymity against an NSA threat model is very difficult;
sometimes privacy of content is sufficient.

in any case, i'd like to see encryption become the norm for even
trivial communications. like the Azureus enhancements Steve mentioned
this can be done in a simple and intuitive manner - it will just take
a lot of effort...
