Total, unequivocal bullshit.  You have anything to back up these absurd
statements?

(1) "Forcibly institutionalized" patients are *NOT* [legally] "prisoners",
and therefore are not included in prisoner counts.  Obviously, this
statement excludes those persons committed to institutions by a court as
"unfit to stand trial" - a microscopic percentage of the
"patient" population in the U.S.

(2) The "2-P.C." [2 Psychiatrist Committal] laws do NOT apply to someone
*after* they have committed a crime.  After they commit a crime, they are
under the jurisdiction of a *court*, and they are no longer patients (and
only _patients_ get 2-P.C.'d).

(3) The 2.P.C. laws are in EVERY state specifically allow for, and in
fact, REQUIRE, that a person be involuntarily committed if "they present
an immenent danger to themselves or others".  This is clearly not the same
as "have committed a crime".


     First you claim that "nobody has ever survived a shot to the head
with a .32", and now *this*  --  Where do you get this shit from???

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
