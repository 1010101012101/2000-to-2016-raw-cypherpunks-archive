It is impossible to rationalise long term consequences of data harvesting into
immediate threat for most people. The only way to change behaviour in absence
of the perceived threat is propaganda ... and those who have means for that
have different agendas. What's left is a personal-level propaganda but the
effects are negligible.

You can't really save anyone.

You can, however, make crypto tools that make things easier. Or surveillance
tools that make things obvious. The latter, I think, is more effective. Time to
open source Echelon ?
