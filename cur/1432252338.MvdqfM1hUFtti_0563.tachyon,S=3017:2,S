It's hard to take seriously any American calling for a trial of Saddam
Hussein who does not first call for a trial of Henry Kissinger.

Kissinger is guilty of a wide variety of serious crimes.  Many are
suitable for an international tribunal, others are clear cut
violations of U.S. law.

Kissinger is available, prosecutable, and guilty.
