This is true.

Today there are very few collections of individuals that oppose government in
general and that have more than 1% of intelligent, coherent, technologically
savvy members. Cypherpunk MOVEMENT is one of those, and it is dangerous to
the government, for the good reason.

Come to think of it, I cannot recall any other MOVEMENT that comes
even close to cypherpunks. Most clans that deal with arms ... I mean
technology ... are mostly gadgeteers or plain cults. Cypherpunks (at
least 2% of them) have a clear agenda and expertise to achieve it.

Very dangerous, as we are finding out.
