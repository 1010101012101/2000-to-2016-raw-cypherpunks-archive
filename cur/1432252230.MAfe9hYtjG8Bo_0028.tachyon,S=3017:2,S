CFP is in SF next year, so you may want to stop by.

As for "comped scribblers," I am one. But look at it from a
journalist's perspective: We may attend two conferences a week, say at
$1,500/per. Rough estimates, then, would be over $150,000 a year, more
than most journalists make.

Paying that much in conference fees is not feasible, and conference
organizers generally understand this and let us in free (we may pay for
meals) in exchange for publicity.
