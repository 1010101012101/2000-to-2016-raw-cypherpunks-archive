NO CHAIN CYCLE 202
 http://www.geocities.com/cycle202/ 

 
Safety ! 
Speedly ! 
Convenient ! 
Lightly ! 
 
 1.PERFECT FREEDOM DANGER 
    Preventing the injuries by the chain when bikes fall down
    (Especially,in the case of children`s we expect to be reduced 80 up
    to 90 percent of the dangers of injuries by the chain)

 2.EASY HANDLING 
    The handling is easy with the function of chainless three gears,
    and the reduction of mechanical troubles of the gearbox is 
    remarkable compared with the bikes attached multi-gears on the
    ordinary chains.

 3.DIRTY FREE.
    It`s the solution to the problem oof smeared over clothes going on
    a bicycle for leisure and salaried employee.

 4.AFFINITY FOR ENVIRONMENT
    The ordinary chain bikes have to put frequently lubrication oil 
    on the chain to prevent corrosion and abrasion.But,in the case of
    the cainless bikes,it is affinity for environment the reason why the
    mechanical parts built in the covered steel cap that the lubrication
    oil does not make environmental pollution.

5.EASY AND CONVENIENCE FOR CUSTODY AND MAINTENANCE
    It does not require troublesome handworks during custody,and 
    worries about corrosion in a long term custody are reduced remarkably
    compared with the ordinary chain bikes.
    Otherwise,the chainless bike is convenience without missing chain 
    from track.

6.MULTI-FUCNTION
    The chainless bike(Steals)
    1)the function of 3th step of three gears emphasized on weight training.
    2)the function of 2nd step of three gears for transportation of everyday
       life.
    3)the fuction of 1st step of three gears for easy climbing acclivity. 

  The mondems should spend money buying sporting goods and invest time
  for their health management by the lack of exercise.
  The STEALS,chainless bike is aiming at the unification of the double 
  burden money and time,and offer the solution into the everyday working 
  as the answer of it.

HOW TO USE NO CHAIN CYCLE

1.The Chainless Bike does not require troublesome handworks 
    that is the charater.
2.The gearbox shall be cleaned 1~2 time in a couple year and then,    
    put in a small quantity of gears.    
3.When you want changing rears (speed) while running the bike,stop the     
    pedal and turn smoothly the gearbox.    
SPECIFICATION OF NO CHAIN CYCLE

1.Specification of gearbox (changing gears)   
   a.Hi-Speed    3th step      : 1 vs 3.5    
   b.Medium-Speed 2nd step : 1 vs 2.4    
   c.Low-speed  1st step      : 1 vs 1.8    

2.Comparative Table    
                                    Chain Bike           Chainless Bike
     Transmission               Chain                     Gerar
     Life Span                   Short                      Long
     Against Impact             Weak                     Strong
     Obstacles                   Hindrance              Without Hindrance
                                                               (spring & ropes)
