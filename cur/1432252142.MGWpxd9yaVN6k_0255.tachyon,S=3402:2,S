DNS and ICANN and such are on their way out. Private namespaces are back.

The assumption - that, for example, xyz.com *must* resolve to the same IP number wherever the query is done - went curiously unchallenged for a long time. Now, seriously, why is it so important that google.com means the same in New Zealand and Czech Republic? Where is this notion that the planet needs the globally unique name space coming from? What makes it "good" (hint - you can't use Google, Inc. profits as an argument) ? 

Historically, only the state insisted on unique identifiers, for its own needs.

The unique namespace is a terrible idea. It's a shit amplifier. It skips and disables local roadsigns and greatly reduces the number of roadsign posters. It's no wonder that ICANN attracts slimy thugs - a prospect that few can decide on global naming has attractiveness of a dung pile for flies miles away.

There are very good reasons for having things harder to find. A complex discovery process itself is a great moron filter. During the search you may find things and people you didn't look for.
