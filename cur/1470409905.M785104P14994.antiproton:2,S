Discussion in <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10269297>

OK, so local realism is dead. But what is it? An excerpt from above:

> Perhaps the best way to explain local realism is that it’s the thing
> you believe in, if you believe all the physicists babbling about
> “quantum entanglement” just missed something completely obvious.

And here's the tl;dr:

> (And thus, quantum mechanics exhibits what one might not have
> realized beforehand was even a logical possibility: it doesn’t allow
> communication faster than light, but simulating the predictions
> of quantum mechanics in a classical universe would require
> faster-than-light communication.)

Another chunk:

> The violation of the Bell inequality has a schizophrenic status in
> physics.  To many of the physicists I know, Nature’s violating the
> Bell inequality is so trivial and obvious that it’s barely even

Me, I like the many worlds interpretation. But it's just an
interpretation. What matters is the math.
