Certain Californians will say that the "Darknet" allegedly coined in 
2002 by these guys is clearly a misspelling of "Blacknet," coined for 
this usage in 1988, by me, and made popular in 1992-3, when it was 
actually deployed (by me)...and investigated by various TLAs on 
espionage grounds.

Not surprising that this "appropriation of the term" came from our 
friends in Redmond. Perhaps they will copyright the term and then send 
me and others threatening letters.
