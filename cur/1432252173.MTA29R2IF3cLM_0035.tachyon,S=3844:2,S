That is how its done.  Tamper detect can look for voltages, freqs, 
temps out of range, pressure changes, acceleration, mechanical intrustion,
etc.  If you see tampering, you zeroize your key, your disk is suddently
filled with useless noise.  

There is a patent on thermite-like pastes you can build into a chip, which
helps against reverse engineering the circuitry, post-mortem.  For you,
simple zeroizing will probably be enough; though see the work on remenance
in RAMs for caveats.

Worse than looking bad, you can't take energetic materials
on airplanes.

Check the archives, this gets discussed periodically, and there
are commercial tamper-resistant/detecting modules out there.
