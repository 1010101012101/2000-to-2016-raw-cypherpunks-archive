A 'tuber' is a swelling on a 'stem' (that in the case of a potato happens
to be underground. A stem is a 'stalk' that bears flowers, fruits, potato
eyes, etc. A stalk is simply a cylindrical 'body' (the thing the xylem and
floem are in). And if you look up 'tuber' and 'potato' you'll find them
listed in 'root and tuber crops'.

You guys failed Botany 101, clearly.
