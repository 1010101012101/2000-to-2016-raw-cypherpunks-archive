Geez!  You guys have the DUMBEST ideas ever!  For fuck's sake, go and
RTFA! (For the dumb: READ THE FUCKING ARCHIVES!)

Anything displayed on your screen is visible to the guy across the street
with a TEMPEST detector unless you work in a Faraday cage.  Failing that a
hidden pinhole camera, or an RF transmitter attached to your cable -- hell
these are available for hobbist use right now: x10.com has small devices
that you can use to broadcast video from one room to another.  Getting the
same done for VGA, XVGA, etc. shouldn't be any harder.

Using IR or RF is one of the stupidest things you could possibly
do.  Think!  IR and RF are detectable from a distance!

Ok, some IR auth is ok, provided it's in a sealed chamber and no photons
leak out.  i.e. think of a two cylinders, sealed at the ends where the
cables go, where one fits inside the other... sort of like fiber optic
cables and connectors.  No leaks.

Direct contact's obviously fine, so long as your alleged attacker can't
tap into it.
