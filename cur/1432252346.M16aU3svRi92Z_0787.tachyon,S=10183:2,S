Security is not bringing more people onto your net or with you
as partners, let alone biased LE. Do you let cops sleep in your
house to protect you? What about that little dimebag you like to
toke on Fridays? Besides, if they want the service, corps don't
need LE to do what they can already do together neutrally on
their own, or by subscribing to equivalent commercial honeypot
services. What is this, infraguard 2.0? Clipper? Dept of redundancy?
Big brother? TIA?

Also, latency/TTL detection of remote hosting..

Heads up to Tor people, and cpunks to carve it up further.
