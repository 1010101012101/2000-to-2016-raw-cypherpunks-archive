Does _what_?

It would help if you gave an example of what you're talking about.

You must be the only remaining user of NS (for either the Mac or 
Windows). Everyone I know gave up on NS 5 and moved on to IE. It's not 
perfect, but it's not buggy like "AOLscape" is.

IE 5.1 is pretty good on OS X, as is OmniWeb.
