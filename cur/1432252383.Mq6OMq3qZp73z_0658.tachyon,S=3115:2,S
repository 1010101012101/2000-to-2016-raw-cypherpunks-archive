Well said. But don't leave, get combative, truth comes out by hammer blows
not friendly persuasion. Telling people to shut up is a national craze reports
the Wall Street Journal, like aroma therapy.

Tim is customarily wide minded about most things, including who
posts here. When he goes on the attack, though, its purposeful, 
usually to hot poker fat-ass noodling. 

Don't expect from Tim polite disagreement, far less polite agreement.
Nobody is in charge here, nobody is the man. Everybody is a bull shitting
loser, or a loon, as Tim anoints his taunters reflexively. Choate is the 
norm, goddam mule, vainly stubborn and resistant to reason as you'd
expect of any coddled American self-indulgent supremacist racist 
ignorant peasant who believes he's an unrecognized Mensa. Give
a fool money and he's a genius, and often a crank to ward off
panhandlers.

Best to stay alert to getting your ass rasped if you get lazy, or presume 
this vile extreme fighting pit a comfortable refuge.

Fuck such fake-wrestling fools to death, as the old fart might snarl --
just before he blows their pea-brains out to make a barbeque stew
stirred with cactus in a vat of dragon-fire jalapenos. 

Statist, communist, those old word farts are over if you're under 30.

Whatever happened to the iron-gut cypherpunk who was blackbelt in 
gobbling jalapenos?
