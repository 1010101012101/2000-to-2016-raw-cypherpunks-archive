What does the concept of right and wrong have to do with it? 

I would say that a more relevant phrasing of the question is one that
needs to be answered on a case by case basis : is it possible to kill
that particular government?

What's in it for the aggressor? Access to rare earths, risk reduction, a
warm-water port, a Pepsi factory, supermodels? I doubt that any 3rd
party would incur the expense of killing an entire government completely
out of a sense of right unless that cost were extremely small - pocket
change, so to speak.
