White Supremacist Tim "I'd like to see a race riot" May Moroned:
#    Vulis, you're the same commie fool
#    you were a a couple of years ago.

Starting to stutter at the thought of Vulis, eh?

My guess is he is the one persistently subscribing
this list to Giganetstore, etc.

Thus making this the TimMay and Vulis-spam list.

White Supremacist Tim "I'd like to see a race riot" May Moroned:
#    Your kind has earned liquidation.

When did all your thoughts turns from creating things
to destroying things? 


White Supremacist Tim "I'd like to see a race riot" May Moroned:
#    The count of a sample of 1% of the votes took all of today, so the
#    count of 100 times as many total ballots will presumably take on the
#    order of 100 days.

Gore wins.


White Supremacist Tim "I'd like to see a race riot" May Moroned:
#    They analyzed the "chads" and counted 33 additional votes for Gore,
#    14 for Bush. So this would imply about 19 additional votes for Gore
#    over Bush. Then, extrapolating to the full population, 1900
#    additional votes for Gore over Bush (modulo statistical fluctuations).

They said the number of errors warranted a recount. Yep.


White Supremacist Tim "I'd like to see a race riot" May Moroned:
#    Of course, the Republicans will have to call for a manual recount of
#    Duval County and all of the other counties where the same statistical
#    examination should turn up votes for THEM.

Apparently the request wasn't made within the required 72 hour period,
so, Bush lost out there. Of course, recounts there wouldn't make much
difference anyway: no fucked-up ballot. I think such recounts should
be allowed even if they missed the 72-hour deadline.

Live and let live.
