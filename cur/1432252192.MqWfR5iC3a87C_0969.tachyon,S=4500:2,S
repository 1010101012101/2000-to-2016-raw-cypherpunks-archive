Actually, voting in Britain is done by Parlimentary district, which
is a lot smaller than a county. The names on the ballots are the
candidates for Member of Parliment from that district..

The party which gets a majority of the parlimentary seats is
requested by Mrs. Windsor to form a government. If no party
gets a majority, the one with the largest number of seats tries
to form a coalition government with one of the other parties.

You don't vote directly for a party or Prime Minister (unless
you happen to live in his or her district - the PM is an MP
as well).

And yes, redrawing parlimentary district boundaries is subject
to the same partisan gerrymandering as congressional
boundaries are in the US.
