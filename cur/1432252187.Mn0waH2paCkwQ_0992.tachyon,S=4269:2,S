Eugene, do you think feds enter people's home because the people in question
may have carried a knife illegally years ago?  What federal law?  What basis
for a search warrant?  What the hell are you talking about?

Then tell them to get the hell off your property if they don't have a
warrant.  That takes 5 seconds of your afternoon.

You know, using the passive voice in this context is "bad personal style."
Don't speak for anyone but yourself.  If you think it's bad, just say so.
Don't hide behind "is usually considered."  Any whether you like it or
not--whether anyone likes it or not, like Tim says, "I'll do what I want."

Statute of limitations for starters.  I'll leave the rest as an exercise for
the student.

Then versus now.  Think about it.

What I said was funny, but the underlying reality is serious--deadly
serious.  Tim's playing to the galleries increases his risk whether he or
wish to acknowledge it or not.

And I think you should stuff a sock in your cake hole.  So we both have
opinions and we disagree.  I can live with that.
