Choate, you're either a complete moron or the most obstinate person I've
ever encountered. One would expect sciencedaily.com's website to change
daily. Hence the name. Now, when someone reads this message of yours two
weeks from now and wants to see what it is that you were talking about,
they're not going to be able to find it. Quantum computing will have been
replaced by stories of monkeys trading sexual favors for food in the front
page headlines.

"Well, I have to do it this way or Tim will yell at me for posting HTML"
you say.

Wrong. Post a direct link. Everyone's happy. You don't look stupid. We all
win.

Now, is that so hard?
