Wow, NBC reports 19,000 Palm Beach County ballots
were discarded because _two_ holes were punched,
presumably by people confused by the illegally
formatted ballot. Buchanun received three times
the votes expected.

>This _NY Times_ article has a little more detail:
>http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/politics/AP-ELN-Florida-Ballot-Confusion.html
>
>: Florida law specifies that voters mark an X in the blank space
>: to the right of the name of the candidate they want to vote for.
>:
>: Jeff Liggio, a lawyer for county Democrats, called the ballot
>: illegal. "Right means right, doesn't it? The state law says right.
>: It doesn't mean left," he said.
