Learn to read poopyhead (isn't that now the official CP insult?). 

Look at the part you snipped :

  I'm not saying that it (vouchers or other defunding)
  should be ruled out but you should at least think 
  about the implications a bit.  

All I said was that actions can have unintended consequences. Make well
considered choices. Look at the power industry deregulation in CA. Too
much, too quickly and poorly crafted. By all means let's improve the
educational opportunities in this country but not with some stooopid
knee-jerk approach. Try and do it in one fell swoop based on right-wing
war chants and I'll bet you do more harm than good.

This statement is neither entirely true nor entirely false but it sure
as hell is a knee-jerk reaction to the issue. Sounds like the sort of
foolishness that Rush Limbaugh vomits on the airwaves.

Uh, nope, that's not what I said. I said I would be in favor of
carefully considered proposals. Proposals that are fair to individuals
and beneficial to the community. Again, the two goals are neither
completely compatible nor mutually exclusive.
