   'Secure' U.S. Site Wasn't Very

   WASHINGTON -- A U.S. government website devoted to helping businesses

   -- such as revenue, number of employees, and the European countries
   with which the firm does business -- that U.S. companies provided to
   the government in strict confidence.

   plugged the security hole at 5 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. "We are aware of
   the concerns, and are taking all necessary steps to identify and
   resolve the issue," a department official said.

   Harbor" site established to aid U.S. firms in offering adequate
   privacy protection wasn't lost on some privacy advocates.

   "If the government can't control its own information, why is it asking
   the private sector to do any better?" says Jim Harper, editor of
   Privacilla.org. "When it comes to information management, government
