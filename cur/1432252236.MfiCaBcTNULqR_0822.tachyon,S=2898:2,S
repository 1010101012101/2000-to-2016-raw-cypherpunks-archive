Somehow I doubt they'll appreciate my perspective:

1) Completely eliminate the Department of Homeland Security

2) Remove all infringements on the right to keep and bear arms and
return to the homeland security the founders envisioned, the
unorganized militia.

It would be hard to even state my perspective at their site. It splits
the problem up into umpteen components, and expects you to comment on
them individually, assuming that their compartmentalization of the
problem is the only possibility.
