Space station moved to higher orbit ahead of new team's arrival

MOSCOW (AFP) Apr 10, 2003
The International Space Station (ISS) was moved to a higher orbit on 
Thursday to prepare for the arrival of a new team of cosmonauts, Russian 
space officials quoted by Interfax said.

The ISS was raised to an orbit of some five kilometers (three miles) 
above earth -- a procedure that is regularly required to counter Earth's 
gravitational pull.

Man that thing must be streamlined to stay in orbit three miles above 
earth...
