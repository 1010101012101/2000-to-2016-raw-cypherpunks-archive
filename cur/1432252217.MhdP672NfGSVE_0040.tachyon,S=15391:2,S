Blindfolding Big Brother, Sort of

Jeff Jonas is an IBM engineer who specializes in software that
infuses powerful search technology with anonymity.

By Kate Greene

In 1983, entrepreneur Jeff Jonas founded Systems Research and
Development (SRD), a firm that provided software to identify people
and determine who was in their circle of friends. In the early
1990s, the company moved to Las Vegas, where it worked on security
software for casinos. Then, in January 2005, IBM acquired SRD and
Jonas became chief scientist in the company's Entity Analytic
Solutions group.

His newest technology, which allows entities such as government
agencies to match an individual found in one database to that same
person in another database, is getting a lot of attention from
governments, banks, health-care providers, and, of course, privacy
advocates. Jonas claims that his technology is as good at
protecting privacy as it as at finding important information.

Technology Review: Your most recent project at IBM, Anonymous
Resolution [formerly known as ANNA], is software that can match a
given individual across different databases, but in the process
safeguards personal identifiers -- for example, name and social
security number -- in those databases. Who would use this software?
What problem does it solve?

Jeff Jonas: The software is used by organizations that have data,
have access to data, or have relationships with other entities with
whom they want to exchange data. For example, a bank will take data
about its customers and encrypt it. Then they'll send the data to a
database marketing company. That company will decrypt it, and match
the bank's customers to various records that the marketing company
would have. For example, records that show what kind of magazines
you subscribe to, how big your house is, the number of children you
have, and so on. And then the marketing company will send back to
the bank what's called a "database marketing append," so the bank
will understand better who its customers are.

That's very commonplace. But the risk is that even though the data
is encrypted while being transported, it is decrypted by the other
party. If the people who are managing that data happen to be
corrupt or they have a breech of their system's security, that
data's at risk for an unintended disclosure event.

TR: How does your software solve this problem?

JJ: The technique that we have created allows the bank to anonymize
its customer data. When I say "anonymize," I mean it changes the
name and address and date of birth, or whatever data they have
about an identity, into a numeric value that is nonhuman readable
and nonreversible. You can't run the math backwards and compute
from the anonymized value what the original input value was.

When I went to invent this software, I could have done this with
encryption, where the data could be decrypted; but I felt like it
would be a stronger privacy product if we didn't invent it that
way. So the unique thing about the technique is that instead of me
encrypting data and sending it to you, and you decrypting it to use
it, the technique allows me to encrypt my data, you to encrypt your
data, and this new technology is capable of performing robust
matching of identities using only encrypted data.

To put [data] on the highest possible privacy grounds, instead of
making it encrypted, we actually used one of the components of
encryption called one-way hashing that is not reversible.

TR: Who currently uses your software?

JJ: The current customers are governments that are interested in
using this to share data with themselves. This is an interesting
notion that I think would be a shock to most citizens of any
country: You can walk into any government organization and you'll
have one group working on, say, money laundering, and ten doors
down you have another group working on drug cartels. The only way
they have today to figure out whether they're working on the same
person is to play the game that I refer to as Go Fish. That means
one of them has to pick up the phone and call the other and say
"Majed Moqed? Khalid al Mihdhar? Threes? Tens? Jacks? Twos?"
They're not going to read the whole list.

This technique allows an entity, whether it's corporate or
government, to compare data that's trapped in silos, sensitive data
that you wouldn't want to escape. The identity data flows into a
central index, and in that index, it figures out when people are
the same or related. But it can't tell you the name or the address
or the phone number of the people who are the same because it
doesn't know. When there's a match, each of the records that match
has its pedigree or attribution on it that tells you which system
and which record. So it creates a pointer and tells you which
record to ask the other group about.

TR: And this is obviously useful for counterterrorism.

JJ: Here's the scenario: The government has a list of people we
should never let into the country. It's a secret. They don't want
people in other countries to know. And the government tends to not
share this list with corporate America. Now, if you have a cruise
line, you want to make sure you don't have people getting on your
boat who shouldn't even be in the United States in the first place.
Prior to the U.S. Patriot Act, the government couldn't go and
subpoena 100,000 records every day from every company. Usually, the
government would have to go to a cruise line and have a subpoena
for a record. Section 215 [of the Patriot Act] allows the
government to go to a business entity and say, "We want all your
records." Now, the Fourth Amendment, which is "search and seizure,"
has a legal test called "reasonable and particular." Some might
argue that if a government goes to a cruise line and says, "Give us
all your data," it is hard to envision that this would be
reasonable and particular.

But what other solution do they have? There was no other solution.
Our Anonymous Resolution technology would allow a government to
take its secret list and anonymize it, allow a cruise line to
anonymize their passenger list, and then when there's a match it
would tell the government: "record 123." So they'd look it up and
say, "My goodness, it's Majed Moqed." And it would tell them which
record to subpoena from which organization. Now it's back to
reasonable and particular.

TR: What were the challenges with developing this software?

JJ: One of the challenges is when you one-way hash the data, it
becomes "infinitely sensitive." What I mean by that is that the
word robert, if you one-way hash it, and take Robert, where the r
is capital and not lowercase, the one-way hash generated by this
subtle difference is completely different.

One of the reasons people didn't try to do this before, or it was
believed that maybe it wasn't useful, is that people's identity
data is always quite different -- sometimes with a middle initial,
sometimes without. Identities just don't show up the same. That was
the trick we had to solve: allowing it to match data that's fuzzy
while only using one-way hashed values.

The trick is in how we prepare the data. Here's a simple example.
One list says Bob and one says Rob. Well, we know that both Bob and
Rob belong to the same root name, in this case, Robert. So before
we anonymize each side, we throw in the most rooted form, which is
Robert. So we've added Robert to both lists, and we then one-way
hash both lists so it turns out the Robert matches.

TR: How is this is based on earlier work you did for Las Vegas
casinos?

JJ: The ability to figure out if two people are the same despite
all the natural variability of how people express their identity is
something we really got a good understanding of assisting the
gaming industry. We also learned how people try to fabricate fake
identities and how they try to evade systems. It was learning how
to do that at high speed that opened the door to make this next
thing possible. Had we not solved that in the 1990s, we would not
have been able to conjure up a method to do anonymous resolution.

TR: You've said that 40 percent of your time is spent on privacy
and civil liberties issues and that a privacy strategist works with
you. Could you give me an example of the sort of things you and
your privacy strategist discuss?

JJ: When the government has a watch list ?- this, by the way,
doesn't have to do with our tech, this is about responsible usage
of tech and improved processes -- when you have a watch list, the
questions come up: Who's on the list? How can people find out if
they're on the list? How can they get off the list if they're not
supposed be on it? If a government has a list and they're sharing
it, making copies of it, and somebody's removed from the list
because they've made a mistake, how can you be sure that they're
removed from everywhere else they shared it?

Another thing that my privacy strategist and I have been talking
about is called an "immutable audit log."

TR: What's that?

JJ: You want to make sure that someone who is using a secret
government system isn't putting their ex-wife in a watch list or
searching for their ex-wife or their neighbor just because they're
curious. That would be a misuse. An immutable audit log is the
notion that every time a user queries for a record, this new kind
of audit log records it in an indelible way that's like etching it
into stone. In other words, even if a database administrator was in
cahoots with them, or the database administrator was a corrupt
entity, they couldn't erase their own footprints.

TR: Is there anything a person can do, other than living off the
grid, to keep their digital trail to a minimum?

JJ: Oh, boy -- that's a great, great question. As consumers, we
often trade our information, creating a bigger footprint, because
of some opportunity being extended to us. And the biggest privacy
problem I have with that is when it is a surprise to the consumer.
My advice to companies and governments is to avoid consumer
surprise. That's one of the most offensive things: when you find
out somebody's doing something with your data about which you had
no clue.

So my advice is to avoid consumer surprise, and that means having
some degree of transparency. I believe consumers should be offered
the opportunity to opt out. So the organizations that you transact
with, the ones that allow the consumer to say "Hey, please don't
sell my data" and those organizations that make it easy for the
consumer to opt in or out -- I think consumers may eventually flock
to those places where they feel the risk of consumer surprise is
less.

TR: The Department of Justice has subpoenaed some of Google's data,
and the company is refusing to cooperate. What is your opinion on
this?

JJ: I haven't been following this very closely. But let's talk
about consumer surprise. I think it would be a surprise to
consumers [to find] that they would be identified to the government
at individual levels. I think consumers would be less surprised if
Google provided just statistics.

TR: As an engineer concerned with privacy issues, what is your
opinion on the NSA domestic wiretapping program?

JJ: I have not read up much on that. I don't know whether it's
legal or not legal. I would say if it turns out to be legal and
it's going to continue, then I would say, "Could you do it with
anonymous data?"

TR: As an entrepreneur, you've successfully looked around, found a
problem, and solved it with software. In your mind, what is the
most important problem to be solved today?

JJ: Picture this: We're in a canyon, and on the left there's this
wall, and behind it is this back pressure, and that back pressure
is "ill-will" that wants to do harm to democracy or the United
States. And behind the other wall it is a police surveillance
state. And the number of technology options that you have that
don't turn you into a police surveillance state and that prevent
the ill-will intent on the left are in the middle. There are a very
narrow number of solutions between these canyon walls. But the
problem is, should ill-will continue to grow, the pressure behind
the wall on the left becomes such that, as we march forward through
time, the canyon gets narrower and narrower, and eventually you
have bad things happening and you have to be a police surveillance
state to protect yourself.

But the real thing that has nothing to do with technology is, if we
don't figure out how to lower ill-will, our future is darker.
"Approximately four thousand years ago, aliens
invaded Earth and began implementing a
diabolical plan to enslave humanity.  These
aliens have come to be known as "cats."  They
had one overwhelmingly superior ability.  They
understood calculus.  And humans did not.  The
plan has been wildly successful and the proof
is obvious: cats rule the world and very few
humans understand calculus." - Kenn Amdahl and
Jim Loats, Calculus for Cats
