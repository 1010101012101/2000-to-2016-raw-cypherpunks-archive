So in Choate Prime, in order that one make a movie of a person getting
shot in the head, one would have to commit murder?

So in Choate Prime, in order that one make a Godzilla stomps on Tokyo
movie, one must first see the destruction of the city of Tokyo?

So in Choate Prime, in order that one make a movie of an exploding nuclear
bomb, decimating Hiroshima, one must build such a weapon and drop it on
city?

So in Choate Prime, are there no cartoons because it would be impossible
to create them in real life?

Porn is speech, the same as any other type of magazine, movie, sound, etc.
The acts can and have been faked, as are the sound effects.

The speech part isn't irrelevant, it's the whole, and only point of this
disucssion.


Yes, I know you'd bring up kiddy porn, but recall that not only movies of
such acts are banned, but so are cartoons, comic books, etc. depicting
such acts.  In other words, here in the real world (i.e. not in Choate
Prime), kiddy porn is thought crime, and thus it is restricted speech.

So is going on Yahoo stock message boards and getting people to buy stocks
so as to raise their price.

So are sexual offers/requests in the office.

I'm sure in your next elequent reply you will continue to tell us about
your lovely world in its parallel dimension, which has no relation to
ours, and we'll read it with fascination.
