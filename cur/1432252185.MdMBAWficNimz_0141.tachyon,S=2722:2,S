About that book:

:Everyone knows it is a bad idea to try and board a plane carrying a box
:cutter, a flight manual written in Arabic, or a sack full of mysterious
:white powder. But with ultra-tightened airport security, a book could also

With enough examples like these collected in your Noggin database, you
develop the ability to measure degrees of intelligence, even without any
mechanical high-tech gear or scientifically conducted testing.

Very useful, especially for self-defense & preservation, especially in Times
Like These with people like those.
