You're right about the privacy aspect, but still missing the entire point.

I don't care about showing up in server logs, although my personal security 
practices are much different now than they were six years ago.  I may have 
spotted my own information in the data, and I might be able to prove it 
(the Palm Pre is in a box 'o bits & crap somewhere.)

The bigger picture is not why Cryptome appears to be distributing old log 
files, but validity of the GHCQ slide in question.  That's why all the data 
is being put up for scrutiny, and we are losing sight of the importance of 
it with all the noise.

Doesn't matter if JY is a fed asset.  Doesn't matter if Best is a troll 
with a personal vendetta against JY/Cryptome (neither of which I believe to 
be true, but still.)

A slide was presented as being part of the Snowden dump.  A researcher has 
shown that with these log files, anyone could have made this slide.  This 
is a Big Fucking Deal with possibly numerous implications about a much 
larger dataset.

Forget about who is saying what and just look at the data and draw your own 
conclusions.  We are better than this.
