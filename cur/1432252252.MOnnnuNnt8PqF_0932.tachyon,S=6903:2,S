COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE RECEIVE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
FUNDS FOR DRUG COURTS

         WASHINGTON, DC - Attorney General John Ashcroft announced today, 
$30.9 million to plan, establish, or improve drug courts for nonviolent 
offenders with drug problems. Eighty-nine jurisdictions in 38 states and 
territories will receive grants. (See attachment)

         The announcement comes at the request of President Bush, who 
pledged in May to increase funding to fight drug addiction through several 
programs, including drug courts.

         "Drug courts help communities by managing offenders' behavior and 
breaking the cycle of drug addiction and crime," said Attorney General 
Ashcroft.  "Drug court judges are actively involved in holding 
substance-abusing offenders accountable while helping to rehabilitate them 
and reduce recidivism."

         Fifty-five jurisdictions will receive grants ranging from $166,000 
up to $500,000 to implement new drug courts.  Twenty courts will receive 
grants ranging from $31,222 up to $300,000 to enhance their existing 
programs or to support statewide drug court activity.  Another 14 tribal 
jurisdictions will receive up to $30,000 to plan drug courts.

         Since 1995, the Justice Department's Drug Courts Program Office 
(DCPO) has made approximately 650 grants totaling more than $125 
million.  Nearly 700 drug courts are operating in the United States and 
more than 430 are being planned.  All 50 states have drug courts in 
operation or in the planning stages.  Thirty-two states have passed 
legislation supporting drug courts and six more are introducing 
legislation.  The drug court concept has also expanded to juvenile and 
family drug courts, DUI/DWI and tribal courts.
                 According to the Drug Court Clearinghouse at American 
University, more than 73,000 adults and 1,500 teens have graduated from 
drug court programs.  Recidivism rates continue to drop for graduates, with 
rates reported by drug courts ranging from 2 to 20 percent.  Also, in 
Portland, Oregon, it was found that for every $1 spent on a drug court, 
$2.50 is saved in standard criminal justice system costs, and when 
estimating broader cost savings, such as victimization and theft costs, $10 
is saved.

         In addition to awarding grant funding, DCPO provides training on 
planning adult,
juvenile or family drug courts.  In FY 2001, DCPO expanded its training 
programs by nearly 300 percent to train more than 200 communities.  From 
1995 through 2000, 446 communities received planning support and have 
completed the training programs.  Of these communities, 76 percent have 
implemented a drug court.  DCPO expects to provide training to about 150 
communities in FY 2002.

         Drug court participants must take frequent drug tests and meet 
regularly with their judges.  Drug court judges monitor offenders' 
treatment regimens and impose graduated sanctions, including incarceration, 
on those who do not comply.  Participants are expected to stay in treatment 
and may be ordered to participate in educational, vocational or community 
service activities.  Offenders who graduate from drug court programs may 
have their charges dismissed or sentences reduced.

         About $50 million is available for drug courts in FY 2001.  The 
President has requested $50 million for drug courts in FY 2002.

         More than 240 jurisdictions applied for funding this year: 129 
were for first-time courts and 99 for enhancements.  A list of grantees, 
contacts and the award amounts is attached.  In addition, summaries are 
available describing how each grantee receiving an implementation or 
enhancement grant will use the funds.

         Additional information about the drug court program is available 
on the Drug Court Program Office's Website at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/dcpo or by 
calling the Drug Court Clearinghouse on 202/885-2875.  The Clearinghouse's 
Website is www.american.edu/justice.
