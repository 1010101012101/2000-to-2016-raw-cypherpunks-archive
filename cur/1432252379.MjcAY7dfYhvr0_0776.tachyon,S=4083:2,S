No need, you can buy these kits for about $100 (by the time you've used up 
the initial ink supply included with the kit you've save about $300 by 
their reckoning) from MIS http://www.inksupply.com.  Their Epson Continuous 
Flow System is one of the best computer-related investments I've ever 
made.  If you're considering a new printer, consider an Epson and a 
CFS.  They also sell archival and quadratone inks (for incredible B&W prints).
