  British 'spy rock' a multi-million dollar miracle of technology: FSB

  Jan 26 1:55 PM US/Eastern


  Russia's intelligence agency described the communications device disguised
  as a rock allegedly used by British spies in Moscow as a "miracle of
  technology" worth tens of millions of pounds.

  "It's a piece of space-age technology, a machine that can withstand a fall
  from from nine floors up and prolonged submersion in water," said Sergei
  Ignachenko, spokesman for the FSB agency, as he showed off the object to
  the media.


  On Monday, the FSB accused four British diplomats of involvement in a spy
  ring in which agents allegedly passed secrets through the device, located
  in a Moscow park and the subject of a programme broadcast by a state-run
  television channel.

  "According to our experts, this rock, this miracle of technology, costs
  several tens of millions of dollars," the spokesman said.

  He said FSB agents were systematically searching the capital to locate
  similar devices they believed British agents had planted.

  He added that the device shown to the media was found six weeks after an
  alleged British spy removed another one.

  On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the exposure of the
  alleged British spy ring justified a hotly debated new law on the financing
  of non-governmental organisations in Russia.

  Putin's critics have accused Russia's intelligence services of using the
  spy scandal as a way of putting pressure on NGOs but supporters of the
  legislation say foreign spy agencies often use non-governmental groups for
  intelligence-gathering.
