For what it's worth, I had the same experience and would like to know what
happened to the wasabisystems list... 

Anyone out there know?

Kind sir:

As the subject says...  All of a sudden mail just stopped.

Figuring that I had, somehow, become unsubscribed from the list, I
tried to re-subscribe.  This resulted in an "Unknown list" message from
majordomo@wasabisystems...

Any ideas?  could assist please?  I know that you are not the list
owner, but you, at one time, seemed to be active on the list.

Regards,
Gregory Hicks
