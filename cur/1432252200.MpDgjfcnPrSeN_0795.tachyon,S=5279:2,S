Yes, a note about this appeared on this list a few weeks
ago, along with a Blacknet Automotive Division request
for these diag codes.

\begin{ethicsrant}
It is perfectly within the rights of an individual (or corp) to
retain trade secrets.  It is also within the rights of others to
reverse engineer these secrets particularly for interoperability
reasons.  These observations are not only based on
libertarian-ethical principles but US law history.

That's fine.

Were that true, that would NOT be fine.  It is not acceptable to
abuse the violence of the state (ie law) in this way --to deny
the ability to reverse engineer.

(As a hacker) Regrettable but fine.  "Potting the fucker in epoxy"
is their right.

So what?  Buy a car from someone else then.  The GNUmobile project?

>This is essentially 'Palladium for cars'.

The carmakers say this is for safety.  Perhaps this is as lame as the
political powergrabs justified fnord in the name of "national security".

Clearly, as engineers, we know that IFF the carmakers
documented what their employees know, then third-parties could
do as good a job.  But there is no obligation to document what you
sell.  Or make it easy for others to fix your stuff ---those stupid
proprietary screws used on some equiptment to keep you out
are not illegal.  But neither is defeating them.  Modulo your
warrantee, which is fair.

Of course, the State might well use the "safety" lever to open
the codes; or it might simply extend a tentacle of fascism
and require it for the nominal benefit of the sheeple.  Consider
if this behavior were applied more generally.

Anyway, PT is right on, this is right up our alley.
