1 out of 10 for knowledge of history.

I promise not to  mention the witch hunts, or the French & Italian
massacres of Protestants, or the aftermath of the Wars of religion, or
the Thirty Year's War or Louis XIVs campaigns in Germany, or the Turkish
massacres in Bulgaria & Armenia, or the slave trade (which certainly
killed millions) or the Spanish persecution and expulsion of the Jews
(whoops, that *was* the Inquisition, you already got that one)  if you
can tell me why the Tsarist pogroms of the late 19th century & the Black
Hand were neither evil nor "mass produced".
