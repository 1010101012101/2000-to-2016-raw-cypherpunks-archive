   Well that escalated quickly.

   Considering that my entire generation of hackers & cypherpunks is 
being eviscerated -- surveilled, investigated, their professional lives 
threatened, I don't really care about in-fighting.  When people stop 
being terrified of releasing their own research, maybe I will care about 
drama.  Life is too short and our work too important to hold grudges.

   I don't delude myself that anyone cares about my opinions, but I 
reserve the right to have them.  And while I too have disagreements with 
people in this space, there's little point in wasting energy on shouting 
about them on lists. =P  Spend time doing something worthwhile.

best,
Griffin Boyce
