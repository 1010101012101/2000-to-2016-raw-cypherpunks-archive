"A targeted registration and draft is "is strictly in the planning stage,"
said Flahavan, adding that "the whole thing is driven by what appears to be
the more pressing and relevant need today" -- the deficit in language and
computer experts."

Well, we could outsource 'em! I'd bet there's tons of Arabic-speakers 
willing to work on the cheap in countries such as Libya, Yemen, and 
Egypt...Bet there'd be a few Saudi nationals who'd be more than willing to 
ride alongside some of our boys in Iraq...
