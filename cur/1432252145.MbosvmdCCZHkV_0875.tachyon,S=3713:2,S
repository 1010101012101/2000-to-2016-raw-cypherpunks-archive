	Things like air and water quality in London being better than they 
have been since the late 1500s.

	Things like the inflation adjusted cost of metals, energy and food 
*AROUND THE WORLD* are lower than at any time in history (meaning that 
while they may be more expensive in real terms than last year, they are 
significantly lower than they were in my grandfathers time).

	Life is better for the vast majority of the world than it's ever been, 
largely due to Americas "excessive" consumption and desire  for cheaper 
goods.
