I think that's an important point too. Even moderately strong crypto is a 
good thing because it forces them to make choices about where they will 
devote their resources. Even though the Feds can "print money" at will, 
reality eventually bites even them in the ass. So in other words, even if 
they can print money they will eventually run out of paper.

That being the case, then using ANY crypto for popular apps is better than 
(and not equal to) nothing. Of course, the stronger the better, but those 
arguments that "they can break anything so why bother" are counterproductive 
at best and suspicious at worst.
