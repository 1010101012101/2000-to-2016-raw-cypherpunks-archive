No, as there is no "fund" that this money is in. Once taxes are paid 
in, the money has gone out to crack addicts, Halliburton, welfare 
whores (excuse me, "hoes"), foreign dictators like Mubarek and Sharon, 
and so on.

In fact, the estimated overall debt is something like $30-40 trillion. 
I've outlined how this number is arrived at a few times in the past. As 
there are about 100 million tax filers in the U.S.--the other 175 
million being children, spouses, prisoners, welfare recipients, illegal 
aliens, non-filers, etc.--a simple calculation shows the average 
indebtedness per tax filer is around $300,000 or more. This is far, far 
beyond what the average household owns in total. Because the U.S. has 
been "charging it" for the past 40 years. Quibblers will say we can 
reduce this indebtedness by selling off government-owned lands, which 
would be a good start. Or be taxing corporations more, but this still 
ends up with the individual tax filers, ultimately. Or by devaluing the 
dollar dramatically, which is the likeliest strategy the kleptocrats 
will follow, after gettting enough advance warning to get their own 
assets out of dollar-denominated vehicles.

So, you see, there IS NO FUND one can withdraw money from.

Anyone claiming new welfare benefits requires even more thefts from 
those still working.

Just because money was stolen from you doesn't give you any right to 
steal from me.
