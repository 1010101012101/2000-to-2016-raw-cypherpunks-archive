	Bill Gates is a questionable case, but there is no doubt that 
John Tesh should die.

	Most people just aren't vicious enough to want to *really* 
kill someone.

	Most.

	Case in point:

	There are some 80 million gun owners in this country. Some 
250+ million guns. Yesterday 79,999,900+ of those gun owners killed 
no one.

	It really is only the mentally disturbed that kill for any 
reason other than self defense or other *huge* cause.

	10 million dollars is, IMO a huge cause.
