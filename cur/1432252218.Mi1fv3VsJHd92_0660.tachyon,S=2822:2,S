Im a writer like your an anarchist.
I did read a funny story in PC authority,this systems consultant gets paid 
an exorbinate fee to test an array for redundancy.
The one and only test is a classic,first ask sweaty designer/contractor; 
"you have absolute faith that taking one server out will not bring down the 
lot?"
When the answer is ,"yes"
Go out to car and come back with large chainsaw,hold over individual 
machine and 'hey presto'
Maybe its not totally secure just yet.
True (magazine) story,I think by guy named 'honeyball.'

I got an offwire from 'pugsley',Ill ask him if you can see it if you 
like.As far as OSD goes,I see the gays are practising strategic melt so Im 
hoping sea sheperd might fill the breach.The lunar anti-abortion right are 
getting a head start!
