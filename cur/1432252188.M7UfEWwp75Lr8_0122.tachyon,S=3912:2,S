"US Government advisor Richard Clarke says software companies
should distribute patches that automatically update customers'
computers."

Experts reject call for automated virus protection

Anti-virus experts have rejected a US government call for
automated software patches to combat computer viruses.

Sophos says calls for software vendors to do more are out of touch
with typical users' requirements.

They point out that many customers would reject anything that
undermines their sovereignty over their computer systems.

US Government advisor Richard Clarke says software companies
should distribute patches that automatically update customers'
computers.

                                       But Sophos says the idea betrays
a lack of understanding of how
                                       anti-virus software already
operates.

                                       "Most anti-virus vendors give
their customers the option of
                                       automating updates, but some
businesses are reticent about
                                       outsourcing crucial security
measures," explained senior technology
                                       consultant Graham Cluley.

                                       "For peace of mind they'd rather
implement their own updates to
                                       ensure they work properly for
their environment."

                                       Mr Clarke's comments came amidst
a fresh virus outbreak. Goner is
                                       an email-disseminating worm that
purports to be a screensaver.
