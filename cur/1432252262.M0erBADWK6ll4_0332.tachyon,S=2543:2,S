What makes you think verislime or other CAs are authenticating?
You can't sue them, they are 0wn3d by a State (and so can
issue false certs, just like States issue false meatspace IDs), etc.

What makes you think that EG is a physical entity, if you haven't met

What makes you think that, given 1e10 humans, there are 1e10 identities?

Ie, why do you think there is a one-to-one mapping?

PKC is only as good as the means by which you obtain the public key.
A server, a CA, are all worthless.

The emperor has no clothes, get used to it.
