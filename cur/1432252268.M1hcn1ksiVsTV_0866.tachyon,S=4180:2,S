If there's any sane lesson that Congress should take away from the Enron 
political scandal (and this is assuredly both a corporate and political 
scandal), it is not that we need campaign finance reform—it is that we need 
federal spending reform. Want to get rid of corporate political corruption? 
Abolish corporate welfare so that Fortune 500 firms don't spend half their 
energy and public relations budgets farming Washington. With $100 billion 
of corporate loot divvied up by Congress every year, the wonder is that 
there aren't 100 Enrons out there, with tentacles into every law firm, 
media outlet and congressional office in the District of Columbia. And 
perhaps there are.
The one lesson I've learned from my 20-year experience in Washington is 
that corporate America is perhaps a bigger adversary to small government 
and the free market than even Tom Daschle. Republicans, and specifically 
the Bush administration—which, of course, had a particularly cozy 
relationship with Enron—could go a long way toward defusing the Enron 
crisis by calling for abolition of the Commerce Department, the 
Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank and other CEO feeding troughs. That'll probably 
happen the day the Olympics installs fair and impartial judges at skating 
events.
Whats this got to do with war?
SEE MWO's ANNALs of ENRON,it will all become clear.
