    The first person charged under CCAA, Hector Flores, was a
                       deliveryman for NotFauna.com. Two years ago,
while
                       carrying a heavy vase of flowers into the home of
a
                       paraplegic customer, he was squirted by one of
the
                       customer's kids with a water pistol. The customer
apologized
                       and Flores forgot about the matter, but
subsequently, when
                       the same child squirted a pizza-delivery man, who
reported
                       the incident, the ensuing investigation uncovered
the previous
                       assault on Flores. Flores was charged with child
abuse for
                       having failed to report the episode, which might
have
                       prevented the attack on the pizza deliverer.
Convicted and
                       sentenced to two years in a facility for child
molesters, Flores
                       appealed, arguing that the law referred only to
actual
                       firearms, not to purple water pistols. The court
ruled that
                       although the language of the statute read
"firearms" and not
                       "actual firearms," the prosecution had
nevertheless acted
                       reasonably in extending the state's school policy
of zero
                       tolerance to the home.

                       After his release, Flores will be required to
register as a child
                       abuser wherever he lives while serving his 19
years'
                       probation. The child will be returned to his
family later this
                       year when his parents have completed the state's
Violence
                       Begins in the Home crime-prevention program.
