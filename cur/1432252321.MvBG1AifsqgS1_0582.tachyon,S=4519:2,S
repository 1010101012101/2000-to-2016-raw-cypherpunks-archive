Microsoft, as a whole, is incompetent at security.  All
supposedly secure software coming out of Microsoft varies from
poor to worthless.  Does anyone doubt it?   They take standard
well known methods and make well known bungles in applying it and
customizing it.

We do not get to see much of the spook output.  What we have seen
in recent years is not good.

During world war II the government sucked up all the best people
from the open sector, and put them to work in the secret sector.
For example most of the words greatest scientists wound up hand
making nuclear weapons.   However, one would expect, with the
passage of time, that people who work in secret would suffer from
Parkinson's law, and this appears to be happening.

I would bet on it in the long run.  It is inherent in the nature
of government.  Without the market weeding out the unfit and
pressuring everyone for excellence, bureaucracies unavoidably
decay for well known reasons.

Microsoft produces crap security because most of their customers
do not know any better.  Therefore NSA will produce crap security
because their customers are forbidden to know any better.
