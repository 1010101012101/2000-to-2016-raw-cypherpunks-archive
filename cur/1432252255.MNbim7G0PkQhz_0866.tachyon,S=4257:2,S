It's all well and good to hear this coming from a Congressman but this
is a Republican Congressman who is using it as a opportunity to attack a
Democratic Administration : should we read anything into this statement
regarding some significant difference between the two parties in regards
privacy and 4th Ammendment issues? 

Hardly.
