It apparently already happens, the installation of governors on rental cars.

I rented a car at the Baltimore-Washington airport last summer and 
merrily got on the freeway (er, "parkway") connecting it with the 
Beltway. It was late at night, traffic was light, so I stepped on the 
gas.

It just ran out of speed at about 65. Couldn't get it to go any 
faster, even with the pedal to the floor.

Now it _could_ be that it was just a late American model, 
heavily-pollution-control-entangled econobox, but I've driven el 
cheapo Korean and Japanese models which had no problem reaching high 
speeds on straightaways.

I figured at the time that the rental cars had indeed been equipped 
with RPM governors.

I was only mildly annoyed and I didn't feel my safety was threatened, 
pace the above point about accelerating. Most traffic acceleration 
risks are at lower speeds, so a top-end speed governor isn't likely 
to pose a safety risk.
