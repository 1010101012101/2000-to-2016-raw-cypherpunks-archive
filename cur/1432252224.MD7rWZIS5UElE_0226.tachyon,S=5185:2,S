Subject: CDR: Re: re ICANN Should Approve More Top Level Domains


I agree with Judith on this.  Seeing the entire internet - instead of the
ICANN restricted internet is as simple as point click and reboot.

Further data is available at www.youcann.org and instructions are located
here http://www.youcann.org/instructions.html and include a link to a
downloadable program that fixes your dns to see the whole internet.

point, click, reboot - and astalavista ICANN.

regards
joe
