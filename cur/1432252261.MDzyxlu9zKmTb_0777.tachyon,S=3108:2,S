I was reading this article regarding the WA web site that published names,
addys and SSNs of police officers and noted that an "identity protection" /
"accountability legislation" bill for LEA is in the works for WA.

Is anybody aware of similar bills or lobbying efforts elsewhere?

Overheard: "In a separate development, a four-day uprising in a prison in
Cuiaba, located approximately 800 mi/1,280 km northwest of Sao Paulo ended
yesterday after inmates opposed to the uprising killed the rebellion
leaders."
