You need a certification authority.  Every one you deal with has to 
acknowledge whatever certification authority gave you your 
certificate.   Interaction with big public certification authorities 
is impractically painful for most users.  If you uses S/MIME, you 
need a Thawte or Verisign certificate, and the guy you are trying to 
work with is never going to get a Thawte or Verisign certificate.
