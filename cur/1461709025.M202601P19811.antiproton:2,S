Definitely: a high paywall, start at $1,000 a post, to cull the deadbeats.
That's in bullion, no bitshit. Mis-post and price doubles, then goes geometric
after 3. Your PINs are known.

Here's the post ticket line: Hettinga hosts a deep "FC" vault packed
with RL ransom goodies any deadbeat nation would genocide to
expropriate for ignorant spenders of cognitive capital aka FC-CC.

Now you know why only 200 Panama Papers files of 11,500,000
have been released. Robert's vault PIN is way off planet.
