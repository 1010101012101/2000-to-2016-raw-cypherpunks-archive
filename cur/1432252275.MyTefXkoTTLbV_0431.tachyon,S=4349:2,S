I knew the guys behind Fractal compression, but that's not what I was 
trying to do.  They looked for a higher-level order I was just looking to 
take advantage of local correlations and the ability to identify identical 
runs in the output of deterministic generators who's references could be 
expressed very efficiently (e.g., correlation coefficient/seed value, 
displacement) compared with the data being compressed.  Its a highly 
asymmetric approach so real-time applications were not considered.

IFS eventually became practical but they came from a time when proprietary 
solutions were king and missed the open standards revolution which powered 
JPG (which while generally as good at compression was open to improvement, 
well studied and not chained by patents).
