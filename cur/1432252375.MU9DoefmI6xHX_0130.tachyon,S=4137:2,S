How Australia is preparing for terrorism
"...Since the attacks on the US, Osama bin Laden has made two specific 
mentions of Australia.."
"...ASIO agents have been dispatched to recruit from Muslim communities and 
more than 30 suspect homes have been raided. Already ASIO has identified a 
small number of Australians who have received terrorist training with al 
Qaeda, apart from those already in US custody. Other terrorist groups have 
identified local supporters."
""Future terrorism could involve anything from chemical warfare to cyber 
terrorism,"
"Attorney-General Daryl Williams, who claims a meeting of national leaders 
in April clarified that situation, with the Commonwealth authorised to take 
control of national terrorist incidents.
The heavily amended anti-terrorism laws recently passed by the Senate have 
bolstered defences against terrorism, Williams says, with supporting or 
committing terrorism punishable by life imprisonment. He now wants Senate 
support for stalled legislation to boost ASIO's reach, including the power 
to detain and question suspects without charges or legal advice."
Fuck who need foreign terrorists.Still,on the bright side..."spot checks by 
the Department of Transport have shown it is possible for people to get 
through metal detectors at some airports while carrying knives."
