Hi Chris,
A couple of projects come to mind.

The Satellite Sentinel Project is using imagery collected by DigitalGlobe 
satellites to monitor war crimes in Sudan and South Sudan.  It might be 
worth reaching out to them to discuss their approach.  I believe Jonathan 
Hutson  
<http://www.enoughproject.org/content/jonathan-hutson-director-communications> 
[ @JonHutson <http://twitter.com/JonHutson> ] may be subscribed to this  
list.
http://satsentinel.org/

It also might be worthwhile to check in with the OpenRelief project to see 
what kind of progress they've made.  Although their focus is disaster 
relief, it seems like the sensor package they're working on could be 
adapted for other uses:
http://www.openrelief.org/

And a search turned up Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - East Africa, which  
appears to provide UAVs for sale or hire, though I couldn't identify their 
physical location.  They specifically advertise support for environmental 
monitoring and appear to have a fairly sophisticated offering including 
mission planning software:
