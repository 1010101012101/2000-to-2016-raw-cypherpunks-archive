#    Twenty years ago was when the "3081"/Sierra version of the 370
#    architecture was out. Not a small machine compared to others.

Twenty years ago a 370/115 was a 16-bitter.

#    When I was standing on a sidewalk in front of the federal courthouse on
#    Pennsylvania Ave (of Monicagate and Microsoft trial fame), a deputy U.S.
#    Marshal told me I could not take a photo of the courthouse.

For the first time, the inauguration was designated a "National Security Event."

Heh. Reno showed up on SNL tonight, sketch "Reno's Dance Party."

She burst through a "brick" wall to confront Will Ferrel, who was
impersonating her in a blue dress.

You could tell she was itching to dance...she was a shakin'.
