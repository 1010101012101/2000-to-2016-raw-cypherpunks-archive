This weekend I received three or more cell phone calls from 800-855-0000,
which said they were the AT&T Relay Service, which relays phone calls
from deaf people using TDD or TTY or now internet webform services.
They claimed to be a "Dr. Charles Ego" (or some name like that)
asking to confirm that I'd received his email, and asking for my email 
address.
I was a bit puzzled, because none of the deaf people I have known
over the years are doctors, and one of the two signing people
I know well was at dinner with me when the call arrived,
and they were calling like this was a business call,
but it was Sunday night before a US Monday holiday,
so they were probably calling from somewhere that it was Monday daytime.
The name sounded enough like the usual fraudulent Nigerian Email Scam,
so I asked what time zone he was in, and he replied 12:00 GMT,
which didn't make sense (either it's Atlantic Time, or he was just wrong.)

So I poked around the AT&T Relay Service web site,
and it sounds like we've got a new web-based interface to
free telephone relay service and the spammers have discovered
the potential for abusing it.   Sigh.

And it's got a privacy policy that sounds like it'll be
difficult to track down these callers.....
The web site says they deal with privacy issues by not storing call content,
though at first reading it doesn't really say whether they do or don't store
call record information like IP address, phone number, or
call duration, though since it's free that probably means it's
either government-subsidized or some other mandated program with
accounting requirements like that, or if they have an
"except for drugs or terrorism" requirement.
