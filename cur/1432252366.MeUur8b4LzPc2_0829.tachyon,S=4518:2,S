In a world were laws typically are many thousands of pages long, 
universal surveillance is a problem.

Laws and regulations have been expanding exponentially.  It is said, but 
is impossible to verify or falsify, that ever person with significant 
business interests commits around three felonies a day.

I get the impression that the rate of increase is itself increasing, 
which projects to a left singularity - infinite legislation in finite 
time in our near future, but I don't have the numbers to project when 
the singularity arrives.

Is there any way to find the total amount of legislation in each year?

It used to be that one could know how much regulation by sizing the 
federal register, but this is no longer the case.  We have already hit 
the event horizon of regulation, in that the federal register has ceased 
to have any meaning.  These days most regulations cannot be found in any 
well defined or meaningful place, and if they could be found it would 
not be much use, since current doctrine is that regulations are defeated 
by people merely obeying them, since this always leads to the law of 
unintended consequences, that mere obedience is a sneaky form of 
de-regulation.  Rather, those regulated should believe and have faith in 
the purposes for which the regulations were passed.  As was illustrated 
with the Bank of Beverly Hills, compliance with regulations no longer 
suffices: Holiness, faith, and zeal is required.  Ye shall not be saved 
by works, but by faith.  For Beverly Hills bank, it was insufficient to 
obey the regulators.  Their staff had to believe in the regulators.

We are close to reaching the same situation in legislation as we have 
already achieved in regulation, where legislation becomes a form of 
prayer, as regulation already has, so that the mere words on paper cease 
to have meaning or effect.
