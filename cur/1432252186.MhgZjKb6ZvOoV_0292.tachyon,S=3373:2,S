If 'you' knew that, nobody could tell from the comments. The general
cypherpunks view seems to be the PGP web-of-trust is sufficient (and they
are woefully wrong).

This is actualy one of the two key problems with PKC management,
authentication/verification. The other being scaling. The
authentication/verification problem itself has two branches. The first
being submitter/user authentication and the other being
protocol/implimentation verification.

As to scaling, I've been touting 'small network' approaches for years. It's 
interesting that Napster and it's ilk are just that. Couple this with a
universal namespace (ala Plan 9) and some service like LDAP and you might
have a usable system. Couple this with a cryptographicaly secure network
layer (this is another key management problem also) and 'indepenent' or
open source nameservers (for IP resolution, not to be confused with the
'working' namespace I mention above). 

The only thing I've seen that looks remotely workable is completely
distributed and open sourced. The problem is setting up the not-for-profit
namespace and key registries (assuming the problems above are resolved).
How should they be funded?

There is no real answer to any of them at the current time though.
