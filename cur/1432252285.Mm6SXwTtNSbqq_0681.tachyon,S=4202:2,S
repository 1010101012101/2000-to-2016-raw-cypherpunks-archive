I know RSA B-Safe stuff is made to fit onto cell phones and pagers.  They
also are the public key vendor for DOCSIS cable boxes.  Maybe they can help
you.  www.rsa.com

How small of footprint?  50K (presuming you mean in currency) isn't really
a measurement of footprint size to me. :)  Would something along the lines
of a Java iButton <URL:http://www.ibutton.com/> match your requirements?
It truly depends on what you need the device to be capable of...and I don't
just mean the crypto implementation but is this a device to be self-powered?
How do you need to interface with it?  Etc.

The device is a DCT2000 set-top box with very limited footprint. Since the
box needs to run a lot of other applications, 50K is the space that we would
like to spend on the security purpose. The platform supports C interface.
