MOVES TO BLOCK INFORMATION FROM PUBLIC GO TOO FAR

Issue: Information Freedom
[Editorial] Since Sept. 11, the government has been eager to limit the
public's access to certain kinds of information. The USAToday's editorial
staff argues that "Americans are being asked to give up their rights to
information, with no evidence that it presents any real risk." They cite
examples of recent government efforts to control what the public sees, such
as President Bush's attempt to cut back the number of lawmakers who would
receive intelligence briefings, to eight of 535 members, and the
disappearance of information from some government Web sites. USAToday
suggests that these moves violate the very spirit of freedom that America is
fighting for. "They risk obliterating the checks on government decisions
that come when lawmakers and the general public know what the administration
is doing...If Americans are to continue supporting the war, it will be
crucial for them to know their enemy and know of their government's
successes and failures."
