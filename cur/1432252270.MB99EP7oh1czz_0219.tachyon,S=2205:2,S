So, for those of us who worship science it looks like we're home free.  It 
seems that such a religious bent isn't too far out.  Both the recognized 
religions and scince fall within the academic category of philosophy.  Both 
attempt to explain the nature of the world around us.  Has there ever been 
a 'formal' attempt to legitimize science as a religion?
