Thanks for the bug report. We appreciate your help in fine-tuning the 
language in the verification emails of the beta test of the PGP Global 
Directory. We noticed this one, ourselves, and put out an improvement 
to it on Tuesday. Please check it over and see what you think of the 
improved version.

If you would like to send bug reports to us directly, please feel free 
to send them to beta@pgp.com. Cypherpunks and Cryptography are both 
inefficient ways to get them to us, as Cryptography waits for Perry to 
approve the post, and Cypherpunks waits for Bob Hettinga to forward it.

However, the Global Directory does not consolidate information from any 
other keyservers. It is a replacement for the old keyserver, 
keyserver.pgp.com, and will take over that venerable old server's job 
once beta test is concluded. We are, however, migrating a number of 
keys from the old keyserver to that one.

Think of the new keyserver as a mix between traditional keyservers, 
mailing list servers like mailman, and a robot CA. Its intent is to 
improve upon the older keyservers by giving some modicum of assurance 
that keys in it belong to someone, as well as allowing someones to 
recover from forgetting their passphrase.

	Jon
