Already litigated in the USA, with very strange results: for example, code 
printed on your T-Shirt is free speech, while the same code may be a 
munition if instantiated on a processor.  Money == spech (recent SCOTUS 
explosion of pro corporate diareaha). bits (for email) may be private, or 
not, depending on whether they are "at rest" or "in motion", etc... There 
are an unknown number of permutations, which leads to the inevitable 
realization that everything must be protected from governmental decisions 
as to whether any subset of bits is "free" or forbidden, by making the 
meaningful only to the entities (persons or corps) that have an actual 
right to know: encrypt *everything*, and only let those who you want to 
have access be able to decrypt them.

Too late in the US. And with Roberts being such a young guy, expect no 
changes for a very, *very*, long time.

Very bad idea.  Allowing the entire planet know your financial 
contributions [trail] will lock you out of some employers, lose your job 
with still other employers, act as a basis for reputational destruction of 
future candidates inder the right [or wrong] conditions, etc.

The problem I think you are looking to "solve" is *Corporate* 
anonymity/pseudonymity.  Won't happen under todays paradigm: the *fix* is 
to go back to separation of "natural persons" and "Corporate/chartered 
persons".  The two types of personhood were never designed to be ewuals, 
yet her we are. :-(

Obscurity as actual security isn't going to fly anymore (if it ever did).

You are describing the state of the world today, at least in *most* 
jurisdictions.  Hell, fully automated trading has had the effect of 
greying out their respective meta-transactions from most forensic 
accountants since the mid-80's, but only for routine audits.  If you know 
what youre looking for the meta is easy to see, and prove.

And this seems fair to you? Why would we want to penalize the excersize of 
privacy?????

First off, I liked H/C: we even had a local bank here that dealt in H/C!  
Secondly though, I think you need to re-examine the privacy implications 
of the systems you are advocating.
