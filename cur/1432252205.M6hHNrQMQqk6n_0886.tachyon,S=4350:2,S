No, I'm not talking about the spammers who were caught in maps, I'm
referring to the INNOCENTS who were caught in MAPS.  If the LEO community 
acted like MAPS does, there would have been armed revolution in the
streets *years ago*.

MAPS never gave a shit about facts, they cared only about their agenda -
no matter who got hurt in the way.

Fuckem.  Vixie is a netnazi who would do us all a favor if he just blew
what little brains he has left out of his left ear.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
