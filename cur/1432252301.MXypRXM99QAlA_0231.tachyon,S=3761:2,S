User-Agent: Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0.6 (Macintosh/20050716)

EFF has sued AT&T over its alleged participation in the NSA's
surveillance scheme:
http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-6033501.html

Complaint:
http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/att-complaint.pdf

BTW I think the ACLU's map (below) is intended to be more fanciful than
based on any confirmed participation by U.S. telecom or Internet companies.

The closest we've come to actual confirmation was a paragraph buried in
the middle of a Los Angeles Times article last month about AT&T,
mirrored here and cited in the EFF suit:
http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=122448

Am I missing something?

Declan,


Politechicals may be interested in a new ACLU white paper and
interactive map detailing  what is known and suspected about how the
NSA's illegal spying on Americans occurs and where the interceptions
are likely taking place..  The white paper is entitled "Eavesdropping
101: What Can the NSA Do?" It looks at the probable connections that
  the NSA has made to the U.S. civilian communications
infrastructure.  The map shows how the NSA's "surveillance
octopus"  likely entangles the country. We believe it is the
first effort to visually illustrate what is happening.

You can find both the white paper and the map at
<http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23989res20060131.html>http://www.aclu
