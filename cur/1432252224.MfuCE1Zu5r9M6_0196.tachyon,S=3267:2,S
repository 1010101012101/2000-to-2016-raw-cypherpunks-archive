  2. OMB to agencies: Get it right before you put it out
By Jason Peckenpaugh The Office of Management and Budget Wednesday issued 
its first-ever
guidelines to ensure information delivered by federal agencies-from
census data to weather forecasts-meets standards of quality and
integrity. The OMB guidelines require agencies to make information quality a
performance goal and to develop a review process to ensure the integrity
of information before it is released. Agencies must also develop their
own standards for information quality that conform to OMB's guidelines. 
Under the guidelines, citizens can ask for corrected versions of any
information that violates these guidelines, but OMB told agencies to
make certain the correction process does not bog down their operations. 
"Agencies, in making their determination of whether or not to correct
information, may reject claims made in bad faith or without
justification," said John Graham, administrator of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB. Full story:
