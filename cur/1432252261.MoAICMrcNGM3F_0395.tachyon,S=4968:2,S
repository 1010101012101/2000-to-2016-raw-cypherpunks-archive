Then you agree that their conditions aren't reasonable.

As to 'economic growth', that implies you have either the time or the
place to look for alternatives. These are not universal, especially in a
market where some parties act with intent to restrain other parties.

Read the first two para's of the DoI as to why this isn't as big an issue
as you might think, provided you get out early enough.

Yeah, like keeping them around just one more year so we can put just that 
much more in the treasury.

Historically dictators and such have not(!) acted to improve their
citizens lot in life, if the citizens get any improvement it's because
the powers that be recognize the situation and are hoping to stabilize it 
(so that their income streams are stabalized). They're not doing it for
the people, it's self-preservation.

No it isn't. It's about getting the fundamental government-corporate
rights and civil liberties infrastructure in place in these countries.
