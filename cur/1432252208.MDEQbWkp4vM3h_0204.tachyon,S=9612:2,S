 Global Media Network proudly presents REVIEW OF ONE OF THE TOP 
NEWS OF THIS MILLENNIUM:- BURGLAR WATCH-A STATE OF WIDESPREAD 
STINK, OPPORTUNISTIC & RAMPANT THIEVERY, PLAQUE, CHAOS, BARBARISM 
AND LAWLESS-A GLOBAL REPORT OF BREAK & ENTER,  THEFT, TREPASS, 
FRAUD, FABRICATION AND COLLUSION CONSPIRED BY VANCOUVER POLICE

ENACTMENT OF THE INCIDENTS [DETAILS PROVIDED BY THE VICTIM]:

On 6 June, 94. the victim went out at 2:30 p.m.  from his 
apartment. When he gone back at 2:37 p.m. he discovered that both 
his apartment and his bedroom were broken and entered. He 
discovered that his newly bought hi-fi components  (bought at A & 
B Sound) and forty CDs (costed CAD$2,000) were stolen from his 
bedroom.  When he reported the crimes to the police woman badge # 
9082, who admitted the fact of surveillance two years afterwards 
in 1996, she behaved very arrogant. She purposely hanged up the 
phone several times in order to aggravate him. 

Being alerted of constant harassment, out of suspicion, in 21 
September, 96, at 6:00 p.m.,  the victim confirmed with the same 
police woman badge # 9082 via 911 that the Vancouver police had 
placed the audio and video surveillance devices inside his 
apartment. She refused to remove them and asked him to remove 
them. The Vancouver police were very familiar with the 
environment inside the apartment. In other words, the Vancouver 
police specificially targeted at the victim's properties that 
were located at his bedroom and knew exactly when the residents 
inside left the apartment. When the residents left the apartment 
on 6 June 1994, at 2:30 p.m., the Vancouver police sneaked into 
his apartment, stolen his properties and left within a minutes.  
 

In July, 96, he called the Vancouver police in 320 Main Street, 
Vancouver, a male police who had sneaky remarks (about twenty 
something years old, caucasian) lied that the former chief 
constable Ray Canuel was in Atlanta, Georgia so that he could not 
handle the complaint. Afterwards, he sent a letter to Ray Canuel 
(deceased of cancer) in the same month without hearing any 
response. He then presented the complaint in person directly to 
the assistant to Ray Canuel. The assistant deceived him that the 
Vancouver police wouldl respond to his complaint three weeks 
later. The complaint aroused the police's revenge. Two polices 
without search and arrest warrant trespassed his apartment in 
Feb., 97. One caucasian police opened his complaint letter which 
was originally sealed without his consent and he was falsely 
arrested by the two polices. One of the police were a Chinese who 
were about 5"6, 160 lb., black and short hair. Another police 
were a caucasian who were about 6"2, gray and long hair whir 
covered his trim, gray-blue eyes, about 220 lb.. Both polices 
were thirty something years old. The latter one misrepresented 
and called himself as former Chief Constable Ray Canuel 
(deceased). The two polices committed trespass and false arrest. 

The fact that Vancouver police are morally corruptive makes no 
difference to his efforts. When the victim filed the complaint 
through other formal channels three years afterward, i.e. 1999, 
he received a fabricated letter from Sergeant Mike Bernard, 
Office of the Chief Constable, Internal Investigation Section, 
Vancouver Police Department dated 20 May, 99, falsifyinging that 
police badge #581 Dave Turpin, Tony Zanatta had conducted the 
investigations. Indeed, they never contacted him nor take any 
report. Given the Vancouver police are coercive that they collude 
with every party the victim seeks help from or affiliates with. 
When the victim booked an appointment with a security company, 
APC Security in Burnaby, B.C., to do a further sweep on his 
apartment, the Vancouver police colluded with the company not to 
show up at the appointment on 26 July, 99. Similar circumstances 
happened for Brian Brown & Associates INC, owner: Brian; 
operator: Laurie. Ph. (604) 2912121. The Vancouver police 
colluded with Brian and solicited him to defraud the victim 
debugging fees. During the appointment, Brian pretended in front 
of the victim that he was an outsider. Brian spent most of the 
time looking at the manuel. Most of all, Brian failed to provide 
a receipt upon request. Besides, on 6 Aug., 99, the Vancouver 
police called the property manager of Crosby Property Management 
Ltd. to follow him when he walked to the garden. The property 
manager purposely aggravated him and tried to fight with him. The 
property manager asked him to complain to the management (instead 
of the police complaint authorities) so that they can cover up 
the conspiracies....

Extreme and harsh measures must be deployed to curb these police 
crimes, brutalities and abuse. Getting the attention of 
legistative representatives is the first powerful step. The 
existing Canadian civil rights are not extensive enough to 
protect law abiding elements of the society. Additional chapters 
must be provided that detailly outlines whatever civil and 
criminal penalties that would incur to police(s) who commits 
crimes/ infringes rights of legal abiding citizens. 

Who could ask for more?! It is amazing what Vancouver tax payers 
will patronize. Vancouver polices are not what "civilians" meant 
to be. It is terribly sad to see that these people are called 
"law enforcement officials." The law of Canada is well 
established. It is, when really enforced, great! Bluntly, 
Vancouver polices were not even qualified as "servants", 
regarding them as "dogs" was done just as a courtesy. They are 
what can be found in garbage depot, sorry excuse for these people 
who are calling themselves "civil servants"! In contrast, there 
are several cities in North America, e.g. New York (during the 
11th Sept. horror attacks), where good examples of the real 
"civilians" can be found. 


Any feedback can be addressed to Chief Constable Terry Blythe of 
Vancouver Police Department at vpdlmail@vpd.city.vancouver.bc.ca. 
By the way, please join our global action together with ALL media 
and ALL political leaders ALL over the world that have received 
our attention.
