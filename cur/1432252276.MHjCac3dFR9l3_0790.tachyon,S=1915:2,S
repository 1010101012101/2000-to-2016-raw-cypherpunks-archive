ABC could have just as easily shipped an empty container from New York to 
Newark and claimed that government security failed.

To be a true test:

ABC should have involved some true al Qaeda operatives in order to see if US 
Security personnel would become aware of the shipment through intelligence 
efforts. 

or 

Shipped it using a forged "From:" address of an organization remotely linked 
with al Qaeda.

Of course then the FBI would have had something to REALLY visit with ABC 
about...

Another sheeple "scare" tatic by the media.
