Several people have suggested that I shouldn't edit these things
when I'm not awake; sorry about that :-)
See http://cryptorights.org/cypherpunks/2002/0112-SF.html for corrected 
announcement.

Anyway, the meeting is definitely Saturday, January 12, 2002,
at Stanford in the coffeehouse in Tresidder.
And we'll be planning for the February 16th meeting,
which will be during Codecon and just before RSA.
