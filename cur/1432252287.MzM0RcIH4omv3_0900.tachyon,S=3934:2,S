Monarchy, anarcho capitalism, anarcho piratism, military dictatorship. 
Or perhaps a republic with the franchise limited to property owning 
heads of households with good credit records.

Observe that police in wealthy neighborhoods are much better than police 
in poor neighborhoods.  Do you think that is the result of voting?

You presumably agree that the people's popular democracies were not all 
that democratic, because they made sure that everyone voted communist, 
and a party member always got elected, and it did not matter who got 
elected anyway since actual decisions were made elsewhere.

Well that is pretty much the system we have in the western democracies. 
  The actual decisions are made by the permanent and fireproof 
bureaucracy. If the elections come out wrong, they ignore the result and 
work to make sure the next elections come out right.
Brainwashing in school, population replacement, and if that does not 
work, the permanent and unelected government just ignores the outcome of 
the vote, as for example the various votes on affirmative action and 
immigration.

One demotic regime, turns out in practice to be remarkably similar to 
another demotic regime.
