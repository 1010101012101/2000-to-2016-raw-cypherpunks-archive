	I know the effort required:

	(1) Make a significant campaign donation to your local Sheriff or CLEO.
	(2) "Establish Residency" in one of the four or five counties 
where the local CLEO operates on a "Shall Issue" basis.
	(3) Become a reserve officer in a local PD that grants off-duty carry.

	I am morally opposed to (1) even if I did have the money. As 
to (2), I don't have the money. (3) is doable, and has other benefits 
(you get access to LEO only training classes at places like Gunsite, 
Thunder Ranch and AWT), but I don't have the time or money.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
