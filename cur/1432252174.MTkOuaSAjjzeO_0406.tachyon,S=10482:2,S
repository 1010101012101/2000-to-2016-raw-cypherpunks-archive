True. But the state of affairs right now is that people are massively u=
sing=20
Skype. So even not-so-well implemented free-software crypto peer-to-pee=
r=20
audio-video and IM app is a step-up (as long as it's not being sold as =

And I would not call Tox snakeoil mainly because snakeoil salesmen *ign=

*trying* to get things working and properly implemented, as far as I ca=
n see.

So there's a huge difference in (perceived? apparent? true?) intentions=
.

It's 7 pages, hardly a "white paper", and the Crypto section is about 6=
 lines.=20
It's a stub, but it does contain *some* info.

Yeah, and I stand by my "still better than Skype, and no intentional na=

Yes. But now we're discussing the proto and the implementation, so I as=
sume we=20
moved forward from the "is it snakeoil" question. At least I hope so.

I'll take the seatbelts, though. I'm fine with making the attacker spen=

more time and resources if they want to get me. There are no bulletproo=

solutions anyway.

And the point here is... what exactly? "Don't use encryption, because i=
t=20
*might* be broken one day?"

And that changes... what exactly? This affects *any and all* desktop-us=
able=20
security solutions, so let's just assume that this is the baseline we h=

work with and assess the solutions on their own merits, eh?
