Hello

 I was trying to find some old references I used to have concerning an idea men tioned in sci.crypt way back.

 It was Phil Zimmermann I think who mentioned something about a possibly new idea for a new public key scheme. He called it "The cryptographic uses of polygonal sequences" and is found here I think: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=12044%40ncar.ucar.edu&oe=UTF-8&output=gplain

thanks
