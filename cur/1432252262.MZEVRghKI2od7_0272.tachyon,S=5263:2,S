.01 Summit is set for January 11, 2001 at the Austin Music Hall <BR>
in the heart of downtown Austin, Texas. It's going to be fast and <BR>

<BR>
The 360.01 Summit, the third in a series of annual conferences for <BR>=

high-level executives in Austin, was founded in 1998 by civic <BR>
entrepreneurs as a non-profit, grassroots endeavor. The 360 Summit <BR>=

brings together the top echelon of Austin's new economy with community =
<BR>
and regional leaders to enhance and strengthen Austin's technology <BR>=

community, to maintain Austin's quality of life, to focus on the areas =
<BR>
that need improvement and to assign responsibility for improving them.<=
BR>
As hoped, the 360 Summit is serving as an ongoing catalyst to affect <B=
R>
change, and the resulting outcome has been an exponential amount of <BR=
>
continuing dialogue and action at the highest levels of both industry <=
BR>
and community. <BR>
