   dnaInfo (Jan 11) - "NYPD Eyeing Drones to Monitor Crowds":

     Drones might eventually be used for surveillance in New York City,
     Police Commissioner Ray Kelly revealed Thursday.
     Kelly said the eyes in the sky -- which have worried civil rights
     activists -- could prove useful when sizing-up demonstrations,
     adding to an NYPD arsenal that already includes 3,000 cameras and
     high-powered anti-aircraft rifles that can shoot down planes.
     "We're looking into it," Kelly told an audience during a rare public
     interview at the 92nd Street Y Thursday night. "Anything that helps
     us."
     Kelly noted that drones are widely used in law enforcement,
     especially along the border.
     But New York presents challenges.
     "There's a lot of air traffic," he noted. As a result, "The only
     thing we would do is maybe use the cheap $250 ones to take a look
     and see the size of the demonstration or something along those
     lines."
     Kelly noted that a drones program is not being actively pursued at
     this time.
