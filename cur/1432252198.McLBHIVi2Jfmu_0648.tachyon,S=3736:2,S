I would like to announce the "secret-admirers" mail list.

The "secret-admirers" list is intended to function in a manner similar
to the well-known Usenet newsgroup "alt.anonymous.messages".  This
newsgroup serves as a dead drop for communications in which the recipient
wishes to remain unknown.

While access to a Usenet news server is unavailable in many environments, 
the ubiquity and flexibility of e-mail may be advantageous for the
following reasons:

- Penetration:  More people having access to (pseudo|ano)nymizing tools 
                is generally a good thing.
- Pool Size:    Higher utilization of the message pool may frustrate
                traffic analysis.  The list may be gatewayed back into
                alt.anonymous.messages or vice versa.  CDR-like
                nodes for redistribution may be established to reduce
                load on individual nodes.
- Filtering:    E-mail filtering tools are widely available, allowing
                recipients to draw only pertinent messages from the
                pool by filtering on tokens which have been negotiated
                out-of-band or by the public key to which a message has
                been encrypted.

The mail list is unmoderated and accepts messages from any submitter.
Submissions may be sent to "secret-admirers@minder.net" or
"sa@minder.net".

TO SUBSCRIBE to the list, send a message with "subscribe secret-admirers"
in the body to majordomo@minder.net.  The more subscribers, the better,
even if procmail just sends it to /dev/null.

TO UNSUBSCRIBE from the list, send a message with "unsubscribe
secret-admirers" to majordomo@minder.net.

A digest of this list is available.  This list is not currently archived.

Thanks,

-Brian
