The alternative being a likelyhood of spending twenty years
in prison for something he did not do.  The fact that he
could plea bargain it down to three years is pretty good
evidence that the prosecution had no real case.

During the recovered memory hysteria, lots of clearly
innocent people confessed to raping their children.  The
prosecution in those cases was prepared to agree to almost
anything that involved a confession, rather than actually go
to court, and use any measures, including horrific criminal
threats against people's children, to force a confession.
Once a few cases actually did go to court, the scam was
exposed, and suddenly people stopped recovering memories.  As
the prosecutor's fear of trials became more and more obvious,
the plea bargains became more and more absurd.  Typically
someone would admit to extraordinary and hideous crimes
against their own children, retain custody, and have to pay a
large sum to the "therapists" who had obtained the evidence.
