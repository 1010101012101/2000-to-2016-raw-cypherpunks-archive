I just got back from Microsoft's 25th holiday party at Les Halles on 
Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a tremendous change from what I remember about 
the '97 holiday party at the same place: Better food, much larger room, 
and, as you'd expect many more people. And no, Judge Jackson and Joel Klein 
weren't invited.

As a service to you, dear readers, I've put some snapshots from the party 
up at:

I've finally scanned in a subset of the slides I took over the summer. A 
list is at:
