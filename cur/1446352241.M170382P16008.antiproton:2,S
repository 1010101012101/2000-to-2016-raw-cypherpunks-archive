fair enough. my assertion relies on the fact that conflict is
destructive in some manner, and cooperation is productive in some
manner.

sometimes, you must defeat bad ideas for the good to thrive:
 this is the essence of our age: competition for survival of the fittest.
yet there is a limit to what competition can achieve.

---

consider that competition can never reach a solution at which full
cooperation will arrive. thus, if competition defines our current age,
which leads to resource exhaustion,

cooperation leads to abundance for all, given sufficient technology,
and a better age above our cruel origins.

---

this is the great divide:

do we carry on with cruelty?

or do we strive for cooperation?

it is an ideal: a state of society in educated awareness and cohesion,
without centralized authority, working toward a collective best end.

it is globally optimal because there is only cooperation. no
destruction competition.

by definition, the efforts of the losers are "waste".

bingo. the crux!

a globally cooperative society would chose this, because it is best
for all, which is best for you. (and not in a "I'm going to kill you,
to save humanity" triviality sense.)

we're getting at the meat of the argument, which is a system and
technology and society which leverages technology in a productive
manner - rational anarchy - instead of a destructive manner - AP
selective killing.

i am aiming for something better.

i don't expect to convince anyone until the argument is formed. i also
reserve the right to proclaim that better options exist.

this is my beef with AP: that we may see it a solution, in near term,
missing a greener pasture at the distance...
