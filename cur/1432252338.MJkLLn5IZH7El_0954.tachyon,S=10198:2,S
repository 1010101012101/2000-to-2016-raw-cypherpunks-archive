interesting how little the constitution is functioning

they do not leak information - not that i am aware of anyway - do you know
of an instance? this is shocking that they are protected basically with
immunity BUT it does say "treason, felony and breech of peace" so anything
could be thrown in those bags - they are effectively gagged
