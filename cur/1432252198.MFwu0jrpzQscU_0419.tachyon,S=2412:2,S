If I don't remember incorrectly, they said something about identifying him
by DNA testing. But it wasn't widely quoted in the mainstream news. So
even if it really is him - they may still claim he isn't the real McCoy if
the insurgency won't stop.

The timing is definitely weird. Too soon before the Elections.

But there is still the backup, the Lost TV Star, also known as Ossama;
whether They intend to announce capturing him, or whether he will be
claimed responsible for Something Scary in a psyops attempt to make the
voters more susceptible to the beat of the Homeland Security drums.
