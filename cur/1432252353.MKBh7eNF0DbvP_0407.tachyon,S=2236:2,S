AUK denizens have lots and lots of credibility, and even though I don't
sell shit on eBay, I suppose I should be worried about being mistaken for

My detractors are strangely unwilling to state their 'beef' with any
significant degree of specificity.  Rather, they typically prefer to
employ misdirection.  I can't seem to wrap my head around their
motivations, but I do have a tentative hypothesis -- which I will spare
discussing on the list in the spirit of conserving the existing signal to
noise ratio.
