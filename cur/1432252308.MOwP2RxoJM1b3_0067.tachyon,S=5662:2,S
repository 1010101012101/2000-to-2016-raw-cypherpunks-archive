In honor of its 10th Anniversary of defending civil liberties online, EFF
presents a series of monthly meetings to address important issues where
technology and policy collide. These meetings, entitled "BayFF,"
kicked off on July 10th and will continue throughout the year. The upcoming
BayFF features famed cryptographer Whitfield Diffie and MEconomy's Master of
Secrets, Dave Del Torto. They will help us celebrate the RSA patent's
expiration on September 20th, 2000. How will these changes effect the public
at large? What are the benefits? Are there any drawbacks?

Whitfield Diffie, who holds the position of Distinguished Engineer at Sun
Microsystems, is best known for his 1975 discovery of the concept of public
key cryptography, for which he was awarded a Doctorate in Technical Sciences
(Honoris Causa) by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1992. Diffie
received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1965.

For a dozen years prior to assuming his present position in 1991, Diffie was
Manager of Secure Systems Research for Northern Telecom, functioning as the
center of expertise in advanced security technologies throughout the
corporation. Since 1993, Diffie has worked largely in public policy, in the
area of cryptography.

Dave Del Torto's career in Internet privacy and security started in
the late 1980s at the University of California at Berkeley, where he
was one of the original "Cypherpunks." He joined Pretty Good Privacy
Inc. (PGP) as a founding employee in 1996, and in 1997 was part of
the four-man team that published the entire PGP source code in 13
paper volumes, which resulted in the first legal international PGP
freeware (exports of 128-bit crypto have since been greatly deregulated).

He currently serves as the Executive Director of the CryptoRights Foundation
(a human rights security organization) and is the Chief Security Officer of
MEconomy, Inc., a privacy infomediary company based in San Francisco.
