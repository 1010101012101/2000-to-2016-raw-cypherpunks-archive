Yes and no.  The users aren't all that anonymous, or they wouldn't need
anonymous technologies, would they?  The remailer network sees where
this message originates.  If you use Zero Knowledge software, their
network knows exactly who is using it at any time.  If a digital cash
bank came into existence, payments transferred into the digital system
from outside would largely be from identified sources.

Nevertheless it's true that the operators would probably not find it
cost effective to try to identify every single customer.  (Although ZKS
will cancel your nym if you spam with it.)

The real issue is the clause above about "market and sell".  This was
the original point raised by Tim May: what markets do we select?
His whiteboard exercise teaches that you need to identify, select and
target particular markets which make sense.  And if you care about the
world you are creating, that's where the moral issue comes in.

Nonsense.  Most participants in this forum DO share common philosophical
goals: the preservation and enhancement of individual freedom via
technological means.  This is our common heritage.  People make moral
judgements every single day on this list based on exactly this framework.
And it is this moral view which tells us that bin Laden and his terrorist
groups are not the market which we should target in order to advance
these goals.

No, probably not.  However the world seems strangely short of virtuous
freedom fighters right now.  In fact "freedom fighters" are probably not
an appropriate target market for cypherpunks.  They may be well funded
but most of them are wedded to violence.  If they get into power they're
not going to make things any better.  James Donald made this point: few
countries are undergoing true popular revolutions.

It would be better to target technologies that would benefit groups
where there is a large, oppressed minority, people who just want to be
left alone.  Unfortunately, almost by definition, oppressed minorities
tend to be poor.  So it is a hard problem to do this profitably.

It's true that this does not directly impact the design.  But we can't
ignore the question, is this a market we want to pursue.  For example,
there are any number of papers on key escrow systems, or "fair" electronic
cash (where only the government can trace it).  Legitimate businesses
might well be willing to use such systems.  So there is profit to be made,
all the more profit since the government is less likely to hassle you.
Would you say that discussions of such technologies would and should be
encouraged on the cypherpunks list?  That it doesn't matter whether this
helps us in or long-term goal or not?

Surely not.  Morality plays a part in everything we do.  We have goals
in common.  We should structure our efforts so that they are in accordance
with our highest goals.  Having principles is nothing to be ashamed of.
We all have them, and we should be proud of that.
