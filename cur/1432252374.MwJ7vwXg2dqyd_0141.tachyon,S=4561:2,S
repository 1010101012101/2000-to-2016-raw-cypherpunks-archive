Which was never it's intent outside of interstate and international
commerce. There is a reason that there is no mention of commercial
representation in the Constitution, in a government of the people, for the
people, and by the people there are no businesses. They aren't people.

Business exists to empower people to develop governments which allow them
to attain their goals and dreams. Neither government or business is an
ends in and of itself.

With respect to Gibson, you should re-read his work then. There is
government (e.g. Turing Police). Also, who originaly built the hovercraft
or robots at Dog Solitude?

The point of Gibson's work is that corporations and government are the
primary corruptors of society.

"the government' is a group of people...to rephrase,

"The group of people we delegate decision making, problem resolution, and
enforcement thereof to does far more to control us (and just generally
piss in our rice crispies) than corporations."

And this surprises whom?

Then again, what are corporations? A group of people who delegate decision
making, problem resolution, and enforcement thereof with respect to profit
making.

It means little, when we get right down to it, so say that one group of
people have a larger influence over us than another. The real point is why
we delegate that authority in that manner.

Of the people, by the people, and for the people after all assumes that
there is A people. A coherent population that respects the ideals of the
American democratic experiment. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people
(including those who enact those ideals) are ignorant [1] of those ideals.
