Still, I prefer to land in fail less soon; maybe in the meantime somebo=

*does* find a perfect solution I can switch to? For the time being it s=
till=20
makes sense to make sure I fail "the least soon" as I can.

Well, "criticism" maybe, but then again should you be busy building you=
r=20
perfect solution from ground up, instead of criticising other people's=20=

temporary solutions today? ;)

Ah, yes. There we are. :)

There will always be different approaches to such things. Sometimes it =
*does*=20
make sense to wait for the perfect solution; sometimes it *does* make s=
ense to=20
use harm reduction techniques. The demarcation line is *not* clear and =
depends=20
heavily on circumstances.

Hence, throwing any incomplete solution out just because it's incomplet=
e,=20
without looking at what a particular threat model is and if maybe, just=
 maybe,=20
it can lower the threat level to people that would be otherwise complet=
ely=20
exposed, is disingenuous.
