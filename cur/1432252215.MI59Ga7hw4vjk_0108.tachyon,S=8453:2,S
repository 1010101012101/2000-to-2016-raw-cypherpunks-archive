Digitally signed information is not a public good because... some
eurosocialist wanker wants me to use his second-hand definitions from
some French eurosocialist rag (Le Monde Diplomatique) in some
combination on-line open-book bluebook exam and pissing contest?

Give me a break, AAA. Hell, I forwarded that exact article to the dbs
not list six weeks ago, and I deliberately *didn't* use it here
because the, forgive me, eurosocialist wanker who wrote it didn't
define a public good, he defined what it wasn't, and, furthermore, it
did not discuss digital copies, the exact things that are *not*
covered by his definitions, or at least, his, and your, by extension,
implicit statist conclusions about those definitions.


In pulling your pud off in the corner of the argument about meatspace
definitions that don't apply to digital goods and information, you're
missing the point. Heck, you'll be trotting out the tragedy of the
commons pretty soon, won't you. Guess what, AAA? On the net there
*is* no commons. None at all. It's all private goods, even when the
*state* pays for it.


Nonetheless, in the spirit of your cherished double-negative
non-definition of public good, and of statist pud pullers everywhere,
let's look at the world in your own terms, shall we. Bash to fit,
paint to hide, as they said in Detroit in the early 1970's

"Rival" means that only one person can own something at once. That,
technically, is the case with anything digitable. My copy
(particularly if it's encrypted and no one else has the key) of a
picture of Hillary Clinton spanking Bill with a bullwhip is, for all
intents and purposes as "rival" as if you had bought it as part of a
magazine and stuffed it under you bed for night-time flashlight
assignations. Only you can see that particular copy, it costs you
money to keep that copy on the hard drive in terms of electricity and
amortized rust-space on the platter, and it cost you money, in
bandwidth, if nothing else, to download that picture onto your hard
drive. When the value of empty hard drive space exceeds the value of
you drooling at Hillary in her leather corset, crotchless fishnets,
bowtie, and stilleto heels flogging Bill on his
hammer-and-sickle-tattoed behind, you delete the picture.

When you delete it, guess what that makes it? Excludable. Nobody can
have those particular bits on on your hard drive.

Excludable, if you want to go back to your eurosocialst wanker Le
Monde Diplomatique definition, means that when you've used it, it's
useless to anyone else. You've deleted it, right? Only one person can
have something at a time. In the case of an encrypted bit of
information, nobody but *you* can decrypt that data and use it. The
fact that it's an exact *copy* of something has no bearing on that
fact. It is, in fact, excludable.

It's price, however, is very, very, small, however, but just because
it's cheap doesn't mean that you can't do transactions that small.
Especially with some more cryptography, like a streaming cash
protocol, or Chaum's blind signatures, for larger transactions.


Which, idiot, was my point. If you actually went out an *thought*
about what I said, instead of went out looking for appeals to
authority to hit me over head with you'd have figured it out by now.
Hell, if you'd go read some econ and finance, instead of quoting
sorry statist french rags at me, you'd have figured it out
*yourself*.

Now, where were we... Yes. There's this bit of drivel:


> Right, I'll do that as soon as you learn to spell dirigistes.
> There's nothing like using French incorrectly to show someone up as
> a pretentious jackass.

Touchi mon pidant, touchi...

I seem to be guilty of making an innocent spelling error transcribing
a (semantically accurate, even if it didn't pass your spell checker,
just like pidant won't :-)) quote from Hayek. Misspelling, of course,
is quite literally a crime in France, which, among other things, is
why I'd never want to live there. :-).

I'm also guilty of being an American, which, as the old joke goes, is
the definition of monolingual.

Notice, however, we're having this discussion in *my* native
language, bucko, not *yours*, what*ever* that is.

In honor of your first spelling flame on cypherpunks, I've trotted
out another Hayek quote, below. See if you can find anything wrong
with *that*. If you find something, let me know, and I'll send you,
free of charge, *my* copy of Hillary in crotchless fishnets beating
Bill's candy-apple-red Internationale behind.

If I haven't deleted it, already.

Sheesh.

Cheers,
RAH
