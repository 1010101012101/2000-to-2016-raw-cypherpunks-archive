You know, I hope it passes.  No, I haven't taken leave of my senses.
I've just had it up to *here* with gradualism.  I'm really reaching the
point of morbid curiosity to see exactly what the sheeple will tolerate.

I know the constitution is practically dead anyway, but just how much
abuse can the sheeple take before they wake up?

Maybe making links to football, "professional wrestling" and Jerry Springer
websites can be made illegal because of their "violent" content.  Now
that would get their attention.

While you are at it make firearm ownership completely illegal.  I know that
will get someone's attention.

A friend of mine in college said that his job in life was to do everything
he could to increase entropy.  I didn't understand what why he chose that 
path. I do now.

The United States is sick.  Intoxicated on its own power, it has a 
serious case of the the bed spins.  Sometimes when you are that drunk
the quickest way to solve the problem is to stick your fingers down
your throat and heave.

The only reason gradualism works is because it operates below the
noise floor.  The noise floor in this country is full bellies and
unlimited entertainment.  Bread and circuses.

Decrease the noise floor and increase the rate of change.

I think I'll be voting democrat this season.
