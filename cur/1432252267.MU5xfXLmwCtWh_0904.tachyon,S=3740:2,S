If a large set of content providers adopt, as a cartel, a specific, single 
form of smart contract that requires the same specific form of hardware 
that they approve, and such adoption freezes out non-approved hardware from 
maintaining commercial scale, then questions of monopoly and collusion 
arise, and the question of greed seems to shine strongest on the cartel, in 
my view.

Regardless, to look at the entertainment industry and cypherpunks as a 
group, some might suspect the greater greed is not among the cypherpunks. 
The largest single cost was distribution. Digital communications can make 
that essentially free. When may we expect a price reduction that parallels 
the cost reduction? Or are they greedy?
