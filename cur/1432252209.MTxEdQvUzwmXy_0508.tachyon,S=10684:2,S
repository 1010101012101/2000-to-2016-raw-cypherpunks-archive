The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to

milestones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Personal Gateway from any ce||ular or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|oba| sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
