That's a bit insufficient and some points clearly outdated, see below.

You don't need pdnsd,ttdnsd,polipo. Vidalia is a nice optional graphical
user interface.

Someone else has to answer here.

You're on the wrong path. Don't use polipo / Firefox etc. anymore,
unless you want to stay out from all other Tor users. Use Tor Browser.
Details:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers

You don't need iptables for that. Tor is running on a Gateway. Tor
Browser without Tor/Vidalia started (patched startup script) is running
on another machine. (Which we call Workstation.)

Tor Button SOCKS Host: gateway IP, port: reserve one SocksPort in torrc
on Gateway exclusively for Tor Browser. Add some extra SocksPorts for
other applications. (stream isolation)

> DNS and firewall
> =================

You don't need ttdnsd. I recommend using one SocksPorts per most, if not
all applications. If you still want some remaining traffic fallback you
can use Tor's excellent Dns- and TransPorts.

> 
> [Q] How can I enforce all udp to go through local DNS port and which one 53 or 8853 ?

For a "fetch remaining DNS traffic and route through Tor iptables rule"
have a look at
https://github.com/adrelanos/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_gateway/usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall
and search for "dns".

You probable mess up there figuring out what is lan traffic for real and
what not. I strongly recommend the Tor-only box to have no local lan
traffic.

> port 80/443 should go through poliop port 8118,
> all dns query should go through local 53 ( or 8853 ? ) port

Like said before, forget about that plan. Don't use polipo.

You can do it with virtual machines and/or physical isolation.
