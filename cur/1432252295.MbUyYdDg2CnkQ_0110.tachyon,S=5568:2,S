Worldwide Caution Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman

July 1, 2002

This Worldwide Caution supersedes the previous Worldwide Caution of March
17, 2002 to alert Americans to the need to remain vigilant during the
upcoming summer season and to remind them of the continuing threat of
terrorist actions which may target civilians and include suicide operations.
This Worldwide Caution expires on October 1, 2002.

The U.S. Government continues to receive credible indications that extremist
individuals are planning additional terrorist actions against U.S.
interests.  Such actions may be imminent and include suicide operations.  We
have no further information on specific targets, timing or method of attack.
We remind American citizens to remain vigilant with regard to their personal
security and to exercise caution.

Terrorist groups do not distinguish between official and civilian targets.
Recent attacks on worshippers at a church and synagogue underline the
growing possibility that as security is increased at official U.S.
facilities, terrorists and their sympathizers will seek softer targets.
These may include facilities where Americans are generally known to
congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools
or outdoor recreation events.  Americans should increase their security
awareness when they are at such locations, avoid them, or switch to other
locations where Americans in large numbers generally do not congregate.
American citizens may be targeted for kidnapping.

U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a heightened state of alert.
These facilities may temporarily close or suspend public services from time
to time to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy.  In those
instances, U.S. Embassies and Consulates will make every effort to provide
emergency services to American citizens.  Americans are urged to monitor the
local news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy or
Consulate.

As the Department continues to develop information on any potential security
threats to Americans overseas, it will share with them credible threat
information through its Consular Information Program documents.  These
documents are available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In
addition to information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded
information by calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive information by
automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from their fax machine.
