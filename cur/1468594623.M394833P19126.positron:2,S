Does anyone want a keybase invite? They just granted me 15 more.

Up till now its been a basically useless service (IMO), although the new 
keybase filesystem feature actually looks interesting....

  Dear nixen,

  CHRIS [1] (CHRIS@CHRISCOYNE.COM) just granted you 15 more Keybase
invitations, which you can send to friends. Please use them wisely! The
signup queue is > 25,000 people long right now, and this bypasses the
line entirely.

  There are now TWO WAYS to invite people:

  1. THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. Use the tab on the top of the website [2].

  2. BY SHARING ENCRYPTED FILES in the Keybase filesystem [3]. Just drop
files in a folder with you and _username@service_, such as
/KEYBASE/PRIVATE/NIXEN,SOMEONE@TWITTER/. That actually works. Real
end-to-end encryption. A popup window will arise, like the godhead at
dawn, and tell you what happens next. That is our prophesy.

  _Either way, you're now invited to play with the Keybase filesystem.
Make sure to run the latest Keybase [4] app._

  Thanks,
Keybase
