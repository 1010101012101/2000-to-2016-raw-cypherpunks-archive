  It's a no, which sure seems to be your answer to my first question.

   I've said so very little here, but I do believe everything I've 
"said."  I'm still at a loss as to how what little I've said (written) 
here would allow any reasonable person to start assuming or even 
guessing that I use binoculars frequently and that I must be some sort 
of "FED."  In fact, I don't think a responable person could assume that, 
but then, from what I've seen of this forum so far, it's set up for 
venting obnoxious political diatribes based on dumb/paranoid assumptions 
('He made an unfavorable, on-point response to John Young, therefore, 
he's probably a FED!') & guesses, not reasonable, intellectual 
discourse.  Your 'Nightwatch' speculation is rather amusing too.  I 
won't humiliate & confuse you with the truth.


   Thanks for the dance!  It was....educational, but now I'm bored of 
going in circles.  :)
