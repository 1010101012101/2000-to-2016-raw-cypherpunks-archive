I have. I've been telephoned by people who used Internet telephony for 
part of the long-haul, reaching a local line at my end. Sounded slightly 
tinny, but was OK.

And a friend of mine here in California routinely calls his relatives in 
Chicago over such a link. They can talk for hours at no cost to him.

And there was at least one meeting of the Cypherpunks, in around 1993, 
where three scattered sites (Mountain View, Northern Virginia, 
Boston/Cambridge) were linked with an "M-bone" voice-over-Internet 
conference call. Better yet, DES-encrypted. That was 8 years ago.
