Well, I suspect they do a lot more before inspection, and use a statistical 
model to trigger whether the actually grab and backhaul any piece of 
traffic.

"Obviously", Source and destination country will matter, then within the US 
source and destination IP address (eg, knock into low-risk bucket if both 
source and destination IP correspond to Citigroup, even if one IP is within 
Saudi)...application is obviously going to matter, presence of crypto (and 
possible "crypto depth") and all the way up to L7 including key words.

Clearly, this policy is going to be risk-model driven and will undergo 
periodic changes (implying too that NSA has their own LAN by which they 
download new policies remotely into the Narus boxes). It would be "nice" too 
if their models fill up their available backhauling bandwidth.

Now that just determines what traffic gets backhauled. It's a big vacuum 
cleaner that grabs as much as they can within requiring that they build a 
completely duplicate optical network. After that the traffic gets pulled 
into the Beltway (most likely) where further models probably determine 
whether the traffic gets stored, read by humans "now", or whatever.

Note that by this time having a human actually bother to "read" an email or 
whatever is not necessarily important, even if it's encrypted.

What this means (to your point) is that merely building better crypto is 
only one axis to protect your privacy. If your communication gets as far as 
the Beltway and human examiners (or possibly gets shot down to their 
subterranean cracking farm) then you're already "of interest". With good 
enough crypto it's -possible- that you can thwart their attempts to actually 
read your email, and that's good because it forces them to decide whether 
they want to expend the big $$$ and risk exposure for a field operation.

But the other axis is statistical (as you point out). It's far better to 
never get caught in the NSA driftnets in the first place. This means stego, 
this means P2P (hum...what if I had a P2P video of a document I wanted to 
transmit...NSA wouldn't be able to read that document, right?) this means 
(somehow) encouraging more crypto in more places so your traffic doesn't 
stick out.
