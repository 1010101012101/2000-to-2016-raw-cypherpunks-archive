No kidding.  With any crypto-quality hash, I can produce statistically
perfectly uniformly distributed
pseudorandom data from *successive integers*.

The von neumann whitener does let

Johnny's whitener removes a particular kind of bias but does not reduce
other
kinds of regularity at all.

Whitening don't mean squat for entropy.  (Perhaps you can think of it as

spread-spectrum for regularity, if the whitener isn't crypto-secure.)

Dataset size is irrelevent except for detectability,
you need more samples to be sure that nuances you see are there.

You MUST use some "hardware" (analog) input, and you SHOULD
use whitening on the output, and most probably should do other
operations in between
(mixing partially unbiassed but imperfect input with a pool, for
instance).
