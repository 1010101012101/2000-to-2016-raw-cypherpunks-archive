Okay, majordomo at the node I subscribed to still lists me when 
I do a "who cypherpunks", but I haven't recieved any messages 
from cpunx for 3 days - not even spam! - Which is clearly wrong. 

Also, there is nothing new in the web archive for the period. 

Hence, this message.  If it doesn't land back in my inbox, that 
will tell me something about the problem.  If on the other hand 
the distribution is working, perhaps someone who knows something 
can tell me something else about the problem.
