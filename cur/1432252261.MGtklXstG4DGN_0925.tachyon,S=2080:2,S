Not so unintended if you ask me.  The chief drawback of semi-anon
methods of negotiating assignations is the lack of geographical data. 
Certain "adult" telephone chat services suffer from aggregating widely
strewn patrons.  A patron in Cincinnati may discover suddenly that the
object of his/her pursuit is actually in Nashville, hardly a quick
drive.  I think toothing has grown popular *because* of the proximity
limitations.  One has a reasonable assurance that the object of pursuit
is close enough to "close escrow", as Lenny Nero would say.
