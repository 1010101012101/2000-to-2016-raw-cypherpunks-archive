WASHINGTON - The Pentagon (news - web sites) is setting up 
a stock-market style system in which investors would bet 
on terror attacks, assassinations and other events in the 
Middle East. Defense officials hope to gain intelligence 
and useful predictions while investors who guessed right 
would win profits.
