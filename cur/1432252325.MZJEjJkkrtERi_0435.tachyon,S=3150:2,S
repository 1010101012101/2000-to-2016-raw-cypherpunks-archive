Dave,


The IP list may be interested in a new ACLU white paper and
interactive map detailing  what is known and suspected about how the
NSA's illegal spying on Americans occurs and where the interceptions
are likely taking place..  The white paper is entitled "Eavesdropping 101:
What Can the NSA Do?" It looks at the probable connections that
the NSA has made to the U.S. civilian communications
infrastructure.

The map shows how the NSA's "surveillance octopus" likely entangles the
country. We believe it is the
first effort to visually illustrate what is happening.

You can find both the white paper and the map at
http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23989res20060131.html >
http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23989res20060131.html.
