Hersh also reports that a number of conversations between members of the
Saudi Arabian royal family that
were electronically intercepted by the National Security Agency,
beginning as early as 1994, "demonstrated
to analysts that by 1996 Saudi money was supporting Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda and other extremist groups."
