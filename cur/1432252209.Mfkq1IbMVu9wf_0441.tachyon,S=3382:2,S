A really big one. Still conventional. Besides, a standard-sized one
might have hit a munitions or fuel bunker.

 Hell, a 10 acre tire fire in central California made a "mushroom"
shaped cloud several thousand feet high. 

During Vietnam there were boxcar-sized bombs used to clear an LZ in the
jungle. How many tons? I don't know but they made ~100 yard circle.
