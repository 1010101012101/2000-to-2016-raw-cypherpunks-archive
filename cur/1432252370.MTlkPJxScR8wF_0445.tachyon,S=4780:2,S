it started off as doctoral thesis done as undergrand.  before year was
out he did indeed "sign up" in some manner.  his work was classified
at or above secret.  and they did indeed build a SCIF on the campus
for him to complete his work.

these are facts, and i've got a copy of the original article with
Sean's description of the events "I was just this grad student..."

i do not know the nature of the agreement; i do not know if it was
encouraged with carrots or sticks.

i'll dig up the archives later today...  the paper was "sanitized" but
the real concern was all of the vast and detailed fiber, power, gas,
transportation, and other infrastructure mapped at sufficient detail
for edges to have sufficiently useful capacity ratings for evaluation
in the graph algorithms highlighting high degree, high risk nodes /
links in the network.  access to "sensitive critical infrastructure
information" ever after actively squelched.
