"Rent-seeking" is one good term for this overall behavior.

People, even animals, seek competitive advantage in various ways. One 
way is by limiting competition and collecting "rent." Travellers 
passing a particular point (tolls), organized criminals charging 
protection money (governments, mafias), guilds limiting entry 
(Blacksmith's Guild, American Medical Association, etc.), immigration 
quotas, etc.

Uusually a threat of violence is involved as an enforcement mechanism.

One of the aspects of crypto anarchy is that such threats of physical 
violence are less useful. And so rent-seeking is thwarted.

Gilding the lily...or the "Cypherpunks rose," appropriately.
