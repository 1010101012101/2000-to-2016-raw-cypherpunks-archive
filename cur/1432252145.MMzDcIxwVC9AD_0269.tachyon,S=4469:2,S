Over 95% of the objections that Jim's attorney has raised over the last 
2 days have been overruled, where almost every one of the objections that 
the D.A. has raised have been sustained.  It's pretty obvious that Judge 
Tanner hates Jim--partly because Jim hasn't shown the proper decorous respect 
to the judge--and Jim's attorney is fighting that as well as the prosecution. 
 By yesterday afternoon, he looked totally demoralized.

One of the people in the court who was reasonably friendly to Jim pointed 
out to him yesterday that instead of trying to prove a point, Jim should 
have spent his time trying to win his case.  Leen has to deal with a client 
who is at least partly committed to a crusade.
