*Except* the hosting server. Legal "whack-a-mole" games will commence soon
after discovery. (Or they will just yank the entries out of the root DNS
servers or screw with the routing tables on the backbone.)

The host of the site is the only one with his ass left hanging out.

I disagree.  I don't believe Jim really was willing to consider the social
implications of his scheme.

He seemed to think that the only target of this would be the government.

I think that there would be a much bigger field of targets than that.

Think about it.  If you had the chance to have people killed without any
posibility of capture, who would it be?

I think that there are more people out there who would go after Bill Gates
or John Tesh than there would for various little known public officials.

About six feet down.)

One of the reasons that this country is so fucked up is that few pay
attention to what their leaders actually do.  You tell them about laws
that are already on the books and they don't believe you. They still buy
into the myth that America is the "Freest Country in the World(tm)".

The people they do hate, however, are those that annoy them. In-laws, bad
TV celebs, evil software moguls, etc.

And what about those people who have lots of money and little or no
personal ethics?  Say that you have a company whos rival has a bunch of
engineers that you want.  They won't work for you, so you have them done
in.  (Or maybe the prosecutors in a big anti-trust trial.)

Free and open assassination markets are a messy thing. True, some good
would come out of them. A whole bunch of bad would come out of them as
well.

Just because you can do something, does not mean that you should.
