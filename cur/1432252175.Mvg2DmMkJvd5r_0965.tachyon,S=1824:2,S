Actually, ammunition is not registered as such, but in DC you
are only allowed to possess ammunition suitable for one of your
DC-registered firearms. This applies even to spent cartridge 
cases.

If this guy didn't own a DC-registered shotgun of the same 
gauge as the shell found, then he's in violation. The car
had California plates, so it seems plausible that he was 
a non-resident.
