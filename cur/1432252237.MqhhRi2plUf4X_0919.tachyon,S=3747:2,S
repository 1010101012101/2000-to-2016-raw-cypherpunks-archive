What sort of "nastygrams" did your lawyers send?

Article writers are free, in a free society, to pick the headlines they wish.

If I received "nastygrams" for the _headlines_ I attached to articles 
I wrote, I'd tell the authors of the "nastygrams" to fuck off. If 
they took further action, I think killing them would be fully 
justfied.

What statist universe have you moved into, Jim?
