We, at Sybase, are updating our marketing database and would like to verify if and how you would like us to communicate with you.  If you would prefer to not receive any further information about Sybase or its Enterprise Portal or Wireless products, please click here: http://woodchuck.sybase.com/sybase/www/Responsehandler?UID1=1079157643&UM=68&UID2=5 to immediately opt out of all further communications.

We haven't talked to you in awhile. In fact, based on what you once believed Sybase could offer, you may have asked us not to contact you. Now, things have changed. We have a new focus on e-Business, click here: http://woodchuck.sybase.com/sybase/www/Responsehandler?UID1=1079157643&UM=68&UID2=1 to learn more. So please take a moment to tell us a little about your e-Business needs. Click here: http://woodchuck.sybase.com/sybase/www/Responsehandler?UID1=1079157643&UM=68&UID2=3 to indicate your preferences, and we'll get back to you with some valuable information. 

If we don't hear from you, we will take your lack of response as your intent to opt out of any further communication with Sybase.  However, should you choose to respond, we hope to have the opportunity to help make your e-Business goals a reality.

Thank you, 

Pamela George
Vice President, Corporate Marketing
Sybase, Inc.
