Don't have to bribe anyone. Well, you do have to pay them extortionate  
amounts of money every six months or so to give you a "long-term"  
visa, but it's all legal, cash paid to Anguillian Inland Revenue, and  
all that.

Besides taxation being theft, and all that.

:-)

As for how I earned it, I'm not sure "earned" had much to do with it,  
truth be told, but I'm not one to look a breezy veranda in the, um,  
mouth, anymore. cf, "Inner Peckerwood Slacker", above...

Cheers,
