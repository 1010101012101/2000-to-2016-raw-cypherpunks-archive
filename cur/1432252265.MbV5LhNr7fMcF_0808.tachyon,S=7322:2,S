That's a different situation.  Insurance isn't a product, it's a
service.  Like someone said in an earlier post, insurance is a
gamble.  People put in money so, in the event of a sickness, they get
more out than they put in.  Denying coverage tips the scale in favor
of the insurance company.

I was referring specifically to genetic abormalities.

I agree on the comment about medical spending, as well as apples and
oranges.

As to care, as I've said a lot before, care is most often more
expensive than coverage.

I've heard of free clinics.  But they're extremely hard to find in
most areas, and they are often overbooked.

Yeah, I think I've gotten one of those. ;-)

That's fine.  I have no problem with being disliked.  I just think
that having an attack in every message is a waste of bandwith.
