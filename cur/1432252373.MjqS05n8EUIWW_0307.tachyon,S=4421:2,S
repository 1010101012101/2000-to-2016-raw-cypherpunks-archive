Um, possibly if *all* MP3's were made with stegodata. If there 
is *one* source of MP3's that's stego'd and a bunch of other 
people trying to make them sound as good as possible, the one 
supplier with consistently poor sound quality will stand out 
when someone goes looking for stegograms.

One thing, which you pointed out in a comment I snipped above, 
is that some music adapts better to MP3 compression than other 
music.  There is plenty of room for stegodata in synthesizer-
pop bands like "Yes" and "The Eurythmics", but almost none 
in layered atmospheric music like "Enya".  If you pick and 
choose which plaintexts to stego, you can probably be less 
obtrusive about it.
