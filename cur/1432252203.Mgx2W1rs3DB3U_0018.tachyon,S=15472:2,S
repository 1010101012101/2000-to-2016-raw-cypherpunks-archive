Do you fly now? Even with prepaid tickets, ID is a requirement, despite 
the provable fact that the production of ID does not increase *security* 
by even a single bit.  In fact, it has been shown (Bellovin?) than this is 
actually a *reducer* of security, as you can now test the waters and put 
together a bunch of aliases that are acceptable to the government's 
computers.

Even worse, the supposed "law" which "requires ID to fly" is *secret*, and 
that secrecy appears to be fine with the federal courts. We can now be 
held to account for SECRET LAWS.  That's a pretty big change all by 
itself.

The vast majority of the country's vagrancy laws were ruled 
unconstitutional in the late 80's (the guy with the cite, if it's 
necessary, is a trooper pal I cannot reach till monday, however he has 
made much ado about "this terrible injustice" :-)

Unfair != unconstitutional. No matter how many times you hear it.

Yet hotels only rarely ask for ID other than a credit card from which they 
can extract money for damages.  I can count the requests for ID on one 
hand, while credit card requests are universal and enforced (as a purely 
monetary policy should be).

Which has 100% nothing to do with the presentation of an ID to buy a 
ticket. Even valid ID.

Your experience and mine differ again.  I was an aux asshole in the 70's, 
and our training back then *far* exceeds what appears to be happening 
today.  Todays policeman is in fact a paramilitary soldier who has only a 
vague idea of what is or is not constitutional. Even for those who know, 
caring is pretty much dead - cops (and spies, etc) have been given carte 
blanche by the US Sheeple to do "whatever it takes" to "protect [us]". A 
little trampling of the constitution doesn't mean anything to anyone (see: 
torture, PATRIOT Act., and thousands of other examples).

Time to wake up and buy some ammunition, food, and make emergency travel 
arrangements ;-)

Which has nothing to do with the subject of anonymous travel.

*I* am *that guy*: I'd rather not be pulled over by *either* of them, as 
is my absolute constitutional right.

Until you said this, I thought you lived in Illinois. California is the 
only place I am aware of that has a no-chase policy, and even then, its a 
no *high speed* chase directive, [wisely & unusually] aimed at the 
protection of the public.

The false positive rate is reportedly around 5%, and is quite manageable 
for the circumstances in which it is used most often (the investigation of 
killings).

I used to purchase the drivers license database in the 1990s, just for 
giggles. Now that it's expensive, I have to get access via Westlaw or 
Lexis/Nexus, but it's still there.  As for the pictures, my understanding 
is that they are now available under FOIA (although I can't see it actualy 
being filled, due to the duplication cost requirements).

I have no doubt whatsoever that the day those records become sufficiently 
monetizable, they will do brisk business (maybe Facebook?)

The FEMA babies are the tinyest possible subset of the people who object 
to data collection.  Even then, just because they are worried about 
something we may consider unlikely, their argument is still sound.

It confirmed: you said your car's paper load had gone *down*.

The *contents* are irrelevent other than in the context of it being

While muddily phrased, I'll assume that was agreement?

Private persons are free to do what they want - the government is not.

I go into smaller courthouses *all the time* without ANY ID.  No gramps, 
either, unless court is "in session", and Judge Corruption is Ruling: then 
I see Grampa Bailiff once in a while.

The definition is "It's impossible to travel anonymously in the USA unless 
it's on a local mass trasit system, or you have direct use of a car.  Air, 
rail, and bus travel are all now dependent on Federally recognized ID (see 
"Real ID Act").
