   The real problem is that the human race itself is either an alien species
that doesn't belong on this planet, or perhaps just an evolutionary mishap akin
to a cancer that has used far more than it's fair share of world resources. It's
not that just some humans are "useless eaters", it's that all are, and the
Goddess Gaia is clearly hard at work trying to rectify this situation with a
variety of new bioweapons, i.e., AIDS, ebola, etc. which will soon, I'm sure,
reduce the human population as is most necessary, by half, if not
three-quarters, or perhaps just eliminate it all together -- to the wild 
applause of the rest of the Earth.
