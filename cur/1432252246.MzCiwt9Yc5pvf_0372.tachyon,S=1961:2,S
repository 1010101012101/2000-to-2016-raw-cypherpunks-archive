[having problems with an MX record somewhere. Let's see if this works...]

At 3:04 PM -0400 4/26/04, Damian Gerow parsed a sentence thusly:

Okay. I'll bite. Let's do a Rorschach test.

Please parse *this* sentence:

"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,
the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."

:-)

Too hard? How about this one:


"Counsel is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky has filed, has an affidavit which
they are in possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any
kind in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton..."


;-)

YMO"I"MV?

Cheers,
