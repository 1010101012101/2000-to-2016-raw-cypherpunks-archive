It is important that the crypto/physics communities prepare primers on the
underlying technologies from a historic design perspective; how does a crt
tv ray gun and beam director work? how does a metal detector work? sculpted
or phased radar, phased array field projection, aegis, etc. Historic roots
would include 1700s electodynamics theory especially electron beam physics
and 1800s mail-order toys like high voltage coils, x-ray tubes and reactant
materials, geissler tubes, helmholdt and maxwell coils, early hf wired and
rf signals before the 1900s textbook stories, and of course guided fields
such as are critical in understanding how these signals systems work in
*earth's* environment.

There is a high resolution model of electrical systems especially focused
on those pesky tubes in 3d lattice alignment in office buildings...

last i heard, 2nd hop distribution is having corruption and extortion
problems, but load rate says the first slice should be done by mid week and
automatically shared as arranged, original data is aligned to the solstice
2014, suggesting more next weekend?

<br>
To John-<br>
<br>
there are over 200 groups discussing the same issues, at least 2 got<br>
nationalised aggressively, and there have been some tangential posts<br>
on blogs or commercial forums mainly concerns about their datacenter<br>
security not knowing who might attack them, but overall the same<br>
concerns are expressed:<br>
<br>
Can the data be spoofed? Not at this resolution without having a model<br>
of everything at the same resolution...<br>
<br>
Are the blocks secure? No. [...] But services are stable.<br>
<br>
Exports to public? yes, p2p clusters loading, datacenters doing<br>
preparation processing, packed table files are set up for distributed<br>
search<br>
<br>
How do *you* know? UHD/4k VNC video stream to one of the master<br>
control servers handling the database import and text chat with 200<br>
others, no direct access to data here, but certainty that the data is<br>
distributing.<br>
<br>
Involved how? rendering code to make GEO-TIFF map tiles and aggrigated<br>
spline/curves to simplify snapshot data and level of detail pyramid<br>
(multi-variate parametric search) index data.<br>
<br>
Now we ask... If this was NATO-ish or any variety of US/UK system<br>
built in the 1960s(?) can we solve for locations or viable downlink<br>
targets to intercept? This hint at geo-magnetic shift is a huge<br>
opportunity!<br>
<br>
The coin data is ... glorious... but the other signals are no less<br>

<br>
ALSO!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?&quot; YES=
.<br>
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard<br>
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the<br>
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has<br>
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA<br>
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR<br>
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without<br>
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting<br>
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar<br>

it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and<br>

<br>
more questions:<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary<br>

Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the<br>
