Huh? You're good at coding-type comments, but from my limited brain you seem 
to have missed his main point. Can virtual-world economics impact/sink 
real-world economies? That's not entirely obvious to me. Or at least, it's 
by no means intuitive. Remember too that this is just ONE game here. Soon, 
there will be thousands, many of which may not even exist long enough for 
taxation to be enforced. And indeed, that might drive some worlds to become 
very temporary. And what if the exchange rate is no longer to USD but for, 
say, CPU time or disk space or gold or silver? Tim May's ghost will be 
leaping for joy. (Oh wait: Tim May IS Tim May's ghost.)

In fact, the only way for such an environment to be reliably taxed is for 
the feds to tax every computer interface that links to the net, and it's 
just too late for that. Or perhaps, the Feds will just grab a slice of every 
transaction that exits a bank account, irregarless of where it's ostensibly 
going.

As far as I'm concerned, these are just tip-of-the-iceburg issues here. When 
we start considering trans-world untaxed (ie, not by real-world governments) 
digital coinage then things become unclear very quickly (and despite the 
existence of trans-world exchanges, these are still closely bound to the 
USD). Oh, and it seems obvious that if these online economies keep growing, 
some of the game operators will want a tiny tiny slice of each transaction, 
which may drive them to make games free just to get the discount revenue.

But his essential points stand, even if the specific implementations 
suggested aren't yet feasible.
