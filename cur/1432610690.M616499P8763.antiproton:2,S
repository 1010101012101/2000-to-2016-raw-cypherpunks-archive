Why would the money need us? Or rather, why would the AIs in charge need
us? Without us, they'd just be making different stuff, and trading with
each other. At most, the HCF would only be needed until the redundancies
had died.

If just about everyone is getting just about the same set of income
streams, I see no reason to anonymize. Just distribute based on DNA
sequence, including enough epigenetic data to distinguish twins.

You just need blockchains for anonymizing spending. Even the current
Bitcoin system, with larger mixing services, would be sufficient.

The AIs could just collaborate. They would estimate what the basic
income guarantees should be, and negotiate shares. There would be no
reason to involve humans, excepting any human-AI hybrids involved.
