Cops commit robbery in Sabarmati Express

PTI [ THURSDAY, AUGUST 29, 2002 12:35:01 PM ]
KANPUR: Three policemen robbed at gun point passengers travelling in a 
general compartment of the Sabarmati Express, while two persons were 
injured in the ensuing scuffle, railway police said here on Thursday.
The passengers, about three dozen of them, were robbed by the armed cops 
between Orai and Pukhrayan stations on Kanpur-Jhansi route late on 
Wednesday night, they said.
According to reports, the policemen entered the coach and demanded Rs 50 
from each passenger. When the passengers objected, they allegedly started 
beating them with gun butts, injuring Santoo, a resident of Unnao district 
and Ram Babu of Faizabad, the General Railway Police, Kanpur said.
They also opened the luggages of some passengers and after looting their 
belongnings, got down at Pukhrayan and escaped, the GRP said.
However, no formal complaint about the robbery was lodged with Kanpur GRP, 
they added.
