There's always Ayn Rand - "The Fountainhead" has at least some
depth of characters, as opposed to her later and more polemic
	<fnord>"Telemachus Sneezed", with the 600-page speech
	by John Guilt</fnord>
"Atlas Shrugged", with its much thinner characters and
increased preachiness.

On the other hand, a lot of Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings haven't
passed the physical tests of time, and I gather geodesic domes
tend to leak even if they're not built as badly as 
those that Some Local Cypherpunks are living in - we'll see how
geodesic economies do...
				Thanks!
