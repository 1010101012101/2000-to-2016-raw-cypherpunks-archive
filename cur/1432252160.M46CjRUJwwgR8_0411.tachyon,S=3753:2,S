Most people who detect an intruder in their homes going through their 
stuff
aren't going to think "This must be a government agent performing an 
appropriately authorized black bag job." They're going to think "Holy 
shit! There's a criminal in my house." and do whatever they feel is 
necessary to defend their loved ones.

So lets say a hypothetical woman named "Sue" ventilates "Agent Smith" 
(who she perceives as a burglar & possibly a rapist) with her twelve 
gauge. Will she be charged with a crime? Will she be "detained" until 
such time as the Feds have finished determining her involvement with 
terrorism? If she asserts her fifth amendment right to not answer 
questions will the FBI torture her until she "admits" she is a terrorist?
