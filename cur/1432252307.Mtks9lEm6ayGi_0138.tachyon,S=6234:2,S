Exactly. I am seeing this in Poland right now. We're after 3-4 differen=

Internet censorship debates (and a few data retention ones), and ISPs h=

always been vehemently opposed. However, as soon as such a discussion=20=

gravitates towards tax incentives, direct payment, etc. -- they are all=
 for=20
it. They see it as an additional revenue stream.

In fact, a few international ISPs that operate in Poland (I will not di=
sclose=20
any of the two related colours) are -- as far as I know -- in the proce=
ss of=20
implementing parental filtering on the national network level. The tech=
 is=20
advanced and less costly than 5 years ago, and now ISPs seem to think t=
hat=20
this will be a billable feature for parents.

Always about the children, eh?

My point being: we can't rely on corporations. We can use the momentary=

alliances as they form, but should not rely on them in the long run.

Yeah, but the lawmakers can make the best interest of corporations perf=

aligned with snooping and retention easily -- with law and money. The o=
