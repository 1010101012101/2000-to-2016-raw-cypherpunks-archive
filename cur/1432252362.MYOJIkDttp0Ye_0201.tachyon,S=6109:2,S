The NSA has an almost unlimited budget. I could easily see them being
used in this fashion. Especially since if bitcoin was being used by the
official enemies of the US, it would allow the NSA to directly screw
around with them.

True, but the mining needs to happen in the open somehow.

Actually, someone mentioned the fact that they could just do the "think
of the children" CP/Drugs line, and that would resolve the problem more
or less in the public eye. Especially when you combine that with
"proceeds of a crime" laws, arguably turning a bitcoin into a similar
object as a stolen stereo.

In China and other similar countries they are dealing with it in a more
direct manner, essentially telling people that if they continue to use
it there will be severe consequences. Hence why the banks in China
backed out so quickly.

Unfortunately, utopian thinking is commonly wishful thinking, that's why
so many bad things happen when utopian extremists start to get their way.
