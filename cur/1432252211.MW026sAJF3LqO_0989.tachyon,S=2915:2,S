Why not have each individual's PC which offered to lend do the 
accounting.  This means their PC must be on-line whenever someone who 
didn't pay wants to listen, limiting the number of copies available, but it

This is a possible problem.  If the tracks were originally purchased as 
.mp3 then this might not be a problem.
