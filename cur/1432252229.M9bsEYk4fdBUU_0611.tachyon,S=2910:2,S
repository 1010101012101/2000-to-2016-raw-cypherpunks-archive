 China seeks hackers for information warfare, cites Clinton's example

 Special to World Tribune.com
EAST-ASIA-INTEL.COMWednesday, February 16, 2005

 Zhang Zhaozhong, director of the Military and Equipment Teaching and
Research Center of the National Defense University, said the government is
hoping to recruit computer hackers as part of its information warfare
operations.

 Zhang noted that former U.S. President Bill Clinton invited hackers to the
White House for a discussion of network security. China could also follow
this example to mine the skills of hackers, Zhang said.

 He said that recruiting hackers would enhance information security levels.

 The comments appeared in the Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po. The newspaper
reported Feb. 10 that a well-known Chinese hacker organization, the Honker
Union, had disbanded. The group claimed thousands of members, including
network security professionals.

 The group claimed to have successfully attacked the White House Internet
site, and it was part of a joint Chinese effort to conduct attacks on U.S.
websites following the April 2001 mid-air collision of a Chinese F-8 jet
and U.S. EP-3 surveillance aircraft.

 Other hacker groups that reportedly took part in the attacks were the
Hacker Union for China and China Eagles.
