Although obnoxious this law is in line with the anti-drug direction of the
American government.

The more I think about it the stranger it is to be discriminated and drug
tested based on the fact that you're in the welfare program. Although
there's something profoundly justified about making sure
people receiving money are going to do the best thing possible with it,
considering drugs are mostly illegal in the US.
