What is peculiar is that the non-bin Laden parts of the tape
are superior quality, with close up zooms and other adjustments
for quality. The portions which show UBL are consistently poorer
than the rest, and show little adjustment for quality. Hard to know
if that difference is in the original or was due to later doctoring.
Any video wizards to comment on the likelihood of different
video operators or was it tape from two different machines
spliced together?

Eric Margolis, a reporter and commentator just now on Wolf 
Blitzer's CNN show pointed out that the tape allegedly came 
from the Northern Alliance, that the Alliance is very close to 
Russian intelligence, and that the Russians are masters at 
forging documents and evidence of all sorts.

Margolis went on to say that every good reporter is suspicious
of "Christmas gifts" like the tape which appear at just the
right time in a convenient finding place.

Blitzer's other two guests, a Saudi representative, and a
reporter for the LA Times, were not suspicious of the tape.

Me, I agree with our Cherry Tree President that no patriot 
not a pedophile or an African-American on death row in Texas, 
would ever doubt the tape's authenticity. However, I deeply 
respect that the Prez crossed his eyes while lisping
the raspberry. Crossed more than usual. And the smirk
of the Prez when he talks about beheading bin Laden is
right out of the video. The smirk that never goes away
on preppy visages.

To mattd, if you've got emit stuff about *illing the *rez,
be sure to post a real world contact address for those
who want to take you up on it. UBL might want to send
a few bucks.
