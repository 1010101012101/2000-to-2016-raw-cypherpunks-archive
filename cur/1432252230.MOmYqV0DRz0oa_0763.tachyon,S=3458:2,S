the idea would be to sync everything. that a) means lots of "innocent"
traffic and b) gives you a deniability shield. "yeah, those subversive
texts were on my node. but I had no control over that, since there is no
way I could filter what comes in."

give me the hardware for less than $1000 and I'll be the first to set up
a node in germany's second-largest city.

here's a cookie: run a large file-sharing network as outlined above.
every file has an associated key and signature. you can replace by
signing the replacement with the same key.
now you have a few gigs of data distributed around the world. chaff and
winnow it or use stego on some of the images.

downside: end-users with 28k modems are pretty much out of the picture
since they can't move enough bytes around.
