Her shooting was widely reported when it happened a few days ago, on 
CNN, leading newspapers, and presumably on other networks. One of her 
bodyguards was killed, and her brother was either injured or killed, I 
don't recall. Lots of footage of her planning to be the first useful 
idiot, er, politician,  to serve in both the U.S.-funded Saddam regime 
and the U.S.-funded post-Saddam regime.

Perhaps these networks and newspapers are not carried on Choate Prime, 
the parallel world that is strangely different from our own.
