**********************  NEW *****************************

SUPPORT FOR YOUNG SCIENTISTS BY 
INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR BIOLUMINESCENCE & CHEMILUMINESCENCE
DETAILS AVAILABLE at http://www.unibo.it/isbc

*********************************************************


This symposium, which is held in association with the International
Society for Bioluminescence & Chemiluminescence (ISBC), is the next
in the biennial series that was started in 1978.

Please visit the Symposium web site http://www.Lumiweb.com as it has
just been further updated and now contains full information about the
meeting.

The Symposium content will again be broad, and include all aspects of
fundamental and basic science as well as the wide range of
applications that now depend on these technologies.

The Symposium will be held 5-9 April 2002 at Robinson College,
University of Cambridge, UK. Robinson College is a modern college 
well designed to host conferences and has excellent en suite 
accommodation. All Symposium activities will be held at the College. 
More details about Robinson College can be found at 
http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk.

The Symposium will start the evening of Friday 5 April and finish at
midday Tuesday 9 April.  Registration and accommodation details are
available at http://www.Lumiweb.com. Those who register for the
Symposium by Monday 19 November 2001 (this date is also the Abstract
deadline date) will get a preferential rate and current Members of
the ISBC are entitled to a further reduction.

PRESENTATIONS
The Symposium will consist of presentations in both oral and poster 
format.

EXHIBITION
There will be an exhibition of instruments and reagents. 
Commercial Workshops are also planned.
Further details, please enquire: symposium@Lumiweb.com

ABSTRACTS
Abstracts are invited for oral and poster presentations. 
Deadline for Abstracts: Monday 19 November 2001. 
See http://www.Lumiweb.com for further information.
Accepted abstracts will be published in the journal "Luminescence"
(publisher, John Wiley & Sons).

SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS PUBLICATION
Manuscripts will be invited from authors making presentations and
these will be published in a Proceedings volume, a copy of which 
will be sent after the Symposium -- and free-of-charge -- to each 
registered delegate.


SYMPOSIUM PROGRAMME
The International Society for Bioluminescence & Chemiluminescence
(ISBC) is taking responsibility for the scientific programme
(Programme Co-Chairs: Professor Tony Campbell (University of Wales
College of Medicine), Dr Phil Hill (University of Nottingham, UK) and
Professor Peter Herring (Southampton Oceanography Centre, UK) Past
President of ISBC). The DeLuca Prize sponsored by Berthold
Technologies http://www.berthold-online.com will be open to
presenters under the age of 35 years and will be judged by the
ISBC.
