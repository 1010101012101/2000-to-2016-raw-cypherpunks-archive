Subject: [tahoe-dev] Tahoe, The Least Authority File System,
	Thursday Night Hack Meet
Reply-To: Tahoe-LAFS development <tahoe-dev@tahoe-lafs.org>

The Tahoe Least Authority File System is a peer-to-peer system that stores
data redundantly with agents who cannot read the data contents. These
agents are granted close to the *minimum* authority necessary to support
requests about the data. This design is motivated by the "Principle of
Least Authority".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_authority

This Thursday (2012-12-06) at 19:00 PST, members of the Tahoe community
will have a physical meetup at "The Big Noisebridge Table". We'll project a
basic state diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) depicting
the behaviour of the distributed "Lease Database" that the "storage server"
agents in the Tahoe network use to manage the encrypted data that they
store. During our meeting we'll add correct and useful content to the
diagram.

An overview of the design, including the basic state diagram, can be found
here:

https://github.com/davidsarah/tahoe-lafs/blob/1819-cloud-merge/docs/proposed/leasedb.rst

For a general introduction to Tahoe check this out:

Gimme the code!!

To understand the behavior of the "lease data base" we'll be inspecting
this code (you might want to look at this before Thursday!):

https://github.com/davidsarah/tahoe-lafs/tree/master/src/allmydata/

storage/leasedb.py
storage/account.py
storage/accountant.py
storage/accounting_crawler.py
storage/server.py (less important)

No punch... no pie... just a group building a better Information Super
Highway (a series of tubes in The Cyber)!
