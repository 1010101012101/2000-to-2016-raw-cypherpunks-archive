[ etc, right on target AFAIK ]

Global observer attacks can be augmented by owning a substantial
number of the routers:  All hosted at one facility, but globally
distributed via transparent VPN connections running on a variety
of platforms all over the world. These router instances would be
somewhat customized to facilitate manipulation of traffic via a
purpose built hypervisor with a plugin architecture for monitor
functions. Since code names aren't supposed to be related to the
named thing in any way, we can't call this Hydra.

In terms of real world threats, I think it's safe to say that TOR
"Hidden Services" aren't very well hidden from motivated
adversaries who can deploy global observation and/or global
infiltration attacks: The persistence, fixed physical location and
interactive availability a hidden services makes it a fat, dumb,
happy sitting target for any major State's military and police
intelligence service that takes an interest in identifying the
host and its operators IRL.
