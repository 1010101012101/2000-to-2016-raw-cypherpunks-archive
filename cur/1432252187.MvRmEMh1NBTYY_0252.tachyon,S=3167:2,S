 >>Great propaganda piece. Take a revolt against government manipulation of 
the economy and portray it as the death of capitalism... Kinda gives 
himself away by describing the fall of Saigon as "foreign invaders fleeing

Thanks Marc,Its from Indymedia.org,main board.It had some marxist dreck 
that I edited out.I fear for the anarchists if the leninists simply inherit 
the torture tables.Its vital more people know how dangerous these 
authoritarian socialists are.
C/punks calling for crypto-anarchy are liable to be burned alive as 
commies.OR if the fucking MLers actually win,we could be toasted as 
crypto-fascists.Monkee's on a rock.There could be e-cash/barter opps 
though,doncha reckon?
