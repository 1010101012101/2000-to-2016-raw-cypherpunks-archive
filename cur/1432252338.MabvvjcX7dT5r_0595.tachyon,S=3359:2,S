Of course the chiefest terrorists are purveyors of low-quality software
such as Microsoft. MS Outlook and Windows are the greatest threats to your
data, far beyond what the most heinous virus/worm could ever hope to
accomplish.

In a world of diverse, secure, noncommercial systems (free *nices) there
would be basically no worms nor viruses, and the damage they'd be doing
would be highly limited.

Ceterum censeo Microsoftem delendam esse.
