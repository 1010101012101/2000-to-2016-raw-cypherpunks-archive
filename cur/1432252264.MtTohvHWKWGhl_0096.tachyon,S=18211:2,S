If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox

   - By Kevin Poulsen<http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/author/kevin_poulsen/>

While investigating a hosting company known for sheltering child porn last
year the FBI incidentally seized the entire e-mail database of a popular
anonymous webmail service called TorMail.

Now the FBI is tapping that vast trove of e-mail in unrelated
investigations.

The bureau's data windfall, seized from a company called Freedom Hosting,
surfaced in court papers last week when prosecutors indicted a Florida man
for allegedly selling counterfeit credit cards online. The filings show the
FBI built its case in part by executing a search warrant on a Gmail account
used by the counterfeiters, where they found that orders for forged cards
were being sent to a TorMail e-mail account: "platplus@tormail.net."

Acting on that lead in September, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the
TorMail account, and then accessed it from the bureau's own copy of "data
and information from the TorMail e-mail server, including the content of
TorMail e-mail accounts," according to the
complaint<http://www.justice.gov/usao/nj/Press/files/pdffiles/2014/Roberson,%20Sean%20Complaint.pdf>(.pdf)
sworn out by U.S. Postal Inspector Eric Malecki.

The tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an
NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual
lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to
tap it later. There's no indication that the FBI searched the trove for
incriminating evidence before getting a warrant. But now that it has a copy
of TorMail's servers, the bureau can execute endless search warrants on a
mail service that once boasted of being immune to spying.

"We have no information to give you or to respond to any subpoenas or court
orders," read TorMail's homepage. "Do not bother contacting us for
information on, or to view the contents of a TorMail user inbox, you will
be ignored."

In another e-mail case, the FBI last year won a court order compelling
secure e-mail provider Lavabit to turn over the master encryption
keys<http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/lavabit_unsealed/>for
its website, which would have given agents the technical ability to
spy
on all of Lavabit's 400,000 users - though the government said it was
interested only in one. (Rather than comply, Lavabit shut down and is
appealing the surveillance order).

TorMail was the webmail provider of choice for denizens of the so-called
Darknet <http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/10/thompson/> of anonymous and
encrypted websites and services, making the FBI's cache extraordinarily
valuable. The affair also sheds a little more light on the already-strange
story of the FBI's broad attack on Freedom Hosting, once a key service
provider for untraceable websites.

Freedom Hosting specialized in providing turnkey "Tor hidden service" sites
-- special sites, with addresses ending in .onion, that hide their
geographic location behind layers of routing, and can be reached only over
the Tor anonymity network. Tor hidden services are used by those seeking to
evade surveillance or protect users' privacy to an extraordinary degree -
human rights groups and journalists as well as serious criminal elements.

By some estimates, Freedom Hosting backstopped fully half of all hidden
services at the time it was shut down last year -- TorMail among them. But
it had a reputation for tolerating child pornography on its servers. In
July, the FBI moved on the company and had the alleged operator, Eric Eoin
Marques, arrested at his home in Ireland. The U.S. is now seeking his
extradition for allegedly facilitating child porn on a massive scale;
hearings are set to begin in Dublin this week.

According to the new document, the FBI obtained the data belonging to
Freedom Hosting's customers through a Mutual Legal Assistance request to
France - where the company leased its servers - between July 22, 2013 and
August 2 of last year.

That's two days before all the sites hosted by Freedom Hosting , including
TorMail, began serving an error message with hidden code embedded in the
page, on August 4.

Security researchers dissected the code and found it exploited a security
hole <http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/freedom-hosting/> in Firefox
to de-anonymize users with slightly outdated versions of Tor Browser
Bundle, reporting back to a mysterious server in Northern Virginia. Though
the FBI hasn't commented (and declined to speak for this story), the
malware's behavior was consistent with the FBI's spyware
deployments<http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/04/fbi-spyware-pro/>,
now known as a "Network Investigative Technique."

No mass deployment of the FBI's malware had ever before been spotted in the
wild.

The attack through TorMail alarmed many in the Darknet, including the
underground's most notorious figure -- Dread Pirate Roberts, the operator of
the Silk Road drug forum, who took the unusual step of posting a warning on
the Silk Road homepage. An analysis he wrote on the associated forum now
seems prescient.

"I know that MANY people, vendors included, used
TorMail<http://en.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1jrnhx/important_security_announcement_from_dpr_himself/>,"
he wrote. "You must think back through your TorMail usage and assume
everything you wrote there and didn't encrypt can be read by law
enforcement at this point and take action accordingly. I personally did not
use the service for anything important, and hopefully neither did any of
you." Two months later the FBI
arrested<http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/silk-road-raided/>San
Francisco man Ross William Ulbricht as the alleged Silk Road operator.

The connection, if any, between the FBI obtaining Freedom Hosting's data
and apparently launching the malware campaign through TorMail and the other
sites isn't spelled out in the new document. The bureau could have had the
cooperation of the French hosting company that Marques leased his servers
from. Or it might have set up its own Tor hidden services using the private
keys obtained from the seizure, which would allow it to adopt the same
.onion addresses used by the original sites.

The French company also hasn't been identified. But France's largest
hosting company, OVH, announced on July
29<http://forum.ovh.com/showthread.php?89685-Le-nouveau-contrat-de-serveur-dedie>,
in the middle of the FBI's then-secret Freedom Hosting seizure, that it
would no longer allow Tor software on its servers. A spokesman for the
company says he can't comment on specific cases, and declined to say
whether Freedom Hosting was a customer.

"Wherever the data center is located, we conduct our activities in
conformity with applicable laws, and as a hosting company, we obey search
warrants or disclosure orders," OVH spokesman Benjamin Bongoat told WIRED.
"This is all we can say as we usually don't make any comments on hot
topics."
