The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
exp|ore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wi|| 
announce further details as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it will be ab|e to bui|d a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing all possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we will have the 
Opp0rtunity to include existing production in a dri|ling program, which 
wi|| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."


Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
