And succumb they do.

We now have these examples of alleged freedom advocates making the 
following non-freedom remarks.

1.) Reason Magazine Contributing Editor Cathy Young advocating 
banning encryption stating that: "Do I like the idea of people being 
able to encrypt electronic communications so that they are beyond 
surveillance? Frankly, I found it scary even before Sept. 11 - 
precisely because of the threat of terrorism. It is said that there 
are no atheists in foxholes; perhaps there are no true libertarians 
in times of terrorist attacks.  Even in the Declaration of 
Independence, the right to liberty is preceded by the right to life." 
<http://www.reason.com/cy/cy092401.html>

2.) Ivan Eland <ieland@cato.org>, Director of Defense Policy Studies, 
Cato Institute writes in favor of victim disarmament "The ban against 
sharp metal objects (i.e., knives) aboard aircraft is a good one." 
See: <http://www.cato.org/current/terrorism/pubs/eland-010920.html>

3.) The Objectivist Center's James Robbins's support of a national 
ID-  Robbins' writes: "...however, the recent assault on America has 
had a significant clarifying effect. Since last Tuesday, some of my 
"go to the wall" libertarian views, such as opposing a national ID 
card, have seemed trivial. The potential for government abuse is 
present, but the need for providing security is actual. So long as 
there are adequate checks and balances, so long as the enabling 
legislation is circumscribed and directed, the measures currently 
being touted seem a reasonable cost." See: 
<http://www.objectivistcenter.org/pubs/jr_what_will_happen_now.asp>

4.) Various Libertarian Party spokespersons notably in Ohio and 
Florida making statements such as:  " "We're normally very wary about 
anything that could mean more authority to the federal government and 
limited individual liberties," said Ralph Swanson, an administrator 
for the Florida Libertarian Party. "But I think you'll find, after 
all this, something has to be done to keep people safe." 
<http://www.Jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/091201/met_7262452.html 
 >.  And Ohio's LP director stating that: "I personally have no 
problem with airlines preventing passengers to carry weapons..." And 
she went on to say "Airport searches aren't 4th amendment 
violations." <see archives at libertarian discussion list 
<LDL@LISTSERV.KENT.EDU> >.

5.)  The Libertarian Party of Virginia candidate for Governor William 
Redpath is publicly calling for the elimination of private gun sales 
as he wants all private gun sales routed via a government licensed 
dealer so a FBI background check can be done.  Currently in Virginia 
if you wanted to give or sell your neighbor a gun you can do so 
without governmental involvement. See 
<http://www.redpath2001.com/gun_control.html>.

I'd like to view the liberty goblet as half full rather than half 
empty but with freedom advocates like these who needs enemies?

Regards,  Matt-
