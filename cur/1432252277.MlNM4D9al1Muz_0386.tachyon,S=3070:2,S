Note this from the NY Times article:

	The Megaupload case is unusual, said Orin S. Kerr, a law professor 
	at George Washington University, in that federal prosecutors obtained 
	the private e-mails of Megauploadbs operators in an effort to show they 
	were operating in bad faith.

	"The government hopes to use their private words against them," Mr. Kerr 
	said. "This should scare the owners and operators of similar sites."

And see 17 USC 512(c)(1)(A) (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html)
for why that's significant.
