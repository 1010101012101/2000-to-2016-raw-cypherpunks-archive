Ever tried to drive to Europe? Or to Hawaii?
Why airplanes don't count as a form of public transport?

This is a measure good for pissing off (which is often the first step to 
radicalizing) the quite secularized majority of American Arabs.

You also seem to forget there is another potential factor - not only the 
visible one (ethnicity), but also one that isn't obvious to visual 
evaluation - religion. There is a significant black minority that inclines 
to Islam, some of them potentially radical. Do you want to suggest banning 
blacks from flying too? If so, what reaction are you expecting to get?
