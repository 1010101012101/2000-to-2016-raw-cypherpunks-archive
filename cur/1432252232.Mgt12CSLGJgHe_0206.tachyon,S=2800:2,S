I use YYYYMMDD when automatic sorting may be required, for 
just that reason.

In all others situations, I use DD name_of_month YYYY to 
disambiguate the format. I grew up in Europe, and moved 
back to the States after college. I've had long exposure 
to both formats, and don't automatically assume one or 
the other.

It's gotten worse recently. Since the turn of the century, 
all three fields are frequently below 13.

04/05/03 or 05/04/03 are very ambiguous.
04/05/2003 is still confusing.
20030405 is good for computers
5 April 2003 is unambiguous.
