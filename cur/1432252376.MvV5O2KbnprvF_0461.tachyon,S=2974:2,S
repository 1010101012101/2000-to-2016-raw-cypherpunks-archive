I fail to see how the above is at all necessary in responding
to the statement.

Either a) an explanation, or b) a link to an explanation as to 
why you have these opinions would have been far more useful 
than the above troll.

Procmail serves no purpose by itself. It requires no small
amount of effort on the part of the administrator to utilise
for any type of systems implmentation, and thus administrators 
with limited time (common in smaller companies) will rather rely 
on (flawed) projects than self-initiated implementations.

The above is useful information. Specifically, the recognition
of duplicate mail receipts is a concept that is new to me, though
that would require that both email addresses would receive an
equal amount of 'publicity' on newsgroups, mailing lists, etc
in order that they are both acquired by a potential spammer.

The latter idea I have heard before. If you have a preferred
implementation however, which one it is and why is information
that I would find useful.
