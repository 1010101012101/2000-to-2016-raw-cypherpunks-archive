Interesting: although it triggered for the wrong reason, it did trigger
appropriately - I do not accept generic rdns.  You want to be seen as
legit, you need to have fdns==rdns on your mx.

Yes, I run extra-tight here, since (a) there's less than 700 users, (b)
they are all free accounts, and therefore have to live at *my* tolerance
level (it is good to be king :-), and (c) I don't believe email is all
that important, and I'd rather toss real mail in error than allow crap in
error.

Sigh...

Thanks for the heads up though :-)
