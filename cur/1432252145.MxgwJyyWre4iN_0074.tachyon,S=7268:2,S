                      The Workshop on the Economics of
                   Securing the Information Infrastructure

                       http://wesii.econinfosec.org/

                            October 23-24, 2006
                               Arlington, VA

                              CALL FOR PAPERS

  Our information infrastructure suffers from decades-old vulnerabilities,
  from the low-level algorithms that select communications routes to the
  application-level services on which we are becoming increasingly
  dependent. Are we investing enough to protect our infrastructure? How
  can we best overcome the inevitable bootstrapping problems that impede
  efforts to add security to this infrastructure? Who stands to benefit
  and who stands to lose as security features are integrated into these
  basic services? How can technology investment decisions best be
  presented to policymakers?

  We invite infrastructure providers, developers, social scientists,
  computer scientists, legal scholars, security engineers, and especially
  policymakers to help address these and other related questions. Authors
  of accepted papers will have the opportunity to present their work to
  government and corporate policymakers. We encourage collaborative
  research from authors in multiple fields and multiple institutions.
