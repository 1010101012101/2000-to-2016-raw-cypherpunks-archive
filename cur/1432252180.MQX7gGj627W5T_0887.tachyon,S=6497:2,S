Thank you for replying.

Yes, the ignorance of our representatives is sometimes frightening - I think 
a remedial course in civics, American history, and basic constitutional law 
should be mandatory for all elected officials at every level... and yet, the 
system as a whole continues to function, at some level, and I can't say I'd 
prefer to live anywhere else.

There is a element that folks like the gentleman you respond to below ,have 
which reminds me of the more arrogant and self-righteous of the folks who 
surrounded me in college: "The system is bad, straight through, therefore we 
must tear it down completely, and rebuild it."

They want a nice clean tabula rasa, nothing so dirty and complicated as an 
actual system inhabited by real live human beings who refuse to behave in 
the way they should. And they are focused on destroying the "bad" system, 
with very little idea of what would be erected in it's place, much less any 
thought as to what messy process might have to be gone through to come up 
with a new one that is acceptable to the people made to inhabit it.

As for condemning democracy to the "dustbin of history", well we know what 
happened the last time someone did this:

Dustbin of History, the

A handy phrase made famous by Leon Trotsky. The Second Congress of Soviets 
was being held in Petrograd when news of Bolshevik seizure of power was 
announced on 25 October (7 November, New Style) 1917. With this decisive 
turn of events, the Mensheviks and other left groups decided not to 
participate in the Congress, and as they were leaving the room where the 
Congress was being held, Trotsky taunted them by proclaiming -- truthfully, 
as it turned out -- that they were well on their way into the dustbin of 
history.

Personally, I'd rather avoid a repetition of the resulting socio-historical 
disaster.

Regards,
Thomas Leavitt
