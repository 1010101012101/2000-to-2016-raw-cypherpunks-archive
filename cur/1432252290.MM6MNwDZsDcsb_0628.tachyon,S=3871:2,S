  U.S.: FBI Sought Info Without Court OK

  Apr 28, 6:27 PM (ET)

  By MARK SHERMAN

  WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI secretly sought information last year on 3,501
  U.S. citizens and legal residents from their banks and credit card,
  telephone and Internet companies without a court's approval, the Justice
  Department said Friday.

  It was the first time the Bush administration has publicly disclosed how
  often it uses the administrative subpoena known as a national security
  letter, which allows the executive branch of government to obtain records
  about people in terrorism and espionage investigations without court
  approval.

  Friday's disclosure was mandated as part of the renewal of the Patriot Act,
  the administration's sweeping anti-terror law.

  The FBI delivered a total of 9,254 NSLs relating to 3,501 people in 2005,
  according to a report submitted late Friday to Democratic and Republican
  leaders in the House and Senate. In some cases, the bureau demanded
  information about one person from several companies.

  The department also reported it received a secret court's approval for 155
  warrants to examine business records last year, under a Patriot Act
  provision that includes library records. However, Attorney General Alberto
  Gonzales has said the department has never used the provision to ask for
  library records.

  The number was a significant jump over past use of the warrant for business
  records. A year ago, Gonzales told Congress there had been 35 warrants
  approved between November 2003 and April 2005.
