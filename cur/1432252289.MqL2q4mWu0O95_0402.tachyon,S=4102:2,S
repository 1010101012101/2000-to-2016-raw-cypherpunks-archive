Actually you may invoke the 5th for anything that isn't in your best
interest (ie witness against himself). The 'incrimination' crap is just
that, a twist on the 'in any criminal case' (the 'any' is the key point).

It's also worth noting there are NO exceptions to this, nowhere in the
Constitution is forced acceptance of immunity for example permitted.

                                 Amendment V

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual
service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
