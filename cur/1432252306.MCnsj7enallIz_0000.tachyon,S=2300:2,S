A GPS receiver doesn't broadcast its location. GPS works purely by
analyzing the signals received from satellites. This is probably a design
goal for military use, as well as a consequence of power requirements.

There is no such thing as a GPS frequency. It seems that for CDMA or
WCDMA phones the location service is defined in terms of messages on the
normal network layer, see a Google search for "position determination service
order".
