Sorry, but you've got your facts completely wrong here.  Mormons very 
much consider themselves a Christian church; in fact, they consider 
their church to be the restoration of the church Christ originally 
established.  Jesus is a divine figure in the LDS church. He's 
considered the literal son of God the Father; he's also considered the 
creator of the Earth, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, and a god in his 
own right.
