"The survey showed that between 69 percent and 95 percent of respondents favored granting police additional powers to tap telephones or intercept voice mail or e-mail, as well as to hold foreign terrorist suspects indefinitely. 

'One sacrifice Americans said they are willing to make is in their civil liberties,' the newspaper said."

NO NO NO ---- 69% to 95% (what the fuck does that mean?  Junior-high school students couldn't get away with that kind of 'statistics' nonsense) of Americans are ready to give up OTHER people's civil liberties, since they themselves have nothing in their brains that anyone could possible be interested in.

They obviously have no concerns about wiretapping, or holding "foreign terror suspects" because all they do is sit around and watch AOL and Disney-TV.
