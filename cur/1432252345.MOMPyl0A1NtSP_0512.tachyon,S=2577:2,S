I'd consider is just a publicity stunt. A proof of principle that you
can abuse the proprietary platforms. Nothing really unexpected, but, 
still nice to see Nyan cat with FB as a transport layer.

I think grainy video (my, that's sure a crappy CMOS sensor) has lots more
of payload bandwidth. Plenty of telecommuters working from home.
Lots of standing video channels.
