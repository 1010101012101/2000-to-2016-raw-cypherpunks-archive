I really won't matter what they prohibit, it will get out into the market 
anyway if its cheap enough to manufacture and there is sufficient 
demand.  Cellular jammers, which should be much more expensive to make than 
those for RFID, are a good example.  AFAIK they are illegal for the average 
citizen to posses one, yet they are as close as your browser to purchase.
