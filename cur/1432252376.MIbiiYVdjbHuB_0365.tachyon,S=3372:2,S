Well, I guess once you need a 3rd party for the e$, it's only going to make 
sense that the issuer offer a "value added" service like you're talking 
about. A 3rd party verifier is probably going to be too costly.

But I'm not 100% convinced that you HAVE TO have a 3rd party verifier, but 
it's looking like that's what's going to make sense 99% of the time anyway.
