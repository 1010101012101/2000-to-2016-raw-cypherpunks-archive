You just bought not only the false presumption, but a logical
impossibility - without knowledge in detail of the CIA's actual
actions, I am unable to prove their violations.

Are you suggesting CIA, NSA, FBI, etc ought do what they will, except
ath someone is able to say that what they've been doing is not in U.S.
best interest? That sounds inane.

I am not even in U.S. nor a U.S. citizen - to me your statement sounds
highly problematic and indicative and problematic nationalist think.

Yes we need a balance of powers in the world - we need national
strength and unity, but this applies to all countries, not just to the
U.S.!

Collections of power, as happens with govt, attract more power abusers
than benevolent dictators, unfortunately. For this reason, a one world
government would be doomed from the outset. We need a strong Russia, a
strong America, and strong small countries etc.

It's the only hope for any long term semblance of balance. If the
world we a single U.S.A.W. entity, Snowden could never have happened.
Of course Snowden required a courageous individual too, but it would
have required someone willing to actually give up the rest of their
life if there were no possbility of sanction anywhere in the world.

You might reconsider your push to have someone other than yourself
somehow prove that the CIA's actions over the decades have not been in
U.S. best interests, or that this is a relevant question!
