On page 61 of the November issue of Analog there is an ad for the book, "Spin 
State" by Chris Moriarty (www.bantamdell.com). The book is alleged to be "A 
thrilling high-end upgrade of cyberpunk."  Has anybody read it?

Of some suspicion is Brin's recommendation "Science fiction for grownups who 
want some 'wow' with their 'what-if.'"

The ad writes about the book;  "UN Peacekeeper Major Catherine Li is hiding 
secrets about her past. And in a post-human universe of emergent AIs, genetic 
constructs, and illegal wetware, one misstep in her hunt for a killer could 
literally blow her mind."

If anybody has the read the book or knows if the book is pro-freedom please 
let me know.
