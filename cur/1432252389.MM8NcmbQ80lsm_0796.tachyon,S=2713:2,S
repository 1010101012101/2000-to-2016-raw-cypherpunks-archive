"Sublimation of an element or substance is a conversion between the solid
and the gaseous states with no liquid intermediate stage."

"sublimation:
"in physics, conversion of a substance from the solid to the vapour state
without its becoming liquid. An example is the vaporization of frozen
carbon dioxide (dry ice) at ordinary atmospheric ..."

Yep.
