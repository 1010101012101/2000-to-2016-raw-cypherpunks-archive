I've been pondering that.  I wonder if Jeff's significant other might be 
willing to provide some critical dimensions, and if those dimensions
might be a, err, a public key of sorts, for decrypting the pattern,,,

That's why I use Reply-All, to see who is in the To: and Cc: fields, and 
remove stuff I don't want there.

Anyone who thinks this is a private email just because I left John's addy
in the To: line needs to learn more about mailing lists, and how easy it
is to manipulate and forge electronic documents.

John, be sure to note this email, and if any part of it is used as evidence,
be sure it is complete.

If incomplete data is presented, yeah, that would be an easy conclusion.
Hence this post, to call attention to such things.
