i agree completely on all of the sad realities related to the
non-existence of pervasive hw crypto facilities.

the power consumption argument is a strawman though. the VIA docs
stated a power consumption difference when XSTORE is configured and
polled frequently vs. explicitly disabled and unused. the details are
fuzzy though, and i suspect it's the rest of the pipeline around
actual use of HWRNG state and moving across cache/bus lines...

i would be curious to know the power details on any of the hw entropy
sources, if any are out there.

best regards,
