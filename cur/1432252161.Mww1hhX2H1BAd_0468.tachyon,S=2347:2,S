Non-sense.  Surveillance was almost unknown.  Postal and physical searches 
rare and anyone desiring private conversations could just walk out into a 
field with the other party(s).

The Founders desired that Congress have the most authority and the 
President be essentially a manager.  From the Washington's first term 
presidents have sought to broaden their powers. Until Lincoln they were 
mainly rebuffed by Congress, the courts and (indirectly) the 
states.  Lincoln you should recall illegally suspended habeas corpus, 
threatened to jail the Chief Justice, shut down newspapers and jailed 
editors that in almost any way criticized Abe.  It was the illegal passage 
of the 14th Amendments that helped put an end to whatever degree of state 
autonomy which had been recognized and ushered in a vastly more power 
federal government, including the President.
