    You are what you eat? Federal agents are tracking suspects tied to
    the Sept. 11 strikes through supermarket club cards that may give a
    hint of ethnic tastes. "Time was, this data was so disorganized
    nobody could make sense of it, but not anymore. They're looking for
    people based on their supermarket tastes," says consultant Larry
    Ponemon, head of the Privacy Council business consortium. "Trouble
    is, there's so much bad data out there, and how do your know if
    someone eats like a terrorist?" he asks.
