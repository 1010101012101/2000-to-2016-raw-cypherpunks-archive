Think more literally here.  The prisoners are the entire population of 
accused persons.  If all the accused (in all cases in the Injustice 
System) were to reject plea bargaining and insist on a jury trial, then 
prosecutors would be spread more thin, and would not be able to extort 
confessions as they do now.

Do you have any evidence at all for this assertion?  It seems to me that 
you've been taken in by Big Brother's propaganda.  On a regular basis I 
hear about corrupt judges who act as a second prosecutor, and actively 
prevent the accused from presenting any effective defense by disallowing 
crucial evidence and even telling them what arguments they can make. 
 Too often, the prosecution just needs to convict somebody to keep their 
numbers high, or police need to make arrests because they've allocated a 
certain portion of the departmental budget to come from forfeitures.
