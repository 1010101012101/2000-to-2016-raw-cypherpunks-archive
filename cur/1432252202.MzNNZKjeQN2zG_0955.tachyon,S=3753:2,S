Well, I guess I agree. However, there is some issues of Cypherpunkly 
importance here, particularly concerning nation-states fighting other 
nation-states. Though I can't consider myself a true-believing anarchist, my 
own personal reason for continuing to post on the subject was to illustrate 
that, as long as Group-of-Bandits X continues to utilize our tax dollars to 
fuck over geographically removed Group of Bandits Y (and their citizenry), 
then some form of local resistance a la Blacknet (and arguably more drastic 
measures) might be called for, irregardless of how much Group-of-Bandits X 
(and their hypnotized citzenry) believe they're marching on God's orders.
