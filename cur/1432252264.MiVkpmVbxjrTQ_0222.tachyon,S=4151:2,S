The difference between 100% and 70% is not great. It serves the same purpose.

(Many estimate the tax burden to be in this ballpark, considering 
that income to non-governmental agencies is taxed at a high rate 
(usually the max, 50 % combined federal and state), then the income 
and dividends to employees and shareholders is further taxed at a 
high rate (30-45%). Tack on property taxes, utility taxes, 8% sales 
taxes, energy taxes, special use permit taxes, boat taxes, luxury 
taxes....)

These united states have allowed themselves to become something far, 
far worse than what the colonists were revolting against.

A kleptocracy, with a Potemkin facade of freedom.
