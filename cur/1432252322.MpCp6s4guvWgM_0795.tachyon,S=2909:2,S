The answer to both those questions is
extremely dependent on the message formats
(plus whether the public keys are published :-)
PGP's formats may be ugly bit-twiddly stuff,
but they're also highly visible unless you're using the
add-on stealth packages.  Most of the other formats
for expressing bignum data also tell you how big the numbers are
(or use a fixed-length key.)  Some signature algorithms
produce output that's shorter than the public key
(such as 160-bit signatures), but if you can find the
public key you can obviously tell.

But for the second question, why bother?  Use adequately long keys.
