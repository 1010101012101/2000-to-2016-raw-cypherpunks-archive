(I'll admit it, I'm a crypto weenie.  I know enough to spell RSA and DSA
correctly, and that's about it.)

Does anyone have any pointers to informative papers (especially analyses and
critiques) to RSA and DSA in particular, and in general, signature
algorithms?  The only page I've found is in the RSA Labs FAQ, and (obviously)
digs into DSA.  A co-worker is generating some SSH keys, and it's been some
time since I actually looked into either algorithm.  PuTTY recommends you
avoid DSA, which was a bit of a surprise to me, and prompted this thus-far
fruitless search for comparisons/critiques.
