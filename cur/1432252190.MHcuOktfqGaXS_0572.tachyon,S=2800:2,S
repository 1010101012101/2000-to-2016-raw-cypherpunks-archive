What intrigues me about this conflict is that it seems possible for
ordinary citizens to have the same kind of access to attack that the state
does. So speaking of "the mainlanders" or "Taiwan likes" may be misplaced.
Of course, most private citizens won't be able to do much with it, but
there may be some who will.

I agree with you with respect to the mainland and Taiwanese governments,
though.
