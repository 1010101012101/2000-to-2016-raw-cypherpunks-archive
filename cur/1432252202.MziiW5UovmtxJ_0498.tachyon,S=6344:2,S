1st off if someone is indigenous it is not the same as being native
polish > mayb u r ignorant of indigenous information AND if an
indigenous person wants to talk about it 2 times on a list i think
that is interesting not something to censor > i am not interested in
censoring or being censored that is one reason i am interested in
opensource and you would think that if someone is interested in
opensource they would b able to see how that is applicable beyond that
of software and the ramifications therein

otherwise i really dont need a daddy but thanks anyway - i find your
comments incredibly rude and purposefully degrading and quite the
contrary to your last sentence which calls for discussion > i dont
think you are modeling any kind of way to be open to discussing at all

as for your argument re the road i think it would not hold up in court
as the road builder would never be held responsible > so in the US the
state certifies roads afterwords so the state agency in the US anyway
would be liable so...

attacking someones form in an argument is really easy and doesnt show
an expansive form from the attacker it just shows they lack a
formidable argument and hence they loose credibliity and dont engage
ethics which is really sad
