Cryptome's offer to sell itself and logs for the amount Omidyar
is tax writing off  at The Intercept, and skying the donation for its archive
to the weekly stipend of top Snowden exploiters, is a parody of
what highly-profitable web sites like e-Bay, ISPs, equipment, program
and cybersecurity peddlers, and net operators and overseers are doing.

Access, traffic and transaction logs are ginned, sorted, stored, munged,
manipulated, sold, stolen, and more, all along the many packeting, hops,
boosts, diversions, conversions, hand-offs to various devices of the route
from user to destination. End point of user and the destination is merely
one bit of data, well, two bits, with gobs of bits quietly being gobbled
elsewhere, camouflaged by the delusion of privacy policies, anonymization,
and website log deletion or never ginning logs.

Cryptome has no logs, never has. Its various ISPs have copious logs of
many kinds (not just the simplistic access logs meant to delude website
operators), along with all the other transceivers of visitor activities and
transaction metadata and metametadata.

Cryptome has never run a server, just buy the service. We do track our
ISPs' activities and through them the ganglia of the Internet to see what
happens to our files.

Voracious bots have always been the heaviest users of Cryptome, siphoning
files hourly, daily, monthly, then providing them to users at other locations
to gin their own families of data for sale to govs, coms, edus, banks,
investigators, investors.

Google, Bing, Internet Archive, Torrent, drops, govs, spies, academics,
researchers, cyberseckers, take, steal actually (as do we), Internet files
for their own use which is primarily to gather data on users, the precious
jewels of the Internet which underwrite its so-called free service.

Public benefit aggregators like Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Google
docs, universities, NGOs, are the prime abusers of visitor data, both
to their websites and by special privilege of advising visitors on how
to protect their privacy while being pickpocketed of personal data.

Cybersecurity con artists are as bad by deluding their visitors and
customers about how to protect themselves with encryption, Tor,
anonymization, OTR, secret chats, deep web, blah, blah. All these
con artists gin their own logs of trusting-users data, then either
hand it over to authorities, sell it covertly, share with cohorts
and standards orgs, write papers and give speeches soliciting
customers, testify in Congress and courts, inform grand juries,
cut plea bargains, brag about resisting NSLs, set up warrant
canaries, share tips with donors and investors, yadda, yadda,
do donate generously, but best, generate taxable income,
tax write-offs, never-ending war, paranoia and FUD.

Cryptome has no privacy or security policy to deceive visitors, and
periodically announce that, and warn not to trust us or any other
website, especially those which advocate HTTPS, anonymization,
privacy, security and crow about civil liberties and public benefit.
