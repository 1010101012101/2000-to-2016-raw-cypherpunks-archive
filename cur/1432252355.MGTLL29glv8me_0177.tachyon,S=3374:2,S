ONLY with a high gain parabolic. Not with a omni. Further, all it takes to
find the other dish is look down that line of site.

They're cheap cards, less than $100 each. The 802.11a, which are higher

hit the street on or right after the 15'th of this month.

I'm going with 802.11a myself. The 'b' stuff seems a tad to kid toyish to
me. YMMV.
