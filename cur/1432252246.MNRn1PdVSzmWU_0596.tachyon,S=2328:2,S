I live in Bristol, in the west of England.  Despite what you say,
British and English flags are very common indeed.  They fly on cars,
are displayed on the walls in pubs, appear on clothing, and even on
people's faces -- particularly before sporting events.

Because Bristol is just across the river from Wales, we also see
a LOT of Welsh dragons.

Mind you, flags have been commonly and prominently displayed in most
of the countries I have lived in (including Japan, India, and Pakistan
as well as the United States) and travelled through (France, for
example).  And we mustn't forget the republican flags on display all
over Belfast.
