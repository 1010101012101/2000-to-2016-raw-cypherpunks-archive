The Elseviers compete with the xxx.lanls.  As do journals that charge
the author to publish with those that don't.  Etc.

Market manipulation is only done using violence.  Only the government
or other mafias manipulate markets.  The rest (aquisitions, proprietary
formats, bundling and giving it away free) is a perhaps more savage
ecosystem than you prefer, but that's life.

There is no such thing as DRM for analog content.  Only
for machine-executable interactive content (eg games).
The gamer-publisher vs. cracker war has been going on indefinately,
even when it was putting a slug into a pinball machine.

So? Think of it as free advertising for *nix.   And it works, too,
many have $witched.

I personally have no problem with intermediaries of any form going
extinct.
I have moral problems with tossing copyright out, but have learned
that the only way to prevent their weakening is a police state.

Unless 'trusted' stuff is *required*, people will decide, and they
need not decide homogenously.  If they decide foolishly, well,
that's their choice, evolution never sleeps.  As Schneier once
wrote, offer a free hamburger for DNA samples and they'll line up
around the block.

Are there no home-Mac users who work for entities that require PC usage?
