  <p align="left"><font size="5" color="#0054A6">About
us:<BR></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="5" color="#0054A6">
  </font>BusinessCardcdr.com is an industry specific
website where consumers, can find sources for blank media, duplication,
replication, and media content!&nbsp; We have an extensive marketing plan
scheduled for launch between Sept. 15th and Sept. 30th.&nbsp; This plan is
projected to bring in at least 10,000 targeted hits within the first month!</p>
<p align="left"><font size="5" color="#0054A6">What does this site have to
  offer? <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>If you sell any product or service in
the CD Business Card industry
this site could give you the most exposure available on the web!&nbsp; We offer
  several platforms of advertising for any budget in order to provide a quality
  service for our merchants, and a listing that will keep your potential
  customers coming back!&nbsp; Our website is divided into three sections
  including:<BR> 1.&nbsp; Business Card CD-R Sources - categorized as
companies who sell
  blank media<BR> 2.&nbsp; Duplication &amp; Replication Services - categorized
as companies who print, duplicate, replicate, or offer all of these
services<BR> 3.&nbsp;
Presentations and Media Content Sources - categorized as companies who produce
multimedia presentations such as Flash or Power Point. </p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">General Listings:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> 
Our general listings are sorted alphabetically by manufacturer or company
name.&nbsp; Each company listed is entitled to one listing per Silver
account. </p>

  <p align="left"><font size="4">Price Listings:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font> Price
  listings are part of the general listing page.&nbsp; They allow the user to
  sort companies based on the quantity of blank media desired in the Business
  Card CD-R Sources section, sort companies based on the quantity of
duplication
  desired on the Duplication &amp; Replication Services section, or sort based
  on price per hour in the Presentations and Media Content Sources Section.
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Main Page Listing:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>There
are only 10 main page listings available for each category.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
listings are the first thing that any visitor to our website sees.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Deluxe Listing:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>Deluxe
listings show at the top of the page when a visitor clicks more
results.&nbsp; These listings are the same as the top ten main page listings,
so users have two
chances to click anyone within the top ten.&nbsp; They are only listed until
the
user resorts the page by price or company.&nbsp; As the options would not be
accurate if they remained at the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
