        Not true at all. Biodiesel is being marketed in the US today at
competitive prices, and obviously, like anything else, economies of
scale would bring down that price. Ethanol is another one. Brazil run a
large portion of
it's vehicles on ethanol.
      Besides which, the true cost of gasoline at the pump would be
$10-15 @ gallon without all the gov't subsidies to the oil industry.
