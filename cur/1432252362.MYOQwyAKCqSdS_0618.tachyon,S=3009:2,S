They're out of the chain of command.  PMCs have already made the US
notorious overseas because of their antics.

They're able to negotiate their way around many of the laws and
regulations that apply to us ("Laws for thee but not for me.")

They aren't held to codes of conduct or oversight that police forces
are.  No accountability, either.

That makes them too big a risk and untrustworthy to mine eyes.

We don't allow it.  Entities that are incredibly rich and well
connected made it so, and there isn't anything anybody else can do
about it.

I hate to frob the pessimist bit this morning, but that's pretty much
what it boils down to.  Those who have the gold made the rules.
