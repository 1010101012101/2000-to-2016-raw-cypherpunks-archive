The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slightly, you wi|| stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wil| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
