No, both are true.



Bin Laden, associates elude spy agency's eavesdropping
By Scott Shane
Sun Staff
Originally published September 16, 2001

James Bamford, author of two books on the NSA, was told by agency
sources that in the late 1990s, NSA officers would sometimes play a tape
of bin Laden talking with his mother to impress visitors holding
high-level security clearances. But early this year, Bamford said, a
source told him that the agency "had totally lost bin Laden's calls."

"They lost all track of him," Bamford said. "It could be that he uses
couriers for really important communications. Or it could be he's using
encryption."

If it is true that the NSA can no longer monitor bin Laden's
communications - and the agency isn't saying - the loss might have
played a role in the failure of U.S. intelligence to pick up warning of
Tuesday's terrorist attacks. Officials have called bin Laden their prime
suspect.
