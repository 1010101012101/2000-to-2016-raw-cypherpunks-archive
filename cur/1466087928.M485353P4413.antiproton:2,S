It's not that easy.  The feds claim that each of those hidden cameras is 
linked to a federal investigation.  Which is probably total bullshit, but 
that's their claim.  I'm not sure how much room the mayor has to protest 
something like that.  Also, Ed Murray is a career politician and I don't 
think he's anti-LE.  Our previous mayor, Mike McGinn, probably would have 
put up a fight against such bullshit.  We owe a lot to Ed Murray for 
advancing LGBTQ equality, but he hasn't been a great mayor.

One other thing: local, state and federal LE get away with a hell of a lot 
by using Fusion centers.  They can really blur the lines of what is legal 
and who has jurisdiction by claiming joint operating protection.  It is an 
unbelievable amount of bullshit (put into place under Bush the Lesser and 
expanded by Obama.)  Combine that with other atrocities like parallel 
construction and you have the rogue police state we are now experiencing.
