  Obviously you're wasting time asking a stupid rhetorical question, 
since clearly you're
a paranoid loon.

  What malfeasance will the government in your fantasyland perform on 
the hundreds, or thousands
of people each day who might utilize the service to find out in general 
how the airport is functioning
at any particular time?

  Are you ASSuming that anyone who voluntarily gives their phone # & a 
flight # is
going to be expected to be a passenger on that flight, & thus subjected 
to whatever government evils
your sad little mind creates?    In the real world, plenty of friends, 
spouses, co-workers, etc. of the
traveling party may also *volunteer* to give their phone # & a flight # 
to check the flight.  Flight updates
SMS'ed yo cellular phones have already been done for years directly 
through most of the major airlines.

  Perhaps the FAA should cancel the service, in order for you to sleep 
better at night...
