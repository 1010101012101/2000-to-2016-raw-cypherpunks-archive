Late news: Just saw Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri calling for an 
investigation into "criminal voting fraud" by the Democrat political 
machine in St. Louis and the lower court judge (if he was appointed 
by Democrats, the jig's up). Ashcroft faces a very, very, very close 
election, and that extra blast of welfare roll voters may have been 
enough to defeat him.

Mighty niggardly of the Democrats, I'd say. Spooky, in fact.
