In a society where a significant part of an individual's life is spent
nonproductively and high productivity generally means high education and
learned skills, extension of the individual's life significantly beyond the
time required to learn these skills is a must in order for the average
individual to break even with the cost of education and upbringing. Of
course, this perhaps does not imply care of the elderly. This is not at
issue here.

Quite. I argue that should hold beyond their individual capability to pay
for the care.

How is this? If the premise holds, it is beneficial to make health care
ubiquitously available. This cannot be achieved if some people are allowed
to opt out of the gamble.

Which is pretty much what I'm after.

It is far more effective to not put money into their sustenance early on.

By making sure the people are completely dependent on the state, probably
through some pretty unfair engineering of contracts you cannot avoid if you
are to stay alive.
