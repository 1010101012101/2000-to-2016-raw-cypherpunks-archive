You don't need a specific radio broadcaster in your PC.
Lots of things leak electrically and radiate signals,
some useful and easy to decode.  Just because it's not useful to YOU
doesn't mean it's not useful to an eavesdropper.
Video cards, monitors and keyboards are among the loudest.
Laptop CRT screens are rumored to be much quieter, but it's not so,
at least for most laptops which have an unshielded VGA plug on them
so you can plug in a real monitor.
				Thanks!
