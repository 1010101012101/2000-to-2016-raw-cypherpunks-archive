Let's say you run a piece of buggy PHP code as a hidden 
service, on a mass hoster allowing easy signups and installation
of own code, with no hard separation of service hosted, and possibly 
not even firewall the VM traffic, forcing it through Tor.

While it's possible they knew the physical host already,
there are certainly far easier ways to nail your ass, given
the above.

It would be interesting to post a hidden service with actionable
content as a honeypot with everything done right, to see what the 
parallel construct story would emerge. No, I'm not volunteering.
