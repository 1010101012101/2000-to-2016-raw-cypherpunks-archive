In fact, the companies that made copying software got a lot of business 
(and hence stayed in business, funded more copying work, etc.) from 
_fully legal customers_ who wanted to ensure that they had backups of 
critical software. Everybody I knew had "Copyiipc" from Central Point 
Software in Portland, OR. They were not copying games, they were 
copying critical disks with their CAD, spreadsheed, accounting, and 
other business apps on them.

Yeah, sometimes these people gave copies to friends. Who often bought 
the program if their businesses would benefit (manuals, support, 
updates, etc.). But the main reason was for ensurance (not a word, but 
it fits with ensure vs. insure).

As the saying goes, the lessons of the past are learned anew by each 
generation...
