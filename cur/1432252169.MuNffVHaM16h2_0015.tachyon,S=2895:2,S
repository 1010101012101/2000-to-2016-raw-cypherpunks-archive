US regulators eye Bitcoin supervision [1].  See also [2,3].  Sample:

     * Senior officials at a top U.S. financial regulator are
       discussing whether Bitcoin, the controversial cybercurrency,
       might fall under their regulatory remit.

     * Bitcoin "is for sure something we need to explore," Bart
       Chilton, one of the five commissioners at the Commodity Futures
       Trading Commission told the Financial Times.  A person familiar
       with the CFTC's thinking said that the regulator is "seriously"
       examining the issue.


Now the fun begins!  Enjoy the show!  Or better yet, be part of it!
