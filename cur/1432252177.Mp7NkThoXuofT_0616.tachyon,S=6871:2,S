VIA and LocustWorld Secure Wireless Mesh Networks with VIA PadLock High-Speed
Encryption
On-die security features in the latest VIA processors enable AES Encryption
at blistering speeds from LocustWorld.s MeshAP-Pro

Taipei, Taiwan, September 23rd 2004 - VIA Technologies, Inc, a leading
innovator and developer of silicon chip technologies and PC platform
solutions, today announced that the MeshAP-Pro from LocustWorld is the first
commercial product to support the hardware-based VIA PadLock ACE (Advanced
Cryptography Engine), allowing it to encrypt and decrypt data traveling
through the mesh at very high speeds.

.Security is a vital part of any wireless network and is an increasingly
important issue as adoption of last mile technologies, such as mesh
networking, mature and become more widespread,. commented Wai Sing Lee, a
security consultant at Frost & Sullivan. .Strong cryptography and
certification can be used to build a highly secure wireless network..

The LocustWorld MeshAP-Pro application is used by commercial wireless network
operators around the world to provide widespread wireless broadband Internet
services over wide areas where each node in the mesh network automatically
interconnects with its neighbors to form a large scale, self organizing
network. Traffic over the network is encrypted using digital certificates and
dynamically generated private keys, making the mesh extremely secure, so as
traffic increases, gateways become loaded with the overhead of handling
multiple simultaneous cryptographic connections. By utilizing the VIA PadLock
ACE, LocustWorld MeshAP-Pro enables meshbox gateways to deliver additional
performance in extremely heavily loaded networks while maintaining
uncompromisingly high-level certificated security throughout the mesh.

.Using the on-die AES encryption from the latest VIA processors we can
achieve an encryption layer with hardly any overhead on the CPU,. said
Richard Lander, CEO of LocustWorld. .Network performance using the VIA
PadLock ACE is close to the speed of un-encrypted communications, achieving
high-strength encryption without the associated performance impact, even on
large networks with high traffic. The result is virtually transparent
encryption..

.The MeshAP-Pro is a great example of how compact power efficient devices
based on VIA processors can enable industry leading security without
affecting normal system performance,. said Steven S. Lee, Head of the VIA
Embedded Platform Division, VIA Technologies, Inc. .Together with innovators
like LocustWorld, we are taking the lead in the move to ubiquitous security
where security operations can be carried out natively by every system in a
network..

Inter-operation between VIA PadLock ACE enabled nodes and other nodes that
execute their encryption through software is ensured by the use of industry
standard AES encryption, so. mesh administrators can utilize VIA PadLock ACE
enabled systems for heavily used nodes to interconnect and make certificated
encrypted connections with older or peripheral nodes with lower data
throughput capacity.

"The VIA PadLock ACE is a great tool, enabling us to extend the power, speed
and scale of our wireless mesh networks further, without losing out on
performance,. added Jon Anderson, CTO of LocustWorld. .The VIA PadLock
ACE-assisted Wireless Mesh gives high speed, secure, wireless networking a
very significant performance boost."

The LocustWorld MeshAP-Pro has been certified through the VIA PadLock
Certification Program that is designed to assist independent software
developers in optimizing their products for the VIA PadLock Hardware Security
Suite. More information on the VIA PadLock ACE is available from the VIA
PadLock Hardware Security Suite website.

About the VIA PadLock Security Initiative
Comprising the VIA PadLock Hardware Security Suite and VIA PadLock Software
Security Suite, the VIA PadLock Security Initiative is focused on providing
key hardware and application level security building blocks that can be
easily integrated into any computing and communications infrastructure.

The VIA PadLock Hardware Security Suite is integrated into VIA C5P Nehemiah
core processors and features the VIA PadLock RNG for high quality key
generation and the VIA PadLock ACE (Advanced Cryptography Engine) for high
speed performance of the US government approved Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES). The VIA PadLock Software Security Suite consists of the VIA PadLock
SDK, the VIA PadLock ZIP utility and source code and the VIA PadLock
Tru-Delete utility and source code.
