I came up with a similar approach in the late '80s (I may have even 
discussed it on the list a year or so back).  I was interested in 
compressing image data, which has quite a bit of inter-pixel 
correlation.  My approach was to run a Hilbert space filling curve through 
the image (it looks like a tightly wound maze).  This allows one to 
maintain most of the pixel correlation while transforming from an array to 
line.  Then I analyzed the auto correlation of the runs of various lengths 
and attempted to create generators which could produce the required 
combinations/permutations and auto correlations to code for the runs.  I 
say attempted, because I was never able to find acceptable algorithms to 
satisfy my requirement.  I still believe these algorithms exist, it was 
just my limitations in identifying the underlying math needed.
