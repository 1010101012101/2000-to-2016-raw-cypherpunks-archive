"...Freeh turns out to be more Clark Kent than Superman. The FBI pursues 
Wen Lo Hee for a genuinely substantial piece of espionage - selling missile 
technology to the Chinese. The only problem is, he's innocent. Then it 
turns out the FBI has messed up the Oklahoma investigation, Freeh falls out 
with Bill Clinton, the Khobar Towers investigation falls prey to Saudi 
government intransigence and the Senate launches an investigation into what 
by this time is being dubbed the 'Fumbling Bunch of Idiots'. The FBI boss 
does catch Hanssen, but as the latter has been spying since 1980 no-one is 
terribly impressed. Freeh steps down early, his career, a bit like the 
Soviet Union, fizzling out unlamented.

Vise sets out to shock us with a tale of human evil, yet Hanssen comes over 
as merely a bit sad. What Vise does succeed in doing is shedding some light 
on an intelligence establishment which has been malfunctioning for decades."
