My bet the purpose of the looting was to allow the planting of all kids
of "documents" like this.  If they were in a hurry to destroy documents,
fire would have worked pretty damn well, not white out.

Some of the most dangerous hypocrites on the planet.  But we'll see if
this is similar to the Russian invasion in '68 (they just took cz) or the
German invasion of Poland in '39.  In any case, those empires collapsed,
so there's hope the American empire will collapse too.  The Berlin wall
didn't come down 'till '89 tho, so it could be a while yet before the US
grinds to a halt.

Patience, persistence, truth,
