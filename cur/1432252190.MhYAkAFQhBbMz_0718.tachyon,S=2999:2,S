has a very entrenched industry dealing with "processing" people the cops
pick up. This has only gotten worse since Bloomberg and his "quality of
life" racket. Breathing Without ID is essentially a crime that costs a
day of your life, not less than ~$200, and a lot of humiliation. I
thought the San Francisco cops were bad, before I moved here. (My
friend was even told by the cops what to expect, and how best to optimize 
for getting out quickly. Kafka would have trouble doing better.)

recently where someone was ticketed after their child's balloon popped
in public. A noise infraction. Quality of live, indeed.  "There are no 
quotas, but if you don't meet them, you're on report."

This is one of the 'applications' for Zombie Patriots.  Set up those practicing tyranny under color of the law for a quick trip to the coroner.  Bring the fun of Hammas to New York.
