The reward will be paid for information passed on in person to US 
authorities in a place/time of
their chosing.This rules out 99 % of those who might actually be close 
enough to know anything.
It also places them in immediate personal danger.Why isnt the reward 
encrypted as described in
AP? And before sandy starts up again,if AP is so unrealistic,why was a SS 
agent required to assist
10 plainclothes federal and state police take my computer away four months 
ago.I wish sandy
would explain to them how hopeless AP is.The main reason I think they wont 
encrypt is because
they dont want it used on them,just like they regularly threaten to use 
nukes yet back off when
they see it can boomerang on them.Cypherpunks should expose this craven 
cowardice or ...just say so.
