Forcing those in power *not* to look back at us, and granting ourselves 
greater ability to visualise power's actions, are not mutually exclusive 
goals. We should be doing both, including methods to hide ourselves and 
to better monitor and hold accountable those in power.

Of course, those monitoring are often punished, so necessarily the 
ability to monitor *and* hide go hand in hand.

In other words I reckon the approach of fighting mass surveillance 
(including acknowledging that corporations are NOT people and their 
surveillance is qualitatively different from my private CCTV system) and 
pushing for greater transparency, in tandem with mass-crypto and 
ubiquitous sousveillance, is exactly the right thing to do..and it's 
more or less what I think we're doing already globally with the 
cypherpunk, pirate party, and eff-ist movements.
