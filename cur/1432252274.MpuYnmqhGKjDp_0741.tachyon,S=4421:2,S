Fact: I forwarded *A* message to UUNET, which is the upstream NSP for the
spammer-to-be's ISP.  The forwarded message had both your comment, AND the
actual offending email.  I have already (REPEATEDLY) acknowledged that the
part with your commentary was forwarded in error.  How about YOUR
acknowledgements?  How about addressing my POINTS?

I *absolutely* agree with this statement, and wish you would cut the crap.

Is that all?  Don't you think that prior to choosing such a wide brush you
should (as a "responsible journalist" of course) have maybe (JUST
MAYBE) done a little homework?  

Do you deny that your "piece" was little more than an "I'll show him not
to fuck with *ME*" excersize in chest beating?

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
