Wow, what a response, at least in private! Four of you have so far 
contacted me about the Watch List, asking "out of curiousity" if they 
are on the list or if the list is available online someplace. (One of 
the four got the message from a forwarding by a list member here. I 
really wish you, "E.L.," would not forward messages to unrelated lists.)

But I need a fifth name. HomeSec promised my own name would be removed 
if I provided the name of _five_ (5) other suspects.

And I need to get off that list by April 1st, which has been designated 
Roundup Day.
