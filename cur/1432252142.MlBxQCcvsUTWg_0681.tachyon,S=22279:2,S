As you might have seen from a comment of mine on the Cypherpunks list nearl=

rently limited to a minimum donation of 1.0 Bitcoin, or (currently) about 8=
64 dollars.=A0 I have hesitated to carefully study that system to understan=
d why the minimum is there (for reasons that should be obvious!), but it ma=

 phenomenon has occurred over the last 1.8 months.=A0 =0A=0APeople should b=
