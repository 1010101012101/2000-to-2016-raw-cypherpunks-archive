o your funny

there is actually a lot in common that libertarians and anarchists have but
it is bent differently - i dont agree that there is scarcity and live in
intense fear that i wont get lotsa stuff - i think we have abundance and
the very idea of scarcity is a con game the elite and the autocrats feed
everyone fr before they are born so that they can exploit them

i find the houses that look like restaurants or hotels that i have seen in
the suburbs that outline washington dc are repulsive and i find it
repulsive that there are people that have no potable water on the planet
and cannot read or write - i would rather people and everything were
treated and thought of as more equal
