No one believes legislation, least of all those who write 
them.  Everyone believes Webster's dictionary.

If the legislators believed that, why would they authorize 
the president to make war on a country to be determined in
order to punish it for terrorism?

The word terrorism is most commonly applied to the acts of 
governments, for example "the great terror", "the red 
terror".  Terrorism is a public good, thus only governments 
can efficiently supply terrorism.   The use of the word for 
non government actions is a response to events in the middle 
east.  For a long time everyone took for granted that only 
governments can supply terrorism, just as many today take for 
granted that only governments can issue money or build 
pavements.
