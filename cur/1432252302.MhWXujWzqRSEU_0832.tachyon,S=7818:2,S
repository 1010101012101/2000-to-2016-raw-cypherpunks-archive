Reply-To: liberationtech <liberationtech@lists.stanford.edu>

I would be interested to know whether this system involves any automated
tracking, such as a database of SIMs that are updated by default via SMS
when the relevant women's SIM passes immigration, etc.

It seems likely it is simply a database registry, cross referencing contact
information of male guardians with the respective woman being monitored.

In effect this means the men may also be tracked, at least their phones are
registered in a central database.

It seems the practicalities around how such a system functions may be an
effective way to organize Saudi men around a campaign? I guess it depends
whether, culturally, such a database of male SIMs is considered an
unacceptable invasion of privacy.

Thanks for the heads up!
