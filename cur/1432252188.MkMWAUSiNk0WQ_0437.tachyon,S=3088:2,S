Something I don't see much of on the efxnet page - "why?"

This is in the FAQ:
"EFNext is the name of a project geared towards making IRC a more stable,
    uniform, chat environment."

and they say "introductory document coming soon." I still don't know why
this is happening (I don't hang out on EFnet). What do the efxnet people
give as their reasons for a new IRC network?
