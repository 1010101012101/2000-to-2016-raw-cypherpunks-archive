SSH java applets exist:

http://www.appgate.com/ag.asp?template=products&level1=product_mindterm

http://javassh.org/

Therefore, you could simply publish the java ssh client of your choice on
an off-site web server of your choice, then hit that web server from
behind your proxy using HTTPS (on the standard port 443) using IE or
Netscape, etc., and accomplish your goal.  No tunneling needed - just
plain old https traffic.  The ssh traffic flows only between the off-site
web server publishing the applet and the host you direct it to ssh into.
