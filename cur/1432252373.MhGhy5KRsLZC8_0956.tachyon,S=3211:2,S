It's not that straightforward, because Postol has a security clearance,
so he's under more restrictions than somebody who doesn't.

If he obtained the information entirely from already-public sources,
as opposed to obtaining documents with classification markings
that don't also have declassification markings on them,
he should be safe from prosecution, but that doesn't mean they
can't pop his security clearance for it.
