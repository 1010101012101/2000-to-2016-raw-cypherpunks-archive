He means Chaumian blinding protocol for transferring a single IOU from  
Alice to Bob.  A Chaum blinded transfer ensures that the issuer Ivan  
cannot trace the transfer from Alice to Bob, in this case it gives  
untraceability (as opposed to anonymity or psuedonymity).

(I suspect...)

Chaumian mixing is a completely different thing to Chaum's blinding formula.
