Several operators of Cypherpunks nodes have gotten tired of the topic 
or the running of nodes and have moved on to other things. Even those 
still running nodes rarely have anything to post themselves.

Those remaining on the remaining nodes, or at least the ones posting, 
are mainly eurotrash lefties and American collectivists who just don't 
get it.

As none of the alternatives to lne.com are what I'm looking for in a 
node, I expect to do most of my future posting to alt.cypherpunks. This 
newsgroup has been in existence for a bunch of years and periodically 
gets interesting threads. A few sock puppets have been spamming it, but 
filters are readily available to screen out the crud.

The advantage of a newsgroup is that all the distribution and 
propagation issues are handled more or less automagically, The 
disadvantages are well-known, but are not much worse than with some of 
today's nodes (subject to long delays, dropped articles, etc.).

Another advantage is that the address will be more or less known to 
anyone, at all times.

Also, no "friendly chats" by Feebs with the operators of a site.  And 
virtually no chance of shutting down a newsgroup.
