Subject: More detailed queries of what Google stores

I asked two very specific questions in a conversation with John
Battelle, and he's received unequivocal answers from Google:

1) "Given a list of search terms, can Google produce a list of people
   who searched for that term, identified by IP address and/or Google
   cookie value?"

2) "Given an IP address or Google cookie value, can Google produce a
   list of the terms searched by the user of that IP address or cookie
   value?"

The answer to both of them is "yes".
