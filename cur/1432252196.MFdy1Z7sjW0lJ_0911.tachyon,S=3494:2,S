Very strange - the article headline and subtitle are seriously
at odds with the contents of the article.
Sounds like the headline editor has much different opinions than
Bob Woodward and the primary authors.

It's about the 1147 people detained in the anti-terror dragnet.
Only 185 of them have problems with their immigration papers.
The Washington Post identified 235 of them, and tried to figure out
what strategies the Feds are using to pick their targets.
The Feds, of course, assert that for except the people being held as
material witnesses, all of the detainees violated some law or other.
Evidence suggests otherwise, and most of them have not been charged
with any crime.

Lots of detail.
