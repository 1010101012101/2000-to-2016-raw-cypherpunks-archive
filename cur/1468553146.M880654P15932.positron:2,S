I'm saying you're a trolling nutjob. Nutjob.

It's not 'the rest'. It's 'a few'.

There's a difference Nutjob.

I don't get facts from the police. If and when it occurs I get
INFORMATION from them.

There's a difference ... Nutjob.

There's an "orchestrasted institutional slander campaign", by people who
have a bone to pick with ioerror, and it doesn't seem to be the 'bone'
that allegedly got rammed up their allegedly unwilling asses or else
there's be a police report from ONE OF THEM by now, and for your
information, NUTJOB, I have no friends that came from ANYTHING related
to computers or the industry. I make acquaintances with Libertarian
psychopaths (like you nutjob), I don't befriend them.
