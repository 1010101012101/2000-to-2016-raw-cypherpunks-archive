<html><h3>WOW!</h3><br><h4>We had a high demand for our products lately, leading to some down time on our web servers. We are installing higher powered servers, so meantime use this <a href="http://206.115.67.162/cp/cgi-bin/start.cgi/18055CIM00">link, click here</a> until we are up on our full traffic servers. The site is fully functionable, and our products still only take a few days to ship to your door.</h4><br><h5>Any "Remove" requests are still in progress, and we are working hard to remove any unwanted emails. Thank you for your support.</h5><br>
