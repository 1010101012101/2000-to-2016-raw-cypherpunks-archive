Interrogators check out each confession.  First ones won't work, bogus
keys.  Just noise.  Second confession reveals pork recipes hidden in
landscape
pictures.  Beneath that layer of filesystem is stego'd some
porn.  Beneath that, homosexual porn.    But your interrogators
want the address book stego'd beneath that.  They know that these
are stego distraction levels, uninteresting to them.  You'll give it to
them eventually.  If you give them a believable but fake one,
it will damage innocents or true members of your association.

My comments were written with that in mind.  I'm familiar with
filesystems
(etc) with layers of deniable stego.

I wonder how quickly one could incinerate a memory card in the field
with high success rate?   Destroy the data and the passphrases don't
help.
