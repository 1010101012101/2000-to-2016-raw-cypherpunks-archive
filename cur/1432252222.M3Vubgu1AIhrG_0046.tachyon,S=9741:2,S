Calm down there Spikey! Very wild west attitude. Proper governance and
peace still beat that. Contracts can be awesome!

Now, this is legit advice. FISA would likely wreck you though. The whole
design is pretty ripe for corruption. Thing is also, they genuinely believe
they're enhancing public safety and all that. If the Commander in Chief
thinks this is a good idea, who's to stop democracy from giving the people
what they want*?

Reg Canaries, I don't think they work. Why would they? It depends on the
phrasing of the gag order, of course, but indirectly saying you got had is
still saying it, so I agree with OP's lawyer.

* typically this somehow involves bloodshed, so I guess gag orders are a
kindness? Maybe Bill's at the right end. Sometimes I'm so happy I'm not in
a lesser democrazy.
