To be fair.. maybe it helps to examine the software environment extant at the time pgp was developed.. ie macos was the gui($$$$), AUX had just been abandoned by apple. of the day... and dos 3.0 , unix releases were SCO Microport and Interactive/ all based on Att 5.3.2 sources except for microport which was SVR4, Linux did NOT exist nor did crypto libraries bsd/386 was an unforfilled promise and almost no private individual could afford a sun pizza box to run bsd  and xenix was $$$$.. same for qnx(and non standard to boot).

. Almost EVERYTHING was command line dos windows 3.0 was just starting to become available

pgp 1.0 cli structure was loosely based on CryptMaster(an earlier paid product).

ie pgp 1.0 was posted/published from a tandon 60 laptop(i386) running a dos command line version of uucp. and additionally fido and sdn clients on the morning of june 5, 1991 from Santa Cruz,Ca.(this after weeks of prediscussion on the WELL...) then additional copys were posted from random upload points all over silicon valley for the next 96 hours.(yes the van/payphone part of the tale is true also, although the payhones wiring was generally directly accessed using a testset to allow connection of a trailblazer modem(preferred for 19.2kb uploads via uucp to usenet.)


     pgp 2.0 continues on from there and currently gnupg is the cli choice of script and integration...(albeit with several flaws security and cryptowise.)


pgp/gpg never was designed for ANYthing but CLI/script/filter/inline usage in the freeware opensource versions and typically people are incompetent at using CLI by far and large(even so called CS students)...
