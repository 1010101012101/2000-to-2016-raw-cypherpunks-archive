No it does not work the other way around.

Normal people killing nazis and commies is not equivalent to nazis and 
commies killing normal people, for normal people are a threat only to evil 
people, whereas nazis and commies are a threat to everyone, including their 
fellow nazis and commies

The jews really were not making war on western europe, germany, and the 
aryan race.  The nazis really were making war on western europe and the jews.
