Just a quick note of clarification, there is a collision
in the name Ian G.  4 letters does not a message digest
make.

Gaim-otr as I understand it is authored by Nikita Borisov
and Ian Goldberg <otr@cypherpunks.ca>.  It can be acquired
here:

   http://www.xelerance.com/mirror/otr/

and here are some other links:

   http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/000715.html

Just to confuse the issue I also am working on a private
instant messaging service which is markedly different, in
that I am taking a payment system and reworking it into an
IM system:

   http://www.financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000379.html

But I haven't got around to a download yet.  And it's not
AIM compatible, as it works through its host payment system.
