Jim:

This is the last time I'm going to respond to you on this
topic. Everyone else understands my point, and there's
a limit to how much effort I'm going to go to correct a
single obtuse individual.

$50 is nothing, of course. Requiring that each message to 
be encrypted with the final recipient's public key is far
from nothing. Sending 10^5 emails without encryption is trivial. 
Encrypting 10^5 emails is far from trivial. We're raising 
the cost to the spammer far more than we're adding to the 
effort of the remailer operator. You speak of gatewaying - 
who exactly is going to set up a free gateway to encrypt 
10^5 messages, each to a different public key? All that 
does is shift the cost to the gatewayer; it does not 
eliminate it.

Jim: go back to the genesis of this 
thread. The discussion was along the lines of "There are
too few remailers. Why?"

Among of the reasons cited are that remailer operators 
often get shut down by their ISPs or network poviders 
because of complaints from end recipients of messages -
they get spam, threats, illegal material, etc. It does
not matter that the remailer keeps no logs; the end
recipients mail server does, and that's enough for the
recipient's ISP (or the LEAs) to take action.

This situation not only gets remailers shut down; it
discourages people from starting them in the first 
place. My proposal makes using the remailer for
spam economically prohibitive, and ensures that
the only recipients are crypto-aware types, who are
far less likely to misunderstand what's going on
than J. Random Luser.

There you go again... Please read the thread. The goal
is not to 'stop spammers'. It's to 'Stop actions against 
remailers, some of which are caused by their 
misuse as spam conduits'. Preventing spam from exiting 
the remailers achieves that goal.

That's true. The use of doomed (since they'll be dropped 
before they leave the network) spam messages as cover 
traffic is something that occured to me as I wrote the 
letter. It is a nice side effect of my proposal, as
long as spammers continue to send doomed spam into the
system.

No Jim, I'm not talking about decreasing the load due to 
spam. I'm talking about making life easier for remailer 
operators. In the long run, it'll reduce spam as well, 
since spammers will learn not to include remailers which send
only encrypted mail in their remailer chains.

A remailer operator can operate his remailer in any way 
he or she wants, and so long as they publish their policies
and adhere to them, there is no basis for anyone to 
criticize them (this is a thing called 'freedom').

Jim: I think I'm beginning to appreciate the depth of 
your lack of comprehension.

Remailers do not encrypt anything. All the encryption 
steps are done by the originator of the message - 
successively encrypting the message with public
key of the recipient (an optional step in current
remailers), and then by the public key of each remailer 
in the chain working back to the originator.

Each remailer decrypts the message with it's private key,
All it knows is to send the inner contents on to the next 
remailer in the chain, or to the final recipient. This is 
how remailer chaining works today.

The only change I propose is that, if after applying it's
own public key to decrypt a message, the remailer notices
that the decrypted material does not match one of the well
known formats for encrypted messages (ie, it is likely
plaintext), that it drop the message. I won't discuss the
recognition algorithm here, since I have already done so
and others have even published sample code. It can be done.
