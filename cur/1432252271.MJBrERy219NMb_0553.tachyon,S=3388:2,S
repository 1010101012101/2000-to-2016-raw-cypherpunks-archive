Don't feel picked on.  I've noticed about 20/day...  About 220 since
Aug 19th.

Symptoms are:

A "Content-Type: application/x-compressed;" size of 0 or 8 bytes.
File, so far, is ALWAYS a .zip with names like "payment.zip",
"funny.zip", "account-details.zip", "test.zip"...  May have some text
designed to get you to open the .zip...

The message is supposed to be from your ISP complaining about your
account.

Personally, I think it is a virus with a 'bug' because my virus
filters have caught about the same number with much larger payloads.
