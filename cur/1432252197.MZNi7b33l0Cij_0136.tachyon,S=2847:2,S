The John Young Interpretation Society proffers these notes especially to
furriners:

1. John Henry --look it up, american folklore/song about man vs.
machine,
John H. lost to a railroad-nail driving machine.  An industrial Kasparov
vs. IBM.

2. Anthrac, quack quack,
derived from Aflac, some sort of US insurance company, which uses a
waterfowl
in its adverts, the bird's quacking sounding like the company name.
Quack is also
slang for sham doctor.   Nice multiple meanings there, soundplay, in
this one.

"Waitress, what kind of rhizome is that gentleman smoking?"
