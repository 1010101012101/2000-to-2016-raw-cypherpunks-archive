Lets not forget the lessons of the NYC Methadone "Maintenance" Programs
either.  While heroin results in crime due to high cost (by virtue of
illegalization), the legal version also creates crime due to it's high
cost.  The MMPs have the same "Money or else" position that the junkie
faces on the street, and while the prices are certainly lower, they are
NOT "low".  In 1983 a junkie expected to pay $40-$80 per *day* for
maintenance (I'm sure it's a lot higher today).  Along with legalization
must come the removal of monopoly practices such a single sourcing of the
drug and prescriptions to dispense.  Only then does the free market take
over and keep the price, and the crime, low.

I like the idea of belief in drug-prohibition as a religion in that it is
a strongly held belief based on grossly insufficient evidence and
bolstered by faith born of intuitions flowing from the very beliefs they
are intended to support.
