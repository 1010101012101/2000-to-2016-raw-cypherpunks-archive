         I was looking at archery sites this morning, looking for a
light recurve targe bow, and hit an Australian page that also had
crossbows -- was shocked to see that you need a permit to buy these
"prohibited weapons" there.  Doesn't take much to make a crossbow,
folks. Must be those Aussies watched Mad Max movies a few times too
many, eh?
