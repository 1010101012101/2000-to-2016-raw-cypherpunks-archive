SRI International Receives Security Technology Patent for Paper-based
Transactions

  MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 23, 2004--

 
 "Nonce Stamp" Offers Many Applications, Including Electronically
Downloaded Airline Tickets, Travelers Checks, Passports, Postage, Legal
Documents, and Event and Movie Tickets
  



 SRI International, a leading independent, nonprofit research institute
known for its pioneering innovations, today announced that it has been
issued a fundamental U.S. patent for its "nonce stamp" technology, which
can secure and authenticate paper documents against fraudulent creation and
use.

 U.S. Patent No. 6,820,201 covers SRI's information-based indicia
technology for securing and authenticating paper documents. The SRI
technology addresses the security issues inherent in today's popular
"print-at-home" documents, such as postage and movie tickets, which can be
readily counterfeited.

 The recently awarded patent and related pending SRI patents cover an
innovative use of a nonce (an element used to protect electronic
cryptography systems from being cracked) to protect paper-based documents.
The nonce is a unique number preprinted on a forgery-resistant material.
When the user wishes to print an article of value, such as a postage stamp,
the value of the nonce is combined with other information (e.g., the value
of the postage) and a digital certificate is created. The digital
certificate, in electronic or printed form, together with the nonce stamp,
provides cryptographically secure proof of the uniqueness and authenticity
of the certificate.

 The inventors are laboratory director Patrick D. Lincoln, Ph.D., and staff
scientist Natarajan Shankar, Ph.D., of SRI's Computer Science Laboratory.
"Most paper currency and other documents that have monetary value include
security features to prevent fraud. SRI saw the need to also secure today's
popular "print-at-home" documents to eliminate forgery and counterfeiting,"
said Dr. Lincoln. "Nonce stamps are a way of creating unique physical
representations of digital certificates that are easily authenticated and
that cannot be forged."
