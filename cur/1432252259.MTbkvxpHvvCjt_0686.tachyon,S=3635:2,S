Not quite, but see below.

BGP is indeed complex -- not the theory, but the practice: how it's
actually used.

Fundamentally, BGP is a way to implement routing *policy*: ISPs
(actually, ASs -- Autonomous Systems) use BGP so that traffic they're
carrying goes the way it's supposed to, more or less.  The metric, of
course is money -- what do they get paid for certain traffic over
certain paths, compared to others?  Among the many criteria that are
considered are traffic engineering, load-balancing among different
links, reducing latency for certain kinds of traffic, balancing bytes
and packets sent and received to certain BGP neighbors, minimizing the
number of prefixes you have to carry around in your routers (currently
about 240K for the so-called "default-free zone"), AUP restrictions,
customer satisfaction, redundancy, regulation, and more.

You can't just connect a couple of random Ethernets and have things JFW
(Just Work), the way you can with LANs in a building.  For one thing,
the Internet is too big; OSPF won't handle nearly that many prefixes.
For another, no one will (or rather, no one should) let you blindly
claim to carry traffic for random prefixes.  (The reality of that is
quite different and much more crypto-relevant...)

RAH: I'm quite certain this won't get to the other lists you've posted
to, but feel free to forward this.
