Except its interesting that in the late/ongoing gulf conflict the 
Catholic church actually
said that US aggression on Iraq was evil.  Interesting.  In any case, 
my mother who would
consider herself a devout Catholic ignored this control channel and 
found herself obeying
the other more insidious control channel -- mass media.  They have 
weapons of
mass destruction.  Tomorrow they could be gassing all of NYC.  blah 
blah blah.
They have spurned the UN long enough!!!

Nothing about oil companies shutting down Saddam because he was 
funneling Russian Caspian
sea oil through his pipeline.  The rules say Saddam couldn't pump his 
own own (except
for oil for food).  They don't say anything about him moving someone 
else's oil.
