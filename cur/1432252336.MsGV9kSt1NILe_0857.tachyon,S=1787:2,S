You could also use a stepper motor connected to the polar mount, and scan
the sky (or the city under the hill) automagically.

This could be interesting even in other bands. Could create some pretty
pictures. :)


Could it be possible to achieve the same without using a movable antenna?
Eg, by an antenna array and comparing phases of the arriving signals?
