This is a load of total crap.  My ex-partner's ex-partner (he decided he'd
had enough after this one), was shot point blank with a .380: the
projectile literally followed the course around the back of the skull,
exiting very close to the opposing eye.  Total damage was some loss of
sight in the eye whose socket was penetrated (mostly from burns), and a
really nervous disposition from then on in...

And no, he's not on life support.  Although, according to popular stories,
he *is* lucky it was a .380.  These slugs have an almost mythical
reputation for doing this kind of weird shit.  Of course they are just as
strange for the shooter, what with all the jamming and whatnot
(personally, I think the cartridge is simply too short to feed reliably as
an automatic, but I realize that YMMV.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
