Obviously. But to use the texture classification method for
'deshredding', the paper must consist of multiple distinct textures or
else you will not get any information out of the method besides the type
of paper used. For deshredding, the likelyhood of two pieces of
paper being previously attached is needed.
So for this to be usable on paper, paper needs to have significantly
varying texture. For rice-paper, parchment and watermarks I can see this
work, but for normal paper?? Does anyone have experience in this or a
cite?

With kind regards,
Wouter Slegers
