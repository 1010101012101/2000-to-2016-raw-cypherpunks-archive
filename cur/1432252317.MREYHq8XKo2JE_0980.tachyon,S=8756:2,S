This is not strictly correct. All satellite communications systems are
privacy invasive. BGAN, Thuraya, etc.

This is common in all satellite communications systems.

Thuraya is easy to monitor. It's not even expensive. There are
commercial solutions and there are non-commercial projects that work
with common hardware. Satellite communication networks are absolutely
not secure to use without additional protection. If location anonymity
is important, I highly advise against using satellite communications
technology. Unless you've properly tampered with the device to falsify
the location reporting, you're probably not as secure as you'd like...

All of these systems keep logs. All of the satellite companies have a
dark history.

It's all about threat models. If you're worried about people who have
control of Thuraya, use a BGAN. If you're worried about upsetting people
who have control of the Hughes network, use Thuraya. If you're worried
about location anonymity or evading content inspection, hack your device
to lie about the GPS location of your device. The location must be
within the same spot beam as your physical location or your device will
not sync with the birds in the sky. If you're using one of these devices
to transfer data at all, I highly encourage the use of Tor as you're
absolutely to be intercepted by multiple parties.

Some BGAN devices can be programmed to only send the spot beam ID but
again, you're trusting closed source, proprietary software/hardware with
your life. That's not a thing I'd suggest. Certainly not in a place like
Syria or other extremely hostile places.

All the best,
Jacob
