It's a nice idea, but they have several people on one card.
When my kids are teenagers, they'll have the same card I
and my wife have.  So they have whole families in that data
mix.  I'd think they would try to correlate the cash register
data with each person - the kids are in the candy corner,
the dad is getting the beer and mom is getting the chips.
Doesn't seem like a very simple problem to me!

Patience, persistence, truth,
