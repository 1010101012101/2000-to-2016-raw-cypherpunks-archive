Subject: "Double Secret" Wiretaps vs. the President's 2004 Statement


Dave,

In April 2004, President Bush made a seemingly direct and
unequivocal statement regarding U.S. wiretapping policies in the
fight against terrorism.  We now know that he spoke these words after
authorizing the NSA warrantless wiretapping program.

You can hear his comments for yourself in this very short video:

The White House explanation for this seemingly gaping discrepancy is
that the President was supposedly (we're now told) only talking about
"ordinary" secret wiretaps under the PATRIOT Act, not about what
we might call "Double Secret" NSA wiretaps (legal or not).

Newspeak is alive and well.  Dean Wormer of "Animal House" fame
would be proud.
