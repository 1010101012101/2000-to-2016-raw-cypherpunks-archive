If that's true, then the government couldn't have stolen it.  However, I
suspect that mainfraim code of any sophistication is rarely released into
the public domain.  I imagine the author would be able to clear that up,
assuming he has no financial reason to falsify its history.

Interesting.

No kidding.  Databases are _hard_ to write efficiently, let alone to
arbitrarily integrate.

Perhaps I am stupid.  I don't know how one would go about modifying
application software to include a 'back door' that would presumably
enhance its suceptibility to TEMPEST attacks.  Isn't tempest all about EM
spectrum signal detection and capture?
