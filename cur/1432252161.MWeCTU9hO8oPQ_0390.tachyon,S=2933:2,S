It is a commonly-held myth that quantum computers could solve
NP-complete problems, but most experts who have studied the issue
believe this is probably not the case.  There is no reason to think
that quantum computation could solve all NP problems in polynomial
time, and in fact, there are good reasons to believe this is
likely not the case.

(Do note that factoring is not NP-complete.)

See, e.g.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#Relation_to_computational_complexity_theory

or for a more nuanced and deep treatment of these issues,
