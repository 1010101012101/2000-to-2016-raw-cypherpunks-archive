File-swapping 'Madster' must track songs

                Friday, November 1, 2002 Posted: 10:03 AM EST (1503 GMT)

                ALBANY, New York (AP) -- The
                file-sharing service Madster must
                keep a list of songs available through
                the system as part of a court order to
                block access to copyright works.

                U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen in
                Chicago granted a preliminary injunction
                against the service Sept. 4. The judge
                sided with recording company officials
                who claimed Albany-based Madster
                violated copyright law just as Napster
                had before it.

                Aspen waited until this week, however,
                to release terms of the injunction to give
                the two sides time to suggest wording tailored to stop
only the transfer of
                copyright files.

                In addition to disabling access to copyright works,
Aspen directed Madster to
                monitor its system and keep a list of "any and all sound
recordings and musical
                compositions" being made available. That list must be
shared with recording
                companies upon five business days notice.

                Service must comply

                The service also must file regular reports detailing its
compliance.

                Madster founder Johnny Deep did not immediately return
calls Thursday. He has
                said that he didn't know of a way to filter copyright
files because the transferred
                material is encrypted.
