Some time ago, I ended up being a mentor in some coding thing. Vagueness =
is there to protect the guilty.

The project in question was for some program to communicate using =
one-time pads. That the pad in a one-time-pad must be full-entropy is =
why it's relevant. The question came up of how you distribute the pads, =
because that's the key problem (nyuck, nyuck) in doing a one-time-pad =
system.

The solution the person came up with was to encrypt them with PGP using =
a 4K-bit RSA key. I leave commentary on this system to the reader, and =
won't spoil the thought experiment with my own, at the moment.

This entropy broker strikes me as exactly the same sort of =
understanding.
