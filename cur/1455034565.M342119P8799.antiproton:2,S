In an effort to re-seed discussion about cypherpunk topics I'll be
reposting old threads from the cypherpunks list in a rough "this day in
cpunks" effort.=20

In this mail, John Young analyzes the subclasses of "the internet" as a
user might see.=20

Optional discussion questions:

      * How has this dichotomy survived the intervening half-decade?
      * Taxonomies sometimes afford conception of novel categories; the
        original periodic table was mostly empty, not-filled with
        elements yet to be discovered. What internets can we conceive of
        that do not presently exist?

>=20
> 10. Internets of combinations, hybrids, deceptions, ploys and
> warfare among 1-9.
