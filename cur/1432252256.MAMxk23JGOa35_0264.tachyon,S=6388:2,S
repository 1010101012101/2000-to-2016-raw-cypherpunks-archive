Whatever happened to simply not opening unexpected letters or packages?

If you think it might be a problem, maybe getting mail delivered to a drop and
discreetly popping on gloves and HEPA filter mask before you open your box
would be better than having it delivered to your house. I'm not particularly
worried, but having a mail drop box is just sound policy, privacy-wise.

Here's a bit on dealing with anthrax from the American Public Health
Association's Control of Communicable Diseases Manual:


3) Concurrent disinfection: Of discharges from lesions and articles soiled
therewith. Hypochlorite is sporicidal and good when organic matter is not
overwhelming and the item is not corrodable; hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid
or glutaraldehyde may be alternatives; formaldehyde, ethylene oxide and cobalt
irradiation have been used. Spores require steam sterilization, autoclaving or
burning to ensure complete destruction. Fumigation and chemical disinfection
may be used for valuable equipment. Terminal cleaning.

4) Quarantine: None.

5) Immunization of contacts: None.

6) Investigation of contacts and source of infection: Search for history of
exposure to infected animals or animal products and trace to place of origin.
In a manufacturing plant, inspect for adequacy of preventive measures as
outlined in 9A, above. As mentioned in 9B1, a potential bioterrorist source may
need to be ruled out for all human cases of anthrax, especially for those cases
with no obvious occupational source of infection.

7) Specific treatment: Penicillin is the drug of choice for cutane-
ous anthrax and is given for 5-7 days. Tetracyclines, erythromycin and
chloramphenicol are also effective. The U.S. military recommends parenteral
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for inhalational anthrax; the duration of therapy is not well defined.

8) Responders can be protected from anthrax spores by donning splash
protection, gloves and a full face respirator with high-efficiency particle
air (HEPA) filters (Level C) or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)
(Level B).

9) Persons who may have been exposed and are potentially contaminated should be
decontaminated with soap and copious amounts of water in a shower. Usually no
bleach solutions are required. A 1:10 dilution of household bleach (i.e., a
final hypochlorite concentration of 0.5%) should be used only if there is gross
contamination with the agent and an inability to remove the materials through
soap and water decontamination. The use of bleach decontamination is
recommended only after soap and water decontamination, and the solution should
be rinsed off after 10 to 15 minutes.

10) All persons who are to be decontaminated should remove their clothing and
personal effects and place all items in plastic bags, which should be labeled
clearly with the owners name, contact telephone number and inventory of the
bags contents. Personal items may be kept as evidence in a criminal trial or
returned to the owner if the threat is unsubstantiated.

11) If the suspect envelope or package associated with an anthrax threat
remains sealed (not opened), then first responders should not take any action
other than notifying the FBI and packaging the evidence. Quarantine,
evacuation, decontamination and chemoprophylaxis efforts are NOT indicated if
the envelope or package remains sealed. For incidents involving possibly
contaminated letters, the environment in direct contact with the letter or its
contents should be decontaminated with a 0.5% hypochlorite solution following a
crime scene investigation. Personal effects may be decontaminated similarly.

12) Technical assistance can be provided immediately by contacting the National
Response Center at 800-424-8802 or the local Weapons of Mass Destruction
Coordinator of the FBI.
