A whole slew of bank-robbers.=A0 A large fraction of the rest are there due=
 to drug cases.=A0 Only a very small proportion of those prisoners are the =
kind of wealthy, savvy people that you are describing.=A0 Now, understand t=
hat one reason I believe what I do is because of a great deal of experience=
 in observing the system first-hand, and it would take a long time to expos=
e you
 to enough facts to demonstrate why I believe the things I do.=A0 Your anal=
ysis is seemingly plausible if every defendant in question is independently=
 rich, white-collar, and intelligent, but most prisoners don't have those a=
dvantages.=A0 =0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 I understand why (in theory) plea-bargaining =
is done.=A0 The problem, it's been horribly misused:=A0 It was, no doubt, u=
sed in 1980 when there were about 20,000 Federal prisoners.=A0 But rather t=
han keeping the total prisoner population down and within reasonable limits=
, they decided to 'blow up the balloon' as far as they could, and thus the =
current figure is 220,000 prisoners.=A0 'Plea bargaining' is precisely what=
 made this abuse possible.=A0=A0 It WASN'T because people suddenly (or even=
 gradually, over time) decided to commit 11 times as much crime as before!=
=A0 This is a clue (!) that this increase in prisoner population isn't an u=
navoidable outcome, but in fact is entirely artificial and certainly avoida=
ble endpoint.=A0=A0http://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2013/08/12/no-ma=

=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 I don't disagree with your idea of capping convictions (by =
law) at, say, 10,000 per year, at least as a concept: In fact, I can see th=
at it would be a great step forward.=A0 But the difficulty is, how can that=
 be done?=A0 Is it possible to force it on 'the system'?=A0 And given Ameri=
ca's corrupt/incompetent/malicious Congress, would they have a reason to vo=
te in such a limitation? =A0 They voted for the legislation that brought us=
 to where we are now, and have tolerated it for 30+ years. =A0 What I am pr=
oposing ought to work with that effect, even better, but without any need t=
o convince these guys that it's a good outcome.=A0=A0 (Even better:=A0 My i=
dea amounts to a system to cap convictions at perhaps 5,000 per year, limit=
ed not by 'law' but instead to clog the system with its own detritus.)=A0 =
=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Another solution I'd implement ("if I were King...") would =
be to prohibit sentencing convicted defendants at more than 10% greater tha=
n the time offered in the plea agreement (If the plea agreement offered 36 =
months, the ending sentence if convicted would be no greater than 39.6 mont=
hs):=A0 The current system only tries 5% of the defendants by jury; if sent=
ences were limited to that 10% upgrade, far more defendants would demand a =
jury trial, and that would 'automatically' limit the number of defendants w=
ho could be convicted.=A0 So, that would be a solution.=A0 But getting Cong=
ress to approve such a change in law would be difficult or impossible.=A0 (=
At least without AP-type convincing.) =A0 I think America's Founding Father=
s would have been astonished to learn that the jury system has been so obvi=
ously subverted as it is today.=A0 But I am not in any way confident that s=
uch a solution could, in fact, be implemented, particularly against the wil=
l (and,
 thus, the influence) of the hundreds of thousands of people (cops, lawyers=
, judges, prison guards) who profit from the current system.=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 Also, I should mention that there have been and are a lot of illegal (not =
legal) activities in regards to Federal criminal sentencing over the last 1=
3 years.=A0 In 2000 there was a case called 'Apprendi v. New Jersey', which=
 started out on the right track but all Federal appeals courts rejected the=
 application of its principle to Federal criminal cases.=A0 Then there was =
Blakely v. Washington (2004) which further expanded the thrust of the princ=
iple.=A0 Unfortunately, an evil bitch named Ginsburg screwed up things in a=
 truly wacky Supreme Court case called U.S. v. Booker (2005)=A0 http://en.w=
ikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Booker =A0=A0 , completely backsliding i=
n this line of cases.=A0 Probably none of you reading the CP list have any =
idea what an atrocious history these cases had, especially Booker, but they=
 are in large part why I have absolutely no confidence at all that the Fede=
ral 'criminal justice' system has any hope of being repaired,
 except perhaps by AP or 'denial of disservice attack' methods.=0A=A0=A0=A0=

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't disagree with your idea of capping convictions =
(by law) at, say, 10,000 per year, at least as a concept: In fact, I can se=

an that be done?&nbsp; Is it possible to force it on 'the system'?&nbsp; An=
d given America's corrupt/incompetent/malicious Congress, would they have a=
 reason to vote in such a limitation? &nbsp; They voted for the legislation=
 that brought us to where we are now, and have tolerated it for 30+ years. =
&nbsp; What I am proposing ought to work with that effect, even better, but=
 without any need to convince these guys that it's a good outcome.&nbsp;&nb=

 (Even better:&nbsp; My idea amounts to a=0A system to cap convictions at p=

f I were King...") would be to prohibit sentencing convicted defendants at =
more than 10% greater than the time offered in the plea agreement (If the p=
lea agreement offered 36 months, the ending sentence if convicted would be =
no greater than 39.6 months):&nbsp; The current system
 only tries 5% of the defendants by jury; if sentences were limited to that=
 10% upgrade, far more defendants would demand a jury trial, and that would=
 'automatically' limit the number of defendants who could be=0A convicted.&=
nbsp; So, that would be a solution.&nbsp; But getting Congress to approve s=
uch a change in law would be difficult or impossible.&nbsp; (At least witho=
ut AP-type convincing.) &nbsp; I think America's Founding Fathers would hav=
e been astonished to learn that the jury system has been so obviously subve=
rted as it is today.&nbsp; But I am not in any way confident that such a so=
lution could, in fact, be implemented, particularly against the will (and, =
thus, the influence) of the hundreds of thousands of people (cops, lawyers,=
 judges, prison guards) who profit from the current system.<br></span>&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I should mention that there have been and are a l=
ot of illegal (not legal) activities in regards to Federal criminal sentenc=
ing over the last 13 years.&nbsp; In 2000 there was a case called 'Apprendi=
 v. New Jersey', which started out on the right track but all Federal appea=
ls courts rejected the application of its principle to
 Federal criminal cases.&nbsp; Then there was Blakely v. Washington (2004) =
which further expanded the thrust of the principle.&nbsp; Unfortunately, an=
 evil bitch named Ginsburg screwed up things in a truly wacky Supreme Court=
 case called U.S. v. Booker (2005)&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite=
d_States_v._Booker &nbsp;&nbsp; , completely backsliding in this line of ca=
ses.&nbsp; Probably none of you reading the CP list have any idea what an a=
trocious history these cases had, especially Booker, but they are in large =
part why I have absolutely no confidence at all that the Federal 'criminal =
justice' system has any hope of being repaired, except perhaps by AP or 'de=
