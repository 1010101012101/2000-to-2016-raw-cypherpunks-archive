As I said, your reading comprehension sucks. Or you're just twisting
shit to pretend that you're right.

Yes, but statements about anonymity systems generally aren't limited to
Tor.

No, I don't care about the "real price of the system". Why should I?

And, as I said before, people that you hate would be using any effective
anonymity system. So you might as well get over it.
