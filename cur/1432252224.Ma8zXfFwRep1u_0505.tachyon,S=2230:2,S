Yes.
Except that you entered into a contract to transport a human in exchange

for money.  No where in the contract was "banned speech" mentioned.

Suppose that instead two men were kicked off a flight for holding hands,

or a woman & offspring for breast-feeding.  That would be a violation of
the transportation
contract.  Because such behavior does not endanger the flight or
passengers.
(Although all behaviors cannot be enumerated, under a "reasonable"
common-law interpretation
of the contract, passive speech (vs. say screaming the whole flight) is
harmless.)

Private property rights, of course.  But contract law too.
