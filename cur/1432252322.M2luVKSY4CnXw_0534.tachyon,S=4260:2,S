	IANALS (laser specialist), but I am given to understand that with
the high energy demands of these types of lasers, and the problems with
getting good energy levels through airborne dust, clouds, etc (and especially
in combat areas where dust and other airborne particles are rather common) 
make lasers less than ideal against ground or low flying targets. 

	Against high flying aircraft, you may be right.
