Battlefield prep.
"The plans could lead Special Operations units to get more deeply involved 
in long-term covert operations in countries where the US is not at war and, 
in some cases, where the local government is not informed of their presence.
This expansion of the military's involvement in clandestine activities 
could be justified, Pentagon officials said, by defining it as "preparation 
of the battlefield"
"(the plans)...may at some point conflict with the presidential ban on 
assassinations.

briefed Mr Rumsfeld and a small group of senior Defence Department and 
military officers on initial proposals."
