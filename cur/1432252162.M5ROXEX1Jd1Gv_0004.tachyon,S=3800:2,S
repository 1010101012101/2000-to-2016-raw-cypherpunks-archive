Homeland security is apparently working better as theory than as reality. 
Reporters investigating airport security over the Labor Day weekend were 
able to smuggle all sorts of contraband -- small knives, corkscrews, pepper 
spray, razors -- through checkpoints at 11 major U.S. airports. CBS news 
crews were even able to get lead-lined bags -- which block out X-rays -- 
past roughly 70 percent of the airport screeners. Worried? Remember, these 
are TV reporters we're talking about here.
