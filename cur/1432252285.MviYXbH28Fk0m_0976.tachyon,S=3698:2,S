We are happy to announce the 0.12 release of NeuClear XMLSIG. Major new
features are:

- Safer Application Oriented API
- Improved verification of Reference Types
- Simpler API
- Support for X509 Certificates
- Improved Interoperability

For a list of all changes see:

NeuClear XMLSig is a java library that use the following libraries:

It is not designed for completeness. The features that we support are
generally features needed for NeuClear. If any one is interested in
implementing the missing features for full interopability please let me know.
