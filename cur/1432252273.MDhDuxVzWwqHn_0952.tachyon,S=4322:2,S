I don't know.  I've yet to meet a mold that didn't die when you poured hot
bleach solution on it, particularly if you add a good wetting agent like
TSP.

Sealers and paints have potent fungicides and mildewcides in them, and for
tough cases, you can use 3-part epoxy systems designed for biological
laboratories that no microorganisms can live on.

You can skim coat floors and walls before finishing, and screen them down,
and all cracks around millwork can be sealed with flexible latex caulk,
which also contains mildewcides and fungicides.

Yes, you may not get mold in wall interiors and structural members, but I
think that you can keep it out of the rooms people inhabit.  Particularly
if you treat the ventilation system at the same time.

There was some government building that was in the news a few years back,
because they had delayed finishing the daycare center, and there was some
noxious black mold on the unpainted sheetrock.

The contractor wanted to wipe the walls down with bleach and paint them,
and various tree-huggers were demanding the whole thing be torn down,
reframed, and redrywalled.

In any case, I think claims of "Attack of the Killer Mold" are vastly
overblown.

Most people with mold-related health problems live in damp slums with
clumps of it growing on their walls.
