This has been done before. A town in Georgia, one in Ohio or 
Illinois, as I recall.

t is just as unconstitutional to _require_ a gun as it is to _ban_ guns.

The crap about "conscientious objector" is just that, crap. I shouldn't
have to fill out some bullshit form to say I have conscientious
objections to having a gun in my house.

Government may no more require a gun in a house than it may require a 
television, or a telephone, or a toothbrush.

Yes, I know the law is pure fluff, and hence is moot, a nullity, as 
they say. But the principle of _requiring_ a  gun is just as foolish 
as the notion of banning guns. Frankly, those who pass such laws need 
killing just as much as the tens of thousands who are banning guns 
need killing.
