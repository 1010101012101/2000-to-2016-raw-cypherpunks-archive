                                      June 20, 2001 -- Osama bin
                                      Laden's terror network is
                                      circulating a chilling recruitment

                                      video in which he urges Islamic
                                      militants to join his holy war on
the
                                      United States and Israel - and
calls
                                      for "blood, blood and destruction,

                                      destruction."

                                      Bin Laden, wearing traditional
                                      Yemeni dres with a dagger, is
                                      shown on the 100-minute tape
                                      telling Muslims they must leave
                                      countries that are ruled by
"allies of
                                      Jews and Christians."
