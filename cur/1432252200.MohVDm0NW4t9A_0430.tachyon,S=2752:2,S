There are things the tor project and surrounding community could do to
help here.

For example, If I could anonymously donate $10 to a charity and in
return receive a persistent nym which I could use to get around those
kinds of blocks... I'd be hesitant to misbehave and get my nym
blocked.  (And forums should feel good about whatever small residual
amount of spammers who do buy donation nyms, because even though they
spam their need to keep buying nyms support the charities).

But no practical software infrastructure exists for this sort of thing today.

And until it does any education/advocacy will not go too far because
it doesn't offer much in terms of real alternatives.  "It's not really
so bad." "Yes it is, or we wouldn't have bothered putting in the
blocking in the first place" "er.."
