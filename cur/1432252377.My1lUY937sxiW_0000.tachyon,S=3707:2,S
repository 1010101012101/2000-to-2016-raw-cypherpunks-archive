Bags of dog food are soft, fire extinguishers aren't.  Why don't you play
full force catch with cans of dog food at 10 feet, instead - no glove, of
course.

The bottle is a little smaller than a 15 lb bottle, of course the 15 lb's
refers to the weight of the bottle itself, it is closer to 50 lbs if it is
fully charged with carbon dioxide (which we have no way to know whether it
it was charged or what it was (once?) charged with).

You really need to back down on this Choate.
