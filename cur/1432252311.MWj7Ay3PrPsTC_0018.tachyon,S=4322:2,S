Apparently, however -- and I say it with utmost respect, while being a newbie 
here -- not for *your* personal spam.

>From a newbie's perspective: when I joined, I had no idea who Jim Bell is, and 
had no idea this list has had such a long and colourful history. While for the 
time being I "tl;dr'd" the bulk of the e-mail that has started this thread, I 
intend on reading it in full soon-ish, as "those who do not know history are 
bound to repeat it".

I now do appreciate the long history behind his e-mail, and regardless of 
whether or not I personally am interested in what Jim has to say, I recognize 
he has the right to say it. Adding a [HISTORY] or somesuch tag would be a nice 
touch, but that's that.

I have no idea what makes a person think they can summarily decide "this is 
irrelevant to the list" and insist upon it for so long, after so many 
responses that seem to indicate otherwise.

I myself had a "WTF?" moment with Jim's e-mail, but I shrugged my shoulders 
and moved to the next e-mail. I don't have to read everything, after all, and 
I can operate the "mark as read" functionality of my e-mail client pretty 
well.

So, I can understand your "WTF?", Al, but it's really the time to stop beating 
this horse. It is dead. It has gone to meet its maker. It ceased to be. If it 
hadn't been mailed to the list it would have been pushing up daisies.

This is a dead horse.
