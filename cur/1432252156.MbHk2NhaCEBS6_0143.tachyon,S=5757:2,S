I don't think anyone claims that it "must have been".  Rather,
the idea that it might have been, or might be useful for future 
terrorists, is sufficient to demonize it.  Similarly, the 9/11
terrorists didn't use guns, but everyone knows terrorists use guns,
The idea of cryptography as munitions isn't just metaphor or,
if it is, it's a really really good metaphor.

I'd rank it number 2, after key based encryption. But the concept
of key-based encryption seems to me to be relatively obvious
(I could have invented it myself if it hadn't been invented already)
whereas the idea of public key encryption seems
(to me at least) to be counterintuitive and utterly brilliant.

To the extent that paranoia represents a genuine disorder, 
paranoia refers not to an excessive amount of distrust or precaution-
taking, but rather an unrealistic assesment of risks. Carrying a gun
around alll the time isn't paranoid.  Carrying around cobra antivenom
is (assuimng you have no particular reason to expect cobra 
attacks).

The idea that there could be a back door in something as basic as 
the CONCEPT of public key encryption strikes me as being absurd.

I'd call it "irrelevant" rather than "suspicious".  Any time an 
academic cryptologist discovers something (PK encryption,
linear cryptanalysis, differential cryptanalysis..) there's always
some spook there claiming he knew about it years earlier.
Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't, who cares? If you make a discovery 
and hide it, you may as well not have made it, and that really
is all there is to say on that particular issue.
