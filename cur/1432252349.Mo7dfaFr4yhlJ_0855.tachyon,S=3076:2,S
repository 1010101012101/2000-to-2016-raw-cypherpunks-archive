Hey yeah, waita minute.

Why can't this guy write a book or something detailing the whole story?  If 
needs be it can be written by A. Cypherpunk and we'll stick the money in an 
account for him. Obviously, it won't be enough to survive oon for long, but 
it'll be something rather than nothing and give this guy something 
productive to do.
