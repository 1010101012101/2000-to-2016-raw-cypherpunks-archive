	Think of it in terms of privacy+access.

	Medical records are not "stateless", and are for many reasons 
not usually kept by the individual (or when they are, they are often 
kept by both the health care provider *and* the individual). Now, it 
I haven't thought this through all the way (and I'm not exactly a 
world class thinker) but I can see several possible "products" that 
might be marketable in a "privacy aware" marketplace:

	(1) A system were both the HCP key *and* one of Alice's key 
or TTP's key are necessary to read a medical record, but where only 
the hospitals key is necessary to write to the record. This would 
provide more privacy for Alice (or at least a combination of privacy 
and access logging) than exists under the current completely 
un-encrypted, accessible by almost anyone system that exists today.
	You might want the TTP to hold either a copy of Alice's key 
with a strong access logging system, or have a setup (If possible) 
were the Either Alice's or the TTP's key will decrypt/allow access 
for cases when you need access to Alice's information when she is 
unable to provide it (severe trauma or medical condition, dead, in an 
adversarial legal battle etc.).

	Medical records are not only Alice's record of what was done 
to her/wrong with her, but also the HCP's record of what they did.

	Yes, it would still be possible for someone to get the 
information through a print-screen or other ways. Total and complete 
security is a really tough nut. The goal may simply be to make it 
harder to leak information, or provide strong accountability to that 
information.

	(I worked in a Hospital in the early 90s. At that time it 
would have been trivial for me to look up anyone on the hospital 
computer system and order their chart, and return it with a "Oops, 
ordered the wrong number")


	(2) A system for larger HCP's like (for instance) Kaiser, or 
the hospital I used to work in, where a specific HCP within that 
system must cooperate with Alice to get *specifically* which parts of 
a record they need. By way of example, at a less monogamous point in 
my life, I was worried that I had contracted an STD (turns out I was 
wrong), and wanted to get it taken care of. The hospital where I 
worked (and had insurance) was not an option because they had one 
medical record on each patient, and, well, my mother worked there as 
a nurse in a department where I was being seen (occasionally) for a 
completely different problem. I wound up going somewhere else and 
paying out of pocket for the consultation. If there was the ability 
within the record keeping system for selective exposure of 
information, that could be handy.

	There is little reason for a Urologist to get access to your 
dental records.

	At least one would hope not.

	At least part of the goal may be to meet "Due Diligence" 
tests. If a HCP/Accountant/Investment Broker takes reasonable 
precautions in protecting privacy, then it's that much harder for 
them to be sued for negligence.

	If they provide strong accountability procedures, and enforce 
them, then that slows leaks down.

	It would be a rare company indeed that let the Techs correct 
the press releases.

	While not being particularly happy with ZKS (Mac/MacOSX port 
public, despite repeated assurances that "it is coming" (for what, 2 
years now?)), There are many services that they could legitimately 
provide companies, such as "privacy procedure" auditing etc., either 
directly for the company, or as a "consultant" to one of the 
Management Consluting firms (Arthur Anderson, KPMG etc.).

	The problems with this aren't technical, but rather legal.

	Da Man insists that you present ID. Therefore the Pharmacy 
insists you present ID. Now, if that order were encrypted so that 
only you, *or* a TTP could reveal *who* picked up order # 3247834 for 
60 tablets of vicodan, then you have, if not more privacy, at least a 
trail of accountability to who leaked it.

	Part of the problem, at least in Medical and Financial 
"spaces" is that it's not only Alice and the Companies desires, but 
also the Feds desires.

	To provide *better* privacy than we have now until such time 
as we can get the government off our backs (either through reform or 
other means) is a possible money maker.

	And if making money doing one thing allows ZKS to pay for 
some "R&D" that helps get the second, I'm all for that.

	As soon as I get a Mac Freedom client, Damn it! (And yes, I'm 
willing to pay, I am just not willing to move to Canada to help write 
it (even if I were capable of such a thing)).
