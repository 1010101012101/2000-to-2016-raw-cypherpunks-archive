	If you're the type of person who spends time in other peoples homes 
while they're sleeping or away, I expect you've gotten used to many of 
these sounds. Or you're oblivious to them.

	There are 3 cases why one would keep a loaded firearm in the house 
for self defense--well, at least three, but three general cases is all I 
can think of off the top of my head:

	(1) Bad Neighborhood: The area that one lives in has a high 
incidence of B&E/Home Invasion, and one is afraid that their home will 
be hit. While this is a *very* good reason to have a loaded firearm 
close at hand, quite frankly there is a higher chance that the home will 
be burgled while you are away. Smart thing to do is move to a less 
dangerous neighborhood.

	(2) One has brought oneself to the notice of the kind of people who 
can use force with little or no repercussion, be that government or any 
other gang of thugs, and one wants to "go down fighting".  (lets' face 
it, no matter how good you are, no matter how fast and accurate, you 
aren't going to win a firefight with the kind and number of troops the 
government, be it city, state, or federal is going to throw at you, all 
you can hope to do is repel the first attack, and take more of them than 
there are of you). In this case, there isn't a lot you can do.

	(3) One has developed a NGO enemy of some kind, either you did 
something to piss off the kind of person who will crawl in your window 
one night and slit your throat. Lock and load--there is nothing else you 
can do.

	I guess (thinking a little further) that there are 2 other cases:

	(4) One is doing something that may bring #3 to come about. (Don't 
do that)
	(5) Being Prepared.

	Nothing special about the .45 acp.
