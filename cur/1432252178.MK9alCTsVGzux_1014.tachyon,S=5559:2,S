They had what looked like a legitimate security / privacy product,
and were upfront about the threat models being regulators and anti-trust cops.

While it's hard to tell from the web site, it looks like
they've still got the same basic technical model -
instead of sending raw text, you're sending text encrypted using a key
that you fetch from a key server, and when the recipient wants to view it,
the recipient runs a viewer that fetches a decryption key.
The policy enforcement runs on the key server,
which deletes keys when the policy says the document should expire,
and apparently places some controls on who it's willing to hand keys to.

People save stuff all the time, and forget it, and backup systems often save it
even if they didn't explicitly try to save it themselves.
By shipping the sensitive messages as encrypted files,
the Save functions are only saving the encrypted version, not the cleartext.
On the other hand, I don't know how much their integration with Outlook 
breaks it.

You can set up your policy servers to set who's allowed to fetch keys.
There's no indication on the web site about how much granularity this has,
or how much protection or authentication they really do.

Policy servers are run by the company using the system, not by Omniva,
so you're still dependent on their competence as well as their honesty,
and if they want to ship a broken system, it's not hard to hide it
(e.g. use a compromised random number generator for the keys.)

I didn't see Ryze.  Looks like some kind of job-hunting thing.
Minciu Sodas does look like a weird site - I'm not sure how much it's
just a self-hyping conference board and how many people agree with each 
other like bloggers,
but I didn't see anything on there that was actual content by Jeff,
but it was too cluttery to spend much time hunting through.

Jack Rosenberg, actually.  Car salesman, with no self-doubt at all.

While I thought Andrew Orlowski's Register article was pretty shoddy reporting,
the Extropians Secret Handshake bit was funny.
