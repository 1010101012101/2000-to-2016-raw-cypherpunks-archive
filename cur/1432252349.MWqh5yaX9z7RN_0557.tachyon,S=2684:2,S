<html><head></head><body> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucky me -- I was recently able to score a
nice copy of Vinge's "Across Realtime", the '91 edition that includes "Ungoverned",
for only $3 at a used bookstore. Busy reading it now, and liking it so much
I talked myself into a $25 copy of "True Names" I found thru Bibliofind.
Wish they were hardcover, it seems like an awful lot to pay $25 for a pulp
edition paperback, but seeing that all the other copies were $60 and up and
also paperback, I guess it's a deal. <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used book stores -- sigh! Sure wish I could afford to quit the computer racket and run a used book store instead. <br>
