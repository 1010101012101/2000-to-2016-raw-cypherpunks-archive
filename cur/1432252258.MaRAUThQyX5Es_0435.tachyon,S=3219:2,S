Are you payed per impression or display?  Odds are blocking them wont make
them leave anyways, if there is something of value, they will outsmart
your blocking.  A common thing for people to do also is to use DNS entries
for doublclick and all the other add servers so they dont talk to the
hsots, or use other software, JunkBuster is not the only solution.
