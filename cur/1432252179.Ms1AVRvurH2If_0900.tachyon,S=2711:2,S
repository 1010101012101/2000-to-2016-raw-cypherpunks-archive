I wonder what Senor Escobar thinks of all this.  Eh Senor?  We haven't
heard your street-wise opinions from the great beyond in a while.

As for me an Nomen Nescio, and the mysterious A Melon, you found us

eachother or others.

Perhaps this whole thing is just one person talking to himself, with
Tim listening in!
