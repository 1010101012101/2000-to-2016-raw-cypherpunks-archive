 EnenKio currency is Gold 
        DO NOT BEG ! TAKE IT, IT'S YOUR RIGHT STOP
dishonoring yourselves --- 
AMERCIA REMOVE IT OR PROVE IT ! www.enenkio.org -- A Nation The newest
OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more "remote" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek
(sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice." [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response:
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble
citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His
Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs
thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to
attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime,
narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug
cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity,
without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to
corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in
the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the
United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business
of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of
the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved
until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His
Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough
investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and
illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of
Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest
State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other
states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and
conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is
obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in
Micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic cleansing" and her
responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links
