Subject: Digital Signatures based on secure hashes

I put together some code for doing digital signatures based on secure
hashes.

Surprisingly, I was able to make it reasonably practical. You can find
well-documented reference code with test cases at -

http://gawth.com/bram/CheapSignaturesBeta.py

I would much appreciate it if anyone would analyze the code - I'm pretty
sure it's secure, since it's use of hashes falls within my area of
expertise, but don't really feel confident until other people have looked
at it as well.

I suspect at least some of the ideas are original, although I haven't
looked at the literature much - I'm particularly proud of the 165 choose
82 trick.

You can find code for running all it's tests at -
