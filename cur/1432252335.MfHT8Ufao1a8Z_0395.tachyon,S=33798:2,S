1. EDRI supports PI's comments on Google-Doubleclick merger
============================================================

European Digital Rights Initiative (EDRI) is supporting the letter Privacy
International (PI) sent on 5 November 2007 asking the head of the European
Commission DG Competition, Commissioner Kroes, to take the merger of
Google-Doubleclick to the next phase. PI argues that the merger could have
serious implications for privacy innovation in advertising.

The letter explains the problems that the merger could bring to the online
advertising market: "Google's purchase of Doubleclick is particularly
worrying because it is a significant consolidation in this domain and we
worry that this very competition to provide high-quality privacy practices
will dissipate. Google's dominant position in the search marketplace will be
compounded by Doubleclick's dominant position in online profiling, leading
to a potentially abusive situation for the protection of privacy. If the
merger is approved, then Google's dominant service will transform radically
from one with a search advertising function into one that collects both
searches and browsing habits of users. "

PI showed how the decision could influence privacy of the Internet users if
the merger is approved :
"Privacy innovation could suffer under the merger as the two largest online
databases come together. Other companies will have to compete against this
massive entity and we worry it will lead to a race to the bottom for privacy
protection. (...) Little is actually known about how all these companies
protect their customers' data, even though they must do so in accordance
with European privacy laws. (...)We know little about how firms make use of
this data.
Google promises that it does not yet create online user profiles, but it is
purchasing a firm that is renowned for the depth and extent of its online
user profiles. We need strong and enforceable assurances that profiles will
not be developed and enhanced through this merger."

BEUC, the Consumer's Organization, as well as the Data Protection
Commissioner of the German state of Shleswig-Holstein, Thilo Weichert, have
publicly opposed the Google-Doubleclick deal. However, Commissioner Kroes
announced on 15 October: "We are looking at the influence on competition
and that's it." The new deadline for the enquiry has been set for 13
November 2007.

2. EU pushes for an international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
============================================================

A recent statement from the European Commission reveals that it has started
negotiations with US, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand to create an
international treaty on counterfeiting - Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
(ACTA), despite the absence of any independent data on the topic.

The European Commission is looking for a mandate from the European Member
States to proceed in this endeavour, but the ball is already rolling, taking
into consideration the almost simultaneous press statements from the US
Trade Representative and Canada's Minister of International Trade as well.

But "while the claims regularly focus on health and safety risks or
suggestions that organized crime or terrorist groups benefit from
counterfeiting, the reality is that the policy prescription typically
includes a range of issues that have little to do with those issues", as
Michael Geist puts it.

Even though the OECD estimates the losses of the international trade are 3-4
times lower than the ones the industry has so heavily promoted, the big
states still have their ears open to the industry lobbists' claims.
EU announces that the new ACTA should build the international cooperation
leading to harmonised standards and a better communication between
authorities and should establish common enforcement practices to promote
strong intellectual property protection in coordination with right holders
and trading partners. Also it suggests "creating a strong modern legal
framework which reflects the changing nature of intellectual property theft
in the global economy, including the rise of easy-to-copy digital storage
mediums and the increasing danger of health threats from counterfeit food
and pharmaceutical drugs."

In fact, it seems that the negotiations have started since mid-2006 between
the European Commission, Canada, US and Japan on such an agreement on
counterfeiting. But ACTA aims higher. US Trade Representative Susan Schwab
explained that the negotiations would "expand upon the enforcement standards
of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) and countries would be encouraged to comply with other international
IPR agreements. The goal is to set a new, higher benchmark for enforcement
that countries can join voluntarily."

Or, as Michael Geist better explains it: "This treaty could ultimately
prove bigger than WIPO - without the constraints of consensus building,
developing countries, and civil society groups, the ACTA could further
reshape the IP landscape with tougher enforcement, stronger penalties, and a
gradual eradication of the copyright and trademark balance."

3. EC plans to profile all passengers in and out EU
============================================================

The European Commission(EC) put forward on 6 November 2007 a PNR plan that
is almost similar to the EU-USA PNR (Passenger Name Records) agreement. The
EU PNR plan is part of a new package of proposals "aimed at improving the
EU's capabilities in the fight against terrorism."

According to this proposal, EU will have to collect 19 pieces of personal
data on air passengers coming into and leaving the EU space, including phone
number, e-mail address, travel agent, full itinerary, billing data and
baggage information. The information will be collected in analysis units
that will make a "risk assessment" of the traveller, which could lead to
the questioning or even refusal of the entry. The data is to be kept for
five years and then another eight years in a "dormant" database.

"The availability of PNR data ... is necessary for the purpose of preventing
and fighting terrorist offences and organised crime," is the reason
expressed by the draft.

In October 2007, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini told Parliament
members that the creation of a PNR database was justified by the high level
of terrorist risk for Europe. "The Union is at least as much a potential
target of a terrorist attack as the United States, and the use and analysis
of passenger name records is an important law enforcement tool to protect
our citizens".

However, legal experts, human-rights groups and data-protection activists
oppose this plan and find it a threat to privacy.

Tony Bunyan, editor of Statewatch stated: "This is yet another measure that
places everyone under surveillance and makes everyone a "suspect" without
any meaningful right to know how the data is used, how it is further
processed and by whom [.] We have already got the mandatory taking of
fingerprints for passports and ID cards and the mandatory storage of
telecommunications data of every communication, now we are to have the
mandatory logging of all travel in and out of the EU. The underlying
rationale for each of the measures is the same - all are needed to tackle
terrorism. Yet there is little evidence that the gathering of "mountain upon
mountain" of data on the activities of every person in the EU makes a
significant contribution. On the other hand, the use of this data for other
purposes, now or in the future, will make the EU the most surveilled place
in the world".

MEP Sophie in 't Veld has also made an appeal to the European Commission to
make an analysis of the situation in USA and Canada in order to verify the
effectiveness of such a system before taking any decision on a similar
system in Europe. "EU counter-terrorism policies must be regularly assessed
on their effectiveness.their impact on reducing the threat and increasing
security, on improving cooperation and exchange between countries and
agencies, as well as an evaluation of the cumulative impact of individual
measures on privacy and civil liberties," she stated.

The Commission's proposal for EU PNR is proposed as a Framework Decision
meaning that the European Parliament is only consulted and its opinion can
be ignored as it happens on a regular basis. The European Council can, in
its secret working parties, change at will this legislative proposal.

Another question raised is why 2004 Directive on the collection of API
(Advance Passenger Information), meant to be applied by all member States by
September 2006, is not enough in supporting the fight against terrorism and
is not yet applied. The API data is more limited including only name,
nationality, passport number, date of birth and the details related to the
flight.

The proposal did not take into consideration the opinions of EU's Article 29
Data Protection Working Party which, during the consultation period
concluded that they "have not seen any information presented by the
Commission that would substantiate the pressing need to process PNR data for
the purpose of preventing and fighting terrorism and related crimes or law
enforcement". They also stated that "Bulk transfer of personal data, which
would include unsuspected travellers to other authorities would be
disproportionate, as data may only be provided to an authority if necessary
for a given purpose".

Concerning data protection, the draft proposal has in view the Council
Framework Decision on the protection of data for police and judicial
cooperation that should apply to the proposed PNR scheme as well. However,
the decision has not been adopted and offers very little protection to
individuals. The decision ignored the opinions of the European Parliament,
the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the EU's Article 29 Data
Protection Working Party and allows the personal data exchange with third
states such as USA.

On the other hand, the draft makes no reference to 1995 EC Directive on data
protection covering the collection of PNR data by the airlines.

4. Putin wants control of Russian Internet
============================================================

As the Internet use in Russia increases spectacularly, having tripled in the
last three years, Putin' governance concentrates its efforts on getting
control over the Russian Internet after having already gained much control
over the traditional mass media.

Putin's allies and supporters have created blogs and news sources to flood
the Internet with messages favourable to the present political power.

During a national broadcast live on TV and Radio in October 2007, Putin
tackled the issue of Internet censorship. "Naturally, in this sphere, as in
other spheres, we should be thinking about adhering to Russian laws, about
making sure that child pornography is not distributed, that financial crimes
are not committed" said Putin.

Besides numerous pro-government blogs, several already established online
outlets have been bought by Putin's allies with the purpose to create a
network to disseminat propaganda and to control the online information.
Such a publication is Gazeta.ru, the most respected online newspaper which
was sold in December to a metals magnate loyal to Putin. Russian officials
have also been looking for the possibility of establishing a separate
Internet within Russia that would serve their purposes.

The reaction of the Kremlin power comes to counterpart situation as the one
having occurred in 2004 when, due to concentrated efforts of uncensored
blogs and on-line publications, a popular uprising in Ukraine provoked the
revoking of the vote for a pro-Moscow candidate in the presidential
elections.

In April 2007, when an opposition movement held a march in Moscow, blogger
Pavel Danilin, a Putin supporter, together with his team, started blogging
about a smaller pro-Kremlin march being held the same day. They blogged so
much, and linked to each other so effectively, that they crowded out all the
items about the opposition march from the very influential top-five blog
post listing on the Yandex Web portal.

Prosecutors have also started focussing on Internet chat sites, blogs and
postings in order to charge the users that criticize Putin or other
officials. However, the federal officials deny any campaign to control the
Internet. "Personally, I am against developing and adopting a special law
that would regulate the Internet," declared Leonid Reiman, Minister of IT&C.
"The Internet has been always developing as a free medium, and it should
remain as such" he added.

Despite the officials' statements, in July 2007, Putin already announced
his plans to create a global information technology powerhouse network, a
statement that was interpreted by the mass media as an attempt from his part
to establish a controlled network separated from the current Internet which
is organised by ICANN. According to Wolfgang Kleinwaechter, special adviser
to the chairmen of the Internet Governance Forum, some Russian officials are
thinking of a separate Internet, with Cyrillic domain names, taking the
example of China.

5. Whois privacy problems not solved by ICANN
============================================================

ICANN meeting that took place last week (29 October - 2 November 2007) in
Los Angeles was expected to decide on the WHOIS database privacy problems.
But unfortunately the decision taken was just to make further studies on the
matter, despite the already seven years of discussions on this topic.

The need for WHOIS reform has been a hot topic for some years in the civil
society and some ICANN structures. An EPIC & NGO Letter to ICANN Board on
Need for Whois Reform sent on 30 October 2007 asks "for changes to WHOIS
services that would protect the privacy of individuals, specifically the
removal of registrants' contact information from the publicly accessible
WHOIS database."

The letter explains that the "current ICANN WHOIS policy conflicts with
national privacy laws, including the EU Data Protection Directive, which
requires the establishment of a legal framework to ensure that when personal
information is collected, it is used only for its intended purpose. As
personal information in the directory is used for other purposes and ICANN's
policy keeps the information public and anonymously accessible, the database
could be found illegal according to many national privacy and data
protection laws including the European Data Protection Directive, European
data protection laws and legislation in Canada and Australia." Moreover, it
points to the Article 29 Working Party's opinion that underlines that "in
its current form the WHOIS database does not take account of the data
protection and privacy rights".

The NGOs supported Final Outcomes Report recently published by the WHOIS
Working Group that "accepted the Operational Point of Contact (OPoC)
proposal as a starting point, and the best option to date. The OPoC proposal
would replace publicly available registrant contact information with an
intermediate contact responsible for relaying messages to the registrant."

The public letter accepted the fact that the WHOIS Working Group proposal
was a workable framework and not a perfect one, recommending "a distinction
between commercial and non-commercial domains."

But the proposal was rejected by the ICANN, as well as another proposal that
would have allowed domain name registration companies to stop making the
data available through WHOIS. Instead, the ICANN decided to ask for further
studies, that will be identified by the The Generic Names Supporting
Organization (GNSO) Council until 15 February 2007.

The move was seen as a new delay after seven years of discussions. Ross
Rader from the GNSO said to AP: "We've had seven years of study on this
issue... what has not been answered is what are the specific questions we
want answers to. From my perspective, further, broad, open study is just a
way for (opponents) to say you don't have enough votes to change the status
quo."

The lack of a concrete decision from GNSO meant a renewal of a call for a
procedure to allow exemptions from ICANN standard contractual obligations
for WHOIS. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee (GAC) said "uniform
process" among governments was not to be expected and the specific cases
should just be referred to national authorities in order to come to a
procedure for the respective registries and registrars.

6. Government attempts of increased level of surveillance in Czech Republic
============================================================

The Czech Interior Ministry introduced in October 2007 a new National Action
Plan to Combat Terrorism that would increase the access of the police and
intelligence authorities to personal data, under the pretext of the
protection against terrorism.

The Czech Ministry of Interior has introduced a similar plan every year
since 2002 - in 2005 it actually won the Czech Big Brother Award for it -
which, until now, has been rejected by the Parliament. The Plan of Action is
meant to be used to draft legislation allowing police and other agencies to
have access to emails and to wiretap without following any court procedures.

"According to the current legal regulations, in order to perform certain
actions it is necessary that security bodies meet a number of requirements
and conditions, the existence of which is unquestionable," stated Vladimmr
Repka, spokesman for the Interior Ministry.

As compared to the plan proposed last year, this year's plan seems to have a
much more ambiguous wording that " it is actually very difficult to argue
against it" says privacy expert Filip Pospmsil from the EDRI-member Czech
NGO Iuridicum Remedium. According to him, the plan is inspired from the US
Patriot Act that that give the US police authorities direct access to
personal data.

Presently, in Czech Republic, the interception of emails and wiretapping can
be done only by a court order that is valid for up to six months. "They want
to have the power just to call the judge and then to get written approval
later" said Pospmsil.

What the Interior Ministry also wants is to force financial institutions and
private Internet providers to pass on clients' information to security
agencies as well as to eliminate anonymous phone cards.

In Pospmsil's opinion, the present plan is meant as a test to check out on
the position of the policy makers and of the public as anyway, even if
approved by the government, the plan has no value if it is not passed by the
Parliament. "I think it's just a kind of test by the Interior Ministry and
other intelligence services to test the willingness of the public and its
representatives to exchange some privacy for promises of improved security,"
he said.

Privacy International has issued reports on the situation in the Czech
Republic showing concern on the increase of the government attempts to
legalise wiretapping, to create a central database from the separate
databases of the security agencies as well as on the high level of video
surveillance in the country, unrestricted by law.

Hana Stepankova, the spokeswoman of the Office of Personal Data Protection,
which is responsible for enforcing the country's privacy laws, stated that
the office lawyers are presently studying the proposal.
The draft plan may receive comments from the public until the end of October
but there is no guarantee that the Interior Ministry will take any comments
into consideration.

7. Open Document Format gains more support
============================================================

The first international workshop of Open Document Format (ODF) public sector
users took place in Berlin on 29-30 October 2007, hosted by the Foreign
Office of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The position of the German Foreign Office, as host of the event, was made
very clear. The Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in his
opening word, called ODF "a completely open and ISO-standardized format",
considering it an "excellent basis" for "a free exchange of knowledge and
information in a time of globalization". The Foreign Office has already
linked its foreign missions in a network using open-source programs and
shifted to OpenOffice and Linux operation systems on their laptops and has
in view to extend this program to all diplomatic workstations by the middle
of 2008.

According to Florian Schie_l of the LiMux Project Office of Munich, where a
migration to Linux is in progress, the ODF is a good tool in reducing the
large range of templates and macros in the municipal government and in
creating more uniform file management standards. The municipal
administration of Freiburg will also implement a project for the migration
of 2000 workstations from Microsoft Office 2000 to OpenOffice, relying in
the future solely on ODF and PDF. ODF will also be adopted as the standard
file format by all agencies and departments of Schwdbisch-Hall as Horst
Brduner, IT director, stated.

Germany is not the only country in favour of ODF. As expressed by Gavin
Beckett of the city administration of Bristol, UK, a migration to Sun
Microsystems's StarOffice is currently in progress in the city
administrative offices. Mr. Beckett pointed out that the difficulty in the
development of the progress is the inertia and habit of the office employees
having been used Microsoft operation system for many years. "The point is to
overcome deeply ingrained modes of behavior," he stated.

Brazil and India are also leaders in the use of open standards in the office
area. Deivi Kuhn of Serpro, a company coordinating the use of open source in
Brazil, declared that ODF standard adopted by the International Organization
for Standardization, a good tool providing both access to knowledge
and ensuring user freedoms, was mandatory for e-government state
interoperability standards. In India, in the federal state of Assam, PCs
with Linux and OpenOffice were given to students and the migration to open
source software was in progress in government offices.

============================================================

Privacy International in a coalition with over 50 other organisations from
around the world, including EDRI, is in the process of appealing for the
imminent implementation of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition
Act by the Japan's Ministry of Justice. The act will make fingerprint and
face-scan compulsory for Japan's visitors and foreign residents. The
campaign will be launched later this week.

If any organisation wants to endorse this privacy campaign, please contact
as soon as possible Gus Hosein - Privacy International - gus at privacy.org.
