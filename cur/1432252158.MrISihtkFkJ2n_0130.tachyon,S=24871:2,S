Fixing the Vote

Electronic voting machines promise to make elections more accurate than
ever before, but only if certain problems--with the machines and the wider
electoral process--are rectified

By Ted Selker

 Voting may seem like a simple activity--cast ballots, then count them.
Complexity arises, however, because voters must be registered and votes
must be recorded in secrecy, transferred securely and counted accurately.
We vote rarely, so the procedure never becomes a well-practiced routine.
One race between two candidates is easy. Half a dozen races, each between
several candidates, and ballot measures besides--that's harder. This
complex process is so vital to our democracy that problems with it are as
noteworthy as engineering faults in a nuclear power plant.

 Votes can be lost at every stage of the process. The infamous 2000 U.S.
presidential election dramatized some very basic, yet systemic, flaws
concerning who got to vote and how the votes were counted. An estimated
four million to six million ballots were not counted or were prevented from
being cast at all--well over 2 percent of the 150 million registered
voters. This is a shockingly large number considering that the decision of
which candidate would assume the most powerful office in the world came to
rest on 537 ballots in Florida.

 Three simple problems were to blame for these losses. The first, which
made up the largest contribution, was from registration database errors
that prevented 1.5 million to three million votes; this problem was
exemplified by 80,000 names taken off the Florida lists because of a poorly
designed computer algorithm. Second, a further 1.5 million to two million
votes were uncountable because of equipment glitches, mostly bad ballot
design. For example, the butterfly ballot of Palm Beach County confused
many into voting for an unintended candidate and also contributed to
another appalling outcome: 19,235 people, or 4 percent of voters, selected
more than one presidential candidate. Equipment problems such as clogged
punch holes resulted in an additional 682 dimpled ballots that were not
counted there. Finally, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, about one
million registered voters reported that polling-place difficulties such as
long lines prevented them from casting a vote.

 Thus, registration and polling-place troubles accounted for about two
thirds of the documentable lost votes in 2000. The remaining one third were
technology-related, most notably ballot design and mechanical failures. In
the aftermath of the 2000 election, officials across the country, at both
the federal and local levels, have scrambled to abandon old approaches,
such as lever machines and punch cards, in favor of newer methods. Many are
turning to electronic voting machines. Although these machines offer many
advantages, we must make sure that these new systems simplify the election
process, reduce errors and eliminate fraud.

 Some countries have introduced electronic systems with great success.
Brazil started testing electronic voting machines in the mid-1990s and
since 2000 has been using one type of machine across its vast pool of 106
million voters. It has multiple organizations responsible for different
aspects of voting equipment development as part of the safeguards. It also
introduced the machines in carefully controlled stages--with 40,000 voters
in 1996 (7 percent of whom failed to record their votes electronically) and
150,000 in 1998 (2 percent failure). Improvements based on those
experiments reduced the failure rate to an estimated 0.2 percent in 2000.

 Voting Technology
 Voting systems have a long history of advancing with technology. In
ancient Greece, Egypt and Rome, marks were made for candidates on pieces of
discarded pottery called ostraca. Paper superseded pottery in the
hand-counted paper ballot, which is still used by 1.3 percent of U.S.
voters. Other modern technologies are lever machines, punch cards and
mark-sense ballots (where each candidate's name is next to an empty oval or
other shape that must be marked correctly to indicate the selection, and a
scanner counts the votes automatically). The table on pages 94 and 95
summarizes the benefits and drawbacks of each of these methods and suggests
ways to improve them. A lengthier discussion of nonelectronic systems is at
www.sciam. com/ontheweb.

 Electronic voting machines have been around for 135 years--Thomas Edison
patented one in 1869. Elections started testing electronic voting machines
in the 1970s, when displaying and recording a ballot directly into a
computer file became economical. At first, many were mixed-media machines,
using paper to present the selections and buttons to record the votes.
Officials had to carefully align the paper with the buttons and indicator
lights. Electronic voting machines that use such paper overlays are still
on the market. More modern direct record electronic (DRE) voting machines
present the ballot and feedback information on an electronic display, which
may be combined with audio.

 Such machines have many advantages: they can stop a voter from choosing
too many candidates (called overvoting), and they can warn if no candidate
is picked on a race (undervoting). For instance, when Georgia changed over
to DREs in 2002, residuals (the total of overvotes and undervotes combined)
were reduced from among the worst in the nation at 3.2 percent on the top
race in 2000 to 0.9 percent in 2002. So-called ballotless voting allows the
machines to eliminate tampering with physical ballots during handling or
counting. (Lever machines, dating back to 1892, share many of those
features.)

 Yet the birthing of DRE voting equipment in the U.S. has not been easy.
The voting machine industry is fragmented, with numerous companies pursuing
a variety of products and without a mature body of industry-wide standards
in place. Deciding what is a good voting machine is still being discussed
by various advocacy organizations and groups such as the IEEE Project 1583
on voting equipment standards. Allegations of voting companies using money
to influence testing and purchasing of equipment are not uncommon.

 Complicating matters, local jurisdictions across the country have
different rules and approaches to testing and using voting equipment. Some
counties, such as Los Angeles, are sophisticated enough that they
commission voting machines built to their own specifications. Many other
municipalities know so little about voting that they employ voting
companies to run the election and report the results.

 Polling-place practices add further hazards of insecurity and potential
malfunctions. I recall walking into the central election warehouse (where
the voting machines are stored and the precinct vote tallies are combined)
in Broward County, Florida, when it was being used for a recount in
December 2002. The building's loading dock was opened to the outdoors for
ventilation. The control center for tallying all the votes was a small
computer room; the door to that room was ajar and no log was kept of
personnel entering and leaving.

 Beyond external issues, DRE machines themselves have had technological
shortcomings that have slowed their adoption. Voters have found their
displays confusing or challenging to use. Software bugs and difficulties in
setting up DREs have also presented problems. During the 2002 Broward
County recount, I was allowed to try out machines from Electronic Systems
and Services (ESS), one of the country's major election machine makers. The
ESS machines had an excessive undervote because the "move to next race"
button was too close to the "deposit my ballot" button. An audio ballot was
so poorly designed it took about 45 minutes to vote.

 On machines made by the company Sequoia, people who chose a straight party
vote and then tried to select that party's presidential candidate were
unaware that they were deselecting their presidential choice. A massive 10
percent undervote was registered in one county using Sequoia machines in
New Mexico.

 Examining the insides of new voting machines still reveals many physical
security faults. For example, some machines have a lifetime electronic
odometer that is supposed to read every vote that the machine makes. But
the odometer is connected to the rest of the machine by a cable that a
corrupt poll worker could unplug to circumvent it without breaking a seal.

 Source code for voting machines made by different companies, like most
commercial software, is a trade secret. Election machine companies allow
buyers to show the source code to experts under confidential terms.
Unfortunately, the local election officials might not know how to find a
qualified expert. And when they find one, will the voting companies be
required to listen? For instance, in 1997 Iowa was considering a voting
machine made by Global Election Systems, which was later bought out by
Diebold. Computer scientist Douglas W. Jones of the University of Iowa
pointed out security issues, and the state bought Sequoia machines instead.
In February 2003 Diebold left its software on unsecured servers, and DRE
critics posted Diebold's code on the Internet for everyone to see. The
problems that Jones saw six years earlier had not been fixed. Any person
with physical access to the machines and a moderate amount of computer
knowledge could have hacked into them to produce any outcome desired.

 The best computer security available depends on sophisticated encryption
and carefully designed protocols. Yet to know the system has not been
compromised requires testing. DRE machines have not received the constant
testing that they require. Security of today's voting machines is wholly
dependent on election workers and the procedures that they follow.

 Because virtually all tallies, no matter what voting method is used, are
now stored and transmitted in some electronic form, computer fraud is
possible with all voting systems. The advent of DRE machines potentially
allows such tampering to go unchecked from the point at which the voter
attempts to cast a ballot. Schemes for altering ballots have always
existed, but a computerized attack could have widespread effects were it
waged on a large jurisdiction that uses one kind of software on one type of
machine. Using a single system allows large jurisdictions to get organized
and improve their results but must be accompanied by stringent controls.

 The successful reduction of residuals across all of Georgia, mentioned
earlier, is a case in point. Thorough tests on the DREs at Kenisaw State
University found many problems, which were resolved before the machines
were put into use. This rigorous testing and careful introduction of the
machines were central to the state's success.

 Electronic Fraud
 How can we find all the dangers created by bad software and prevent or
correct them before they compromise an election? Reading source code
exposes its quality and its use of security approaches and can reveal bugs.
But the only completely reliable way to test software is by running it
through all the possible situations that it might be faced with.

 In 1983 Ken Thompson, on receipt of the Association for Computing
Machinery's Turing Award (the most prestigious award in computer science),
gave a lecture entitled "Reflections on Trusting Trust." In it he showed
the possibility of hazards such as "Easter eggs"--pieces of code that are
not visible to a reader of the program. In a voting machine, such code
would do nothing until election day, when it would change how votes were
recorded. Such code could be loaded into a voting machine in many ways: in
the voting software itself, in the tools that assemble the software
(compiler, linker and loader), or in the tools the program depends on
(database, operating system scheduler, memory management and
graphical-user-interface controller).

 Tests must therefore be conducted to catch Easter eggs and bugs that occur
only on election day. Many electronic voting machines have clocks in them
that can be set forward to the day of the election to perform a test. But
these clocks could be manipulated by officials to rerun an election and
create bogus voting records, so a safer voting machine would not allow its
clock to be set in the field. Such machines would need to be tested for
Easter egg fraud on election day. In November 2003 in California a random
selection of each electronic voting system was taken aside on the day of
election, and careful parallel elections were conducted to show that the
machines were completely accurate at recording votes. These tests
demonstrated that the voting machines were working correctly.

 To prepare for a fraud-free voting day requires that every effort be made
to create voting machines that do not harbor malicious code. The computer
science research community is constantly debating the question of how to
make provably secure software. Computer security experts have devised many
approaches to keep computers reliable enough for other purposes, such as
financial transactions. Financial software transfers billions of dollars
every day, is extensively tested and holds up well under concerted attacks.
The same security techniques can be applied to voting machines. Some
researchers believe that the security precautions of "open source" (making
the programs available for anyone to examine) and encryption techniques can
help but not completely guard against Easter eggs.

 Guarding votes against being compromised has always required multiple
human agents watching each other for mistakes or malice. The best future
schemes might include computer agents that check one another and create
internal audits to validate every step of the voting process. The Secure
Architecture for Voting Electronically (SAVE) at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology is a demonstration research project to explore such
an approach. SAVE works by having several programs carry out the same
tasks, but while using such different methods that each program would have
to be breached separately to compromise the final result. The system knows
to call foul when too many modules disagree.

 Audit Trails
 Some critics insist that the best way to ameliorate such attacks is by
providing a separate human-readable paper ballot. This widely promoted
scheme is the voter-verified paper ballot (VVPB) suggested by Rebecca
Mercuri, then at Bryn Mawr College. The voting machine prints out a
receipt, and the voter can look at it after voting and assure himself that
at least the paper records his intention. The receipt remains behind a
clear screen so no one can tamper with it during its inspection, and it is
retained by the machine. If a dispute about the electronic count arises, a
recount can be conducted using the printed receipts. (It is not a good idea
for the voter to have a copy, because such receipts could encourage the
selling of votes.)

 Although the VVPB looks quite appealing at first glance, a deeper
inspection exposes some serious flaws. First, it is complicated for the
voter. Elections in this country often have many races. Validating all the
selections on a separate paper after the ballot has been filled out is not
a simple task. Experience shows that even when confronted with a printout
that tells voters in which race they have made a mistake, few are willing
to go back and correct it. Anything that takes a voter's attention away
from the immediate act of casting a ballot will reduce the chances of the
person voting successfully. Every extra button, every extra step, every
extra decision is a source of lost votes.

 The scheme is also complicated for the officials. If a voter claims fraud,
what is the official to do? The voter claims she voted for Jane, but both
the DRE screen and the receipt show a vote for John. Should they close the
polling station? On top of this, the officials are not legally allowed to
see an individual voter's ballot.

 VVPB addresses only a small part of the fraud problem. The paper trails
themselves could be made part of a scheme for defrauding an election if a
hacker tampers with the printing software. The paper can be manipulated in
all the usual ways after the election.

 A better option would allow people to verify their selections with
recorded audio feedback. An audio transcript on tape or a CD has an
integrity that is harder to compromise than a collection of paper receipts.
Most current electronic voting machines can be set up to speak the choices
to the voter while he looks at the visual interface. The tape can be read
by a computer or listened to by people. Because misreads of paper are a
major difficulty with all counting machines today, the tape can be better
verified than paper receipts. An audio receipt is also preferable to a
paper receipt because it is hard to change or erase the audio verifications
without such alterations being noticed (think about the 18-minute gap on
the Watergate tapes). Also, a small number of cassette tapes or CDs are
easier to store and transport than thousands of paper receipts.

 Other proposals for voter verification include recording the video image
of the DRE and showing the ballot as it has been received by the central
counting databases while the voter is in the booth. The advantage of these
techniques is that they are passive--they do not require additional actions
on the part of the voter.

 Here is how voting might go using a well-designed audio record. Imagine
you are voting on a computer. You like Abby Roosevelt, Independent. You
press the touch-screen button for your choice. The name is highlighted, and
the vote button on one side is replaced with an unvote button on the other
side. The tab on the screen for this race shows that a selection has been
made. The earphones you are wearing tell you that you have voted for "Ben
Jefferson" (and these words are recorded on a backup tape).

 Wait a minute! "Ben Jefferson"? You realize that you must have pressed the
wrong button by mistake. You study the screen and see a prominent "cancel
vote" button. You press it. "Vote for Ben Jefferson for president
canceled," the computer intones onto a tape and into your ears. The screen
returns to its prevote state, and this time you press more carefully and
are rewarded with "Vote cast for Abby Roosevelt, Independent, for
president." You go on to the Senate race.

 The features just described are designed to give feedback in ways you are
most adept at understanding. People are good at noticing labels moving,
tabs changing, and contrast and texture changes. We have trouble doing
things accurately without such feedback. The audio verification comes right
at a time when the user is performing the action. Perceptual tasks (seeing
movement and hearing the audio) are easier to perform than cognitive ones
(reading a paper receipt and remembering all the candidates one intended to
vote for). A tape or CD recording is a permanent, independent transcript of
your vote.

 These features are all implementable now as ballot improvements on current
voting machines. Extra work would be needed to allow sight- or
hearing-impaired people to verify multiple records of their ballot as well.

 Some researchers are studying alternatives to DREs, in the form of
Internet voting or voting using familiar devices such as the phone. Since
May 2002, England has been experimenting with a number of systems intended
to increase turnout. These methods include mailing in optically readable
paper ballots (absentee voting), using a standard phone call and the
phone's keypad, using the instant-messaging facilities on cell phones and
using interactive TV that is available in English homes. Swindon Borough,
for example, included more than 100,000 voters in an experiment using the
Internet and telephones. A 10-digit PIN was hand-delivered to voters'
homes. This PIN was used in conjunction with a password the voters had been
sent separately to authorize them to vote. No fraud was detected or
reported. But the effort only improved turnout by 3 percentage points (from
28 to 31 percent).

 In contrast, introducing the option of absentee voting increased voter
turnout by 15 percentage points--but with a downside: large-scale vote
buying was reported in Manchester and Bradford. (Being able to prove whom
you have voted for, such as by showing the ballot you are mailing in,
enables vote buying.)

 What Must Be Done
 The universal adoption of perfect voting machines will not be happening
anytime soon. But quite independent of the specific machines used, much can
and should be done simply to ensure that votes are collected and accurately
counted in the U.S. We must be adamant about the following improvements:

 1. We must simplify the registration system. The largest loss of votes in
2000 occurred because errors in registration databases prevented people
from voting. Registration databases must be properly checked to make sure
they include all eligible people who want to be registered. We must develop
national standards and technology to ensure that people can register
reliably but that they do not register and vote in multiple places.

 2. Local election officials must understand the operation of their
equipment and test its performance thoroughly when it is delivered and
before each election. DREs should be tested on election day, using dummy
precincts.

 3. Local election officials must teach their workers using simple
procedures to run the equipment and other processes. Ballot making,
marking, collecting and counting all must be carefully set up to avoid
error and fraud. Many voting officials inadvertently use procedures that
compromise accuracy, security and integrity of ballots by, for example,
turning off precinct scanning machines that check for overvotes and
inspecting and "correcting" ballots.

 4. Each step in the voting process must be resistant to tampering.
Collecting, counting and storing of ballots must be done with documentation
of who touches everything and with clear procedures for what to do with the
materials at each stage. Multiple people must oversee all critical
processes.

 5. Each task in the voting process must be clear and accessible, have
helpful feedback and allow a person to validate it. Perceptual, cognitive,
motor and social capabilities of people must be taken into account when
designing machines and ballots. Ballot designs should pass usability and
countability tests before being shown for final approval to the parties
invested in the election. Voters must be able to understand how to make
their selections, and votes must be easy to count in mass quantities.

 6. The government should invest in research to develop and test secure
voting technology, including DREs and Internet voting. Rushing to adopt
present-day voting machines is not the best use of funds in the long term.

 7. Standards of ethics must be set and enforced for all poll workers and
also for voting companies regarding investments in them and donations by
them or their executives.

 Only when these requirements are met will we have a truly secure and
accurate voting system, no matter what underlying technology is used.
