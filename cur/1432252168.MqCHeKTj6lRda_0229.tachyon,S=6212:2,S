     Yes, while it would be unconstitutional for the federal government to
pass this law, how could it be unconstitutional as a local or state
statute?  Something similar to requiring X number of smoke detectors per
square foot.  Additionally, it does not mention a paperwork requirement for
not owning a gun.

     While I admit it seems like a foolish law (akin to requiring a citizen
to vote), I hardly see how it would require 'a killing'.  Also, given their
views, killing them may not be as easy as others who are unarmed. ;-)

Thanks!

This has been done before. A town in Georgia, one in Ohio or
Illinois, as I recall.

t is just as unconstitutional to _require_ a gun as it is to _ban_ guns.

The crap about "conscientious objector" is just that, crap. I shouldn't
have to fill out some bullshit form to say I have conscientious
objections to having a gun in my house.

Government may no more require a gun in a house than it may require a
television, or a telephone, or a toothbrush.

Yes, I know the law is pure fluff, and hence is moot, a nullity, as
they say. But the principle of _requiring_ a  gun is just as foolish
as the notion of banning guns. Frankly, those who pass such laws need
killing just as much as the tens of thousands who are banning guns
need killing.
