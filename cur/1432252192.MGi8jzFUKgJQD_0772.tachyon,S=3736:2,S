Right, I agree.

But what I'd like to consider is a recipe for "plain ordinary"
folk to conspire anonymously to commit murder.

Not just any murder: murder for some of the people who (some
people on this list have said), are needing killin'.

If a bunch of crypto anarchists or whoever decide to knock off
Bill Gates or Al Gore (who really didn't invent the Internet
well enough...), you can bet someone will come looking pretty hard!

Again, I see this as a serious problem in applied cryptography.
