I find myself storing a pile of vaugely sensitive information on my 
palm.  Where do I find the competent analysis of this?  Ideally, I'd
like to be able to protect things that I move into a "sensitive" area
(passwords), and maybe select items in other places that I want to
encrypt.  I don't really want to have to enter a password each time I
look at my schedule and todo lists.

Someone suggested YAPS
(http://www.palmblvd.com/software/pc/Yaps-2000-11-7-palm-pc.html) are
there others I should look at?
