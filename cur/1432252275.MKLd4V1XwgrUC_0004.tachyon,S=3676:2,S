This remionds me of something I've been wondering about, which may actually 
call for warchalking (though I'm sure warchalking is not being used for this 
yet).

Here in NYC Verizon has already set up about 50 802.11b nodes on top of 
telephone booths, and when they're finished there will be about 150 city 
wide. Now one of these nodes is down the street (Wall Street), but its too 
far out of range for me to reach from my desk. The Starbucks across the 
street, however, is a different story.

Now I'm wondering...if there existed an 802.11b repeater between Starbucks 
and the Verizon hotspot, then I could potentially send a friend working down 
by Wall and Water email or whatever without the message ever going wireline. 
(Is this correct? Of course it assumes that the IP shortest path is a 
wireless one.) Since any 802.11 repeaters that might ever come into being 
could be quite cheap, I can easily see private citizens installing them in 
order to connect 802.11 b/a/g islands together, bypassing the wireline 
infrastructure althogether. Warchalking would help such folks determine how 
far the hotspots actually are from one another, to see if a repeater is 
needed.
