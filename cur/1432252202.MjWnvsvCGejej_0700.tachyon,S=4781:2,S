When individuals distribute information about or alternatively manufacture 
explosives they are prosecuted. When corporations manufacture explosive 
devices and sell them to people/countries who use them to kill and opress 
other people it's acceptable and encouraged. Does posting a route to R.D.X. 
makes one a criminal or does it turn this page into a terrorist page(Oh, my 
oh my)!! ;)
Manufacture: 100mL of 95% or better white nitric acid, 14g of 
hexamethylenetetramine, 16g of ammonium nitrate, 100mL of acetone, A 150mL 
beaker, A 250mL beaker, A 500mL beaker, A hot water bath, A cold water/ice 
bath, A glass rod, A thermometer, 1000mL of distilled water, 100mL of 10% 
sodium carbonate solution, A filter funnel, Two filter papers.
1) Pour the nitric acid into the 250mL beaker, and put it into the cold 
water bath. 2) Add the ammonium nitrate, abd stir it until it dissolves. 3) 
While keeping the temperature at around 25*C, stir in the 
hexamethylenetetramine. 4) When it has all been added, stir it for 10 
minutes while warming it up to 50*C to 55*C in the hot water bath. 5) Hold 
it at 50*C to 55*C for 5 minutes, and then let it cool back down to 20*C. 
6) Pour 300mL of distilled water into the 500mL beaker, and add the 
reaction to it. 7) Leave it to precipitate the R.D.X., and filter it out. 
8) Wash the solid in the filter with 150mL of water, then the sodium 
carbonate soltion, then with the remaining 150mL of water. 9) Scoop the 
crystals out into the 150mL beaker, and add the acetone. 10) Warm it to 
50*C in the hot water bath, and filter it. 11) Dump the filtrate into 400mL 
of cold, distilled water, and filter out the crystals. 12) Leave the 
crystals spread out to dry.
Does this sound right to youse?
