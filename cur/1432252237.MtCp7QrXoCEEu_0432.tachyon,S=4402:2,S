They aren't *knowingly* lieing - that is the point. Church types firmly believe hell exists,
and only pestering a omnipotent and omniscient being (who therefore already knows what they
wanted to say, and could do something about it if he chose to) will prevent them visiting it
(as opposed to actually being nice to other people and so forth, which would at least be
productive)

Nope. but they should be prosecuted if they front-page splash it as "earth doomed, we have
two weeks to live, there is no hope" and fail to mention that it is a religious prediction
that the scientific community has a few issues with....

> Should someone be prosecuted for saying the Holocaust never happened,
> or was exaggerated greatly by the Jewish lobby?
That is borderline. given that the accepted body of fact admits that the Holocaust not only
happened, but was pretty much as described by the Jewish lobby, then any claims that it
didn't happen should be accompanied by pretty convincing evidence. Not that I think the
Holocaust justifies what is going down with the palastinians, but I don't think it can be
denied that it actually happened.

If there were no distinction between what could be presented as fact, and what couldn't, a
lot of marketers would be a lot happier. Of course, I am writing from a UK viewpoint, but I
suspect that the US has similar rules about advertising that (for example) claims that a
given car can get 250km on a single tank of fuel, when it is lucky to get 25...

As I understand it, the idea of "impartial journalism" was a marketing gimmick - to sell
wire news to local papers without having to adjust it to the local "slant"

"best investigative journalism on the planet" - MiB ;)

Or the police could have contracted for an extra page (small batch, a few dozen copies) that
they then substitute for the real one in the editions sent to the criminal concerned.

doesn't mean they can't answer the question "what is a *deliberate* lie"
