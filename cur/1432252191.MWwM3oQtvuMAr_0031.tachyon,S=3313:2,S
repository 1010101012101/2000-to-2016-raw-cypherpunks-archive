.. and a companion article says that some hotel chains are prepared to do 
pre-screening for their customers, too, and have responded to FBI requests 
for information after 9/11. In particular, Hilton Hotels, which also owns 
the Hampton Inn, Doubletree, and Embassy Suites chains, as well as the 
Waldorf-Astoria in NY and Palmer House in Chicago, says that they've 
already got the technology in place and that it would be easy for them to 
incorporate the necessary configuration changes. The CIO of Hilton is says 
the only obstacle would be "privacy-related issues", which are likely to be 
no issue at all if customers don't know it's happening or don't get an 
opportunity to object.
