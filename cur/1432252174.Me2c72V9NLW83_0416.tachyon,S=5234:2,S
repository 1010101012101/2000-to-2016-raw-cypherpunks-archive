> What about this model? In a network you send your public email encryption

> The institution is defined by a name (e.g. AES string) and postal address
> (e.g. hash key). Having this information added to your node, all your email
> to you or from you will be stored in the virtual email provider
> institution. This detaches your nodes IP and encrpytion key from the
> institution. That means, care-off (c/o) institutions will be able to house
> 3rd-party e-mail without needing to distribute their own public keys.

> the webserver stores the emails, even if Alice or Bob are offline.
> 
> 2) Or/additionally: Create an virtual institution and add the email key of

Although technical solutions are feasible, we ought to consider some things:
- Email is older than the web itself;
- Email has three times as many users as all social networks combined;
- Email is entrenched in the offices, many a business is powered by it;

Given the enormous energy necessary to remove such an appliance and replace it with something better. How could we make a secure solution that plays nicely with the current tools without disturbing too much what is already established?
