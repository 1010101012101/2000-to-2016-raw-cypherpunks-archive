God, how dumb can you get?

Not only is this a systematic, police-state invasion of privacy with
international repercussions, but it defeats the purpose of the
redundant, distributed Internet architecture. The invasion of privacy
can be defeated by strong encryption and other measures discussed on
this list, but the vulnerability created by concentrating data links can
only be fixed by setting up high-bandwidth channels that bypass US
jurisdiction.
