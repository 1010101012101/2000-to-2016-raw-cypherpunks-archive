Freedom fighters are generally funded by expatriates resident in
sympathetic foreign countries.   These expatriates need C3
equipment to ensure that their money is not being embezzled or
misused.  By and large they are not using it, and should be.

I find this unlikely.  The powerful confiscate from the
vulnerable because they want the money, not because the
vulnerable are sinners deserving to have their money confiscated.

It is always loudly proclaimed that the money is tainted.  When
the Swiss banks were receiving the money from jews it was
supposedly tainted because it came from jews.  Later it was
supposedly tainted because it came from nazis.  Any money is
tainted when someone else wants it.
