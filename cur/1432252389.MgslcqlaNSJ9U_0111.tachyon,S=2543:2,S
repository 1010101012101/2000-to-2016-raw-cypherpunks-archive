Hi all!

As I informed this maillist my companys servers (including finnish
tor-exit-node) were taken by the finnisih police circa january 2008. They
were very rude and called me a pedophile etc. Really nice to know that
police is your friend :P...

Few days ago I got a letter from the department of justice, they are not
going to press any charges 'cause they finally realised that my server was
just relaying traffic and that is not a crime. I've been waiting that
letter for many months and I'm really glad they finally made a wise
decision.

Now I'm going to consult my lawyer and possibly going to demand
compensation for my losses. I had to buy new servers, restore everything
from backups, help the "Central Crime Police" (KRP) because I was'nt using
Windows but Debian GNU/Linux and full encryption (aes-cbc-essiv:sha256).
Also all the sites, domains and email-services I hosted were down about 48
hours and customers do not like that.

Wish me luck =)

M
