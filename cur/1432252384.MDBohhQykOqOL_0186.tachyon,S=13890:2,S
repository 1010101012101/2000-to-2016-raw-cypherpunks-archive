Hi Ryan,

This is Ben the Pyrate. I'm glad you're interested in Project Byzantium.

Well you reached me, at least. I'm forwarding this on to the Project
Byzantium mailing list to bring everyone else in the loop. There is a
lot of good information in your email which I believe will be of
interest to everyone. You can join our mailing list by signing up at the

I agree, that sounds like a great place to test and demonstrate a
project like Byzantium. As long as there is the understanding that
Byzantium is still in development and not ready for use in life-or-death
situations.

I am not planning on attending, but perhaps other members are? We still
have a number of v0.2a CDs left over and I would be willing to send them
up with someone so they can get into the hands of testers.

Yep, we have heard about this one but so far there is no code, only some
documentation on the protocol. We're not certain wether or not this is
redundant with other solutions we have also been looking at. We are
planning to keep an eye on their developments.

I was not aware of Forban, but it certainly does look like something
that might be useful to us. I will look into it further and perhaps we
can try it out at our development sprint this weekend.

Yes, we're aware of the Serval project and we're also eager to make sure
that our networks can interoperate seamlessly. They are doing a lot of
good work and we are keeping an eye on them as well. We may incorporate
some of their software into future versions of Byzantium.

Thanks, the above projects are all very interesting and definitely
in-line with what we're trying to offer. We will try to evaluate and
intregrate these into future builds.

Bitcoin is quite a fascinating idea in many ways, however I don't think
it is very relevant to Byzantium's core mission. I'm very sure it could
be operated over a mesh network like Byzanitum. However, I don't really
see how Bitcoin would be useful from an emergency response perspective.
I could be wrong and I would be glad to hear opposing arguments. However,
for now I don't think it will be part of the standard distribution. (Of
course, there's nothing stopping you from installing it yourself or
making a re-spin of our distribution.)

We are currently doing our best to reach out to other mesh networking
projects and communities to collaborate on a set of standards and best
practices for interoperability. We are working on a proposal which will
be presenting in early October. Byzantium is somewhat narrowly focused
on one piece of the problem-set, so we are eager to collabroate with
complimentary projects who are solving other pieces (such as Serval and
Commotion Wireless). However, we are currently working in our spare time
on almost no budget so don't expect overnight progress.

Our next release won't happen for several months so the v0.2a release
will still be the most current version in mid-September. We don't have
the resource to make an updated release for S17. Even if we did, there
haven't been any significant changes to warrant it.

Good luck, and please let us know how Byzanitum does "in the field". We
are always eager to see user feedback and bug reports.
