Actually if you can pull that off you've got yourself a darn fine 
real random number generator- any PRNG has to have some period after 
which it will begin to recycle (assuming no other randomness in 
introduced into the system), in which case you just set i>the period 
and read off future states using
current state +1 = current state - period + 1. Assuming I< the period 
then I believe you have a fairly good definition.  A 
cryptographically strong PRNG would then be a PRNG with a very large 
period and some way of reinjecting randomness to guarantee the device 
never begins to recycle.
