Agreed. It is a DNS issue.

nslookup from one box without cryptome.org cached gives me:
"can't find cryptome.org: Non-existent host/domain"

John might want to temporarily redirect cryptome.org to the IP address
(if his setup allows him to) so people get the hint, and make a note
of the IP address in large type on his homepage.

Since John talked about some server changes with Verio, it's likely
their DNS problem. Also, whois shows the cryptome.org record was
updated Oct 1 and is pointing to secure.net, whatever that is.
