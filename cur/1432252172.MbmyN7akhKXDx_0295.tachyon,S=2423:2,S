The US never intended to use its military might to defeat an
unconventional enemy.

It intended to use its military might in the entirely conventional way
to destroy or deter governments that foster terrorism, as was
accomplished very successfully in Afghanistan.

Regime change in Iraq was supposed to deter Syria and Iran, but they
have not in fact been deterred.  Saudi Arabia and Libya have been
deterred.  Indonesia has changed its policy on terror, but it is
unclear whether this was the result of the spectacle of Saddam and his
bullet ridden sons or honest soul searching.
