TV ANNOUNCER:  In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer was 
quoted as saying: "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an 
intellectual property sense to everything it touches."

The medical researchers at Beaker-Bunsen took up the challenge to 
carefully dissect Balmer's statement.  They discovered there was 
indeed medical precedent for calling Linux a cancer.

We asked them what the medical equivalent would be for Windows.  
"Tourette syndrome, of course" they replied.
