Each weekday, dozens of U.S. government aircraft take to the skies and
slowly circle over American cities. Piloted by agents of the FBI and
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the planes are fitted with
high-resolution video cameras, often working with "augmented reality"
software that can superimpose onto the video images everything from
street and business names to the owners of individual homes. At least
a few planes have carried devices that can track the cell phones of
people below. Most of the aircraft are small, flying a mile or so
above ground, and many use exhaust mufflers to mute their engines --
making them hard to detect by the people they're spying on. [...] The
government's aerial surveillance programs deserve scrutiny by the
Supreme Court, said Adam Bates, a policy analyst with the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C. "It's very
difficult to know, because these are very secretive programs, exactly
what information they're collecting and what they're doing with it,"
Bates told BuzzFeed News.
