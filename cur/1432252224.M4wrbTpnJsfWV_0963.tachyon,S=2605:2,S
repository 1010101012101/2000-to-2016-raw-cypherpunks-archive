Connectionless protocols havent been an issue for Mallory for years.

While i am no longer working in the core, when I left, there were already 
a half dozen tools widely distributed that could pull of reconstruction of 
just about any defined protocol, connectionless, connection, or 
multiflow/multiconnection.

Lawful intercept requirements are still a debated topic, however, when I 
left most was being done under an FBI Patriot Letter.  Once in a great 
while you'd see another agency, but FBI is the primary Mallory of concern 
today: Draw your own conclusions as to what they can/cant do with caution 
though.  They now know when they dont know, and demand assistance.
