As I said, an Islamic regime is objectionable if it tolerates 
terror against non islamic minorities, thus creating, perhaps 
unintentionally, an environment that facilitates terror against 
external infidels - that is to say, terror against me and 
people like me.

That "case" is a nutty rationalization put forward by the 
former fans of the Khmer Rouge to rationalize their bad 
conduct.

The Khmer Rouge came to power in the same way communists did in 
Laos: because the North Vietnamese created them armed them, and 
then engaged in major military intervention to bring them to 
power.
