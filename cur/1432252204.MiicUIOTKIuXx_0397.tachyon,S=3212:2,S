I live in this area too and this is far different than the one I 
heard.  The description of events that I heard was that he was bothering 
*no one*, simply walking around wearing a shirt.  The mall did make that 
claim but I haven't heard anyone else say he was bothering anyone.  The 
newspaper story said they mall had one complaint about him, not "many." 
Also, the subsequent patrons wearing "Give peace a chance" where booted too 
and they were definitely not bothering anyone.  Only when public pressure 
came to bear did they relent.

Let's see, you believe you're engaging in protected speech, rent-a-cops 
come and tell you to stop, and you don't believe you have to. If you're 
going to lie down if you believe you have a valid argument then that's 
really weak.

I happen to agree with those who said that since he was on private property 
the property owners had every right to boot him off. I just think you 
should do a little more fact-checking before you post.
