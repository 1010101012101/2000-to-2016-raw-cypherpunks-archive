I suggest a more straightforward way to "avoid being labeled" by such a 
voodoo bullshit thing as the MMPI: don't take it. Nobody at any company 
I have ever been connected with has required it of their employees, the 
law can't require it (even if one is ordered into a "psychiatric 
evaluation," it cannot be compelled, for the same reason no speech can 
be compelled).

A simple litmus test: if one is working for an employer or agency which 
requires psychobabble tests, one is working for the wrong side.

You're a waste of electrons here. Even Agent Farr was more on-topic. Is 
this some kind of ersatz chick thing?
