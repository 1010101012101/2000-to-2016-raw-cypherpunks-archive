In 1972 (the year before the APA unilaterally decided 
homosexuality was "no longer an illness") the Gay Rights Platform was 
drawn up at the convention of the National Coalition of Gay Organizers. 
 It was officially set forth at the Gay Pride March on Washington, D.C. 
on April 25, 1993 and has been reinforced every year since.  

	By the way, a couple more of the demands:

	1)	Demand that contraceptives and abortion services be made 
		available to all persons, regardless of age (what the 
		hell does that matter to homosexuals???);

	2)	Full inclusion of lesbians, homosexual men, bisexuals 	
		and transgenders in education of children and child 	
		care;

	3)	 Legalization of all forms of sexual expression, 
		including pedophilia, changing age of consent laws to 
		allow sex with children;

	4)	demand that Federal Defense budget funds be diverted to 
		cover AIDS patients' medical expenses...  

	The 1998 Federal Budget included $4.746 *BILLION* for AIDS 
funding.  That was a $465 million increase over the 1997 Budget, which 
is more funding than all forms of cancer combined.  Current Federal 
Money (your tax dollars and mine) spent per  death:

	AIDS/HIV:	$39,172.00
	Diabetes:	$ 5,449.00
	Cancer:		$ 3,776.00
	Heart Disease:	$ 1,056.00
	Stroke:		$   765.00

	What's wrong with this picture?	You don't get cancer by engaging 
in promiscuous sex.  Funding should not be based on sexual behaviors.
