Hey, don't mention it. But don't miss the other areas of his policies, 
like  women's rights, and such as the following: 

"He supports limits on free speech over the Internet. He supported  
legislation, later held unconstitutional, that sought to censor  
communications over the Internet. And he supported legislation to 
require  mandatory use of filtering on all computers used by 
schools and libraries  receiving federal e-rate assistance." 

Of course I realize that the freedom of citizens to bear arms is 
going to be  near and dear to many if not all participating in this 
list. But one has to  balance one issue against others. I feel that 
women's rights are especially  important in a democratic society, 
and I also feel that anyone who supports  the right to bear arms but 
also supports the removal of separation of church  and state, and 
the impositions against your speech over the internet to  which 
such a postion leads, is not worth your time. I personally would 
want  to find a better figure to symbolize and speak for my right to 
arm myself.
