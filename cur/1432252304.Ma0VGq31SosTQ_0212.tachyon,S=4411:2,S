This isn't just the default behavior; it's the only defined behavior
right?

While it's _possible_ to do this, I've never heard of a server hosted
application that advertises that it's doing this.  I would think it
would be quite hard to get a CA to issue you a certificate if this is
what you intended to do with it (act as a general MITM on SSL
connections you proxy).

There have been applications which do this locally eg. a no longer
shipped product called SafePassage by c2.net, and achilles a SSL
debugger both of which are local proxies and both of which ask the
user to install a certificate allowing this when they are installed.
The installed certificate is self-signed however, and not issued by a
CA, as it is only valid for that user machine anyway, the user won't
want to buy a cert to authenticate information to their own machine,
it would be less secure to do so, and the user won't want to pay for
this certificate.

Is there any software actually doing this?  (I know wild card certs
are available, but would think a wild card cert on .com would be a
very dangerous thing for a CA to issue, and you'd hope browsers would
be smart enough to reject such certs).

This is what SafePassage et al do.
