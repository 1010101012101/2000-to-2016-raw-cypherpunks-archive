I won't include text of the original articles, no. I no longer even
include partial quotes in my discussion (and cut them out of anything I
reply to usually). If I have something to say specific to their
topics I include it. I try to make sure the titles give some clear
description of what the article is about (I try to use the original titles
but sometimes that doesn't work). Outside of that I'm sticking with the
URL's themselves. I'll do my best to make sure they are topical and
interesting, that's the best I can promise.

Consider it 'minimalist performance art directed at political protest'.
And yes, I understand it pisses some off. Imagine how pissed off I am at
being reduced to this level of communications 'for the children'...
