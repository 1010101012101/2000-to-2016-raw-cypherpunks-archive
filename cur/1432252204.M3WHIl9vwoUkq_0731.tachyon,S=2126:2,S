IE first checks that the software is digitally signed, and then 
asks the user do you want to run this software signed by so and 
so.   Then IE allows it to run.

You do not just go to the web page.  You go to the web page and
IE asks if this is OK.

Of course there are lots and lots of web pages that say "Hey, 
click here to view me naked -- just click yes to all the stupid 
dialogs that come up"
