"YOU want to do the encryption, not the ISP who can be secretly subpoenaed 
to
hand over the plain text."

Well, that too!

My point is and has been "crypto is econnomics" (to paraphrase Tim May 
during one of his moments of clarity). Better to get 'them' to get a 
subpeona and make 'em expend the effort (and $$$), just to find out the 
email's about Pamela Anderson's boobs. Or, better yet, to find out the 
enduser also encrypted the email (AND it's about Pamela Anderson's boobs).

Even if they dig out the plaintext, let them spend thousands of $$$ while we 
spend pennies. Eventually you gotta figure that'll eat into the invasionary 
funds, no? (Or am I being naive?)
