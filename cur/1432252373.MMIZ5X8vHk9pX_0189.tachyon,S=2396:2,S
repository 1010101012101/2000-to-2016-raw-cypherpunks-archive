This looks like a homework assignment for a class.

If a, b, c, and d are all arbitrary symbols, most substitutions (such 
as a = 2, b = 5, etc.) certainly will _not_ give (a*d)*d=a*(d*d)=d as a 
true statement. Only special values of a and d will make that true. 
(For example, a = 1 and d = 1 makes (1*1)*1=1*(1*1)=1. Other values may 
as well. Finding them is up to you.

Lastly, your English is again unclear. "So can (a*d)*d=a*(d*d)=d 
considered as associative over * for this case as per definition?" 
isn't a proper English sentence.

Why do you keep posing these problems to the list? Are they homework 
problems? Do you think the list is just too quiet and needs ill=phrased 
puzzlers to keep it occupied?

Did you ever do the coin flip experiment we suggested you do?

Are you an AI which has failed the Turing Test and escaped?
