Thoughts on the double quoted post? I tend to concur; But perhaps we can
create a little list discussion; It seems somewhat up our alley, eh?

Not a matter of trust but a matter of risk acceptance. I feel the same way
about banks but the entire 1st world seems to have accepted the risk of
banking. Internet services are developing the same way. Everyone uses email
now and it's hard to get through the world without it. A very large
population uses a free email service. When the entire world accepts this
risk, you lose the ability to reject the risk.

This does not make things right.

My prediction: in 20 years or less, you will need special authorization or
license to operate your own MTA. It will start out small, such as
"registering a legitimate server to be placed on whitelists" then made
mandatory by whatever acting government is ruling at the time. Webservers
may take the same route. Unauthorized servers will be eliminated.

Your privacy is a commodity. Do your economic duty and let people have
access to your life. What do you have to hide, Citizen?
