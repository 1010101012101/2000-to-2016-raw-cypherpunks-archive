it would be very interesting to combine the black budget disclosures
(as limited as they are) with the open data dumps for other
contracting, with the corporate financial reporting from the various
incorporated institutions implicated.  obviously privately held
interests will be harder to crack,...

this would provide a very interesting source of information for
further discovery along the timeline for which budget details are
visible.

given the RSA payout (as meager as it was, just for a little code
change ;) financial signals traced to these budgets could help
quantify the degree of complicity and duplicitous venality of various
technology vendors.  some affected are certainly more victims than
co-conspirators.

best regards,
