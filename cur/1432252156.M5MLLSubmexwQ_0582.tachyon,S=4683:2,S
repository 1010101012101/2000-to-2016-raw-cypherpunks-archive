While I agree with your assessment that he has "earned killing", I do not
see how my failure to kill him earns doubt - one does not necessarily
follow the other (in the real world anyway - the "ideal" world is
something completely different).

I did not, and likely will never have the opportunity to kill the bastard.  
Nevertheless, this was a very radicalizing event in my life, and was the
foundation upon which many of my future "incidents" were based.  In a way,
the guy did me a favor: he permanently opened my eyes to the Real World.

His reward, and society's reward, is that I am now a fervently
anti-government/anti-LEO prick, who will never again work within the
system (or for that matter, do anything to assist it in any way, shape, or
form).  

I firmly believe that he and his ilk will get the killing they so richly
deserve when enough people finally wake up and form a [political] critical
mass.  Until then, I choose not to take the lone-gunman approach - yes, I
am a pussy :-(

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
