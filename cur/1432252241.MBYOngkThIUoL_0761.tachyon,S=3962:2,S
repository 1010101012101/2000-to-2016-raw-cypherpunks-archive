I don't know how many people have seen this already...


Interesting new data released Monday by Syracuse University on the
Dept. of Homeland Security. It includes employees by county for the
entire country:

http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/tracdhs/030825/county_full.html

which, curiously, shows Boulder with zero full-time DHS employees but
San Miguel (Telluride) with 7!

It also includes this, from
http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/tracdhs/aboutdata030825.html

"TRACs direct experiences with the DHS in connection with the FOIA law
thus far have not been encouraging. Most of our FOIA requests to the
department, for example, have yet to be acted upon although -- given
the short time that has elapsed since our initial requests -- this may
not be entirely surprising. More disturbing is the fact that many of
public records that the Freedom of Information Act requires be posted
on the agencys web site are not yet available.

"But there have been a number of additional specific incidents that
heighten our concern. In an attempt to telephone the departments
public affairs office in June, for example, TRAC was twice informed
that the direct-dial number of this office was not a matter of public
record. On a second occasion, after a FOIA officer in one of DHS
sub-agencies promised to fax TRAC a list identifying documents that
the FOIA specifically mandates be made public, the promise was
withdrawn. Then another DHS sub-agency informed TRAC it would not act
on our FOIA request -- an outcome flowing from its failure to classify
Syracuse University as qualifying as an educational ...institution
whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research. On yet another
occasion, a TRAC request for more timely information to update
material posted some months before on a sub-agencys public web site
was summarily refused."

They also track FBI and other govt ops...

Subject: Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

TRAC's first special report on the DHS is now available. This report
provides comprehensive information about the staff of an agency which
now employs one out of every twelve full-time federal workers: where
they work, what they are paid, what they do and the agencies within
the department that employ them.  Analysis, maps, tables and graphs
are available.  Also presented are data documenting staff changes
between 9/11 and March 31, 2003.
