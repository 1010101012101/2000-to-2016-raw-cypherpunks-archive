General Electric's Power Systems division is very profitable. Should it
start giving away its stock in trade to poor nations which "need" an
electric generation plant, regardless of the nation's prior
mismanagement which led to its inability to pay?

Bull. The overweight still get coverage.

In re b), Bob won't be denied health _care_, regardless of his genetic
abnormalities or actual medical history, provided that he pays for it.
Also, food and medical coverage are apples and oranges, to torture a
metaphor. There is an upper limit to what people spend on food, even
given unlimited resources. There seems to be _no_ upper limit on what
people will spend on medical care. This is exacerbated when costs are
shared.

In re c), what, you've never heard of free clinics? Hell, I've donated
piles (in terms of my net worth) of cash to clinics, on the premise that
helping to control VD will have a societal benefit in excess of many
other uses of the money. For that matter, when my son was born I noticed
that I had been assessed about $400 to help cover the medical costs of
the indigent. (Which pissed me off, since I wasn't notified beforehand
that the hospital would do that, nor given a chance to opt out, but
that's another topic.)

Wow, you haven't been reading c-punks long. If Tim makes a personal
attack on you, it'll usually involve an observation that you should be
killed.

I would say that Tim's comment, above, is more an observation than an
attack. I agree with him completely, except that he doesn't go far
enough.
