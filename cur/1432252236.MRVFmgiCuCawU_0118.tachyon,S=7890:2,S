TRENDS IN INTELLIGENCE SPENDING, AND MORE FROM CRS

The rise and fall (and rise) of intelligence spending over the past three
decades is traced in a newly updated report from the Congressional Research
Service.

"Limited publicly available data suggests intelligence spending, measured
in constant 2014 dollars, has roughly doubled since the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks and, before declines over the last three years, was
almost double spending at its peak at the end of the cold war," the CRS
report notes.

The report does not explicitly deal with the latest disclosure of a
classified intelligence budget document in the Washington Post. "Because
the document leaked to the news media is classified, CRS is unable to
provide a discussion of the specific detail of that budget submission." But
the report provides a useful compilation of previously disclosed
intelligence budget data, along with some sensible extrapolations to round
out the picture.

CRS also reviews proposals to restructure the intelligence budgeting
process.  See "Intelligence Spending and Appropriations: Issues for
Congress," September 5, 2013:

	http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R42061.pdf

But any proposals to modify current intelligence budget practices face
strong opposition in Congress. In its report on the FY2014 defense
authorization act, the House Armed Services Committee included language to
prohibit efforts by the Secretary of Defense to create a new budget account
for the National Intelligence Program. (Section 924)

   http://gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt102/html/CRPT-113hrpt102.htm

The Committee also said that the Defense Department has been secretly
maneuvering to promote a consolidated National Intelligence Program budget
within the Department of Defense as a separate budget category -- a step
favored by the 9/11 Commission, among others, as a way to increase clarity
and accountability in intelligence spending. "The committee is concerned
that the executive branch has failed to notify the appropriate
congressional committees about its continuing efforts to pursue
consolidation of the portion of the Department of Defense budget designated
as part of the National Intelligence Program," the House report said. The
Committee directed the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress
on "any planning [for future intelligence budget consolidation] that has
occurred during the past two years."
