I wasn't trolling. I've been a member of this list, and paying close
attention to the field, since well before I joined the US government (which
happened back in May).

Before this, I worked for 5 years at a relatively adversarial non-profit
group focused on government transparency, called the Sunlight Foundation.

I also did personal work on furthering encryption and drawing attention to
government surveillance:

https://konklone.com/post/the-door-to-the-fisa-court
https://twitter.com/fisacourt

I still work on them, and stuff like it, in my personal capacity. I'm on
the record in all kinds of places, in my personal capacity, supporting what
Edward Snowden did and pushing for technical changes and policy reform to
curtail surveillance.

I completely expect (and find welcome and appropriate) high levels of
skepticism for anything the US government does. All I can tell you is where
I'm coming from, and the actions my team is taking.

In my government capacity, when https://letsencrypt.org is operational next
year, I hope to get as many .gov domains to use their certificates as I can.
