My guess is their thinking is based on damage to road surface rather
than on fuel consumption. Damage to road surface varies with some
unlikely power of pressure exerted.   I can't remember references right
now unfortunately. But it works out that  cars & vans cause effectively
none of the damage, medium-sized goods vehicles cause vast amounts,
larger trucks & busses less than you'd think (multiple axles, bigger
tyres) and the occasional giant load (construction crane, tunnel
sections, tank transporters, whatever) a lot more.
