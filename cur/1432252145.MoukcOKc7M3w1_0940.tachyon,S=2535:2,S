When you don't want to use it, why should it not be useless?

Your "second order effect" physics is on target.  Nonlinear devices
generate harmonics when tickled.  All devices vary and have
characteristic
RF signatures.  I read something about that recently somewhere, but
memory fails.

I'm not an Elmer but I pretend to be one on the internet.
