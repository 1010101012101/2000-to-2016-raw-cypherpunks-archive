Not quite accurate either. Forward to sophist pendantry!

>From one site I found using google and 'fasces'...

Ancient Roman symbol of the regal and later the magisterial authority. The
fasces were cylindrical buncles of wooden rods, tied tightly together,
from which an axe projected; they were borne by guards, called lictors,
before preators, consuls, proconsuls, dictators, and emporors. The fasces,
which symbolize unity as well as power, have often been used as emblems.
