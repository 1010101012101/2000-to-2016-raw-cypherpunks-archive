Much information on the G36 is readily available on the Web. It is 
not actually very similar to the G3, except for the roller-delayed 
action used by HK in most of their semi-automatic rifles.

The caliber is, as per current NATO expectations, 5.56 mm.

I sent out a note entitle "More on the G3" this morning, but it has 
not yet, 8-9 hours later, appeared in my mailbox. Could be delays and 
glitches due to the storms hitting California today. If I don't see 
it in the next several hours, I'll send it out again.
