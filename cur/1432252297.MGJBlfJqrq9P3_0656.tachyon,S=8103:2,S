Maidsafe is trying to be the cloud but P2P. At Bitcoin2014 I asked as to
why they wanted a blockchain/consistency, that guy didn't know (nice guy
though), left my e-mail address and didn't hear back.

It definitely rings a similar bell, it sure did with me when I heard about
it. I've even pointed to it when saying how things could also be.

Overall I'm underwhelmed by the design and I think it tries to do too much.
I think It's not fundamental/simple enough. I think Blockchain style
consensus is expensive and not required. Only reason I can think off is
that they want premined coins or something.

There's a whole flux of not-really-working-yet ideas that use the
blockchain for no reason other than having premined coins and some P2P
framework. It's interesting and good to see that blockchain-tech is such a
key for people's creativity. And it's a shame that it's probably not the
right tool for the job in most cases.

(Consensus is overrated! Who needs it? You just need things to work the way
you want them for you. What do you care how it looks to people you never
deal with?)
