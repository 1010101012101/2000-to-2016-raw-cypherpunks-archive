Hello again, people of liberationtech.

Nobody replied to my missive. Perhaps it was Too Long; Didn't Read!
But I wanted to mention to you that I subsequently talked to some
young programmers at DefCon. I told them that my claim is that
LeastAuthority.com's S4 is proof against PRISM-style indiscriminate
surveillance, but not proof against targeted surveillance. They
suggested: why not call it “PRISM-proof” then? Good idea! I might do
that.

Regards,

Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn

Founder, CEO, and Customer Support Representative
