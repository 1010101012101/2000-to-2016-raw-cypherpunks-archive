It would take you years to check five hundred Chomsky citations.  His 
citations are at best obscure and hard to find, at worst impossible to find.

Almost every Chomsky citation that I have checked was at best somewhat 
misleading, and at worst a lie.

Chomsky's citations are usually false in one of three ways, sometimes false 
in all three ways at the same time.

1.  Chomsky misrepresents the authority of the sources.  For example 
in  "Distortions at fourth hand" quoted in full in 
<http://www.jim.com/jamesd/chomsdis.htm> he represented Hildebrand and 
Porter as an independent review of evidence from impartial sources, whereas 
in fact they were merely mouthpieces of the Khmer Rouge.  He represented 
Ponchaud as merely the mouthpiece of US imperialism, while in fact Ponchaud 
had interviewed hundreds of refugees, and collected hundreds of first hand 
accounts of Khmer Rouge terror.

2.  Chomsky misrepresents the content of the sources:  For example Chomsky 
represented the testimony of murder, torture,and terror collected by 
Ponchaud as second hand, when in fact it was first hand.

3. Chomsky claims sources that just cannot be found.  In particular the 
article "Distortions at fourth hand" first leads up to the purported 
citation of "repeated discoveries that the massacre reports were false", 
and then proceeds to draw all sorts of conclusions from the alleged falsity 
of these massacre reports.  Without this alleged citation, his article, 
appearing a few months after the photos of the massacres north of 
Aranyaprathet had horrified the world, would have sounded like the banal 
totalitarian propaganda that is, would have sounded no different from the 
vast pile of totalitarian propaganda that had become so painfully familiar 
throughout the twentieth century.  This alleged citation is the very key 
and center of the whole article, and no one can find it.
