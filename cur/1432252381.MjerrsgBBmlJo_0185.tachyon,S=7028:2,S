Ha, read this lil blurb from their site:
PrivateBuy is the only personal payment account that lets you safely and =
anonymously shop anywhere online. PrivateBuy cloaks your identity, =
shields your money and offers the same universal acceptance as a credit =
card. It's the vehicle that ensures your peace-of-mind, security and =
privacy when shopping online. As a PrivateBuyer you have incredible =
buying power, protection and anonymity. Your purchases are kept private =
and off your credit card statement. You'll also stay off marketing and =
mailing lists. Whether you're concerned about using your credit card all =
over the Web, worried about identity theft, or just looking for a better =
way to buy -- PrivateBuy gives you the confidence you need to purchase =
whatever you want.=20

Ya thats a load of shit!  If you ask me they are either working for the =
government or making a fortune by turning in the idiots who use it under =
the guise of anonymity.
The worst link in the system is payment.  to use privacybuy you need to =
fund your account with a credit card I don't get it. What is the point =
of paying them a 4 dollar service charge if a 2 dollar subpoena will =
give away your name address and vital statistics! =20
I'd hate to see the look on the basterds face who orders chemicals from =
fisher thinking he got away clean, when 20 jack booted thugs come in and =
kick his door down!

Can one of the more educated cypherpunks inform me of the appropriate =
way to buy and pay for things anonymously online?

Thanks
