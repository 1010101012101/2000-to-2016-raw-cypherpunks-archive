I'm talking about anytime you type into text boxes. The goal of this
proposal was to return to the hypertextual nature of the web in order to
reduce our dependence on centralized indexes. However, I find your proposal
to improve the utility of the AwesomeBar interesting.

An even simpler proposal: assuming the AwesomeBar doesn't already include
live bookmarks in its autocomplete functionality, add it. Then anyone can
simply publish their bookmarks via RSS and anyone else can import them.
Then someone can just add functionality to create live bookmarks that pull
signed and possibly encrypted (with Ed25519/Curve25519 of course) RSS feeds
from a DHT.
