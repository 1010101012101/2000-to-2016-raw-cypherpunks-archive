not quite on the first point, but the 2nd comes closer. the difference
between individuals and corps is that the corp has far more assets and
activities to protect and that it usually has more than one mind. every
large corp is at least a little shizophrenic - look at IBM for a good
example.

it' just a logical step. if robbing your electronics storehouse is no
longer illegal because there's no law, or no government to enforce it,
then you have to take steps yourself.

I wonder whether taking over the government is economical. i.e. if the
government were to disappear, would it be more cost-efficient for the
corps to take over as rulers or to hire armies and only defend
themselves?
