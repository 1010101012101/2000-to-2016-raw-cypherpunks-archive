Except that all it takes is for the judge to grant the witness
transactional or use immunity. Or even full immunity (less common, from
what I hear).

"Mr. McCullagh, the court hereby grants you transactional immunity for
your testimony today. Now Mr. McCullagh, please answer the prosecutors
questions and give the court all of your notes made regarding this
witness."

Much on the Net. Here's just a flavoring:

"Title 18 U.S.C. ' 6002 provides use immunity instead of transactional
immunity. The difference between transactional and use immunity is that
transactional immunity protects the witness from prosecution for the
offense or offenses involved, whereas use immunity only protects the
witness against the government's use of his or her immunized testimony
in a prosecution of the witness -- except in a subsequent prosecution
for perjury or giving a false statement.



Tim again: I'm not a lawyer, but I read about cases like this. And there
were dozens of hours of discussion about use immunity, transactional
immunity, etc. during recent high-profile televised cases.

The notion that a witness can blithely escape having to testify by
asserting the 5th Amendment is one of those folk beliefs that just
doesn't hold up.
