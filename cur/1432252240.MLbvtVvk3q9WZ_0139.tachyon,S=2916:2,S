    I certainly wouldn't argue that US policy in Indochina was anything 
other than a fiasco, nor that the current misadventure in the Middle 
East will be spared the same fate, but the Chinese had another very 
important reason to back the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam - Russia.

    The Soviets supplied heavy military and financial aid to Vietnam, in 
return for an anticipated naval base through which they could extend 
their power into the South Seas.  They never got the base - the 
Vietnamese played them like a fiddle - but the threat was enough for the 
PRC to view Vietnam as an enemy-by-proxy, and so to back the Khmer Rouge.

    In addition, the whole of Indochina was (and is) a clusterfuck of 
rivalries and feuds going back centuries.  The (relatively) sudden 
appearance of a bunch of new regimes, all with revolutionary mindsets 
through which to apply their old vendettas, probably made the bloodshed 
inevitable - although US intervention undoubtedly made it worse.
