--- intro ---

cryptography in a computer context, tied down into particular mindsets and
frameworks, limited and private approaches to programming, addressing issue
of secrecy and security, as if it is all inside the existing observation,
contained within a particular viewpoint and set of variables as
interpreted. and then, how to convey another parallel world that also
involves itself in the same conceptual structure, though differently... and
even precedent to what is rigidly occurring inside the electronic boxes and
technologies, yet in comparison appearing only low-tech if no-tech, even
while precedent if not philosophically more pure. grounded by default of
its physicality as it relates to ideas placed into action. how to make the
case 'this happened before that' and yet to address a default detestation
or conceit that may also exist, culturally, via a detachment between ideas,
how things work, their relevance and trajectory and importance as
knowledge, while inside an illiterate world. a question of meaning, though
also inherent bias, presumption of 'knowing' and having answers instead of
not knowing and asking questions, learning from other realms of inquiry.
thus are minds and mentalities closed or are they capable of seeing beyond
themselves and their finite assumptions, especially if shared, solidified
into the dogma of ideology.

"science" without art is no longer science. it is technique removed of its
human purpose and capacity and becomes and functions for another antihuman
agenda. it can become a distortion or false viewpoint to develop hostile
policies within. the *insight* of art, of inquiry, of questioning, of the
realm of risk and of peak functioning and imagination, of optimization
within a limited context and challenging constraints - of knowing, of
being, of choices and actions - creates or opens or allows access, willing
or not, into another realm beyond the normal and everyday, new territory or
old territory reconsidered and reconceived. turning answers into questions
again and presenting new views into existing questions and ideas.

so for instance, 'the context' for crypto could be assumed to be computers
by default of this being the present situation, in a confined digital,
binary technological development. for some the relevance or questions of
crypto may be bounded within assumptions of this context, perhaps never
having been experienced or considered beyond this computer model and its
particular emphasis on certain algorithmic approaches, as if previous
questions have been answered correctly and now it is just an issue of
extending the model indefinitely, tweaking it within the given parameters
and upgrading the model into newer technologies. in this sense a certain
'faith in technology' could even exist, where blind faith replaces the role
of questioning fundamental truth, which has already been decided upon, and
is assumed "known" and therefore someone can just pick up the or join in
the parade and security and secrecy are effectively deemed guaranteed as
long as staying within the ideological lines.

and yet an entire world of experience exists outside of this view and some
if it can have profound relation both to the ideas of crypto and the
falsification of existing models that seek to bound and limit its
interpretation, thereby to control it within a given domain, while actual
crypto could be occurring outside this, without realization by some
"experts" who wholly believe in a limited finite hardware/software model as
the limit of questioning or the basis for relations in a realm of
intelligence or human communications of ideas in a realm of secrecy,
privacy, and security, including issues of the state as decentralized. as
if "where there is no computer encryption- there is no cryptography". in
the realm of ideas this view is beyond laughable and truly ignorant of the
domain cryptology operates within. for instance, the role of crossword
puzzles or suduko as it relates to puzzle solving, as these skills may be
applied outside a realm of computer encryption yet decipher meaning. not
necessarily within those puzzles though others. and that this is basic and
should be assumed relevant to ideas of cryptography and not seen as
separate in terms of what it involves. an algorithm is only a minor part of
a much larger realm of questioning that may involve other multiple
approaches brought into a shared evaluation. it is not just a technical
response that can be easily resolved in software/hardware models if it
exists beyond their boundary. and thus how a situation is modeled or
observed would influence what can be evaluated, and thus if there is no
consideration of crypto outside of computation, none seeming exists. and
yet this could be entirely false, an illusion or delusion of those so
trapped in their POVs. and to some degree or other everyone is trapped
within individual frameworks in some way, it is an issue of how it is dealt
with, must everything occur within that limit in interactions and thus a
bubble reality and bubble-relations are required, or can a person transcend
their own limits through realizing and acknowledging truth beyond
themselves and their limits and humble themselves before the larger world
of ideas and other people, to learn and interact with others and ideas, and
develop shared frameworks that are self-correcting, including requiring a
person to correct their flawed assumptions as part of this empirical
condition. in a sense, being freed of the burdens of upholding a false
private finite view, letting go of the need to rationalize everything in a
single correct view that is theirs (onesided) and see what is beyond the
limit of a particular person, via shared identity that maps into a larger
realm of the many, via the shared set of human awareness. where
/perspective/ itself changes, transforms, becoming multiple while resolving
itself in a single modeling of truth.

so a situation exists, a condition begging the question: can you freely
observe, can you freely think about what cryptography is, or are you bound
to certain interpretations that restrict and limit because those frameworks
are required for degrees or careers or papers for conferences, even if or
while they may be inaccurate or limiting the examination and exploration of
the issues involved. and so in some sense this seeks to present a realm
that is closely paralleled with crypto in the abstract, yet also thoroughly
material, tangible, in a way that this information in software or encoded
into electrons may not readily be. and thus the purpose here is not to
break the model of crypto considerations for its own sake, it is to break
it open so that it can relate to other events and be reconsidered within
the larger context it exists within, so that it can breathe again as an
idea. and be removed of the carapace of ideological and its sterilization
of the questions so important to the discipline, whose purposes ultimately
involves protecting and securing truth, not lies.


--- cultural precedent ---

for a moment assume we are considering the multimedia networked computers
of today including cellphones in this domain, as a platform in which
'ideas' and relations occur. that it is a technological environment we
partly inhabit to establish and maintain relations, with other people and
with institutions and with news and information; education, entertainment,
the weather report and so on. and in this inquiry, how someone defines
[multimedia] could be important to where the boundaries or limits are for
how the shared situation is interpreted, including in what categories and
what variables or dimensions it will be mapped out within.

and thus if someone considers that 'multimedia' began with the Macintosh
computer in the 1980s that would be one context for evaluating the
situation and making assumptions. Yet another may believe it was
established with Macromedia Shockwave software that allowed interactive
cd-roms and eventually websites to be developed as a platform. And at some
point these views may be resolved into one or another framework that may
bias the interpretation and also the possibilities when asking questions
and developing viable or usable solutions.

i once had the pleasure of taking courses at SF Multimedia Studies Program
in San Francisco in the mid-90s in the early multimedia boom when there was
still a cultural dimension to the questions of internet development, before
it become a de facto technical framework related to issues of canned
software systems, data mechanics and constant upgrades and repair versus
about ideas, organization of information, knowledge, education, models of
truth, culture. the issues of its commercialization -- like a Tsunami --
basically destroyed the internet as a cultural platform, and this went
hand-in-hand with greed, the desire for money and profit, and not valuing
the traditional goals of society because it could be edited out of
equations in self-serving ideologies of exploitation, as a standardized
institutionalized practice. sound familiar to anyone?

in any case in an overview class prior to this cultural meltdown, Randall
Packer taught a class entitled From Wagner to Virtual Reality that set the
stage for considering what the potential could be for multimedia computers
within the larger society, and this from a view of the arts, what it offers
as a context for technological development, its larger purpose.

and so with that experience in mind, back to questioning [multimedia] then
could feasibly lead, in the just stated framework, back to the Lascaux cave
paintings, with realistic depictions of animals estimated to have been
created approximately 17,000 years ago.

thus the question of multimedia could be an issue of first markings in a
next realm of communication, contrasting a pre-multimedia realm of
newspapers with an interactive realm, or assumably hand signaling with
diagrammatic animated-like depictions via cave artists.

formal systems of written language begin over 5,000 years ago by
comparison. moving from much earlier abstract marks, firstly, to eventual
representation by alphabets, allowing for shared communications in an
archival format, as this also relates to number, counting. and managing
both information and ideas (grain deposits, governance, stories, law,
culture).

so if a person questions [multimedia] in that context, of first marks and
new formal systems of communication and relation, yet still other
dimensionality and frameworks could exist that help define and consider
how, say, new markup languages or codes function in this realm compared to
those previous, or how it may evolve over time in a systematic way, given
what has happened many many many times before, over a period of millennia.
absent this, it is reinventing the wheel though perhaps with less
knowledge, repeatedly, and thus devolving the cultural standard to less
than what preceded it, due to ignorance, ignoring lessons learned.

so the internet ends up absent coherent knowledge at a larger scale, absent
education or ideas beyond the limited framework, and entirely within a
big-box highway advertising model of commercialization, as if an exercise
in ancient roman road building to every end of the empire with direct
connections back to the bank vaults at the core of the entire enterprise.
culture here being money. commodification of information, exchange, data,
the status quo. financialization perhaps high theology in its speculative
sense, escape velocity beliefs.

and yet another person may observe (and these latter two examples are from
Randall Packers scholarship) that like with Lascaux, that [multimedia] was
developed within art and that the work and ideas of electronic sculptor Nam
June Paik created frameworks for its evaluation and relation that
essentially are part of an overall empirical review, and it is important
both to consider and retain truth of these observations in newer frameworks
as applicable, because that is the source of knowledge in terms of
innovation and imagination, that it can and does function across shared
frameworks, scaffolding, between various structural systems.

you could just evaluate birds without considering anything else, yet
without trees, wind, leaves, sky, clouds, song, the fullness and wholeness
of the bird is missing. so too, the issues and ideas of code, encryption,
or in this case networked [multimedia].

and so the issue becomes one of including context, the foreground and the
background events in an ecological and ecosystem-like review or survey, and
i think diagramming and mapping and other 'first marks' are closer at
accessing these connections than written alphabetic sentences that must  R
A T I O N A L I Z E  them within a pre-existing viewpoint in order for the
views to make sense or be valid, given existing interpretations, versus
exploring questions and ideas at a conceptual level of ideation (fancy
word). thus, instead of staying within the existing limited views of ideas,
breaking them open again to question and test assumptions- that ideas are
hypotheses that can and need to be challenged to retain their integrity,
otherwise they can become ungrounded and detached from actual reality and
substitute for it, as a lesser version of events and experience- as agreed
to exist. thus, just like not being able to modify the segments within
letters which become inviolable by the limits of their modeling, so too
ideas become rigid by boundaries which protect them yet which could be
based on errored assumptions or viewpoints. /history/ is effectively this.
it could be a warped skewed series of shared observations that becomes the
platform to develop future actions and ideas, and if unchallenged or not
corrected, can function against the very goals and ideas sought, due to
this internal corruption or internal rotting that is deemed off-limits from
further consideration, especially in terms of structure, foundation. so
too, systems of language, code, programming as this effects hardware,
software, technical and cultural development. what can and cannot happen as
a result of established framework and their normalization, standing-in for
truth, yet potentially not accurately representing it and instead this can
become religion, following certain beliefs beyond the evidence, and
especially when in denial of external truth, via disregard or denial of its
falsification. which then establishes an inside and outside condition,
which is an ideological compound that can occupy communities, governments,
education institutions, and bureaucracies. and software and hardware tools,
entire technological platforms that support this ~behavior. so then
devolution is in full swing, and it becomes a Planet of the Apes scenario.
caged humans treated as if apes, needing to conform to the false worldview,
poisoned out of existence.

so there are these strange dynamics in the everyday that must be
encountered and dealt with and they involve pressures that like force
fields align with ideological frameworks that are mediated in certain ways,
in particular realms, and they can be known and identified yet may also be
unspoken or not talked about due to limits in communications with other
people, in regard to what can be said versus what it is known. and the
political danger in speaking, such that you may be attacked or killed for
speaking 'wrongly' or 'falsely' in that context, of the ideological. next
thing you know- no school for you, no career, no friends, etc. thus
following the ideological lead, the party line is important when truth is
managed by power and the facts can be chosen and edited to fit the finite
shared viewpoint, whereby broken society and broken equipment and tools and
broken relations are really all about evolution, and not driving
civilization into the ground, and making people dig their own graves.

this is the result of bad ideas. those that go uncorrected in their errors
and assumptions. the consequences are very real and add up. each lapse or
reinforcement of error promoting and extending an inhuman agenda, and this
can be codified and solidified within processes, within tools, within
relations, within language itself which functions against greater truth and
relies upon this fallen state of mediocrity in some faith-based sense- that
simply going along with the flow and following is going to lead to
emancipation and not extinction. as if the automated technocratic system -
driven by antihuman values - has our best interests at heart, when the
heart -- its virtues and its truth -- is not modeled within the machinery.
it is viewed as non-existant, a falsehood, sentiment by those detached from
its grounding.

and so crypto, likewise, may be perceived only as a manly man's sport- no
girly stuff here. no warm fuzzy relations or questioning. nothing soft. all
bits and sharp edges and speed, equations! algos! macho macho stuff.
mathematics as rigid thought system, non-metaphysical. and yet that is not
where its creativity arises from, in many instances. it is within ideas
firstly, ingenuity, not canned approaches. not answered questions
repeatedly incrementally upgraded. it does not glorify or harbor partial
truths as if good enough. weak ideas have no place in crypto, they are more
than a security risk. they are an unacceptable unallowable weakness and
should not retain employment, and those who serve them should be isolated.

here is why...

how do you discuss the direct relevance of fiber and textile arts with
cryptographers? what if this consideration involves a vital realm of
questioning and reconsidering the existing interpretation of cryptology yet
it is deemed off-limits by existing ideology? what if the too-simple binary
approach seeks to govern or determine what can be true or included within
its controlled framework- and in doing so ignores evidence and itself is
the security risk? what if there are cryptographers whose principles are
not aligned with serving truth and instead mimic this, and yet the illusion
of this imitation is broken by wrong choices, in that a lesser approach is
believed superior, ignoring or disregarded its falsification. and what if
to get into a larger framework, of [crypto] beyond its existing ideological
limits, involves cracking open the concept and seeing it in the larger
cultural context it exists within yet also has become detached from,
potentially, thus to consider it anew and test and challenge and extend its
modeling beyond existing limits and boundaries, thresholds and frameworks,
to see what crypto really involves as an idea, versus a given
implementation in a particular medium at a place in time, such as within
networked [multimedia] computers.

my first instinct is to not heed preconceived ideological limits of those
who simply think it is ~profane (to their crypto-religion) to break "their
rules" for crypto corruption, as they need the existing model to retain
coherence and governance of its next self-same iteration, that the sign of
crypto equals itself and not something beyond their control (that is:
crypto=3Dcrypto, versus its truth beyond the signage as packaged,
commoditized). so if people are trying to limit evaluation of an idea, core
to a discipline, it is fairly easy to see the political dimension and lines
of force that need certain questioning to remain *answered* and
out-of-bounds, to limit interpretation, keep it within a given perspective
so to control what can happen, and to protect a border between what is
inside and outside, or what if valid and invalidated by default of enforced
convention, if not standardization.

thus it is not only to forget them, it is to not include or allow them in
considerations if truth is and has been secondary to their inquiries, for
bad faith is their foundation for relations and interactions result in
automatic exploits via onesided agendas. keep out. they are bad for crypto
and these relations should be short-circuited, not allowed to continue.
especially as to influencing what can or cannot happen in their limited,
finite viewpoints. the exploring and questioning of ideas requires thinkers
and should not defer to ideologues.

so if suddenly it is proposed that yarn and thread and fabric have a lot to
do with crypto and computers and someone from a networked multimedia
computer context cries that it is off limits and wrong, perhaps they are
unable to consider such things or consider cryptological considerations
beyond a binary technical enterprise, and therefore are stuck and will
remain stuck in that given framework while other things happen around them,
eventually surpassing the broken model and its adherents who remain stuck
if not captured inside a sinking ship. woe are they, unknowing of their
descent into the unfathomable, the pressures that await.

and so at this juncture the connection with the Jacquard loom can be
introduced, of new technical automation within textile manufacture (c.1801)
involving a mechanical process of weaving guided or programmed by coded
punch cards instructions, resulting in the creation of woven patterns.
abstract input related to machine functionality, holes in the card mapped
to and representing hooks, leading to output in another medium. perhaps
similar to metal tines protruding from a wind-up music box, as to what
notes are played, though involving a more complex instrument and its
orchestrated movement of warp and weft.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom

note that also around this time, Ada Lovelace composed the first algorithm
for the Analytical Engine computer of Charles Babbage, thus recognized as
the first computer programmer. These observations originating from a course
taught by Mr. Packer on 'multimedia history'.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace

what is important to consider is that the platforms for crypto systems in
use today were experimented with and explored across a wider range of
consideration in terms of mechanical systems and how code and programming
developed into a single monocultural binarist system.

and at some point the relation between thinking of some task and putting it
into a set of  instructions to be parsed by machinery retained coherence
that may have been lost today, where writing such code appears even lost to
its own interpretation or unknown effects within the automated machinery.
and at some point choices could have become limited, from the control over
this interaction and the dimensions it is mapped and proceeds within, to
those that are not related to experienced or actions that need or should be
dealt with. and this could be an issue of programming models, though also
of ideas; especially "economics" as a discipline, where equations do not
adequately map to the reality they seek to describe in order to determine
profit-loss and gears by which civilization grinds into existence.

so i am one of the weirdos who appreciates sewing, due to an artistic
background, and this is a skill that is nearly wholly of a female domain
today, at least in the US, in that to seek classes a male will be faced
with class exercises for making dress patterns, etc. it is an interesting
conundrum or limit that certainly reflects what females must face in most
every context in terms of the dimensions allowed due to constricting bias
of interpretation.

awhile ago i went to a sewing expo at the nearby convention center to look
at equipment and was completely surprised at the level of correspondence
between advanced tools today and the earliest programmable equipment 200+
years ago. whether an individual sewing machine that can be programmed via
bitmap graphic files or via stitch patterns or larger equipment, the role
of embroidery done automatically by sewing machine (in that it is itself a
computer) is the extension of this earliest programmatic development, a
merging of Lovelace and loom. yet perhaps a step or more removed from ready
or immediate analysis, and more of a plug-and-play scriptability of
equipment. it remains unknown to what degree it is possible, though mirrors
similarly the issues of scale, from very large industrial color printing
into the desktop context of inkjet and laser home printers, whereby
something occurring at one scale is suddenly available in another and what
does it mean or indicate. and thus, in seeing the larger machinery, not
factory-level though home-factory level, say 8' x 4' dimensions for
equipment, including LASERS, these advanced sewing machine-computers can
basically map out anything in thread as if a painting on a canvas and this
has been automated, expertised, such that what may once have been zoned in
a particular area of town, requiring certain square footage, could instead
occupy the basement of a house in a newly zoned live-work neighborhood that
involves both e-commerce and retail dimensions, thus potentially like with
3D printing alongside paper/data copy services, could bring the village and
its [signage] back into a realm of city planning, where such districts
foster these services both locally and for remote online or business
orders, via courier and bulk shipments.

in other words, the nature of industry, craft, trade, skill, is changing
alongside the development of computation and this changes and challenges
the context of these tools and the relations they involve. and in this
approach, a certain segment of the population could develop their work or
business within their home, especially if it is symbolic processing, which
is the basis for telework and telecommunications today, reliant upon
infrastructure.

this is not the idea that will be explored here. it involves something
else, something more fundamental and basic and vital and of a seemingly
entirely other approach and application. the difficulty is that for me it
exists beyond words, and thus like a programmer trying to find a way to
convey the necessary instructions to allow particular computation to occur,
it is to try to access a realm that already exists and to not limit it by
my own incapacity, yet to bring it into question as a framework for
considering the ideas of cryptography. today, yesterday and tomorrow.


--- deep culture ---

to precede this investigation, it was to recontextualize the idea of code
and programming outside the limits of the electronic box of the digital
computer, and consider that it may have some connection to the surrounding
background of other existing or previous events and their structures and
frameworks. as with cryptology and cryptography in general, as further
relations within this domain, reliant upon it though also seemingly
limited, constrained if modeling does not or cannot take into account
information existing beyond its threshold. and so it gets into a realm of
observation and action, open minds that are aware and questioning and those
that may be closed and reliant upon rigid structures for security and
secrecy that in a larger consideration are invalid, yet not accounted for
or accountable in this realm. so perhaps this is an ideological audit of
sorts, a litmus test, of crypto & intelligence...

the importance and value of art within development and sustenance of
culture can at times be hard to decipher, especially when retrograde or
functioning against the necessary direction. while some appreciation may be
given or afforded, it may also appear as a luxury, and a vast quantity of
its production may be ungrounded and not offer greater insight beyond
extremely limited or copyist approaches, yet which represent it and
"culture" likewise, via artifacts and trends and social hierarchy that both
validates and is validated by this relationship. and then there are the
exceptions- where the *insight* occurs. not just the production. and this
is a rare and ephemeral thing, and appears to occupy its own zone, where
its truth is transmitted and received within dimensions similar and-or
different and challenge or call into question or further expand upon
observations and discoveries, shared or unshared, in such a way as ideas in
a particle collider, or raindrops from a storm becoming rivers that return
to oceans and return to the sky. that a transformational event or relation
happens and alignment occurs within a range of experience, that provides
grounding, heightened or new awareness, and essentially helps establish and
defined an empirical model of relation held outside or alongside the
current technological construct as an ideological framework, art and
artistry active both in its preparation, continuing development, and
dismantling.

in this sense, technologists may be artists, as with others, yet
unrecognized this way, or if so equated, likely corrupting its validity due
to the role of commerce, exploiting or marketing this when subverted by
other agendas. which is perhaps covered by the fake money that artworks can
represent, symbolic commerce, the realm of celebrity now mass culture,
everyone having a potentially valuable signature, everyone a Warhol
Portrait in waiting.

and so it is to say again that this inquiry is not about that, in itself,
and yet about its substance, the truth it involves yet is caught within,
via collapse of culture, illiteracy and evaluating things only in their
most immediate limited sense via particularized views, which the binary
mindset provides as a basis for relation.

in this way, the contributions of artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude could
be evaluated in terms of artistic opinion in some canon of art history- yea
or nea? like or no-like in terms of an artistic project or experiential
relation-- especially in terms of aesthetics. and as this relates to ideas,
how the various artwork is interpreted.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude
http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/artworks/realized-projects

i am no expert and art scholars have vast amounts of knowledge and insight
to share on these questions, though offered here is a potential way of
considering such artistic works in the larger context they inhabit- which
remains open to interpretation.

in the realm of fabric, Running Fence at least in part could involve seeing
what otherwise is unseen as a boundary or limit, a line on a map that
otherwise goes unnoticed, yet may establish an inside and outside. today,
GPS maps may be correlated with this, as a rode that is driven on is a
line, while others may appear, like that for a state park whose trees can
only be viewed in the distance from the freeway, that establish various
boundaries, inside and outside relations as it is mapped or correlated via
direction observation. informational structure that is represented and then
its representation encounters what it is mapped onto.

metaphysics is a difficult word and easily diluted in its placeholder
meaning, yet what it attempts to define is something that is difficult
otherwise to capture in ordinary terms, as if it operates at another level
than that of mundane, dull, and disconnected experience. as if suddenly
everything makes sense and has inherent alignment, yet which can be
unrecognized or hard to grasp because it is beyond a threshold of awareness
or understanding, unless it is encountered, experienced, and can be
revealed. thus there is an *invisibleness* to it.

so the thing about ideas that relates to this, perhaps especially as
linguistic constructs or models that take on the form of an idea as a sign,
symbol, or word, is that it is linked to CATEGORY and categorization, that
the meaning of words and concepts map into frameworks, structures, that
each upon another build upon themselves the larger language development.
foundation of this would seemingly be truth, yet not inherently so. and
thus [category] could be related to truth yet not equated with it. it is as
if an idea in superposition that has the potential to tend towards truth,
or towards greater falsity, given its accounting.

and so if there are two concepts, [concept1] and [concept2], they could be
of different categories that challenge or extend one another or be based on
different truths altogether or one could be largely inaccurate as an idea
whereas another more accurate, in a particular context. in other words
there are limits to meaning, it has boundaries, and concepts relate to one
another as with people, within certain dimensions and not others. and
connections are reliant upon structures or scaffolding between them, to
establish or allow their relation in whatever truth may exist, or falsity
may be allowed if this connection relies upon errors.

if really cutting to the chase, this issue of language could be an issue of
"original sin" as it relates to the SIGN and its misconception of equating
with truth itself, versus as a reference to it. thus the [sign] could refer
only to itself, within a corruption of language or outside or beyond itself
to truth that validates it beyond a programmatic assumption.

so when a [building] is covered entirely in fabric, what was once a
building that is seen within its surrounding context is suddenly
transformed, "disappeaered" or made invisible by its being covered and in
doing so, its surface is removed from the common visual realm and hidden
within an opaque interiority that can only be accessed by observational
imagination, as if virtual. in that, if remaining on the outside of this
boundary, it is discontinuous to all previous experience, where a building
is removed or masked out of the framework, placed into some liminal realm,
betwixt and between, neither here nor there. and in this abstract
condition, the form of the building represents the building itself in its
greater detail, yet lacks the 1:1 recognition that was known relation
before this.

in this way a given observation of a particular building could then have a
limit or barrier created that limits or changes this observation, and
provides a more abstract view in place of what was presumably of greater
fidelity to the thing-in-itself. the volumetric massing of the building may
instead become prominent, and in this, the covered building could exist as
if a wrapped present even, its unveiling and return to itself part of the
great delight.

and yet beyond this, what could be involved is informational, related to
the SIGN itself, as if the cover is what written or representational
language functions as, when referring to something else it seeks to contain
within its meaning. such that to cover something in this way is to contain
it likewise, potentially, as a category. in other words, the fabric could
demarcate the boundary between concepts, as with between different words
and their meaning, and challenge the notion of this capacity to do so. when
the building is covered or limited by this fabric veil, how has its
existence changed and the relation of observers to it.

it is tremendously difficult to write of, it is many layered and my
approach inadequate to seek to convey that this directly involves the
issues of data modeling within computers. that when seeking to map a SIGN
onto something else, it presumes certain boundaries or limits yet may
remain only partial to a given observation-- abstracting the very thing
that is to be modeled, instead of allowing it to exist in its totality, and
thus could involve an issue of removal of reality or reductionist
"development" by default of this presumption that the sign represents the
thing in itself, versus references and gains its value from it.

in other words, you could take the fabric off the wrapped building and
claim it is actually the building in itself-- which is what those invested
in binary language do with signs, they believe the truth is within being
able to put brackets and limits on perception and control and categorize
things, as if doing so makes it true. such that there is only one version
of an [event] and it is theirs and it is correct. and computers and
institutions and minds are programmed this way ~likewise. and in essence
this could be the empty set [ ] [ ] [ ], whereby truth is arbitrary insofar
as it exists to serve a given ruling perspective. because the way things
are covering it can be manipulated, and hide other details, or make limits
appear that are not really there, and thus guide in the wrong direction.
and perhaps there really is no building under the fabric- perhaps it is
hollow inside, and who would know if no one is allowed to check inside
anymore. the very idea of questioning theories- heresy.

when Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered a stretch of coastline, the issue of
scale again is relevant and involves what level of detail is possible to
achieve, and thus a rough sketch like covering of the form occurs yet only
to the most general aspects of given landscape and its geologic features.
'measuring the coastline' is a famous example of fractal mathematics
whereby the rule for measurement changes the length of the coastline. if
you map things at one-inch scale a different coastline will result than at
one-foot scale, as features and micro-features are accounted for. and so
too with fabric coverings, and so too, computer modeling and data
representations of objects and ideas and events in the 'external world'.

this is to suggest that the generality of the covered stretch of coastline
is somewhat of a proof of the limits of representation to potentially
accurately or entirely 'categorize' or cover or stand-for something else,
and yet the very power of language and SIGNs to do so, to be able to map
some event onto another, via a word or symbol or phrase. and that, like a
primal marking or delineation of territory, this artistic intervention is
establishing a boundary condition, in some cases an inside-outside
correlation, though also of thresholds of observation and awareness and
relation, that allows it to be considered anew-- yet also, the draping of
the event may be low-resolution to the event itself, in certain dimensions.

the ability of a computer to take the language of economics and automate it
into software systems for diagnosing ills and benefits of society within
its computational framework may pale in comparison to the coastline it
seeks to measure and its covering via its SIGNAGE. it may not only be
limited or reliant upon boundaries, it may be inaccurate and false in its
assumptions that become solidified and related to as if by default true, as
concepts. as if data that correlates to the conception validates the
conception itself; covering =3D truth. it is the very problem of binary
pattern recognition, its ideology and the corruption of ideas at the core
of civilization and wrong-minded and -guided technological development
today:

  take half of everything or anything
  including errors and wrong assumptions
  call it truth, ignore everything else

so what if in the data modeling of the world, various data tarps are being
placed over all that exists, yet this is an ideological mapping that is not
serving human interests in the way the data is being processed and used, in
terms of automated reasoning and decision making that seeks to benefit its
modus operandi and not have this serve human values or needs anymore,
especially in terms of representational governance. what does it mean that
the Whitehouse or various seats of government may be data modeled likewise,
"mediated" in this same abstract modeling that tends to exploit falsity to
move in a particular direction and in doing so, plays the SIGNS and
shuffles the limits and categories [ [ ] [ ] ] and creates a viewpoint that
is supposedly shared, yet does not map into truth accurately and has no
legal obligation to do so, while humans and their society collapse into
nothingness.

moving the abstraction (goalposts of meaning) around, the signage to create
false perspective stagesets for oratory and political theatre, as if truth
itself -- this gaming of language and perception -- versus the requirement
and obligation to address [ideas] in their truth, within the world that
exists, not only that which can be allowed to exist within the computerized
worldview.

(signs do not need to be accounted for in their whole truth, only partial
truth. the category or sign is detached from truth, becomes its own truth
via relativization)

maybe this question of abstraction, naming, categorization, and language
are inherent in the human condition, yet it is also possible some may
exploit these dynamics, through dishonesty and seek to misalign and
misdirect development via the /appearances/ of things, versus to account
for things in themselves. and thus again [signage] can replace truth,
stand-in for it and mediate existence yet it is entirely shallow and
self-contained, systematic, as if an issue of sustaining an illusion within
the given boundary, of an inside and outside, such that some may be kept on
the outside, and not understand the threshold that is engineered, and thus
be disenfranchised by watching and following the stage play, to their own
demise.

how do you know that GPS misdirection is only an error and not seeking to
cause an accident, is this an issue of faith in the goodness of
technocratic, biased political technology? what if the demarcation of
events in history are warped to a biased viewpoint and thus staying within
those lines serves a certain agenda set against your own existence- is
observance of that boundary by default validated via its
institutionalization, and what if educational systems no longer allow
questioning of these views within their walls- what does it mean?

what is versus what is represented. what exists versus what is represented,
modeled, and believed to exist. authenticity versus the requirement of
masquerade. people hiding views beyond certain limits or boundaries.
"reason" contained within binary parameters, etc. then Plan B, psychiatric
'medicine' for those who do not comply with the insane master narrative.

   they refer to the [model] and not to the reality

   they defer to inaccurate and false modeling
   and not to more accurate truth and reality

   they do not question their secured model
   and instead question the very sanity of
   the perceiver of more accurate reality

   (goto: psychiatric routine; loop)

// sidenote: in this way, those observers who can ignore larger reality for
a partial viewpoint stand against natural observational powers and the need
to correlate their understanding with it, for survival. this could indicate
either a simulation exists, thereby explaining how some people seem to
treat life as a game without consequence; else also an invading or
occupying population that aligns its reality at a distance and must
correspond views via a centralizing query and response, say via cellphones.
both scenarios could also exist simultaneously, existing beside the human
population.

i think in some way, some artwork of Christo and Jeanne-Claude opens up
questioning of the categorization of elements of existence in a linguistic
if not geometric framework, as this relates to form and topology, and
boundaries. pattern yet at a holistic level or totality, in terms of
creating an inside/outside with a wrapped building. versus Running Fence
that may involve other conceptions of boundaries and limits via scale,
distance, and other geographic and geologic considerations, including
accessible temporal and spatial experience of observers. in some sense the
various events seem to question 'the fabric of space-time' via relation. as
if made out of whole cloth.

the enigma of information in this realm of category, where does the wrapped
entity reside in its truth- its it contained only within the boundary or
does it exist beyond this, outside of it, uncontainable in its
conceptualization within finite dimension. is it instead of a realm of
typology, tending toward the iconic, of stereotype and the archetype, the
symbol that is temporarily accessed, made visible, tangible, this gift.

the terror of this covering process would be that what becomes covered is
removed and replaced by a false framework, literally dismantling what once
appeared and could be assumed still present (and represented) by the
sign-based covering. in this way the exterior could be presented and
presumed as if an integrated whole while subverted in this same dimensions
internally, and thus while appearing as an icon or representative concept,
such as [economy], could replace the very meaning of this with its
anti-thesis in terms of reliance on falsehood or other exploitations that
are ungrounded yet also unchecked, allowed to be this way due to language
-- its signage if not CODE -- being equated with truth itself. in this way
the cover of a concept or ideas by SIGNS that inaccurately represent or
subvert its connection with truth can be camouflage that enables truth to
be hidden, kept away due to such boundaries and observational limits.

{ a note here on the iconic, regarding large scale sculptures of Claes
Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, also encountered locally at the once
great Walker Art Center prior to its ideological fall and reconstruction.

while the wrapped building if not [SIGN] could be evaluated in terms of its
boundaries or limits, and in this difference between normal perception and
its altered condition may appear abstractly singular in some new or
different way, and perhaps iconic, as if a more pure manifestation or
realization of what is observed in this abstraction-- and thus clarity by
simplicity perhaps- this would seem different than an item changed and seen
anew via a different technique, say a change in scale and materials, such
as the soft sculptures or various juxtaposed objects, such as giant
binoculars or paperclip or gigantic power outlet. that would seem to be an
issue more of A1=3DA2 and challenging the parameters of what makes somethin=
g
what it is as an entity, such that if you change this and that element will
the original entity remain the same, how does its essence change when its
model of itself is modified, and to evaluate this surreal process.

768/22589.jpg

it is thus to distinguish between the iconic aspects of wrapped works by
Christo and Jeanne-Claude in their potentially iconic aspects with those of
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, yet both could be considered to
function in a similar linguistic and conceptual realm involving sculpture,
geometries, limits, and observation. }

there are millions of people who have more accurate language for these
events and more effective analysis to consider as it relates to these
issues, scholarship of everyday observation as well as scholarly
investigations and contemplations of aesthetics via appreciation of such
ideas. so this is meant to offer connection between these realms and
provide example, should, say, code and programming function similarly, yet
also involve security issues that exploit similar parameters. alot can be
learned from the structural frameworks of information that correlate across
and between disciplines and thus the interdisciplinary is that integrative
perspective of shared empirical truth. it is the natural tendency of truth
to be correlated with itself in the terms it exists and not to falsely
limit this, which unfortunately appears to be the default state in ways
large and small, between people to between nations, unless it is not
allowed. and thus illiteracy mapped onto these coverings, inaccurate data
models and representations that ignore and do not acknowledge truth beyond
an interior condition, can function both to protect whatever is going on
inside, outside of observational view, protected or guarded by this
condition, and keep those on the outside bounded and limited and reliant
upon it, if everything is similarly designed, into a giant false
perspective.

whereas literacy would enable to coverings or [signs] to be tested,
evaluated, error-corrected, and to verify what is on the inside corresponds
with what is on the outside and not base this in blind faith and religious
adherence to private inhuman ideology, as a means for survival or profit, a
society of insiders the slaves outside sustain. and yet there is no way to
get past this without requiring this [signage] be validated in truth,
firstly, via logic. not binary "true belief" reliant on falsity and opinion=
.


--- code and programming ---

and then there is Olek... the category-defying space goddess time traveler
whose artwork i fear to write about due to its magical dimensions which for
me function beyond words, yet accesses a vital and core truth via aesthetic
activity that my words can only fail to describe or capture.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olek
http://oleknyc.com/
http://instagram.com/oleknyc#

and in some way, if sheets of fabric pieced together correlate with the
wrappings and coverings of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, as if perhaps a data
representation, category or [sign] as variable (x), or data object of an
event, then it is with the crochet artworks of Olek that the yarn itself
enters into a code-like situation, via different structural stitches and
patterns, that can overtake another [sign] as if a program that seeks to
replace it via another version, a secondary layer of colored patterned yarn=
.

in terms of code, it is known there are routines and ways of establishing
structure and as with stitches, they have different purposes and qualities.
an edge stitch versus an interior stitch that covers distance. as the
beginning and end of a program may have different functional requirements
in terms of code, than then interior.

the work of Olek is vast. awe-inspiring. like i said, i am scared to write
about it because my broken language cannot approximate its dimensions, it
is beyond this and my capacity to convey and yet for me singularly stands
out as important work in its depth of imagination and creative purpose, its
tapping into and revealing hidden truth, and its performative social aspect
that everyday people can relate to, via changing what is 'known' if not
unseen, subconscious, or forgotten and looking and considering it anew.

and yet to look at a finished or completed piece or 'yarn-complete' artwork
is almost not the event in itself, as if time-lapse somehow is required to
comprehend an aspect of it that is beyond a finished iconic relation.
instead it is the insane challenges that Olek and her knitting crew taken
on that genuinely defy belief -- in that it was never before imagined in my
finite awareness that somehow could do what Olek does with yarn -- because
it is beyond the ordinary limit yet also part of its unique capacity. yarn
sculpture, yarn muralist, yet more than this- yarn topologist, yarn
symbologist. and still it does not access the totality, which others have
much more competence at defining in terms of the conceptualization and
practices involved, and precedents.

who would figure you could cover an entire locomotive train in yarn and
that doing so is not just an issue of getting it covered, thought also of
additional aesthetic detail and meaning in the patterning. and this is what
sets artists apart from others, in that they can see beyond and somehow
ground such events in a realm of greater insight and awareness. and what is
it? why is it fascinating or for others potentially without the requirement
to be a legitimate investigation. what truth is being revealed and how.'

and i do not know myself, though i can sense it. it is as if the
inaccessible is made accessible yet per-language or pre-definition or
something that exists in language and functions as a symbol or a sign is
dematerialized yet held together by crocheted yarn and somehow a childlike
fascination and pure joy overwhelms at the excitement it brings into the
world, like light breaking through decades of dreary clouds and seeing a
smile radiate outward or a strange glance that then winks, securing a
shared known relation.

and its also sexy. wild. libidinal. its potent if illicit energies flowing
throughout. and perhaps this relates to its tangibleness, of knit fabrics
that have textures that can be soothing to the touch, comforting and
familiar. they also have information, in terms of touch, very much like the
second skin of clothing. something very close to the realm of everyday
feeling and issues of relation, in particular self-with-self as a person is
clothed, and as others are likewise clothed or covered. and thus, what if
suddenly the [sign] you walk by everyday is covered in yarn and becomes
[sign2], and in its difference and similarities a world of consideration
and insight is made available.

i tend to believe the artists and artworks mentioned are involved in
recontextualizing a situation and thus allow it to be perceived anew,
within these different dimensions, to question frameworks of knowledge,
relation, and issues of observation via aesthetic interventions. and the
wrappings and presumably the crochet works are seemingly also temporary
conditions, at least in the sense of outdoor installations. it would seem
yarn would quickly deteriorate (though that may be very interesting as well
to learn from, going from vibrant color to twine-like monotone decay and
how meaning shifts).

while for Christo and Jeanne-Claude the artworks likely involve massive
planning and preparation of fabric, its manufacture, Olek and team do this
crocheting onsite, as a collaborative endeavor, involving a social aspect
that occurs outside the gallery or museum and instead on the street itself,
where the artwork is mediated, as it is made.

in other words, Olek and her team presumably have algorithms, code,
programs and routines they use, the various kinds of stitches and patterns,
guided by planning, by which they approach their challenge and transform it
via aesthetic intervention of crochet.

it is as if knitting is an intuitive approach to mathematical, geometrical
situations that may function similarly in approximating certain parameters,
as encountered, versus being able to know ahead how many stitches will be
required, in that specificity. or so it is imagined. and perhaps like
computer programming, creating software for a task that is encompassed
within a set of concepts and refined in its functionality though perhaps
this remains in a realm of code, another layer over what it seeks to
describe and thus various threads and stitching of information and
relations may occur in order to define such a territory and establish such
functioning, albeit in a realm of signs that may never be grounded within
linear language beyond this representational issue, and thus approximation
could be part of this process. knowing it versus being unaware.

writing of crochet artworks that cover or create other symbols or signs,
including people turned into yarn people, has a close connection to data
representation and the modeling of existence via CAD-like parameters that
seek to define real life objects as data entities, if not substitute for
them in computational models, simulations, and in algorithms used for
processing (or "machine reasoning") that can become deterministic
worldviews and rationalizations, to which people must align in their local
relations, at their jobs, and in schools- a basis for a binary ideology
that overtakes everything.

there is one instance more than any other i could find that captures this
process of data that overtakes the reality, on the instagram site of Olek
there is a short video of a small vodka bottle that is slowly captured the
code of yarn or ribbon that envelopes it, and yet with a string attached,
as if likewise it could be unraveled. Olek has mentioned elsewhere (if
memory serves) that cutting one string of a crocheted work can cause the
entire piece to fall apart.

http://instagram.com/p/d21b1rBR54/#

[so too i propose a similar condition exists for 'reason' when based on a
faulty and inaccurate modeling of representational data, [signs] that when
evaluated via logical reasoning fall apart due to errors involved, relied
on. and in this way, data that is insecure could jeopardize a much larger
connected framework and cause it to fail, just as "concepts" wrongly
modeled or evaluated could unravel an entire security approach. and perhaps
this is age-old military knowledge, where a strength becomes a weakness, a
place of refuge and hiding once revealed can become a trap that cannot be
escaped from. when the cover is blown, the camouflage ineffective, the
stealth lose their advantage. the situation changes, and its their turn to
adjust to a reality that is beyond them. their code no longer will work.
their security made insecure. unwanted transparency.]

when watching rain fall on a section of concrete sidewalk, going to a dry
condition to a series of raindrops dotting its surface, and then eventually
filling in entirely with water saturating its surface, it is to see a
progression take place bit by bit that then overwhelms a previous
condition, as if a phase-change. dry to wet. and in this same way the small
bottle that is encompassed by this yarn of code is like that of data that
is taking over the actual bottle as a digital representation, bit by bit of
code, until the program works its way to completion: this is the yarn
bottle. this is the data model of the bottle, written in code, used and
reference in other programs as its sign, as if [yarn-bottle minus bottle] =
=3D
[bottle] in the everyday binary analysis. in that the data representation
of the bottle is equated with the bottle itself. as if the data statistic
is the more real reality than anything existing beyond its onesided and
biased framework of evaluation, because that is what binary relativism
requires and allows as a privileged viewpoint. inside the covering, versus
being on the outside. seemingly. the data burka as it were, of civilization
as represented digitally.

in taking a series of threads and uniting them in a larger chain of
connective stitches and relations, and establishing surfaces and mapping
out complex topologies with these, various edge and surface and pattern and
structural conditions are encountered and dealt with, and so too, likely
various limits and thresholds and boundaries as it exists within particular
approaches and circumstance. real-time calculation that mediates these
conditions, thinks-through and works-through these conditions and gains
knowledge by encounters with repeated features, whether flat or round or
spherical or edges, and increases knowledge via new challenges not
encountered the same before.

and so what if code and programming and crypto were similarly involved in a
situation involving such boundaries, limits, and assumptions mapped onto an
underlying structure.

in some sense, it could be assumed the structure itself is true, and that
everything in its being able to cover and represent this situation is
accurate, in and of itself, for being able to assign functions and define
parameters and assign variables in a given situation, and have a seemingly
accurate outcome based on some predictable input. and yet what if the very
situation that is covered, and the [signs] that reference and rely upon it
are themselves held beyond a security audit, for their own integrity as
ideas. such that what is covered may not actually be there, in the way it
is believed to be, or assumed to be, or said to be, even though it appears
this way as an IMAGE. what if it is only on the surface, a threshold
condition, and is instead hollow on the inside and has been replaced by a
subverted model of events, which instead hide within and behind this
technical development, via the very code meant to prevent and protect
against such subversion. or has that never been the idea within the
programming itself as idea- and instead of protecting and securing truth-
protecting secrecy and privacy and security which could instead be a realm
of harboring lies and grand deceptions.

it is to wonder if the collective programming of technological civilization
actually audits truth at the level of the [signs] themselves used as ideas
and for shared awareness or if this is simply believed because it has been
institutionalized and validated within an ideological framework and thus is
assumed and presumed 'true' by default of its existence in and as code, as
programming, as software and hardware, and as cryptographic communications
that serve- what, exactly? if they are not grounded in truth in the ideas
that establish the code, how can the program function towards this or serve
it. if the concepts are ungrounded, how is this loose yarn or security flaw
not able to be thoroughly exploited and unravel all security by design of
such flaws into every last dual-use item and object. so what if it is the
world that has been so covered in yarn or wrapped and covered in code, and
people have put their lives into this, and yet it is not actually serving
them or the human population in its actions and instead defaults to a realm
of exploitation and subversion via its known errors that cannot be
corrected, and instead it is defended against any such correction.

artistic investigations can offer a glimpse into situations that otherwise
may not be readily accessible or realizable within existing limits of
particular observation.

what Olek and her team function as, at least in this tentative estimation,
is somewhere between the analytical programming of Ada Lovelace and the
capacity of a customizable crotchet-loom consisting of a human knitting
crew (compiler or not, unknown), and that in this personal relation with
what is to become covered, it is seemingly similar in challenge to the
daunting and original challenges a programmer can face when taking on a new
area or developing new skills or approaching new problems beyond previous
limit, and thus building a vocabulary and skills and competence via further
such development. and that, over time, massive time and effort is put into
a project or goals that can transform a situation and model it within
certain parameters, and provide functionality that is new or optimized, and
that such efforts and accomplishments cover a wide range of activity,
including from creating basic computing utilities or programming languages
to internet and telecom software, to content management systems (CMS) and
other social and retail software, to explorations of data organization and
computer modeling, and into financial and e-commerce and banking software,
to include the role of cryptography software and hardware both online and
offline in a similar context.

and perhaps many people have dealt with endless thread or lines of code
that are woven into complicated structures or must investigate convoluted
software to figure out how something is fit together, and all such
investigations occur in a given domain or in a given limit or parameters
where the code and programming and computation reside, as it aligns with
textbooks and classes and conversations and conferences about what exists
and what is going on. that it is occurring within certain frameworks and
dimensions. and yet in the same way, as a shared model of computation and
data representation, it is proposed that what is underneath this has not
been accounted for accurately and is not lining up with these efforts in a
way that works, especially in terms of security issues and the state, as
this becomes detached from truth and in doing so can allow a dictatorship
to be hidden within a democracy yet beyond any outside accounting. as it is
protected by ideological code, beliefs, political agendas, thugs and
activists who in turn have control of the surveillance state via this
interior difference, =C3=A0 la coup.

and thus it is to review the assumption of this data modeling, the way the
language and perception and observation works, pre-computer, to more
accurately account for what is going on within the secrete and hidden
technological enterprise of the rogue state. and what it indicates is that
the [signs] are not mapped accurately or checked against truth beyond a
given boundary or limit, which is based nearly entirely on the IMAGE of a
thing replacing the thing itself; the image of a bottle replacing the
bottle. though the 'data image' even moreso. and this in terms of boundary
and threshold observation yet also its iconic aspect, that like modular
programming, it can be assumed to exist as itself by default of its being
perceived this way, inside the limited framework, and no external reference
is needed, nor is it even allowed if contradicting the viewpoint. and that
is the ideological environment that software and hardware are being
developed within today in terms of economic, social, political tools that
result in devolved and antihuman culture which seeks to stop external
feedback from having a voice anymore.

and there are loose strings everywhere. pull one and the false frameworks
collapse, when evaluated in terms of paradoxical logic, actual reasoning of
events instead of simply real-time processing them, via binary assessments
that can self-contain truth yet only within an increasingly disconnected
bubble, relativism unto itself, falsity.

how can something that brings so much joy and beauty find itself compared
in relation to such a dismal situation. i think it is through seeing the
situation through other eyes that perhaps HOPE exists in recognizing what
is true about this condition and then reorganizing and redeveloping code
within that shared framework, and that taking into example the
transformative power of, instead of functioning from within "the inside" of
the situation, whether museum or standards institution, it could instead
involve the gathering of individuals of shared purpose, to accomplish
something larger that none by themselves could do alone, and taking on the
bigger challenges and projects likewise, with the combined skillsets as
part of this customizable equipment to call upon.

so for instance, if new approaches to crypto were considered- it would not
be to gather a group of algorithm-centric thinkers within a confined set of
parameters to question what incremental technique may further the existing
broken model and its assumptions, including hardware and software
platforms-- instead, the beginning question could and likely should exist
beyond this limit, beyond this threshold of ideological viewpoint, and
gather together linguists, artists, thinkers, and those involved in
patterns and structure and logic, physicists and others in addition to
cryptologists, to consider the core ideas of security and secrecy and
privacy in the terms they actually exist, before their institutionalization
and normalization in the existing corrupt scenario. a computational
linguist could have 1,000 approaches to encryption schemes by how they
model language in terms of various relations, as might a graphic designer,
and these could then be related to establishing algorithms, not just
mathematic structures. an innovative technologist may understand
infrastructures better than others and may know of new techniques or
possibilities that may others be unconsidered. say electromagnets in a shoe
that allows a drop or pickup of electronic data, or leaving a data print as
a sign. and certainly this type of prototypical engineering of intelligence
apparatus exists in the deep state, yet what about its application towards
everyday scenarios such as house keys or e-commerce portals on home
dwellings, synced with courier services for data updates and threshold
access. infrastructures, zoned crypto, etc.

and the question here attempts to ask: what if the form that has been
covered is not the form that exists anymore. and what if what is actually
required is to locate the ideas that need to be accurately modeled in data,
and that this data representation needs to be secured, as an issue of
integrity for systems built upon it, including most vitally, cryptography.
and thus the issue is securing truth within a realm of lies and
unaccountable deceit, and active hostilities against citizens trying to
exist within a constitutional framework, yet aggressively denied their
rights, via abuse and torture and retaliation for the attempts to recover
what has been lost. and that many people exist in this condition, and yet
'reason' itself is broken within the state, feedback in terms of citizen
representation and control over governance of the shared state, which is
out-of-control and functioning against the population by default. and until
this is accounted for, every further action within the false framework
further allows its legitimation to continue in this criminal offensive,
against the greater truth.

in this way, securing this truth, aligning with it, relying upon it,
requiring it to be addressed by relativistic viewpoints and ideology,
within a shared logical framework- it then becomes a showdown of truth
against power: whether law will be observed or if power will seek to
destroy it, as with most recent dictatorship that have fallen. the data
model is wrong, based on lies. a false perspective. the role of leaks,
threads that when cut break the support structure needed to sustain the
illusion. yet, when will documents provide direct evidence of crimes
against citizens, mass surveillance of daily activities, ubiquitous paid
informants of a private police state monitoring other citizens, covert
programs to control what occurs in institutions, organizations and schools
that aligns only with certain beliefs and demographics. will anyone even
dare do anything if the documents are revealed. or is even that too much to
expect, that someone may risk their life for the larger issues involved and
take a stand against tyranny. never before has a nation been more full of
hypocrites than the USA today. when are people going to take on the fight
and take the necessary risks to change the underlying dynamics and shift
the situation to a more realistic framework that piece by piece can be
configured and established in a common model, and programmed likewise, to
an agenda which serves people and traps the traitors within their
deception, isolating and separating and constricting their actions until
there are no longer any moves left.

it saddens my heart because the artwork here is tremendous and full of
life, yet exists in contrast to the world as if aberration, a beautiful
exotic flower in a civilization brought to ruin, a reminder of what living
is about, its potential, the true potential of the artist, of individuals
with insight who strive to use their talents to shared their observations,
and improve awareness of what exists as it exists, and beyond, into what
could be, as a basis for consciousness, relation, value. grounding of
belief. of action. the role of inspiration and play, the fantastical, of
boundary breaking and paradigm shifting realization and revelations. even
through something so humble and seemingly so commonplace as yarn, to see
through the imagination of other its potential  and perhaps consider other
observations anew, based on the truth it helps reveal.

in itself this is insufficient for evaluating the depth of any of the
artworks above. especially so for the magic that is Olek, because
interpretation of her work as code or programming or involving boundaries
may not be accurate other than a correlation with the dynamics involved...
another interpretation of which there are many, likely many more suitable
to this consideration than my limited awareness allows. yet consider the
power of artwork that can bring into consideration these questions and that
aligns in such a way to offer a conceptualization of the existing situation
within computational modeling of civilization in accurate and inaccurate
terms. it does not exist the same within textbooks of the involved
disciplines-- though it does exists outside them in the realm of the
interdisciplinary.  the real grounded value of critical theory and
literature of the Two Cultures, the electromagnetic reconnection across the
short-circuited institutional and ideological divide, to balance knowledge
via the empirical modeling of truth (1:1) and shared observation around
common, structurally related events. addressing this situation is entirely
possible, if dealing with it head-on.


--- last notes ---

artwork of Olek extends into ballooning, where relations also exist with
weaving and patterns...

also, 'mathematical knitting' is another realm of inquiry into mathematical
concepts and topological forms via fiber arts and textiles:

ailing-see-arts

the purpose of such examples being- what if security and cryptographic
concepts and ideas were brought outside of the existing framework and
explored in other mediums, involving issues of language and code and
programming outside the electronic context. perhaps there is something
still valuable and unknown in that ancient pottery or in that abstract
marking no one notices, or the missed stitch or oddly arranged pattern. in
this way, so too, why not origami crypto for self-folding or collapsing
patterns or creating code that can reconfigure or rearrange itself, as the
basis for algorithms.

context, tied down into particular mindsets and frameworks, limited and pri=
vate approaches to programming, addressing issue of secrecy and security, a=
s if it is all inside the existing observation, contained within a particul=
ar viewpoint and set of variables as interpreted. and then, how to convey a=
nother parallel world that also involves itself in the same conceptual stru=
cture, though differently... and even precedent to what is rigidly occurrin=
g inside the electronic boxes and technologies, yet in comparison appearing=
 only low-tech if no-tech, even while precedent if not philosophically more=
 pure. grounded by default of its physicality as it relates to ideas placed=
 into action. how to make the case &#39;this happened before that&#39; and =
yet to address a default detestation or conceit that may also exist, cultur=
ally, via a detachment between ideas, how things work, their relevance and =
trajectory and importance as knowledge, while inside an illiterate world. a=
 question of meaning, though also inherent bias, presumption of &#39;knowin=
g&#39; and having answers instead of not knowing and asking questions, lear=
ning from other realms of inquiry. thus are minds and mentalities closed or=
 are they capable of seeing beyond themselves and their finite assumptions,=
 especially if shared, solidified into the dogma of ideology.<br>

<br>&quot;science&quot; without art is no longer science. it is technique r=
emoved of its human purpose and capacity and becomes and functions for anot=
her antihuman agenda. it can become a distortion or false viewpoint to deve=
lop hostile policies within. the *insight* of art, of inquiry, of questioni=
ng, of the realm of risk and of peak functioning and imagination, of optimi=
zation within a limited context and challenging constraints - of knowing, o=
f being, of choices and actions - creates or opens or allows access, willin=
g or not, into another realm beyond the normal and everyday, new territory =
or old territory reconsidered and reconceived. turning answers into questio=
ns again and presenting new views into existing questions and ideas.<br>

<br>so for instance, &#39;the context&#39; for crypto could be assumed to b=
e computers by default of this being the present situation, in a confined d=
igital, binary technological development. for some the relevance or questio=
ns of crypto may be bounded within assumptions of this context, perhaps nev=
er having been experienced or considered beyond this computer model and its=
 particular emphasis on certain algorithmic approaches, as if previous ques=
tions have been answered correctly and now it is just an issue of extending=
 the model indefinitely, tweaking it within the given parameters and upgrad=
ing the model into newer technologies. in this sense a certain &#39;faith i=
n technology&#39; could even exist, where blind faith replaces the role of =
questioning fundamental truth, which has already been decided upon, and is =
assumed &quot;known&quot; and therefore someone can just pick up the or joi=
n in the parade and security and secrecy are effectively deemed guaranteed =
as long as staying within the ideological lines.<br>

<br>and yet an entire world of experience exists outside of this view and s=
ome if it can have profound relation both to the ideas of crypto and the fa=
lsification of existing models that seek to bound and limit its interpretat=
ion, thereby to control it within a given domain, while actual crypto could=
 be occurring outside this, without realization by some &quot;experts&quot;=
 who wholly believe in a limited finite hardware/software model as the limi=
t of questioning or the basis for relations in a realm of intelligence or h=
uman communications of ideas in a realm of secrecy, privacy, and security, =
including issues of the state as decentralized. as if &quot;where there is =
no computer encryption- there is no cryptography&quot;. in the realm of ide=
as this view is beyond laughable and truly ignorant of the domain cryptolog=
y operates within. for instance, the role of crossword puzzles or suduko as=
 it relates to puzzle solving, as these skills may be applied outside a rea=
lm of computer encryption yet decipher meaning. not necessarily within thos=
e puzzles though others. and that this is basic and should be assumed relev=
ant to ideas of cryptography and not seen as separate in terms of what it i=
nvolves. an algorithm is only a minor part of a much larger realm of questi=
oning that may involve other multiple approaches brought into a shared eval=
uation. it is not just a technical response that can be easily resolved in =
software/hardware models if it exists beyond their boundary. and thus how a=
 situation is modeled or observed would influence what can be evaluated, an=
d thus if there is no consideration of crypto outside of computation, none =
seeming exists. and yet this could be entirely false, an illusion or delusi=
on of those so trapped in their POVs. and to some degree or other everyone =
is trapped within individual frameworks in some way, it is an issue of how =
it is dealt with, must everything occur within that limit in interactions a=
nd thus a bubble reality and bubble-relations are required, or can a person=
 transcend their own limits through realizing and acknowledging truth beyon=
d themselves and their limits and humble themselves before the larger world=
 of ideas and other people, to learn and interact with others and ideas, an=
d develop shared frameworks that are self-correcting, including requiring a=
 person to correct their flawed assumptions as part of this empirical condi=
tion. in a sense, being freed of the burdens of upholding a false private f=
inite view, letting go of the need to rationalize everything in a single co=
rrect view that is theirs (onesided) and see what is beyond the limit of a =
particular person, via shared identity that maps into a larger realm of the=
 many, via the shared set of human awareness. where /perspective/ itself ch=
anges, transforms, becoming multiple while resolving itself in a single mod=
eling of truth.<br>

<br>so a situation exists, a condition begging the question: can you freely=
 observe, can you freely think about what cryptography is, or are you bound=
 to certain interpretations that restrict and limit because those framework=
s are required for degrees or careers or papers for conferences, even if or=
 while they may be inaccurate or limiting the examination and exploration o=
f the issues involved. and so in some sense this seeks to present a realm t=
hat is closely paralleled with crypto in the abstract, yet also thoroughly =
material, tangible, in a way that this information in software or encoded i=
nto electrons may not readily be. and thus the purpose here is not to break=
 the model of crypto considerations for its own sake, it is to break it ope=
n so that it can relate to other events and be reconsidered within the larg=
er context it exists within, so that it can breathe again as an idea. and b=
e removed of the carapace of ideological and its sterilization of the quest=
ions so important to the discipline, whose purposes ultimately involves pro=
tecting and securing truth, not lies.<br>

<br><br>--- cultural precedent ---<br><br>for a moment assume we are consid=
ering the multimedia networked computers of today including cellphones in t=
his domain, as a platform in which &#39;ideas&#39; and relations occur. tha=
t it is a technological environment we partly inhabit to establish and main=
tain relations, with other people and with institutions and with news and i=
nformation; education, entertainment, the weather report and so on. and in =
this inquiry, how someone defines [multimedia] could be important to where =
the boundaries or limits are for how the shared situation is interpreted, i=
ncluding in what categories and what variables or dimensions it will be map=
ped out within.<br>

<br>and thus if someone considers that &#39;multimedia&#39; began with the =
Macintosh computer in the 1980s that would be one context for evaluating th=
e situation and making assumptions. Yet another may believe it was establis=
hed with Macromedia Shockwave software that allowed interactive cd-roms and=
 eventually websites to be developed as a platform. And at some point these=
 views may be resolved into one or another framework that may bias the inte=
rpretation and also the possibilities when asking questions and developing =
viable or usable solutions.<br>

<br>i once had the pleasure of taking courses at SF Multimedia Studies Prog=
ram in San Francisco in the mid-90s in the early multimedia boom when there=
 was still a cultural dimension to the questions of internet development, b=
efore it become a de facto technical framework related to issues of canned =
software systems, data mechanics and constant upgrades and repair versus ab=
out ideas, organization of information, knowledge, education, models of tru=
th, culture. the issues of its commercialization -- like a Tsunami -- basic=
ally destroyed the internet as a cultural platform, and this went hand-in-h=
and with greed, the desire for money and profit, and not valuing the tradit=
ional goals of society because it could be edited out of equations in self-=
serving ideologies of exploitation, as a standardized institutionalized pra=
ctice. sound familiar to anyone?<br>

<br>in any case in an overview class prior to this cultural meltdown, Randa=
ll Packer taught a class entitled From Wagner to Virtual Reality that set t=
he stage for considering what the potential could be for multimedia compute=
rs within the larger society, and this from a view of the arts, what it off=
ers as a context for technological development, its larger purpose.<br>

<br>and so with that experience in mind, back to questioning [multimedia] t=
hen could feasibly lead, in the just stated framework, back to the Lascaux =
cave paintings, with realistic depictions of animals estimated to have been=
 created approximately 17,000 years ago.<br>

<br>thus the question of multimedia could be an issue of first markings in =
a next realm of communication, contrasting a pre-multimedia realm of newspa=
pers with an interactive realm, or assumably hand signaling with diagrammat=
ic animated-like depictions via cave artists.<br>

<br>formal systems of written language begin over 5,000 years ago by compar=
ison. moving from much earlier abstract marks, firstly, to eventual represe=
ntation by alphabets, allowing for shared communications in an archival for=
mat, as this also relates to number, counting. and managing both informatio=
n and ideas (grain deposits, governance, stories, law, culture).<br>

<br>so if a person questions [multimedia] in that context, of first marks a=
nd new formal systems of communication and relation, yet still other dimens=
ionality and frameworks could exist that help define and consider how, say,=
 new markup languages or codes function in this realm compared to those pre=
vious, or how it may evolve over time in a systematic way, given what has h=
appened many many many times before, over a period of millennia. absent thi=
s, it is reinventing the wheel though perhaps with less knowledge, repeated=
ly, and thus devolving the cultural standard to less than what preceded it,=
 due to ignorance, ignoring lessons learned.<br>

<br>so the internet ends up absent coherent knowledge at a larger scale, ab=
sent education or ideas beyond the limited framework, and entirely within a=
 big-box highway advertising model of commercialization, as if an exercise =
in ancient roman road building to every end of the empire with direct conne=
ctions back to the bank vaults at the core of the entire enterprise. cultur=
e here being money. commodification of information, exchange, data, the sta=
tus quo. financialization perhaps high theology in its speculative sense, e=
scape velocity beliefs.<br>

<br>and yet another person may observe (and these latter two examples are f=
rom Randall Packers scholarship) that like with Lascaux, that [multimedia] =
was developed within art and that the work and ideas of electronic sculptor=
 Nam June Paik created frameworks for its evaluation and relation that esse=
ntially are part of an overall empirical review, and it is important both t=
o consider and retain truth of these observations in newer frameworks as ap=
plicable, because that is the source of knowledge in terms of innovation an=
d imagination, that it can and does function across shared frameworks, scaf=
folding, between various structural systems.<br>

<br>you could just evaluate birds without considering anything else, yet wi=
thout trees, wind, leaves, sky, clouds, song, the fullness and wholeness of=
 the bird is missing. so too, the issues and ideas of code, encryption, or =
in this case networked [multimedia].<br>

<br>and so the issue becomes one of including context, the foreground and t=
he background events in an ecological and ecosystem-like review or survey, =
and i think diagramming and mapping and other &#39;first marks&#39; are clo=
ser at accessing these connections than written alphabetic sentences that m=
ust =C2=A0R A T I O N A L I Z E =C2=A0them within a pre-existing viewpoint =
in order for the views to make sense or be valid, given existing interpreta=
tions, versus exploring questions and ideas at a conceptual level of ideati=
on (fancy word). thus, instead of staying within the existing limited views=
 of ideas, breaking them open again to question and test assumptions- that =
ideas are hypotheses that can and need to be challenged to retain their int=
egrity, otherwise they can become ungrounded and detached from actual reali=
ty and substitute for it, as a lesser version of events and experience- as =
agreed to exist. thus, just like not being able to modify the segments with=
in letters which become inviolable by the limits of their modeling, so too =
ideas become rigid by boundaries which protect them yet which could be base=
d on errored assumptions or viewpoints. /history/ is effectively this. it c=
ould be a warped skewed series of shared observations that becomes the plat=
form to develop future actions and ideas, and if unchallenged or not correc=
ted, can function against the very goals and ideas sought, due to this inte=
rnal corruption or internal rotting that is deemed off-limits from further =
consideration, especially in terms of structure, foundation. so too, system=
s of language, code, programming as this effects hardware, software, techni=
cal and cultural development. what can and cannot happen as a result of est=
ablished framework and their normalization, standing-in for truth, yet pote=
ntially not accurately representing it and instead this can become religion=
, following certain beliefs beyond the evidence, and especially when in den=
ial of external truth, via disregard or denial of its falsification. which =
then establishes an inside and outside condition, which is an ideological c=
ompound that can occupy communities, governments, education institutions, a=
nd bureaucracies. and software and hardware tools, entire technological pla=
tforms that support this ~behavior. so then devolution is in full swing, an=
d it becomes a Planet of the Apes scenario. caged humans treated as if apes=
, needing to conform to the false worldview, poisoned out of existence.<br>

<br>so there are these strange dynamics in the everyday that must be encoun=
tered and dealt with and they involve pressures that like force fields alig=
n with ideological frameworks that are mediated in certain ways, in particu=
lar realms, and they can be known and identified yet may also be unspoken o=
r not talked about due to limits in communications with other people, in re=
gard to what can be said versus what it is known. and the political danger =
in speaking, such that you may be attacked or killed for speaking &#39;wron=
gly&#39; or &#39;falsely&#39; in that context, of the ideological. next thi=
ng you know- no school for you, no career, no friends, etc. thus following =
the ideological lead, the party line is important when truth is managed by =
power and the facts can be chosen and edited to fit the finite shared viewp=
oint, whereby broken society and broken equipment and tools and broken rela=
tions are really all about evolution, and not driving civilization into the=
 ground, and making people dig their own graves.<br>

<br>this is the result of bad ideas. those that go uncorrected in their err=
ors and assumptions. the consequences are very real and add up. each lapse =
or reinforcement of error promoting and extending an inhuman agenda, and th=
is can be codified and solidified within processes, within tools, within re=
lations, within language itself which functions against greater truth and r=
elies upon this fallen state of mediocrity in some faith-based sense- that =
simply going along with the flow and following is going to lead to emancipa=
tion and not extinction. as if the automated technocratic system - driven b=
y antihuman values - has our best interests at heart, when the heart -- its=
 virtues and its truth -- is not modeled within the machinery. it is viewed=
 as non-existant, a falsehood, sentiment by those detached from its groundi=
ng.<br>

<br>and so crypto, likewise, may be perceived only as a manly man&#39;s spo=
rt- no girly stuff here. no warm fuzzy relations or questioning. nothing so=
ft. all bits and sharp edges and speed, equations! algos! macho macho stuff=
. mathematics as rigid thought system, non-metaphysical. and yet that is no=
t where its creativity arises from, in many instances. it is within ideas f=
irstly, ingenuity, not canned approaches. not answered questions repeatedly=
 incrementally upgraded. it does not glorify or harbor partial truths as if=
 good enough. weak ideas have no place in crypto, they are more than a secu=
rity risk. they are an unacceptable unallowable weakness and should not ret=
ain employment, and those who serve them should be isolated.<br>

<br>here is why...<br><br>how do you discuss the direct relevance of fiber =
and textile arts with cryptographers? what if this consideration involves a=
 vital realm of questioning and reconsidering the existing interpretation o=
f cryptology yet it is deemed off-limits by existing ideology? what if the =
too-simple binary approach seeks to govern or determine what can be true or=
 included within its controlled framework- and in doing so ignores evidence=
 and itself is the security risk? what if there are cryptographers whose pr=
inciples are not aligned with serving truth and instead mimic this, and yet=
 the illusion of this imitation is broken by wrong choices, in that a lesse=
r approach is believed superior, ignoring or disregarded its falsification.=
 and what if to get into a larger framework, of [crypto] beyond its existin=
g ideological limits, involves cracking open the concept and seeing it in t=
he larger cultural context it exists within yet also has become detached fr=
om, potentially, thus to consider it anew and test and challenge and extend=
 its modeling beyond existing limits and boundaries, thresholds and framewo=
rks, to see what crypto really involves as an idea, versus a given implemen=
tation in a particular medium at a place in time, such as within networked =
[multimedia] computers.<br>

<br>my first instinct is to not heed preconceived ideological limits of tho=
se who simply think it is ~profane (to their crypto-religion) to break &quo=
t;their rules&quot; for crypto corruption, as they need the existing model =
to retain coherence and governance of its next self-same iteration, that th=
e sign of crypto equals itself and not something beyond their control (that=
 is: crypto=3Dcrypto, versus its truth beyond the signage as packaged, comm=
oditized). so if people are trying to limit evaluation of an idea, core to =
a discipline, it is fairly easy to see the political dimension and lines of=
 force that need certain questioning to remain *answered* and out-of-bounds=
, to limit interpretation, keep it within a given perspective so to control=
 what can happen, and to protect a border between what is inside and outsid=
e, or what if valid and invalidated by default of enforced convention, if n=
ot standardization.<br>

<br>thus it is not only to forget them, it is to not include or allow them =
in considerations if truth is and has been secondary to their inquiries, fo=
r bad faith is their foundation for relations and interactions result in au=
tomatic exploits via onesided agendas. keep out. they are bad for crypto an=
d these relations should be short-circuited, not allowed to continue. espec=
ially as to influencing what can or cannot happen in their limited, finite =
viewpoints. the exploring and questioning of ideas requires thinkers and sh=
ould not defer to ideologues.<br>

<br>so if suddenly it is proposed that yarn and thread and fabric have a lo=
t to do with crypto and computers and someone from a networked multimedia c=
omputer context cries that it is off limits and wrong, perhaps they are una=
ble to consider such things or consider cryptological considerations beyond=
 a binary technical enterprise, and therefore are stuck and will remain stu=
ck in that given framework while other things happen around them, eventuall=
y surpassing the broken model and its adherents who remain stuck if not cap=
tured inside a sinking ship. woe are they, unknowing of their descent into =
the unfathomable, the pressures that await.<br>

<br>and so at this juncture the connection with the Jacquard loom can be in=
troduced, of new technical automation within textile manufacture (c.1801) i=
nvolving a mechanical process of weaving guided or programmed by coded punc=
h cards instructions, resulting in the creation of woven patterns. abstract=
 input related to machine functionality, holes in the card mapped to and re=
presenting hooks, leading to output in another medium. perhaps similar to m=
etal tines protruding from a wind-up music box, as to what notes are played=
, though involving a more complex instrument and its orchestrated movement =
of warp and weft.<br>

</font>note that also around this time, Ada Lovelace composed the first alg=
orithm for the Analytical Engine computer of Charles Babbage, thus recogniz=
ed as the first computer programmer. These observations originating from a =
course taught by Mr. Packer on &#39;multimedia history&#39;.<br>

</font><font><br><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" targ=

important to consider is that the platforms for crypto systems in use today=
 were experimented with and explored across a wider range of consideration =
in terms of mechanical systems and how code and programming developed into =
a single monocultural binarist system.<br>

<br>and at some point the relation between thinking of some task and puttin=
g it into a set of =C2=A0instructions to be parsed by machinery retained co=
herence that may have been lost today, where writing such code appears even=
 lost to its own interpretation or unknown effects within the automated mac=
hinery. and at some point choices could have become limited, from the contr=
ol over this interaction and the dimensions it is mapped and proceeds withi=

 also of ideas; especially &quot;economics&quot; as a discipline, where equ=
ations do not adequately map to the reality they seek to describe in order =
to determine profit-loss and gears by which civilization grinds into existe=
nce.<br>

<br>so i am one of the weirdos who appreciates sewing, due to an artistic b=
ackground, and this is a skill that is nearly wholly of a female domain tod=
ay, at least in the US, in that to seek classes a male will be faced with c=
lass exercises for making dress patterns, etc. it is an interesting conundr=
um or limit that certainly reflects what females must face in most every co=
ntext in terms of the dimensions allowed due to constricting bias of interp=
retation.<br>

<br>awhile ago i went to a sewing expo at the nearby convention center to l=
ook at equipment and was completely surprised at the level of correspondenc=
e between advanced tools today and the earliest programmable equipment 200+=
 years ago. whether an individual sewing machine that can be programmed via=
 bitmap graphic files or via stitch patterns or larger equipment, the role =
of embroidery done automatically by sewing machine (in that it is itself a =
computer) is the extension of this earliest programmatic development, a mer=
ging of Lovelace and loom. yet perhaps a step or more removed from ready or=
 immediate analysis, and more of a plug-and-play scriptability of equipment=
. it remains unknown to what degree it is possible, though mirrors similarl=
y the issues of scale, from very large industrial color printing into the d=
esktop context of inkjet and laser home printers, whereby something occurri=
ng at one scale is suddenly available in another and what does it mean or i=
ndicate. and thus, in seeing the larger machinery, not factory-level though=
 home-factory level, say 8&#39; x 4&#39; dimensions for equipment, includin=
g LASERS, these advanced sewing machine-computers can basically map out any=
thing in thread as if a painting on a canvas and this has been automated, e=
xpertised, such that what may once have been zoned in a particular area of =
town, requiring certain square footage, could instead occupy the basement o=
f a house in a newly zoned live-work neighborhood that involves both e-comm=
erce and retail dimensions, thus potentially like with 3D printing alongsid=
e paper/data copy services, could bring the village and its [signage] back =
into a realm of city planning, where such districts foster these services b=
oth locally and for remote online or business orders, via courier and bulk =
shipments.<br>

<br>in other words, the nature of industry, craft, trade, skill, is changin=
g alongside the development of computation and this changes and challenges =
the context of these tools and the relations they involve. and in this appr=
oach, a certain segment of the population could develop their work or busin=
ess within their home, especially if it is symbolic processing, which is th=
e basis for telework and telecommunications today, reliant upon infrastruct=
ure.<br>

<br>this is not the idea that will be explored here. it involves something =
else, something more fundamental and basic and vital and of a seemingly ent=
irely other approach and application. the difficulty is that for me it exis=
ts beyond words, and thus like a programmer trying to find a way to convey =
the necessary instructions to allow particular computation to occur, it is =
to try to access a realm that already exists and to not limit it by my own =
incapacity, yet to bring it into question as a framework for considering th=
e ideas of cryptography. today, yesterday and tomorrow.<br>

<br><br>--- deep culture ---<br><br>to precede this investigation, it was t=
o recontextualize the idea of code and programming outside the limits of th=
e electronic box of the digital computer, and consider that it may have som=
e connection to the surrounding background of other existing or previous ev=
ents and their structures and frameworks. as with cryptology and cryptograp=
hy in general, as further relations within this domain, reliant upon it tho=
ugh also seemingly limited, constrained if modeling does not or cannot take=
 into account information existing beyond its threshold. and so it gets int=
o a realm of observation and action, open minds that are aware and question=
ing and those that may be closed and reliant upon rigid structures for secu=
rity and secrecy that in a larger consideration are invalid, yet not accoun=
ted for or accountable in this realm. so perhaps this is an ideological aud=
it of sorts, a litmus test, of crypto &amp; intelligence...<br>

<br>the importance and value of art within development and sustenance of cu=
lture can at times be hard to decipher, especially when retrograde or funct=
ioning against the necessary direction. while some appreciation may be give=
n or afforded, it may also appear as a luxury, and a vast quantity of its p=
roduction may be ungrounded and not offer greater insight beyond extremely =
limited or copyist approaches, yet which represent it and &quot;culture&quo=
t; likewise, via artifacts and trends and social hierarchy that both valida=
tes and is validated by this relationship. and then there are the exception=
s- where the *insight* occurs. not just the production. and this is a rare =
and ephemeral thing, and appears to occupy its own zone, where its truth is=
 transmitted and received within dimensions similar and-or different and ch=
allenge or call into question or further expand upon observations and disco=
veries, shared or unshared, in such a way as ideas in a particle collider, =
or raindrops from a storm becoming rivers that return to oceans and return =
to the sky. that a transformational event or relation happens and alignment=
 occurs within a range of experience, that provides grounding, heightened o=
r new awareness, and essentially helps establish and defined an empirical m=
odel of relation held outside or alongside the current technological constr=
uct as an ideological framework, art and artistry active both in its prepar=
ation, continuing development, and dismantling.<br>

<br>in this sense, technologists may be artists, as with others, yet unreco=
gnized this way, or if so equated, likely corrupting its validity due to th=
e role of commerce, exploiting or marketing this when subverted by other ag=
endas. which is perhaps covered by the fake money that artworks can represe=
nt, symbolic commerce, the realm of celebrity now mass culture, everyone ha=
ving a potentially valuable signature, everyone a Warhol Portrait in waitin=
g.<br>

<br>and so it is to say again that this inquiry is not about that, in itsel=
f, and yet about its substance, the truth it involves yet is caught within,=
 via collapse of culture, illiteracy and evaluating things only in their mo=
st immediate limited sense via particularized views, which the binary minds=
et provides as a basis for relation.<br>

<br>in this way, the contributions of artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude cou=
ld be evaluated in terms of artistic opinion in some canon of art history- =
yea or nea? like or no-like in terms of an artistic project or experiential=
 relation-- especially in terms of aesthetics. and as this relates to ideas=
, how the various artwork is interpreted.<br>

<br><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude" targ=
et=3D"_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude</a><br=
><a href=3D"http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/artworks/realized-projects" =
target=3D"_blank">http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/artworks/realized-proj=
ects</a><br>

<br>i am no expert and art scholars have vast amounts of knowledge and insi=
ght to share on these questions, though offered here is a potential way of =
considering such artistic works in the larger context they inhabit- which r=
emains open to interpretation.<br>

<br>in the realm of fabric, Running Fence at least in part could involve se=
eing what otherwise is unseen as a boundary or limit, a line on a map that =
otherwise goes unnoticed, yet may establish an inside and outside. today, G=
PS maps may be correlated with this, as a rode that is driven on is a line,=
 while others may appear, like that for a state park whose trees can only b=
e viewed in the distance from the freeway, that establish various boundarie=
s, inside and outside relations as it is mapped or correlated via direction=
 observation. informational structure that is represented and then its repr=
esentation encounters what it is mapped onto.<br>

<br>metaphysics is a difficult word and easily diluted in its placeholder m=
eaning, yet what it attempts to define is something that is difficult other=
wise to capture in ordinary terms, as if it operates at another level than =
that of mundane, dull, and disconnected experience. as if suddenly everythi=
ng makes sense and has inherent alignment, yet which can be unrecognized or=
 hard to grasp because it is beyond a threshold of awareness or understandi=
ng, unless it is encountered, experienced, and can be revealed. thus there =
is an *invisibleness* to it.<br>

<br>so the thing about ideas that relates to this, perhaps especially as li=
nguistic constructs or models that take on the form of an idea as a sign, s=
ymbol, or word, is that it is linked to CATEGORY and categorization, that t=
he meaning of words and concepts map into frameworks, structures, that each=
 upon another build upon themselves the larger language development. founda=
tion of this would seemingly be truth, yet not inherently so. and thus [cat=
egory] could be related to truth yet not equated with it. it is as if an id=
ea in superposition that has the potential to tend towards truth, or toward=
s greater falsity, given its accounting.<br>

<br>and so if there are two concepts, [concept1] and [concept2], they could=
 be of different categories that challenge or extend one another or be base=
d on different truths altogether or one could be largely inaccurate as an i=
dea whereas another more accurate, in a particular context. in other words =
there are limits to meaning, it has boundaries, and concepts relate to one =
another as with people, within certain dimensions and not others. and conne=
ctions are reliant upon structures or scaffolding between them, to establis=
h or allow their relation in whatever truth may exist, or falsity may be al=
lowed if this connection relies upon errors.<br>

<br>if really cutting to the chase, this issue of language could be an issu=
e of &quot;original sin&quot; as it relates to the SIGN and its misconcepti=
on of equating with truth itself, versus as a reference to it. thus the [si=
gn] could refer only to itself, within a corruption of language or outside =
or beyond itself to truth that validates it beyond a programmatic assumptio=
n.<br>

<br>so when a [building] is covered entirely in fabric, what was once a bui=
lding that is seen within its surrounding context is suddenly transformed, =
&quot;disappeaered&quot; or made invisible by its being covered and in doin=
g so, its surface is removed from the common visual realm and hidden within=
 an opaque interiority that can only be accessed by observational imaginati=
on, as if virtual. in that, if remaining on the outside of this boundary, i=
t is discontinuous to all previous experience, where a building is removed =
or masked out of the framework, placed into some liminal realm, betwixt and=
 between, neither here nor there. and in this abstract condition, the form =
of the building represents the building itself in its greater detail, yet l=
acks the 1:1 recognition that was known relation before this.<br>

<br>in this way a given observation of a particular building could then hav=
e a limit or barrier created that limits or changes this observation, and p=
rovides a more abstract view in place of what was presumably of greater fid=
elity to the thing-in-itself. the volumetric massing of the building may in=
stead become prominent, and in this, the covered building could exist as if=
 a wrapped present even, its unveiling and return to itself part of the gre=
at delight.<br>

<br>and yet beyond this, what could be involved is informational, related t=
o the SIGN itself, as if the cover is what written or representational lang=
uage functions as, when referring to something else it seeks to contain wit=
hin its meaning. such that to cover something in this way is to contain it =
likewise, potentially, as a category. in other words, the fabric could dema=
rcate the boundary between concepts, as with between different words and th=
eir meaning, and challenge the notion of this capacity to do so. when the b=
uilding is covered or limited by this fabric veil, how has its existence ch=
anged and the relation of observers to it.<br>

<br>it is tremendously difficult to write of, it is many layered and my app=
roach inadequate to seek to convey that this directly involves the issues o=
f data modeling within computers. that when seeking to map a SIGN onto some=
thing else, it presumes certain boundaries or limits yet may remain only pa=
rtial to a given observation-- abstracting the very thing that is to be mod=
eled, instead of allowing it to exist in its totality, and thus could invol=
ve an issue of removal of reality or reductionist &quot;development&quot; b=
y default of this presumption that the sign represents the thing in itself,=
 versus references and gains its value from it.<br>

<br>in other words, you could take the fabric off the wrapped building and =
claim it is actually the building in itself-- which is what those invested =
in binary language do with signs, they believe the truth is within being ab=
le to put brackets and limits on perception and control and categorize thin=
gs, as if doing so makes it true. such that there is only one version of an=
 [event] and it is theirs and it is correct. and computers and institutions=
 and minds are programmed this way ~likewise. and in essence this could be =
the empty set [ ] [ ] [ ], whereby truth is arbitrary insofar as it exists =
to serve a given ruling perspective. because the way things are covering it=
 can be manipulated, and hide other details, or make limits appear that are=
 not really there, and thus guide in the wrong direction. and perhaps there=
 really is no building under the fabric- perhaps it is hollow inside, and w=
ho would know if no one is allowed to check inside anymore. the very idea o=
f questioning theories- heresy.<br>

<br>when Christo and Jeanne-Claude covered a stretch of coastline, the issu=
e of scale again is relevant and involves what level of detail is possible =
to achieve, and thus a rough sketch like covering of the form occurs yet on=
ly to the most general aspects of given landscape and its geologic features=
. &#39;measuring the coastline&#39; is a famous example of fractal mathemat=
ics whereby the rule for measurement changes the length of the coastline. i=
f you map things at one-inch scale a different coastline will result than a=
t one-foot scale, as features and micro-features are accounted for. and so =
too with fabric coverings, and so too, computer modeling and data represent=
ations of objects and ideas and events in the &#39;external world&#39;.<br>

<br>this is to suggest that the generality of the covered stretch of coastl=
ine is somewhat of a proof of the limits of representation to potentially a=
ccurately or entirely &#39;categorize&#39; or cover or stand-for something =
else, and yet the very power of language and SIGNs to do so, to be able to =
map some event onto another, via a word or symbol or phrase. and that, like=
 a primal marking or delineation of territory, this artistic intervention i=
s establishing a boundary condition, in some cases an inside-outside correl=
ation, though also of thresholds of observation and awareness and relation,=
 that allows it to be considered anew-- yet also, the draping of the event =
may be low-resolution to the event itself, in certain dimensions.<br>

<br>the ability of a computer to take the language of economics and automat=
e it into software systems for diagnosing ills and benefits of society with=
in its computational framework may pale in comparison to the coastline it s=
eeks to measure and its covering via its SIGNAGE. it may not only be limite=
d or reliant upon boundaries, it may be inaccurate and false in its assumpt=
ions that become solidified and related to as if by default true, as concep=
ts. as if data that correlates to the conception validates the conception i=
tself; covering =3D truth. it is the very problem of binary pattern recogni=
tion, its ideology and the corruption of ideas at the core of civilization =
and wrong-minded and -guided technological development today:<br>

<br>=C2=A0 take half of everything or anything<br>=C2=A0 including errors a=
nd wrong assumptions<br>=C2=A0 call it truth, ignore everything else<br><br=
>so what if in the data modeling of the world, various data tarps are being=
 placed over all that exists, yet this is an ideological mapping that is no=
t serving human interests in the way the data is being processed and used, =
in terms of automated reasoning and decision making that seeks to benefit i=
ts modus operandi and not have this serve human values or needs anymore, es=
pecially in terms of representational governance. what does it mean that th=
e Whitehouse or various seats of government may be data modeled likewise, &=
quot;mediated&quot; in this same abstract modeling that tends to exploit fa=
lsity to move in a particular direction and in doing so, plays the SIGNS an=
d shuffles the limits and categories [ [ ] [ ] ] and creates a viewpoint th=
at is supposedly shared, yet does not map into truth accurately and has no =
legal obligation to do so, while humans and their society collapse into not=
hingness.<br>

<br>moving the abstraction (goalposts of meaning) around, the signage to cr=
eate false perspective stagesets for oratory and political theatre, as if t=
ruth itself -- this gaming of language and perception -- versus the require=
ment and obligation to address [ideas] in their truth, within the world tha=
t exists, not only that which can be allowed to exist within the computeriz=
ed worldview.<br>

<br>(signs do not need to be accounted for in their whole truth, only parti=
al truth. the category or sign is detached from truth, becomes its own trut=
h via relativization)<br><br>maybe this question of abstraction, naming, ca=
tegorization, and language are inherent in the human condition, yet it is a=
lso possible some may exploit these dynamics, through dishonesty and seek t=
o misalign and misdirect development via the /appearances/ of things, versu=
s to account for things in themselves. and thus again [signage] can replace=
 truth, stand-in for it and mediate existence yet it is entirely shallow an=
d self-contained, systematic, as if an issue of sustaining an illusion with=
in the given boundary, of an inside and outside, such that some may be kept=
 on the outside, and not understand the threshold that is engineered, and t=
hus be disenfranchised by watching and following the stage play, to their o=
wn demise.<br>

<br>how do you know that GPS misdirection is only an error and not seeking =
to cause an accident, is this an issue of faith in the goodness of technocr=
atic, biased political technology? what if the demarcation of events in his=
tory are warped to a biased viewpoint and thus staying within those lines s=
erves a certain agenda set against your own existence- is observance of tha=
t boundary by default validated via its institutionalization, and what if e=
ducational systems no longer allow questioning of these views within their =
walls- what does it mean?<br>

<br>what is versus what is represented. what exists versus what is represen=
ted, modeled, and believed to exist. authenticity versus the requirement of=
 masquerade. people hiding views beyond certain limits or boundaries. &quot=
;reason&quot; contained within binary parameters, etc. then Plan B, psychia=
tric &#39;medicine&#39; for those who do not comply with the insane master =
narrative.<br>

vers who can ignore larger reality for a partial viewpoint stand against na=
tural observational powers and the need to correlate their understanding wi=
th it, for survival. this could indicate either a simulation exists, thereb=
y explaining how some people seem to treat life as a game without consequen=
ce; else also an invading or occupying population that aligns its reality a=
t a distance and must correspond views via a centralizing query and respons=
e, say via cellphones. both scenarios could also exist simultaneously, exis=
ting beside the human population.<br>

<br>i think in some way, some artwork of Christo and Jeanne-Claude opens up=
 questioning of the categorization of elements of existence in a linguistic=
 if not geometric framework, as this relates to form and topology, and boun=
daries. pattern yet at a holistic level or totality, in terms of creating a=
n inside/outside with a wrapped building. versus Running Fence that may inv=
olve other conceptions of boundaries and limits via scale, distance, and ot=
her geographic and geologic considerations, including accessible temporal a=
nd spatial experience of observers. in some sense the various events seem t=
o question &#39;the fabric of space-time&#39; via relation. as if made out =
of whole cloth.<br>

<br>the enigma of information in this realm of category, where does the wra=
pped entity reside in its truth- its it contained only within the boundary =
or does it exist beyond this, outside of it, uncontainable in its conceptua=
lization within finite dimension. is it instead of a realm of typology, ten=
ding toward the iconic, of stereotype and the archetype, the symbol that is=
 temporarily accessed, made visible, tangible, this gift.<br>

<br>the terror of this covering process would be that what becomes covered =
is removed and replaced by a false framework, literally dismantling what on=
ce appeared and could be assumed still present (and represented) by the sig=
n-based covering. in this way the exterior could be presented and presumed =
as if an integrated whole while subverted in this same dimensions internall=
y, and thus while appearing as an icon or representative concept, such as [=
economy], could replace the very meaning of this with its anti-thesis in te=
rms of reliance on falsehood or other exploitations that are ungrounded yet=
 also unchecked, allowed to be this way due to language -- its signage if n=
ot CODE -- being equated with truth itself. in this way the cover of a conc=
ept or ideas by SIGNS that inaccurately represent or subvert its connection=
 with truth can be camouflage that enables truth to be hidden, kept away du=
e to such boundaries and observational limits.<br>

<br>{ a note here on the iconic, regarding large scale sculptures of Claes =
Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, also encountered locally at the once grea=
t Walker Art Center prior to its ideological fall and reconstruction.<br>

<br>while the wrapped building if not [SIGN] could be evaluated in terms of=
 its boundaries or limits, and in this difference between normal perception=
 and its altered condition may appear abstractly singular in some new or di=
fferent way, and perhaps iconic, as if a more pure manifestation or realiza=
tion of what is observed in this abstraction-- and thus clarity by simplici=
ty perhaps- this would seem different than an item changed and seen anew vi=
a a different technique, say a change in scale and materials, such as the s=
oft sculptures or various juxtaposed objects, such as giant binoculars or p=
aperclip or gigantic power outlet. that would seem to be an issue more of A=
1=3DA2 and challenging the parameters of what makes something what it is as=
 an entity, such that if you change this and that element will the original=
 entity remain the same, how does its essence change when its model of itse=
lf is modified, and to evaluate this surreal process.<br>

<br>it is thus to distinguish between the iconic aspects of wrapped works b=
y Christo and Jeanne-Claude in their potentially iconic aspects with those =
of Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, yet both could be considered to =
function in a similar linguistic and conceptual realm involving sculpture, =
geometries, limits, and observation. }<br>

<br>there are millions of people who have more accurate language for these =
events and more effective analysis to consider as it relates to these issue=
s, scholarship of everyday observation as well as scholarly investigations =
and contemplations of aesthetics via appreciation of such ideas. so this is=
 meant to offer connection between these realms and provide example, should=
, say, code and programming function similarly, yet also involve security i=
ssues that exploit similar parameters. alot can be learned from the structu=
ral frameworks of information that correlate across and between disciplines=
 and thus the interdisciplinary is that integrative perspective of shared e=
mpirical truth. it is the natural tendency of truth to be correlated with i=
tself in the terms it exists and not to falsely limit this, which unfortuna=
tely appears to be the default state in ways large and small, between peopl=
e to between nations, unless it is not allowed. and thus illiteracy mapped =
onto these coverings, inaccurate data models and representations that ignor=
e and do not acknowledge truth beyond an interior condition, can function b=
oth to protect whatever is going on inside, outside of observational view, =
protected or guarded by this condition, and keep those on the outside bound=
ed and limited and reliant upon it, if everything is similarly designed, in=
to a giant false perspective.<br>

<br>whereas literacy would enable to coverings or [signs] to be tested, eva=
luated, error-corrected, and to verify what is on the inside corresponds wi=
th what is on the outside and not base this in blind faith and religious ad=
herence to private inhuman ideology, as a means for survival or profit, a s=
ociety of insiders the slaves outside sustain. and yet there is no way to g=
et past this without requiring this [signage] be validated in truth, firstl=
y, via logic. not binary &quot;true belief&quot; reliant on falsity and opi=
nion.<br>

<br><br>--- code and programming ---<br><br>and then there is Olek... the c=
ategory-defying space goddess time traveler whose artwork i fear to write a=
bout due to its magical dimensions which for me function beyond words, yet =
accesses a vital and core truth via aesthetic activity that my words can on=
ly fail to describe or capture.<br>

</font><br><font><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olek" target=3D"_b=

<br>and in some way, if sheets of fabric pieced together correlate with the=
 wrappings and coverings of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, as if perhaps a data=
 representation, category or [sign] as variable (x), or data object of an e=
vent, then it is with the crochet artworks of Olek that the yarn itself ent=
ers into a code-like situation, via different structural stitches and patte=
rns, that can overtake another [sign] as if a program that seeks to replace=
 it via another version, a secondary layer of colored patterned yarn.<br>

<br>in terms of code, it is known there are routines and ways of establishi=
ng structure and as with stitches, they have different purposes and qualiti=
es. an edge stitch versus an interior stitch that covers distance. as the b=
eginning and end of a program may have different functional requirements in=
 terms of code, than then interior.<br>

<br>the work of Olek is vast. awe-inspiring. like i said, i am scared to wr=
ite about it because my broken language cannot approximate its dimensions, =
it is beyond this and my capacity to convey and yet for me singularly stand=
s out as important work in its depth of imagination and creative purpose, i=
ts tapping into and revealing hidden truth, and its performative social asp=
ect that everyday people can relate to, via changing what is &#39;known&#39=
; if not unseen, subconscious, or forgotten and looking and considering it =
anew.<br>

<br>and yet to look at a finished or completed piece or &#39;yarn-complete&=
#39; artwork is almost not the event in itself, as if time-lapse somehow is=
 required to comprehend an aspect of it that is beyond a finished iconic re=
lation. instead it is the insane challenges that Olek and her knitting crew=
 taken on that genuinely defy belief -- in that it was never before imagine=
d in my finite awareness that somehow could do what Olek does with yarn -- =
because it is beyond the ordinary limit yet also part of its unique capacit=
y. yarn sculpture, yarn muralist, yet more than this- yarn topologist, yarn=
 symbologist. and still it does not access the totality, which others have =
much more competence at defining in terms of the conceptualization and prac=

<br>who would figure you could cover an entire locomotive train in yarn and=
 that doing so is not just an issue of getting it covered, thought also of =
additional aesthetic detail and meaning in the patterning. and this is what=
 sets artists apart from others, in that they can see beyond and somehow gr=
ound such events in a realm of greater insight and awareness. and what is i=
t? why is it fascinating or for others potentially without the requirement =
to be a legitimate investigation. what truth is being revealed and how.&#39=
;<br>

<br>and i do not know myself, though i can sense it. it is as if the inacce=
ssible is made accessible yet per-language or pre-definition or something t=
hat exists in language and functions as a symbol or a sign is dematerialize=
d yet held together by crocheted yarn and somehow a childlike fascination a=
nd pure joy overwhelms at the excitement it brings into the world, like lig=
ht breaking through decades of dreary clouds and seeing a smile radiate out=
ward or a strange glance that then winks, securing a shared known relation.=
<br>

<br>and its also sexy. wild. libidinal. its potent if illicit energies flow=
ing throughout. and perhaps this relates to its tangibleness, of knit fabri=
cs that have textures that can be soothing to the touch, comforting and fam=
iliar. they also have information, in terms of touch, very much like the se=
cond skin of clothing. something very close to the realm of everyday feelin=
g and issues of relation, in particular self-with-self as a person is cloth=
ed, and as others are likewise clothed or covered. and thus, what if sudden=
ly the [sign] you walk by everyday is covered in yarn and becomes [sign2], =
and in its difference and similarities a world of consideration and insight=
 is made available.<br>

<br>i tend to believe the artists and artworks mentioned are involved in re=
contextualizing a situation and thus allow it to be perceived anew, within =
these different dimensions, to question frameworks of knowledge, relation, =
and issues of observation via aesthetic interventions. and the wrappings an=
d presumably the crochet works are seemingly also temporary conditions, at =
least in the sense of outdoor installations. it would seem yarn would quick=
ly deteriorate (though that may be very interesting as well to learn from, =
going from vibrant color to twine-like monotone decay and how meaning shift=
s).<br>

<br>while for Christo and Jeanne-Claude the artworks likely involve massive=
 planning and preparation of fabric, its manufacture, Olek and team do this=
 crocheting onsite, as a collaborative endeavor, involving a social aspect =
that occurs outside the gallery or museum and instead on the street itself,=
 where the artwork is mediated, as it is made.<br>

<br>in other words, Olek and her team presumably have algorithms, code, pro=
grams and routines they use, the various kinds of stitches and patterns, gu=
ided by planning, by which they approach their challenge and transform it v=
ia aesthetic intervention of crochet.<br>

<br>it is as if knitting is an intuitive approach to mathematical, geometri=
cal situations that may function similarly in approximating certain paramet=
ers, as encountered, versus being able to know ahead how many stitches will=
 be required, in that specificity. or so it is imagined. and perhaps like c=
omputer programming, creating software for a task that is encompassed withi=
n a set of concepts and refined in its functionality though perhaps this re=
mains in a realm of code, another layer over what it seeks to describe and =
thus various threads and stitching of information and relations may occur i=
n order to define such a territory and establish such functioning, albeit i=
n a realm of signs that may never be grounded within linear language beyond=
 this representational issue, and thus approximation could be part of this =
process. knowing it versus being unaware.<br>

<br>writing of crochet artworks that cover or create other symbols or signs=
, including people turned into yarn people, has a close connection to data =
representation and the modeling of existence via CAD-like parameters that s=
eek to define real life objects as data entities, if not substitute for the=
m in computational models, simulations, and in algorithms used for processi=
ng (or &quot;machine reasoning&quot;) that can become deterministic worldvi=
ews and rationalizations, to which people must align in their local relatio=
ns, at their jobs, and in schools- a basis for a binary ideology that overt=
akes everything.<br>

<br>there is one instance more than any other i could find that captures th=
is process of data that overtakes the reality, on the instagram site of Ole=
k there is a short video of a small vodka bottle that is slowly captured th=
e code of yarn or ribbon that envelopes it, and yet with a string attached,=
 as if likewise it could be unraveled. Olek has mentioned elsewhere (if mem=
ory serves) that cutting one string of a crocheted work can cause the entir=
e piece to fall apart.<br>

et=3D"_blank">http://instagram.com/p/d21b1rBR54/#</a><br></font><br>[so too=
 i propose a similar condition exists for &#39;reason&#39; when based on a =
faulty and inaccurate modeling of representational data, [signs] that when =
evaluated via logical reasoning fall apart due to errors involved, relied o=

nnected framework and cause it to fail, just as &quot;concepts&quot; wrongl=

 a place of refuge and hiding once revealed can become a trap that cannot b=

ealth lose their advantage. the situation changes, and its their turn to ad=
just to a reality that is beyond them. their code no longer will work. thei=
r security made insecure. unwanted transparency.]<br>

<br>when watching rain fall on a section of concrete sidewalk, going to a d=
ry condition to a series of raindrops dotting its surface, and then eventua=
lly filling in entirely with water saturating its surface, it is to see a p=
rogression take place bit by bit that then overwhelms a previous condition,=
 as if a phase-change. dry to wet. and in this same way the small bottle th=
at is encompassed by this yarn of code is like that of data that is taking =
over the actual bottle as a digital representation, bit by bit of code, unt=
il the program works its way to completion: this is the yarn bottle. this i=
s the data model of the bottle, written in code, used and reference in othe=
r programs as its sign, as if [yarn-bottle minus bottle] =3D [bottle] in th=
e everyday binary analysis. in that the data representation of the bottle i=
s equated with the bottle itself. as if the data statistic is the more real=
 reality than anything existing beyond its onesided and biased framework of=
 evaluation, because that is what binary relativism requires and allows as =
a privileged viewpoint. inside the covering, versus being on the outside. s=
eemingly. the data burka as it were, of civilization as represented digital=
ly.<br>

<br>in taking a series of threads and uniting them in a larger chain of con=
nective stitches and relations, and establishing surfaces and mapping out c=
omplex topologies with these, various edge and surface and pattern and stru=
ctural conditions are encountered and dealt with, and so too, likely variou=
s limits and thresholds and boundaries as it exists within particular appro=
aches and circumstance. real-time calculation that mediates these condition=
s, thinks-through and works-through these conditions and gains knowledge by=
 encounters with repeated features, whether flat or round or spherical or e=
dges, and increases knowledge via new challenges not encountered the same b=
efore.<br>

<br>and so what if code and programming and crypto were similarly involved =
in a situation involving such boundaries, limits, and assumptions mapped on=
to an underlying structure.<br><br>in some sense, it could be assumed the s=
tructure itself is true, and that everything in its being able to cover and=
 represent this situation is accurate, in and of itself, for being able to =
assign functions and define parameters and assign variables in a given situ=
ation, and have a seemingly accurate outcome based on some predictable inpu=
t. and yet what if the very situation that is covered, and the [signs] that=
 reference and rely upon it are themselves held beyond a security audit, fo=
r their own integrity as ideas. such that what is covered may not actually =
be there, in the way it is believed to be, or assumed to be, or said to be,=
 even though it appears this way as an IMAGE. what if it is only on the sur=
face, a threshold condition, and is instead hollow on the inside and has be=
en replaced by a subverted model of events, which instead hide within and b=
ehind this technical development, via the very code meant to prevent and pr=
otect against such subversion. or has that never been the idea within the p=
rogramming itself as idea- and instead of protecting and securing truth- pr=
otecting secrecy and privacy and security which could instead be a realm of=
 harboring lies and grand deceptions.<br>

<br>it is to wonder if the collective programming of technological civiliza=
tion actually audits truth at the level of the [signs] themselves used as i=
deas and for shared awareness or if this is simply believed because it has =
been institutionalized and validated within an ideological framework and th=
us is assumed and presumed &#39;true&#39; by default of its existence in an=
d as code, as programming, as software and hardware, and as cryptographic c=
ommunications that serve- what, exactly? if they are not grounded in truth =
in the ideas that establish the code, how can the program function towards =
this or serve it. if the concepts are ungrounded, how is this loose yarn or=
 security flaw not able to be thoroughly exploited and unravel all security=
 by design of such flaws into every last dual-use item and object. so what =
if it is the world that has been so covered in yarn or wrapped and covered =
in code, and people have put their lives into this, and yet it is not actua=
lly serving them or the human population in its actions and instead default=
s to a realm of exploitation and subversion via its known errors that canno=
t be corrected, and instead it is defended against any such correction.<br>

<br>artistic investigations can offer a glimpse into situations that otherw=
ise may not be readily accessible or realizable within existing limits of p=
articular observation.<br><br>what Olek and her team function as, at least =
in this tentative estimation, is somewhere between the analytical programmi=
ng of Ada Lovelace and the capacity of a customizable crotchet-loom consist=
ing of a human knitting crew (compiler or not, unknown), and that in this p=
ersonal relation with what is to become covered, it is seemingly similar in=
 challenge to the daunting and original challenges a programmer can face wh=
en taking on a new area or developing new skills or approaching new problem=
s beyond previous limit, and thus building a vocabulary and skills and comp=
etence via further such development. and that, over time, massive time and =
effort is put into a project or goals that can transform a situation and mo=
del it within certain parameters, and provide functionality that is new or =
optimized, and that such efforts and accomplishments cover a wide range of =
activity, including from creating basic computing utilities or programming =
languages to internet and telecom software, to content management systems (=
CMS) and other social and retail software, to explorations of data organiza=
tion and computer modeling, and into financial and e-commerce and banking s=
oftware, to include the role of cryptography software and hardware both onl=
ine and offline in a similar context.<br>

<br>and perhaps many people have dealt with endless thread or lines of code=
 that are woven into complicated structures or must investigate convoluted =
software to figure out how something is fit together, and all such investig=
ations occur in a given domain or in a given limit or parameters where the =
code and programming and computation reside, as it aligns with textbooks an=
d classes and conversations and conferences about what exists and what is g=
oing on. that it is occurring within certain frameworks and dimensions. and=
 yet in the same way, as a shared model of computation and data representat=
ion, it is proposed that what is underneath this has not been accounted for=
 accurately and is not lining up with these efforts in a way that works, es=
pecially in terms of security issues and the state, as this becomes detache=
d from truth and in doing so can allow a dictatorship to be hidden within a=
 democracy yet beyond any outside accounting. as it is protected by ideolog=
ical code, beliefs, political agendas, thugs and activists who in turn have=
 control of the surveillance state via this interior difference, =C3=A0 la =
coup.<br>

<br>and thus it is to review the assumption of this data modeling, the way =
the language and perception and observation works, pre-computer, to more ac=
curately account for what is going on within the secrete and hidden technol=
ogical enterprise of the rogue state. and what it indicates is that the [si=
gns] are not mapped accurately or checked against truth beyond a given boun=
dary or limit, which is based nearly entirely on the IMAGE of a thing repla=
cing the thing itself; the image of a bottle replacing the bottle. though t=
he &#39;data image&#39; even moreso. and this in terms of boundary and thre=
shold observation yet also its iconic aspect, that like modular programming=
, it can be assumed to exist as itself by default of its being perceived th=
is way, inside the limited framework, and no external reference is needed, =
nor is it even allowed if contradicting the viewpoint. and that is the ideo=
logical environment that software and hardware are being developed within t=
oday in terms of economic, social, political tools that result in devolved =
and antihuman culture which seeks to stop external feedback from having a v=
oice anymore.<br>

<br>and there are loose strings everywhere. pull one and the false framewor=
ks collapse, when evaluated in terms of paradoxical logic, actual reasoning=
 of events instead of simply real-time processing them, via binary assessme=
nts that can self-contain truth yet only within an increasingly disconnecte=
d bubble, relativism unto itself, falsity.<br>

<br>how can something that brings so much joy and beauty find itself compar=
ed in relation to such a dismal situation. i think it is through seeing the=
 situation through other eyes that perhaps HOPE exists in recognizing what =
is true about this condition and then reorganizing and redeveloping code wi=
thin that shared framework, and that taking into example the transformative=
 power of, instead of functioning from within &quot;the inside&quot; of the=
 situation, whether museum or standards institution, it could instead invol=
ve the gathering of individuals of shared purpose, to accomplish something =
larger that none by themselves could do alone, and taking on the bigger cha=
llenges and projects likewise, with the combined skillsets as part of this =
customizable equipment to call upon.<br>

<br>so for instance, if new approaches to crypto were considered- it would =
not be to gather a group of algorithm-centric thinkers within a confined se=
t of parameters to question what incremental technique may further the exis=
ting broken model and its assumptions, including hardware and software plat=
forms-- instead, the beginning question could and likely should exist beyon=
d this limit, beyond this threshold of ideological viewpoint, and gather to=
gether linguists, artists, thinkers, and those involved in patterns and str=
ucture and logic, physicists and others in addition to cryptologists, to co=
nsider the core ideas of security and secrecy and privacy in the terms they=
 actually exist, before their institutionalization and normalization in the=
 existing corrupt scenario. a computational linguist could have 1,000 appro=
aches to encryption schemes by how they model language in terms of various =
relations, as might a graphic designer, and these could then be related to =
establishing algorithms, not just mathematic structures. an innovative tech=
nologist may understand infrastructures better than others and may know of =
new techniques or possibilities that may others be unconsidered. say electr=
omagnets in a shoe that allows a drop or pickup of electronic data, or leav=
ing a data print as a sign. and certainly this type of prototypical enginee=
ring of intelligence apparatus exists in the deep state, yet what about its=
 application towards everyday scenarios such as house keys or e-commerce po=
rtals on home dwellings, synced with courier services for data updates and =
threshold access. infrastructures, zoned crypto, etc.<br>

<br>and the question here attempts to ask: what if the form that has been c=
overed is not the form that exists anymore. and what if what is actually re=
quired is to locate the ideas that need to be accurately modeled in data, a=
nd that this data representation needs to be secured, as an issue of integr=
ity for systems built upon it, including most vitally, cryptography. and th=
us the issue is securing truth within a realm of lies and unaccountable dec=
eit, and active hostilities against citizens trying to exist within a const=
itutional framework, yet aggressively denied their rights, via abuse and to=
rture and retaliation for the attempts to recover what has been lost. and t=
hat many people exist in this condition, and yet &#39;reason&#39; itself is=
 broken within the state, feedback in terms of citizen representation and c=
ontrol over governance of the shared state, which is out-of-control and fun=
ctioning against the population by default. and until this is accounted for=
, every further action within the false framework further allows its legiti=
mation to continue in this criminal offensive, against the greater truth.<b=
r>

<br>in this way, securing this truth, aligning with it, relying upon it, re=
quiring it to be addressed by relativistic viewpoints and ideology, within =
a shared logical framework- it then becomes a showdown of truth against pow=
er: whether law will be observed or if power will seek to destroy it, as wi=
th most recent dictatorship that have fallen. the data model is wrong, base=
d on lies. a false perspective. the role of leaks, threads that when cut br=
eak the support structure needed to sustain the illusion. yet, when will do=
cuments provide direct evidence of crimes against citizens, mass surveillan=
ce of daily activities, ubiquitous paid informants of a private police stat=
e monitoring other citizens, covert programs to control what occurs in inst=
itutions, organizations and schools that aligns only with certain beliefs a=
nd demographics. will anyone even dare do anything if the documents are rev=
ealed. or is even that too much to expect, that someone may risk their life=
 for the larger issues involved and take a stand against tyranny. never bef=
ore has a nation been more full of hypocrites than the USA today. when are =
people going to take on the fight and take the necessary risks to change th=
e underlying dynamics and shift the situation to a more realistic framework=
 that piece by piece can be configured and established in a common model, a=
nd programmed likewise, to an agenda which serves people and traps the trai=
tors within their deception, isolating and separating and constricting thei=
r actions until there are no longer any moves left.<br>

<br>it saddens my heart because the artwork here is tremendous and full of =
life, yet exists in contrast to the world as if aberration, a beautiful exo=
tic flower in a civilization brought to ruin, a reminder of what living is =
about, its potential, the true potential of the artist, of individuals with=
 insight who strive to use their talents to shared their observations, and =
improve awareness of what exists as it exists, and beyond, into what could =
be, as a basis for consciousness, relation, value. grounding of belief. of =
action. the role of inspiration and play, the fantastical, of boundary brea=
king and paradigm shifting realization and revelations. even through someth=
ing so humble and seemingly so commonplace as yarn, to see through the imag=
ination of other its potential =C2=A0and perhaps consider other observation=
s anew, based on the truth it helps reveal.<br>

<br>in itself this is insufficient for evaluating the depth of any of the a=
rtworks above. especially so for the magic that is Olek, because interpreta=
tion of her work as code or programming or involving boundaries may not be =
accurate other than a correlation with the dynamics involved... another int=
erpretation of which there are many, likely many more suitable to this cons=
ideration than my limited awareness allows. yet consider the power of artwo=
rk that can bring into consideration these questions and that aligns in suc=
h a way to offer a conceptualization of the existing situation within compu=
tational modeling of civilization in accurate and inaccurate terms. it does=
 not exist the same within textbooks of the involved disciplines-- though i=
t does exists outside them in the realm of the interdisciplinary. =C2=A0the=
 real grounded value of critical theory and literature of the Two Cultures,=
 the electromagnetic reconnection across the short-circuited institutional =
and ideological divide, to balance knowledge via the empirical modeling of =
truth (1:1) and shared observation around common, structurally related even=
ts. addressing this situation is entirely possible, if dealing with it head=
-on.<br>
