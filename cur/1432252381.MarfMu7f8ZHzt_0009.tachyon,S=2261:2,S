I am not sure these two were murdered as saddam's sons (although obviously
they were, and were no doubt given priority over equally worthy targets)
but as authority figures in the former government. That they were also (if
they could be captured) bloody useful hostages against actions by their
father probably didn't go without notice either.
However, if strafeing an occupied house with helecopter gunships, rocket
launchers and heavy machine guns after a cursory "surrender or die" is
ignored, based on military intel (which as the WMD fiasco shows is
worthless if the PR spin department are demanding raw access to unfiltered
intel and filtering, not on reliability but on closeness of match to the
desired outcome) is to be the new standard, I suspect a suicide bombing of
the white house (killing all the staff and the shrub) would now be "ok"
provided they shouted 'surrender or die' first, yes?
