I think we need more hidden services to make the darknet more attractive,
less exits. The open Internet has been dead for a while, time to accept it.

Running a non-exit relay from home is still worthwhile, since it raises the 
bar for physical access, and also increases the traffic background.

Decentral search is pretty important, we could really use lots of
YaCy nodes as hidden services -- indexing not just the hidden web, of
course.

I wish there was a library of different privacy-based appliances in
virtual formats (.ovf) which are kept up to date for easy deployment
(even though running it on bare iron would be preferable). That would
seem to be a lot of work, though, and run into trust issues.
