I'm primarially looking at author/developer interactions.  However, all
actors are considered.

Distributors are concerned with licensing -- this is generally the
exposure point for commercial liability, and high-profile distributors
will have an aversion to novel or obscure licenses.  To this extent,
licensing is somewhat like cryptography:  well established, well
understood licenses which have stood the test of time, are considered
lower risk.  Again, corporate licenses tend to speak to ghosts in the
corporate closet (IBM:  Patents, Sun:  compatibility and standards
control, Corel:  Canadian law).

Another advantage of selecting a widely use license is that it aquires a
strong institutional resistence to sudden change.  In the DJB instance
cited previously, and the IPFilters licensing "revision" which also
effected OpenBSD, licenses which were authored at the sole discretion of
a single user were unilateraly modified, or had their interpretation
unilaterally changed, to terms not acceptable for broader use.  This is
less likely where a broader constuency is represented.  The authorship /
revision issue is one I've put some thought to, there are a few possible
solutions.

Free software largely precludes significant revenue streams from
software sales.  Not always -- Red Hat continues to generate significant
revenues from box and corporate sales, though it is moving to a
subscription (Red Carpet) and services model.  Still, in large part,
your benefit is going to come from indirect revenues:  services,
hardware, publications (e.g.: O'Reilly).   Eric Raymond's list from CatB
still largely stands.

In this case, appeal to developers is *quite* significant, as this
distributes your cost structure effectively to unaffiliated partners.
This particular lesson is one that a large number of free software
businesses (including the one I was affiliated with for 18 months) fail
to grasp.  There's little specific benefit in direct control of code.
IBM, incidentally, is a company that Seems To Get It(tm).

Users, similarly, should be concerned with long term viability of code.
A project with a single sponsor, and one with troubling financial
prospects to boot, doesn't gain much credibility despite their "free
software" status.  Licensing compatibility emphasizes the inherent "code
escrow" powers of free software licensing by providing the possibility
that the compelling features of the project might be continued, or at
least incorporated into another project, should the initial sponsor
fail.

Which is served by a mix of factors, significant among them, license
compatibility.

No.  Software itself competes on a different level.  It's influenced by
the licensing, but isn't fully dictated by this.  Poor license choice
can severly hamper adoption, development, use, and credibility.

There are a good four or five well established "shoes" (GPL, LGPL,
BSD/MIT, Mozilla, IBM PSL) which serve a broad range of needs, with a
pretty good track record for interoperability.

But that's just one idiot to another.

Peace.
