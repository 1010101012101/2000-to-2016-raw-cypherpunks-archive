Microsoft did release a patch for this, which can be found here:

http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/security/bulletin/ms99-032.asp

When I view his message on my patched machine, Windows pops up a
'You crazy?' dialogue box as the script starts to run.

OTOH, Microsoft can't be trusted too far, so please let me know
if I am sending out a snippet of evil code with this message. :)
