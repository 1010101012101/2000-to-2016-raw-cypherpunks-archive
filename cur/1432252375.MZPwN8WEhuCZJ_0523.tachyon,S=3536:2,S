Bush asks Freeh to stay at FBI, USA Today says

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The incoming Bush administration has asked FBI Director Louis Freeh to remain on the job, USA Today reported Thursday, citing officials close to the situation. 

Freeh has told Federal Bureau of Investigation employees in an internal memo last month that he intends to complete his 10-year term that expires in 2003 and cannot be extended, USA Today said. 

Freeh declined to comment Wednesday, as did Bush transition officials, the newspaper said. 

Although he is an appointee of President Clinton, Freeh clashed with the president over questions about the transfer of FBI files to the White House. 

He also has differed with Attorney General Janet Reno's decision against launching an independent investigation of campaign finance irregularities involving Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
