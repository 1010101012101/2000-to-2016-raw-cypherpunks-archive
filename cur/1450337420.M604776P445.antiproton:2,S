Man To Jump From Stratosphere With No Spacesuit
Press Releases
December 16, 16:05 UTC+3
Unless the World Votes To Save Him, He Faces Certain Death

LONDON, Dec. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/. Death Challenge, Inc., a new
business venture that practices commercially sustainable philanthropy,
announced today the official date of the most spectacular and perilous
event ever to be broadcast live. Death Challenge 1, The Death Dive
(http://DeathChallenge.com) will take place on Good Friday, March
25th, 2016, in the same week as World Water Day.

At 3.33pm Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), "The Challenger", who will remain
anonymous and masked, will risk his life by jumping out of a jet from
the stratosphere, 9.53 miles (15.3 km) above the Earth, and diving
50,300 feet with NO spacesuit, NO pressure suit, NO oxygen and NO
parachute into shark-filled waters – all in a bid to STOP Death by
Dirty Water. (http://DeathbyDirtyWater.org).

"This is a cause close to The Challenger's heart,"
(http://DeathChallenger.com) says company spokesperson, Aideen
Doherty. "Having spent extensive time in the areas of the world most
affected by waterborne diseases, he has witnessed firsthand the
dramatic effects of this solvable problem. The Challenger also
suffered from a near-fatal illness after drinking dirty water during
his travels. Nearly 2 million children die annually from dirty water;
therefore, in order to bring an end to this crisis, The Challenger is
willing to risk his own life."

An event without parallel or precedent, the Death Dive will be
streamed live to a global pay-per-view audience, all of whom will be
able to vote whether or not to "Save The Challenger" by offering
lifelines. Both the online audience and those at the dive site itself
can purchase votes before and during The Challenger's historic leap of
faith, saying "YES" or "NO" to three possible lifelines. Crucially, no
lifelines will be accepted by The Challenger unless one billion votes
are purchased globally, symbolic of the approximate number of people
not having access to the most basic ingredient of life – clean water.

In Lifeline One (active at 25,000ft–20,000ft), a circling aircraft
will toss out a parachute which The Challenger will try to chase down
and put on under near-impossible conditions. In Lifeline Two (active
at 20,000ft–15,000ft), a rescue skydiver will pursue the exhausted and
oxygen-deprived Challenger in an attempt to complete the first-ever
mid-air hook up without any safety equipment. In Lifeline Three
(active at 15,000ft–7,000ft), an aircraft will release a tow rope,
which The Challenger will try to grab and use to skysurf into the
water. If The Challenger misjudges the skytow, he could collide with
the aircraft or take out its wing or tail controls. If The Challenger
blacks out upon exiting the jet, there is an additional option to
release a rescue team to provide him with oxygen. However, this
lifeline will only be activated if 7.125 billion votes are first
secured – the equivalent of the entire human race voting to save one
man and all the people of the world without access to clean water.

Other ways to contribute to the global success of Death Challenge
(http://savethechallenger.com) include pay-per-view tickets to watch
online, VIP tickets to watch the event from an aircraft or boat at the
dive site – or underwater with sharks at the point of impact – and a
special option to purchase a ride to the Stratosphere with The
Challenger.

"The risks of the jump are more than monumental," says company
spokesperson, Aideen Doherty. "As he jumps, The Challenger will face
insanely low air pressure, freezing temperatures and oxygen
starvation, all which can lead to imminent death."

The Challenger is one of the world's most experienced extreme
athletes, having completed just under 20,000 skydives, more than 5,000
high dives and thousands of hours of cage-free dives with Great White
sharks over the past 30 years. He will use multiple extreme
disciplines in an attempt to survive a dive more than 260 times higher
than the current world record – approaching twice the height of Mount
Everest.

The Challenger is the first to risk his life in The Death Challenge.
Death Challenge 1, The Death Dive, is a Category 10 event, deemed by
experts to offer zero chance of survival. Death Challenge 1 will also
feature and be supported by musical entertainment from new and
well-known artists. Death Challenge will continue to showcase extreme
athletes in high-risk events to raise the awareness of and bolster
Death Challenge's philanthropic efforts to end many of the world's
worst social, economic, and humanitarian problems.

Death Challenge Inc., Death Challenge Foundation and The Death Dive
will be audited and verified by an international accounting firm. For

end to Death by Dirty Water, please visit:
