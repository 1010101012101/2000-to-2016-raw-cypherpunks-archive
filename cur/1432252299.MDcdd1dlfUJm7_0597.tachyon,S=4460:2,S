Namecoin is another currency, based from bitcoin code. But like many
crypto things, when you take a "black box" and little modify it, the
conseguences could be a complete disaster.
Namecoin is flawed and *NOBODY* should consider it anymore. From [1]:

0. Coins are destroyed
1. NetworkFee descreasing for 50 to zero and will be zero in ~80000
block and has no feedback with network activity like difficulty has.
2. Namecoin was designed for free domains and this is its future
3. Developers have to do system intrusion from time to time to avoid
collapse or spam hell

DIANNA try to use existing bitcoin chain's (as satoshi explained) to do
the same thing, but they are designing it carefully. Help them if you
can.
