He won't be put in front of the ICC as the US never signed on to it. So 
this one is out.

That leaves either an American Tribunal or an Iraqi one. In either case 
they should adhere to US procedures as they are based on them.

See above. Because of the possiblity that either Rumsfled & friends 
might end up in front of the ICC they never signed off on it.
