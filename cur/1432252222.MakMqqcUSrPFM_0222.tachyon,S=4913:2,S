About Liquidnet :: Senior Management :: Board of Directors :: Liquidnet Europe


Liquidnet is successfully redefining institutional trading.

Launched in April 2001, Liquidnet was built exclusively for institutional
trading. After only three years, we are now ranked as one of the top 14
largest NYSE institutional brokers and the 15th largest NASDAQ broker*
respectively. The Liquidnet global community has grown to represent more
than $6.8 trillion in equity assets under management.

Liquidnet's unique model brings natural buyers and sellers together and
enables them to anonymously negotiate trades among each other, without
intermediaries or information leaks. Liquidnet's institutional Members
trade large blocks of small-, mid- and large-cap stocks easily, efficiently
and with little to no market impact costs. The result is the
industry-leading average execution size of more than 42,000 shares since
inception, with 50% of all executions done at the mid-point and 92% done
within the spread.

 Liquidnet, Inc. is a registered broker/dealer, headquartered in New York
City. Liquidnet Europe Limited is regulated by the Financial Services
Authority and is headquartered in London.
