$TART YOUR OWN BU$INE$$
RIGHT FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME
Have you ever dreamed of what it would be like to have your 
own business. To work for yourself, with NO boss!
5 years ago I was working 12 hrs. a day, 6 days a week barely
making a living. Now, I’m working from the comfort of my 
home earning 10 times the income.
HOW CAN YOU ?
Paul Zane Pilzer, leading economist, author and entrepreneur 
has a
100% success record for predicting the hottest trends. He says
“The next TRILLION dollar industry is wellness”. That’s 
right, wellness and prevention. The wellness industry is 
growing at a staggering 100 million dollars a month! With the 
high cost of pharmaceutical drugs and their massively toxic 
side effects, millions of people are turning to alternative 
means. This is called aWAVE.
Now for the first time ever you have the opportunity to be in
business with the # 1 wellness authority in the world, Dr. Earl
Mindell. Dr. Mindell’s number one best selling book, The 
Vitamin Bible alone sold eleven million copies. Doc Mindell 
was just recently featured on the # 1 morning show in 
America, “ Live with Regis”.
