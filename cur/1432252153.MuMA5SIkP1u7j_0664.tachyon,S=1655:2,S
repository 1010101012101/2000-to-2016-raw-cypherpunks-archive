  LAS VEGAS -- A federal lawsuit to ban a book that promotes income-tax 
evasion is generating debate on the 1st Amendment's guarantee of free 
speech.

At issue is the conduct encouraged in the book "The Federal Mafia: How 
the Government Illegally Imposes and Unlawfully Collects Income Taxes" 
and Internal Revenue Service laws that prohibit advising the filing of 
false tax returns.
