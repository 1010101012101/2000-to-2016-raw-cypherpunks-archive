You would be surprised how many *men* have to deal
with crazy battering women and need to seek refuge
in shelters and safe supportive halfway houses for men.

Either way, all such people who are innocent enjoy the
right for the government and commerce not to impede upon
their right to privacy, including shielding their innocent selves
from warrantless govt and commercial tracking and datakeeping.
Stop giving away your rights and taking those of other innocents.
For it is not the criminal they are after, but control over you.
