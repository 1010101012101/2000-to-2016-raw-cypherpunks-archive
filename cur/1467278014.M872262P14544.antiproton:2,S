Whether this is objectively true or not, what good comes out of this
nationalistic manner? Every nation on earth tend to see their cultural
qualities, superior to other nations. This may look naive at a first
glance, but it leads to chauvinism and rivalry. I used to think the best
thing about russian culture (not that i know it very well) was that it
managed to beat the nationalism and elitism at least once in its history,
leading to internationalist practices. Now you counteract it...
