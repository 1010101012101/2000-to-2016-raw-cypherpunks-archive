I see that Greg Broiles has already made the main points, that 
lawsuits must hinge on a "matter of law." It is not enough that 
someone feels aggrieved--there must be some element of criminality 
involved. Hence my example of the bookstore owner who feels 
"aggrieved" that another bookstores hurt his business: there is no 
basis for a lawsuit, and a competent judge will quickly throw the 
case out.

Many people feel aggrieved, for many and diverse reasons.

Courtrooms are not the answer for about 99% of these cases.

I'm not bothering with the rest of your post.

I don't know if you were, or are, a competent "computer condotterie" 
or whatever it is you say you are, but I'd say you ought to stick to 
that. You don't have a good intuition for how the law works.
