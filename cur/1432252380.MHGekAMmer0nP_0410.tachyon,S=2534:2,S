  The web boards (forums) like phpNuke, et al, are not nearly as useful as
listservs. The problem is that you have to go there. So, for instance, for the
lists I admin, if someone puts out an announcement of an upcoming event, and
people don't think to go look at the forum for awhile, they get the annoucement
too late. Not a good thing. 
   Another serious problem with them is that if you don't go there for awhile,
the messages pile up, if it's a fairly active list, and become overwhelming. The
tendency is then to just skip them. You also can't filter out the people you
don't like -- a real drag. 
    As for the lne.com blocks on "spammers", that bit me too. When my dsl line
ip changes, sometimes I can post to lne, sometimes I can't. So I just subscribe
to lne to get the spam free postings, and then post to minder.net.
