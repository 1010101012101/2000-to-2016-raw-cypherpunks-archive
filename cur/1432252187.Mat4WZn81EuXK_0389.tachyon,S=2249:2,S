Where are the endless flamewars?

In fact, though Matt Beland has complained that the libertarians have 
driven off all the good posters, I found that he has written virtually 
no posts himself, until the last few days. When he added his criticism 
of libertarians, I did not recognize his name, so I looked for past 
articles he has written: a few in 2001 and a few in 2002.

If he and others like him want more content, they ought to be writing 
it.
