when the first fingerprint scanners (attached to keyboards) appeared on
the CEBIT (europe's COMDEX or whatever other #1 computer tech event you
have) I asked someone at the booth if they included anything in the
device to protect it against the most basic tampering processes (like
sniffing on the cable and then reproducing the "yeah, he's clear" signal
later). the answer was an astonished look.

there's too many people out there who put $500 locks on glass doors.
