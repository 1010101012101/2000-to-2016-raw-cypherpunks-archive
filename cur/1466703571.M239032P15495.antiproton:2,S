	Virtually none of the posts were off-topic. They were all about
	tor, and as far as I was concerned tor's failure and
	misrepresentations.

	So, cut the 'off topic' fake excuse please.

	OK. That sounds like sarcasm because if that's not sarcasm you
	get the world prize in crazyness.

	Again either that's sarcasm, or I'm - almost - speechless.

	You are starting to sound like a really crazy piece of shit...

	Yep. You are even way more crazy and despicable than your
	employeers. 

	What the fuck are you doing in a cypherpunk mailing list, apart
	from trolling and spying?
