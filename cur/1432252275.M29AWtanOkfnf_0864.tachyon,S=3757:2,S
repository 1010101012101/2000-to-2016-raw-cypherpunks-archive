Not really. It's still fully legal in these United States to say that 
"Senator Blowhardt needs killing."

I believe there are specifics about the President and his Immediate 
Family which do not allow one to say the same with equal candidness.

I'm not saying that saying Senator Blowhardt needs killing won't get 
some kind of Official Attention, just that there are no laws banning 
such expressions of opinion.

The lawyers and lawyer larvae can comment on what it takes for such 
speech acts to cross the "bright line" (or whatever the offical 
lawspeak is) for such an expression of opinion to become illegal.
