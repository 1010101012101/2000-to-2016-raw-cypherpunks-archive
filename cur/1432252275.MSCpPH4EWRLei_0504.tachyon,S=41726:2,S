== note on crypto ==

wondering if a distinction could be made in the realm of cryptology as
with other disciplines whereby there is an existing functionality and
then an edge condition of developing ideas where intuitions may be
pursued, tested, learned from.

i see people in various disciplines working on 'ideas' as part of
their work, whereas the same tasks can be pursued in purely
functional, managerial terms likewise, perhaps involving an existing
mode of operation versus evaluating various parameters or potential
paradigms.

in some sense then, as with art, there are artists who have skills and
can develop their work within a given set of parameters, and others
who may be more abstract and involved in this abstraction at the level
of ideas, questioning of existing presumptions. i relate this
condition and pursuit to 'conceptual art', rightly and-or wrongly,
having only an intuitive understanding of what it involves versus art
historical accounts of what it means and how it is identified.

then, so too with music. there are some who perform and develop music
within traditional or known parameters, and others who test or
question the limits though also in a deep realm of ideas. and this
tends towards 'conceptual music' in my sensibility, because more is
involved than what may be discerned from the aesthetics and it may
take more to understand it as it may operate in different parameters
than what is already known, and may need evaluation within a different
sensibility to access what it involves, which may center on grounding
of ideas or conceptions beyond a given interpretation, model, or limit
in standard approaches.

this then relating also to the rich realm of conceptual architecture,
typology seemingly having a unique role in this (ex. architects
Boullée and Ledoux from the enlightenment era when studying ruins and
the discipline of archaeology began, if remembering correctly, moving
into another realm perhaps tending towards the surreal compared to
existing approaches)...

Boullée

https://www.google.com/search?q=Boull%C3%A9e&client=firefox-a&hs=KOV&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=rcs&source=lnms&tbm=isch

Ledoux
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Nicolas_Ledoux
https://www.google.com/search?q=ledoux+architect&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&source=lnms&tbm=isch

(note: relation of Cenotaph for Newton and nuclear reactor, containing
fission of sun inside building type, significance for evaluating
landscape, environment, meaning, symbolism)

it is as if 'ideas' and their contemplation was more readily at the
center of questioning, the basis for what is developed, less so than
unquestioned conventions repeated as patterns. and this continued as a
major approach, including Le Corbusier and others, within certain
parameters, though a 'high conceptualization' can be involved in an
activity that in the griops of other practitioners is merely a
functional question that has already proscribed solutions that can be
uniquely or methodically rearranged though perhaps not fundamentally
questioned. so in some sense the fundamentals or basis or foundational
and its basics are secured and relied upon or brought into question
and further tested, experimented with, refined, or moved beyond
perhaps in particular circumstances as a model or approach.

this conceptualization continued into the 1960s (such as Archigram)
into the 1980s though its purpose seemed to be made profane, focused
on the image as a basis for abstraction, and the deeper questions of
architecture ignored for a shallow aesthetic approach that can be
hollow or ungrounded from 'reality' in some significant sense,
detached from issues and people and of a realm of CAD design, as if
architecture is only industrial design, creating pleasing objects or
sculpture devoid of economic, social, political, cultural issues it
involves, its deep meaning and insight, and instead, developing
blindness. this is more anti-architecture, the concept is not about
ideas but about extending an ideology of a particular warped value
system, and so the image is like an illusion of what actual
architecture is, in its greater purpose and mission. not trivial, not
just manufacturing buildings or 'culture' as if a fashion item to be
copied, reproduced as a trend or style, yet that is what it has
devolved to in tersm of its 'ideas', in many or most cases- if just on
its detachment from understanding nature itself and people and serving
these interests instead of designing building as part of a
political-economic flow that aestheticizes an existing and harmful way
of life, yet makes it as enticing as possible. (in this way the
excellent observation of such 'architecture' as pornographic forms, as
introduced by Dr. Elisabeth von Samsonow in The Plasticity of the Real
video lecture.)

i tend to consider this earlier intersection between archeology and
architecture vital for understanding both disciplines in their
interrelated depth, bridging past and future, and asking questions
again in a different context than just a present mode of operation.
thus to question and learn from ruins or evaluate a situation in a
larger context than it may otherwise have due to convention. and it
appears a lot is lost to narrowed conception of processes and existing
functioning that may limit potentials for insight and innovation
beyond the existing boundaries, again due to convention if not
conforming to rules or patterns or models that may already work in the
given constraints or parameters- though these too also change and
transform over time, yet the 'ideas' attached to them do not, and
often approaches can become fixed ideas or conceptions, as if the
world does not change becomes a routine is continued the same, even
while everything is shifting underneath yet may be unrecognized in a
given approach or even denied, to retain a way of doing things and
thinking, beliefs, etc.

so, a potential exists and perhaps it is like basic research of
architecture or a given discipline, where it may not be ready to be
applied or may question fundamental assumptions and this is purposeful
and can be extraordinarily beneficial if it cracks open the
malmodeling that may become standardized as approach, and allow other
development to occur by falsifying given notions or providing
alternative paths or techniques. and yet also, infrastructure can
exist that forbids this from occurring, that limits any such
conceptions, or confines questioning to what amounts to only small
tweaks in the functional circuitry because it is a situation that is
nearly completely controlled and there is little room within for
fundamental changes and an entire system would need to be rebuilt from
scratch to replace what exists, otherwise. and there are dreamers who
do this, and architects who focus on utopia. or modeling of cities.

Frank Lloyd Wright (FLlW) had his vision for the development of the US
which was based on a different approach to city planning,
democratizing it via planning principles if not mistaken, though part
of this was developing a low-cost affordable home (if not made of
concrete), the USonian home, a unit or component in the larger
integrated plan of massive development. Le Corbusier had skyscrapers
and green spaces as part of the Ville Radieuse (my memory is gone
though approximating a general sketch of approaches) and both these
efforts were based on social goals, what architecture and master
planning can effect via focused development. and Arcosanti by Paolo
Soleri is yet another example, building a prototype community with new
building techniques as part of a larger vision that is potentially
counterpoint to the existing approach, and that there is a tradition
of this questioning of existing development patterns and yet it is
also fraught with issues in the realm of ideas as relativism bounds
such inquiry.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usonia
http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Artifact%20Pages/PhRtUsonAuto.htm
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ville_Radieuse
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcosanti

for accuracy it should be noted that this innovation in thinking has
basically evaporated from the practice of architecture, it is
completely without support as a research endeavor in the given model
of education and development, as if the technical approach + aesthetic
fashion is the peak sum of its content as fixed-idea, though it is
more a purification of given ideology intimately tied to existing
warped economic, social, political agendas evidenced as "culture" that
is antihuman, against nature, against thought, essentially
anti-architecture as it exists.

so the conceptual potential of architecture, the critical questioning
of assumptions can be lost or drown out by other priorities or values,
superseded by a particular view or agenda that in turn limits what can
be pursued in that domain, as it becomes normalized, made a shared
worlview, institutionalized. yet likewise, detached from fundamentals
edited or censored out of existence given the tyranny of convention or
otherwise, e.g. deceptive motivations.

and so at the edge of development, there could be little blood
occurring because there is no real-stake involved at this leading or
front position. it could be somewhat mundane or basic or commonplace,
detached from significance or risk, and more about continuing to
extend a particular approach than testing, questioning, learning and
pivoting into other unknown or newly discovered realms via discovery,
innovation, invention, failure even and falsfication of beliefs and
approaches. defeat of ideology. instead- there are no ideas,
potentially. just the same old beliefs repeated ad naseum yet without
questioning them again and again, thus to assume their rightness or
correctness through their repetition, no more integrity than that.
thus mediocrity as a type of security even, doing what has been done
as a validation process or confirmation of value, matching a pattern
as pattern and not its truth it must represent. and thus the
detachment, the moving away from what is vital, developing in the
wrong ways and directions towards a false viewpoint and framework, if
not at odds with what is needed. and this all occurs automatically-
especially in peoples minds and thinking, psychologies and relations,
as individuals and groups then combine into organizations, continuing
such efforts.

conceptual architecture is then about ideas. thinking through
architecture, architecture as a model, a medium for ideas. for
communication and relation. the importance of language in all the
above examples, and its fundamental relation to geometry (art, music,
architecture). and this fundamental consideration also involving a
kind of philosophical approach to the questioning, in terms of
research, the basics, fundamentals, foundation of disciplines and
beliefs, techniques approaches actions, methodology. questioning,
debate, discussion, the role of basic research in development, its
application over time via refinement, testing of hypotheses and
improvement of models and approaches. it is not just engineering
alone.

and it also involves a larger domain than just a detail, so while
research into concrete may always be ongoing, that concrete sidewalk
technology around for thousands of years since Roman times, the heated
sidewalk or improved wear or illumination or concrete via other
additives to the mixture is not in itself a larger modeling of the
depth and breadth of the question of architecture beyond that narrowed
realm- though can be incorporated into it as a vital detail, and so
definitely is related, though a part of a larger research enterprise,
a larger more encompassing and ecosystem view, where each detail has
its value and importance and insight, yet in the realm of ideas, 'big
ideas' need to occur to frame the big situations, and to limit these
to finite or specific details then bounds what can occur.  it is
equivalent to saying we can build skyscrapers to look like furniture
and if that is all it involves, a vast many other potential realms of
questioning or consideration can be lost in the process as it is
defined and conceived, in terms of what is and is not considered, put
on the table in terms of questioning. for most the skyscraper itself
as a building type has become a default solution, so too the high rise
city as a defacto approach to eco/soc/pol development, yet it is
fraught with vast many problems and creates and solidifies certain
patterns that are ineffective, inefficient, though believed the
correct way because that is the standard, the way things are done
today and how wealth or success has been generated. it is an engine,
in other words, that provides momentum to many industries and
questioning it as foundation could even be heretical. and thus if
questioning is removed, everything works just like a machine. yet a
machinery that is functioning against life, the earth, people,
economics, society, and other dimensions if a true accounting were to
take place beyond the controlled viewpoint that secures this approach.

conceptual architecture potentially could delve into these areas, yet
without support or even vital influence upon these processes, either
for being unrealistic or uneconomical or without existing capacity,
technology, or other limitations that restrict alternatives from
developing. again- the lack of research and its replacement by a
default 'ideology' the indicator that the process is determined by an
existing agenda that does not want to be fundamentally questioned in
its rightness, correctness as method, practice, income-generating
structuring.

and yet an amazing discipline such as architecture can then lose its
soul, its essence, its insight and become shallow, ungrounded from
reality, and force disconnection through its development which then is
no longer actual or real architecture and instead something else, a
substitute process that stands-in for it as mimic, yet operating
within different principles that confine questioning to a narrow range
of consideration that basically destroys it, the ideas turning to
answered questions, architecture turned against itself, becoming only
a question of engineering, the art of construction being about
decorative buildings instead. though no deep insight into the human
condition beyond an archaeological condition where these forms can be
evaluated, analyzed, as they map to social, political, economic
issues, versus serving people as part of a heightened moral and
ethical obligation, service to culture and its development, not
turning away from it for money or just another career, etc. and thus
'the ideas' of architecture are nowhere to be found within the field
as it exists today, they are instead censored out of it by default of
the existing securing of ideology within institutions as this then is
the basis for further development within constrained parameters of
"design" that has more in common with the particularities of fashion
than wide-ranging investigation into questions and understanding and
development of culture in its highest manifestation, to include the
role of technology and its coherent and innovative integration within
built form, which instead becomes a manufacturers and industry
consideration: "smart homes", etc. this versus master planning of
civilization across all of its dimensions in a cohesive clear vision.

this as context for cryptography, in that there may be a standard
approach via public-key or other security systems in place that have
become normalized, made routine as processes and that assumptions may
readily exist as 'solutions' that remain bounded in given
considerations while there could be more going on beyond the existing
framework or limits of these same systems in practice, when evaluated
in terms of basic research, tweaked or tested or broken, and this
appears part of a vital process of improving and securing
cryptographic systems even. that a basic RD&D process exists already,
though to still question- within what parameters and is it possible
that the existing modeling is based on fundamental assumptions that
could in some way be limited or narrowed and a larger inquiry is
restricted because of these beliefs that become 'assumed truths' via
their restricted boundaries,  as if knowns or certainties due to
history or precedent yet these not brought back into questioning again
(reinterpreting of previous models, as if archeological ruins even,
where new insights may still be available or other approaches
discovered through their reevaluation and testing of assumptions).

it is to question if there may be a distinction made between
cryptography that is operational and active, that exists as an
infrastructure and working system (however rube-goldberg the issues of
implementation, chaos of variability as it connects with
secured/insecure modes), and what may be a more research-oriented
approach, not just into mathematical approaches to cryptographic
modules, and instead potentially further into the most basic realm of
crypto questioning, perhaps at the level of signs & symbols (language)
and how operations function (geometry) instead of an algorithm that is
operational as software approach or methodology, within a given or
existing set of parameters or assumptions that may be relied upon yet
also may be limited or even false in certain instances or deny other
approaches from occurring.

in other words, it is to wonder if there is a realm of 'conceptual
cryptology' that may already exist and yet not be defined or
understood this way, or 'conceptual cryptography' in a more particular
realm whereby these core questions of cryptographic models could be
pursued in their depth- or does the existing institutionalization of
these "ideas" restrict these inquiries due to a forced perspective of
ideology, a particular value system that relates to economic, social,
political pressures that retain a given approach for the good of
institutional control or manufacturing or to keep validating the
static conception, even as it may deteriorate within its 'ideas' made
static, assumed true by their repetition and continual access,
matching the sign equals sign as confirmation of correctness, versus
grounding in this greater depth of inquiry and realm of potential and
perpetual insight, when going back to the source and evaluating the
situation with fresh eyes and minds, in the dimensions that exist,
which could be far more than is modeled or believed or allowed in
existing approaches or functioning.

as with archaeology and architecture, it is to question if
cryptography may have a unique in situ condition at this intersection
of language and geometry, that currently may exist outside its
conceptualization in terms of practice, as crypto is developed
systematically, as it is made into infrastructure via technology,
manufacturing, and extension of these. and here, of the danger of
ideology, answered questions that move towards further falsity, as if
unconscious, when questioning of 'ideas' becomes detached from action
and through further development becomes ever more disconnected from a
fundamental condition of truth than in service to it. and what if this
integrity, securing this foundation of cryptography in truth is
requirement for security, yet given existing parameters could be
ignored in its philosophical dimensions that predate, inform, and give
life to the discipline, yet may not be valued or identified or related
to this way, as it becomes institutionalized or supported, made into
systematic development.

is there such an entity as 'conceptual cryptography' and where does it
begin and end. how might it be different than a primarily engineering
based approach or evalaution or crypto. to what extent is it supported
and operational as inquiry, yet what parameters or domain does it
occupy, including in past times and efforts that map out this
relation, its core questioning. could it today function in non-crypto
domains yet influence crypto development, etc. and thus questions of
the universality and connectedness of patterns, their permutations and
relations, potential interdisciplinary relevance as language and
geometry across mediums.

(if not involving inquiries and in-depth research at the junction and
structural intersection of linguistics and mathematics, and a
wider-range of potential communication strategies.)

== re: Amazon LCD tablet ==

i grew up studying those giant shopping catalogs for Sears and JC
Penneys stores that had inventories of everything in stores and that
could be mail ordered. they were seemingly hundreds of pages thick,
consumer bibles of specific national retailer chains in the U.S. and
for those without encyclopedia, did offer an interesting look into the
development of digital watches as they took over analog, calculators,
early computing, electronic and video games, and then 'electrics'
spanning tools to housewares, various large and small appliances.

when the Amazon Kindle lineup went from e-ink only into a
mixed-category of LCD screens it seems to blur the distinction in
purpose between the e-reader devices and more ordinary tablets that
compete with others, in particular ecosystem-based devices from Apple.

my initial thought was that there were two different categories
occupying a single name of "Kindle" and that they were functionally
very different devices with different purposes.

while it is understood that 'tablets' are a category unto themselves
and need no further justification for existence in an online retail or
software/app model, it struck me as strange that there was not
something more conceptual going on with the Amazon HD Fire devices,
beyond ordinary tablet functionality, at least from what reviews
mention about it in terms of user experience and how it streamlines
access to Amazon services through the tablet UI.

one thought has stuck with me about the potential for this
tablet-Amazon ecosystem relation and it is that this device now
competes with others in a general 'multimedia' tablet category, yet
its real and potential advantage in terms of apps or whatever is its
unique connection to Amazon inventory, which spans multimedia in an
intranet sort of way, perhaps as if portal.

from here, at this location, in this particular and unique context of
relation between those who access Amazon through such a tablet
interface, it would appear the killer functionality of such an LCD
tablet would be to provide 'catalog-like functionality' in the style
of earlier paper-based approaches, such as the Sears Catalog and
others, though perhaps beyond just existing approaches determined by
web interfaces and into a higher degree of functionality, such that
the tablet actually is the Amazon Catalog in electronic format, in
particular- mail-order format whereby, say, ala Whole Earth Catalog or
Hammacher Schlemmer, you could potentially order anything that Amazon
lines up into its supply-chain, even if for a one-time sale, via such
a massively connected inventory and integrated yet distributed
delivery system.

This probably sounds very bad to some peoples ears in terms of the
impact or effects this could have if suddenly Amazon is bidding on
installing pools in the neighborhood, though perhaps it would be
bounded to certain things like European appliances that are imported
or other high-rated, quality based interactions vetted by a
review-system recovered from the troubles of existing feedback
environments internet-wide.

curated merchandize, then, that is presented in deep categories of
content, with additional information (requiring dimensions of items
from manufacturers, etc) and matrix-based searching functions (using
grids and geometry to search instead of only keywords) that then are
the basis for a _new_design of the Amazon interface that standardizes
the interface and user experience with the available inventory,
instead of relying on existing web technologies to define parameters
for what can occur in these interactions, including variable results.

What this is to question is why the Amazon Fire LCD tablet is
competing in a multimedia category as if just another tablet when
instead it could be 'the Amazon Catalog' instead and while able to
deliver movies, music, book content, that ultimately a programmatic
hierarchy could exist that this is a platform for interfacing with and
accessing Amazon inventory firstly, before that secondary utility,
which allows delivery of online data (movies, movies) though also, and
primarily it is assumed: offline 'content' in terms of sales from its
warehouses and third party suppliers, and thus is the basis for
creating, sustaining, and developing this huge momentum in sales, or
having it operate in more conventional terms, competing as another
tablet in a highly competitive space, and perhaps not having this
catalog-functionality as its core mission to the extent that this is
how the tablet is designed, its fundamental purpose and advanced
functionality, versus just an extension of existing web technology
approaches that leverage an excellent e-commerce experience though
remain heavily defined by what is a very low-resolution 'catalog' of
its inventory, when instead there could be more extensive information
about each item, so that people do not need to research missing facts
or data repeatedly and instead it could be presented as advanced specs
(dimensions, materials, warnings; contains lead, requires widget Z),
that combined with expert reviews or more in-depth analysis could
transform the experience into a research-based activity where all of
the necessary data is in the Amazon Catalog, perhaps not the web
version, but the tablet catalog version that acts like an encyclopedia
attached to extended or other content or dimensions.

For instance, if a product attaches to a table, yet no information is
provided for how this connection takes place or how deep or thick the
table must be, the same item could be ordered and then returned if it
does not fit a particular table. And if this information is not
provided for in the reviews, then orders and returns are the 'feedback
process' that is in effect a negative interaction as a total exchange,
inefficient, and time-wasting for everyone when instead that
additional information which could be known to be critical (no less by
the product manufacturer) could be provided as _missing detail in the
current approach, in many cases, with sales across the online retailer
landscape. It could require several google searches of discussion
forums or downloading PDF manuals to get this information if it exists
or a call to the manufacturer, all that stands in the way between
simply evaluating the item and then deciding it will work and clicking
through the sale. Instead this short-circuit of necessary or missing
information could require dozens of clicks and several searches of
discussion groups looking for answers or clues to what may become a
mystery by default.

Consider then the condition whereby there is lack of basic information
in this entire process, encountered with online retailers and
e-commerce in general, not just Amazon of course. It is assumed when
product data went online, that perhaps nothing new was expected of the
items in the way they were modeled as 'data' in terms of their sale.
Yet for instance this same product was in a store in yesteryear, it
could be touched, evaluated as a 3-dimensional item, and if it
attached to a table the mechanism to do this could be evaluated or a
box could be opened by a worker to help evaluate the device to see if
it actually would fit a particular table or not - prior to sale. And
here is point: the information is available for the person in the
store, though when it is sold online this information may be
non-existent online even though it is a very basic consideration for
its practical and successful use in basic scenarios and everyday
conditions. It is unexceptional to ask such questions in an offline
context, yet when this same questioning occurs in a remote
'catalog-context' or 'online retailer' context often there is no one
to ask or anyone who knows the answer, and it instead is a gamble.

The way this is made to work is by offering free returns, and yet this
also effects other prices and is a structural inefficiency if it could
be solved and such returns unnecessary when they could instead be
avoided, due to an issue such as 'missing information' that is
important to the seller and the buyer, to know enough about the item
at the center of such exchange.

Thus, of various products sold online, consider if they had a more
robust and in-depth data model that consisted of various "dimensions",
and therefore if there were these attachment devices to tables, you
could narrow a search for such items not just by the main category
{tablet attachment}, and instead further by subset details, such as
{clamp to 2-3/4 inches} when others only may only open to 1-1/4 inch
and therefore would not fulfill the criteria.

And so in modeling a particular item or device, as category, it could
be modeled in various subset details that may already occur in areas
like HDTV sets, to some limited extent (a bit too fuzzy whereby false
positives are frequent as with many hierarchical approaches based on,
it is assumed words versus geometric structures based on such
functional details). In some sense it could be equivalent to a limited
'dimensional-search' via matrix, that in some cases may involve
measurement (height-width-depth), color, form or shape, materials, and
other specifics (calories, toxins, requirements). Then instead of
searching from the general to the specific, looking for the needle, a
person could start with the needle, knowing what they usually are
looking for -though cannot find- and located it through geometry of
such data.

In this way, potentially the future of online catalogs in a tablet
interface as it may streamline the process of interaction and exchange
with this data ecosystem of media and other goods.

(concepts: patterns, typologies, variable details, relational structures)

(also, this strategy could be used for other search via structurally
organized -if meta- data as a content or information search via
categories, dimensions, graphs and grid. dimensions, 3- and N-value
logic, set theory, AI interface and interactions. tending toward
'living queries' where, given parameters, search could continue or
map/carto/survey realms, provide reconaissance, report back data
structures, variables. this could be basis for custom data structure
of PC, a model built up over many queries, spanning local-global
structure, heuristic feedback, etc.)

[review]  The Riddle of the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code
http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/dec/05/what-was-greek-to-them/

"But then what? The sequel to the decipherment is little more than a
final, self-evident coda to most of these stories. “Enigma” is broken,
so the Allies win the war; hieroglyphs are decoded, so the culture of
pharaonic Egypt is revealed to us. What this conceals, however, are
all the further disputes and rivalries that regularly follow the
successful cracking of the language or of the code. Just how correct
was it? And, if it was, what does it tell us about the culture
concerned, or the history of the period? Whose theories are now
confirmed or disproved? These controversies can be just as exciting
and bitter as those leading up to the decipherment, and probably more
significant. But we rarely get to hear about them before the heroic
tale ends."

(note: on archaeology, often referred to as excavations of the past,
centuries ago though this moves into decades ago, particularly with
industrial archeology, or potentially even the near-present especially
in terms of media, as this relates to crypto, hacking, cracking,
exploits, etc. that is, discovering not stone tablets and instead
electronic tablets with known or unknown security measures. as related
to ingenious techniques for how to access the locked-in data without
having it vanish, such as freezing chips or other surgical critical
access methods;

note: should also mention data archeology and data recovery belonging
to this same context. in archaeology often trash sites are highly
valued for the information they bring, proverbial 'trash to treasure'
scenario. thus to consider old data, databases, or even receipts in
this way, as with inventories in Linear B. and what actionable realms
does that relate to within today's processes: corporate intelligence
or whatever, to model a situation, exploit information, etc.
('exchange your electronics' for rebates or upgrades, and the hidden
data could be gleaned and monetized, though perhaps someday another
route to recovering rare elements instead of mining them, gold,
silver, rare earth metals from old circuit boards. preexisting
approaches within new EM context: archeology, geology/mining,
crypto/spying, on and on, into today)

the relevance of archeology does not stop here either. concepts and
methods could be useful in computing, developing a new data structure
to access information via layers or time-based evaluations,
reconstructions, modeling, etc. then also the great tools, LADAR and
others. just the issue of dust alone, reimagined in future of smart
dust, traces of info everywhere, data fossilization, TSCM-like
correlations. thus interdisciplinary structures, models and methods,
knowledge, shared value. integrating perspective via n-dimensionality,
unified frameworks, continuum of truth throughout shared cultural
scaffolding via logical reasoning, maximized, optimized, tested and
improved. thus what might archeology have to offer crypto/security and
development of computing in the realm of paradigm, conceptualization,
understanding, meaning, integrated modeling, measurement, organization
of data, archive and records, inventory, digs, reconstructions,
research, mapping & cartography, language, excavation)
