I don't really like the "greens" type of person as they tend to blame 
every thing on me and my desire to be like an average person with 
average consumption of our worldly resources but why exactly 
should they be targeted for special treatment over other travellers 
who may be more astute in voicing their beliefs?

The decision to permit travel should be a matter of policy and not 
determined by individuals based on their personal beliefs or 
attitudes.  I have experienced this type of treatment in third-world 
countries where the person making the determination could be 
influenced by monetary issues.  I have always visited places where 
the degree  of hassle was determined by spiritual specifics, ie - 
religion.

Ring a bell here?  Green bad, Republican good, Christian good, 
Muslim bad?, or the other way round!!  It would be very sad if 
America was to become this shallow!
