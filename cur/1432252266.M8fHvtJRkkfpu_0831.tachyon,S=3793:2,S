>From the Sunworld article:

"When he was a fledgling cyberjournalist, Quittner wrote a puff piece
in Wired about the principal members of the EFF that equated them with
Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters of the '60s (in fact, Stewart Brand was a
Merry Prankster)."

Funny, Brand doesn't mention that in his resume
(via http://www.well.com/user/sbb/).

Maybe he was wrong, too...  (or maybe I'm wrong ;-)


I sent feedback to Wired online recently mentioning my plans to not
renew my Wired print subscription (after subscribing since Vol 1 #2)
[yes, I know online & print are not the same...it was just a footnote
to feedback about an online article].  

The incredible number of ads are bad enough; my main complaint is
there's just never much content, other than some (generally
out-of-date) technofetish and pseudo-celebrity interviews.  Plenty of
ads, though.  Did I mention the ads?
