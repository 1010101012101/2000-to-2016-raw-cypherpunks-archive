Here's a link to the Florida law on absentee ballots:

---
http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0101/SEC67.HTM&Title=->2000->Ch0101->Section%2067

(1) The supervisor of elections shall safely keep in his or her office
any envelopes received containing marked ballots of absent electors,
and he or she shall, before the canvassing of the election returns,
deliver the envelopes to the county canvassing board along with his or
her file or list kept regarding said ballots.

(2) All marked absent electors' ballots to be counted must be received
by the supervisor by 7 p.m. the day of the election. All ballots
received thereafter shall be marked with the time and date of receipt
and filed in the supervisor's office.

I must be missing something. Sure looks like the deadline was Tuesday,
with perhaps an exemption for overseas ballots elsewhere in the law?
