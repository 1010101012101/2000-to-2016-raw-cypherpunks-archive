I can only see one application for voluntary TCPA, and that is the
application it was designed to perform:  Make it possible run
software or content which is encrypted so that it will only run on
one computer for one time period.

All the other proposed uses, both good and evil, seem improbably
cumbersome, or easier to do in some other fashion.  There are
quite a few extremely evil uses it would be good for, but they
would only be feasible if enforced by legislation -- otherwise
people would turn the chip off, or tear it out.
