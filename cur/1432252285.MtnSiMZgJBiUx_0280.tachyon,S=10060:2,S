Abstract: Jill Kelley issue is important because her uncle is a
Director of the FBI, her 1st cousin is the Deputy Director of the FBI,
her great-uncle was the Director of the FBI after Hoover, her uncle is
a Director of NSA, her 1st cousin is Director of CIA covert
operations, and even her uncle ran the CIA rendition and torture
transfer facilities... Among many others.

The "KELLEY KLAN" including "Jill Kelley" has completely taken over
most of the US institution. Father-in-law now assigned as WhiteHouse
Director of Cyber-Security amidst a senate vote and executive orders!
Relamzted parties completely control FBI, all 1811s, and most covert
military institutions. Notables include most of the FBI National
Security and Counter-Intelligence, as well as the "CAAT" contingency
_secret_ backup "government", and a plethora of military
"intelligence" divisions.

WPost tends to have ammusing phrasing:"[Many details surrounding the
case remain unclear. The FBI declined to respond to a list of
questions submitted by The Washington Post on its handling of personal
information in the course of the Petraeus investigation. The bureau
also declined to discuss even the broad guidelines for safeguarding
the privacy of ordinary citizens whose e-mails might surface in
similarly inadvertent fashion.(Jill Kelley's Uncle: FBI OIC KELLEY)
"If this had all started involving someone who was not the director of
the CIA .b	.b	. they would have ignored it,b said David Sobel,
senior counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy
group. bA bell went off because of who it was.bThat consideration
triggered a cascade of additional quandaries for the Justice
Department, including whether and when to notify Congress and the
White House. The FBI finally did so on election night, Nov. 6, when
Deputy Director Sean Joyce called Petraeusbs boss, Director of
National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.(Jill Kelley's First Cousin:
