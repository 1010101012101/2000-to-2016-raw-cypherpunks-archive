The FBI Congressional Liason office respond to my inquiry on Magic Lantern 
by telling me they could not provide me with any information on this 
because it is "classified." She also said she was told that the project is 
still being developed and it was a "mistake" that coverage of this has made 
it into the media. The Congressional liaison also said the folks working on 
this would not tell her anything about the project.
