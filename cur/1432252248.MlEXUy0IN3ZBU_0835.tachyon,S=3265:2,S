"Where did this "of color" nonsense get started?"

Like a lot of PC terms...from guilt-ridden white liberals. Black folks never 
use this term, as far as I've ever heard. Likewise with "physically 
challenged". My black karate Sensei used to periodically laugh at the shame 
and embarassment associated with any speech "coloration"...to the point 
where some people won't even mention skin color when describing another 
person.
