Jodi is apparently oblivious to the fact that AIDS is not the single
largest cause of death in Africa. It is also a disease that affects the
young. Research into the diseases of old age is unlikely to cause
a significant extension of the patients lifetime. That is why cancer
recieves more funding than heart disease.

Spending the federal defense budget on almost anything other
than military pork would be a good thing. The US millitary budget
is more than half the discressionary spending of the US. It is
greater than the combined spending of all the NATO allies
combined and of the combined budget of the 19 other countries 
in the top 20 mmilitary spending nations.

If the US military has a preparedness problem the problem is 
not lack of resources. Why is it that the people who always say 
that a problem cant be solved by spending more money sing a
different tune for military spending?
