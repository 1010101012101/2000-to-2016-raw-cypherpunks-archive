Punk was much more than fad or fashion; it demonstrated the fractal effect 
in culture, showing how small events, the acts of a few people, can cause 
ripples around the world. Punk demanded and received a response
Punk's attack on the establishment and institutions of the day, its 
willingness to exploit taboos for fun and profit, was supremely effective 
at getting up noses. So what, for all its loudmouth posturing, is punk's 
legacy?
Damning God and the state, work and leisure, home and family, sex and play, 
the audience and itself, the music briefly made it possible to experience 
all these things as if they were not natural facts but ideological 
constructs: things that had been made and therefore could be altered, or 
done away with altogether. It became possible to see those things as bad 
jokes and for the music to come forth as a better joke
The charts for three guitar chords (A, E and G) above a simple exhortation: 
"Now form a band." For many people, that defined punk.
