In fact we have seen Islamic terrorist attacks in Sweden and 
Switzerland, particularly Switzerland.  Don't know about 
Belgium.

Doubtless keeping US troops in Saudi Arabia was a bad idea,
since it enabled Saudis to blame the evil of their government
on the US, rather than themselves, but Bin Laden's indictment
not only mentions US troops in Saudi Arabia, but also the
reconquest of Spain, the massacre committed by the crusaders in
Jerusalem, and the failure of Americans to obey Shariah law.
