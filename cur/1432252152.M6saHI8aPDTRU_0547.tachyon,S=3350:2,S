Yes, I thought that as well, and bought the subscription for a year. I'm very
pleased with what I've seen so far, and intend to prolong it.

Alchemy (the next bleeding edge after Satori) is supposed to have IPsec.
It would be very good indeed to have opportunistic IPsec in there.

WRT54GS is about to be released in the EU as well, and with twice the flash
and the RAM it should have space for some interesting functionality.

The WRT54G clones are largely useful as very cheap Linux boxes with radio,
for individual homes and small scall meshes. They should be able to support a
few VPNs over typical ADSL/cable modem link bitrate, but for more serious
work I'd go with VIA's C5 family (1 GHz fanless, and hardware crypto support
as well as on-die entropy source).
