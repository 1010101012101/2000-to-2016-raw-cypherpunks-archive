Last night I was channel surfing, I saw an interview with a prominent title 
"Profiles in terror".  The anchorman was interviewing the Secretary General 
of the Hezbollah, an organization invariably described as terrorist in our 
press, even though it, unlike most Arab states, and unlike Israel, usually 
obeys the laws of war.

The interviewer asked the Secretary General about the conditions under 
which the Israeli prisoners were being held.  He did not answer.  Instead 
he said (from memory, not his exact words)

: : 	We have four Israeli soldiers prisoner (gives ranks and
: : 	brief description).  They were each captured on occupied
: : 	Lebanese territory (gives location of capture).  The
: : 	Israelis hold nineteen Hezbollah soldiers prisoner, all of
: : 	them captured in Lebanon, many of them taken in raids on
: : 	their homes.   Why is no one asking about these prisoners
: : 	and the conditions under which they are held?
