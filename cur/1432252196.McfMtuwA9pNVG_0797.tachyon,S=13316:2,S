Keeping a Remote Eye on Day-Care
                                          Kids 
                                             Parents can monitor live video
of kids
                                          via Webcams, thanks to a Newport
firm.
                                          More centers are likely to join. 

                                          By MATTHEW EBNET, Times Staff
                                          Writer


                                               For Judi McDill, the video
window in
                                          the corner of her computer screen
is the
                                          only connection with her son
during the
                                          day. On the Web, she watches him eat
                                          lunch, stand on chairs with that
coltish
                                          wiggle in his knees, fuss with
his shirt
                                          buttons. Sometimes, when the
5-year-old
                                          notices the camera in his
day-care center,
                                          he waves. 
                                               All day she watches. 
                                               Chase, 5, was attending
Southcoast
                                          Early Childhood Learning Center
in Costa
                                          Mesa when a man crashed his Cadillac
                                          into the playground last year,
killing two
                                          children. So when McDill looked
for a
                                          new school, she was sold on Newport
                                          Harbor Montessori Center because
of its
                                          Webcam service. The Webcam offers
                                          "some peace to [my] soul" about
her son's
                                          well-being. 
                                               "I know it couldn't prevent
something
                                          bad happening again, but it gives me
                                          reassurance about his safety," said
                                          McDill, 35, who lives in Orange.
"The
                                          teachers know they are being
watched at
                                          any time. The biggest thing for
me is that I
                                          can just see him. I can see him.
And I can
                                          touch him in some way." 
                                               A year-old Newport Beach
company
                                          offers the Webcam service, which has
                                          been picked up by five Orange County
                                          child-care centers and is being
considered
                                          by five others. The company
provides the
                                          schools with $800 computers, the
cameras
                                          and high-speed Internet
connections for
                                          free, in exchange for full
participation
                                          from parents in the Webcam program,
                                          called GuardianCam. The parents
pay $10
                                          to $20 a month for the service.
All they
                                          need is a computer at work to
watch. The
                                          company also is installing
equipment in
                                          five schools in the San Diego
area and is
                                          "talking to" 42 preschools in the
San
                                          Francisco area. 
                                               Jennifer Lovely of Newport
Beach
                                          said she got the idea for the
company
                                          when she found it hard to leave
her own
                                          son Joseph, 4, in a home day-care
center.
                                          With help from some technologically
                                          savvy friends, Lovely created the
                                          company and began approaching
                                          preschools. She now employs 10
                                          people--and watches Joseph via her
                                          computer as he attends Newport
Harbor
                                          Montessori. 
                                               Lovely wasn't the first to
think of the
                                          idea. The first online video
system was
                                          launched in early 1997 at a day-care
                                          center in Connecticut. Also in 1997,
                                          Cathy's Kids Club in Tustin
installed
                                          video cameras in classrooms to
broadcast
                                          still pictures on the Internet
for parents to
                                          monitor their children. That
system is still
                                          in place, an employee there said. 
                                               Still, concerns have been
raised about
                                          such systems, by teachers and
sociologists
                                          who question just how much parents
                                          should be overseeing their
children during
                                          the school day. And some
conservative
                                          commentators have huffed that if
parents
                                          want to watch their children so
badly, they
                                          should stay at home with them. 
                                               But Lovely says she has not
heard any
                                          such complaints. 
                                               "This is just a sign that
people are
                                          saying, 'Yes, I have to work,'
but they are
                                          finding other ways to connect
with their
                                          families," she said. "This is one
way of
                                          doing it that works. . . . I know
it is
                                          one-way communication, but it is
                                          something." 
                                               Lovely said some schools were
                                          apprehensive, especially about the
                                          requirement that all parents
participate in
                                          the program; that adds cost to
already
                                          expensive day-care fees. But other
                                          schools were eager to join in,
wanting
                                          another opportunity to allay
concerns
                                          about safety in child-care centers,
                                          particularly after the Costa Mesa
crash. 
                                               "There's this fear out
there," said
                                          Jamee Backus, director of Newport
                                          Harbor Montessori Center, which
cares
                                          for about 160 children. "I feel
like this
                                          abolishes all that fear. Parents
can log on.
                                          Then they can ask their children
about
                                          their day. The parents know what
to ask.
                                          Like, 'Hey, I saw you were
working on a
                                          science project. . . .' And the
children feel
                                          more connected with their
parents. You
                                          can feel it in them. You can see
it when
                                          they wave into the cameras. It is
darling." 
                                               Sometimes the video can be
frustrating,
                                          however; the quality of the
images can be
                                          uneven and jerky. The video produces
                                          seven frames per second, compared
with
                                          about 30 for television. The
video offers
                                          detail and color, but no sound. 
                                               But even if technology
doesn't allow
                                          for perfect, real-time video yet,
                                          participating parents and schools
say the
                                          idea offers a sense of security. 
                                               "For the parent it shows we
have
                                          nothing to hide," Backus said,
"and they
                                          don't have to come and check on
their
                                          child." 
                                               Backus said about two dozen
parents
                                          enrolled in the school
specifically for the
                                          cameras, and about a third of
them were
                                          single parents looking for some
way to
                                          stay in touch with their children. 
                                               One 31-year-old mother sends
her
                                          child to a preschool in the
county that uses
                                          the cameras. She did not want her
name
                                          used because of concerns about her
                                          4-year-old daughter's safety. 
                                               She said the cameras were
the biggest
                                          selling point for her school. 
                                               "It just makes sense," she
said.
                                          "There's a lot to worry about. I
have
                                          [video] on all day. All day.
Without it, I
                                          can ask her how her day was and
she just
                                          says, 'OK' or 'Fine.' But this
way I can ask
                                          her specifically about what she's
done. I
                                          also can call her on it when she
puts her
                                          feet on the table. She's not
supposed to put
                                          those feet on the table."
