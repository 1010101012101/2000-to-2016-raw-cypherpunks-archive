I do a lot of my random web browsing thru www.safeweb.com, 
which allows me to disable pop-ups. 

It also 

1: Causes the direction and content of my browsing to be 
obscured from any observer between me and the Safeweb site.

2: Obscures the target site from knowing who is surfing them.

3. Manages cookies intelligently.

It's not perfect - safeweb.com could build a pretty good profile
of where I surf. Ideally, you'd want to chain through two or more 
non-colluding Safeweb type services - think of it as a remailer
for HTTP.

Also,  In-Q-Tel (the CIA VC firm) is one of Safeweb's investors
The CIA's story is that they want a way for their agents to surf
without leaving footprints. Safeweb appears to have been founded
a group of programmers of Chinese descent, and is designed to
act as a route around the Great Firewall of China. There's even a
entry proxy called 'Triangleboy' which should allow Safeweb to be
used if the main site is blocked.

Unlike a lot of the people on this list, these guys actually write
code.
