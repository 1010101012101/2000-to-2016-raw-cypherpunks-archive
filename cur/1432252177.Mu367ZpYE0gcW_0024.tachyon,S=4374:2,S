Does this really work? I can't imagine this working for murder (but on the
other hand, that's  a bad example since it's unreasonable to imagine
murder legal in the USA). Even for something like tax laws or other
complicated regulations this sounds dubious.

Well, a lawyer who advised a client that something was legal when in fact
it wasn't might have a problem.

Such a statement would help, but more because it would be from an expert
on the law than because of any legal shield. I am not a lawyer, and so I'd
like to have one's opinion before doing anything that could land me in
jail. That kind of thing.

Prohibiting what - publishing cryptography code?
In any case, even if the law is unconstitutional, you may have to go
through several layers of court cases to prove it. c.f. Bernstein. :(
