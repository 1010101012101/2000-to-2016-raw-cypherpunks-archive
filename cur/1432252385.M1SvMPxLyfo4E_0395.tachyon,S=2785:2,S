It is an interesting question, as yet unexplored, whether the
2nd WTC plane/manned-cruise-missile (made by Boeing in either case)
was intended as an "emergency
personnel bomb" (following the christian anti-abortionist bombing,
et alia model)
or whether they were just going for redundancy/extra effect.  After all,

the lameass parking lot WTC bomb a few years ago didn't do a hundredth
of the effect of
10 guys and two planes..  Orderz of Magnitude, DOOD..
