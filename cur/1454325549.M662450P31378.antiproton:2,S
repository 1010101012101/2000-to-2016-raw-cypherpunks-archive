Feel free to continue such.

Is it possible that you are misunderstanding cypherpunks?

Is it possible you have misunderstood some particular conversation?

Seems you are flailing at windmills... by all means, flail away, but
don't expect others to jump onto jobs you imply need to be done, and
assume have failed to be done - down that path lies madness, so I
suggested taking a deep breath and, whatever it is you're trying to
achieve, try again.

Haven't seen your address round these parts before, so your various
presumptions of existential "problems" are a little hard for me to
stomach...

All in generic terms, with no substantiated facts.

Forget scraping the barrel - take a deep breath and step back for a bit.

Frankly, I'm yet to see that (in any substance) in your words I have ever read.

Never has been. If it is, name it, point it out, other than that, not
interested in your straw men.

I say you have demonstrated good sense to tone down, from aggression
("how fucking elitist is that") to polemic. It's a start, yet lacking
any substance.

Please, do feel welcome :)
