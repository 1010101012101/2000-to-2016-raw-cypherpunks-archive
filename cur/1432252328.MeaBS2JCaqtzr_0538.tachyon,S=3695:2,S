         I think Karsten first asked that question. Well:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/nation/specials/attacked/A59466-2001Oct14.html 

http://www.msnbc.com/news/642989.asp

"In a high-security wing of Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center, 
an unknown number of men with Middle Eastern names are being held in 
solitary confinement on the ninth floor, locked in 8- by 10-foot cells with 
little more than cots, thin blankets and, if they request it, copies of the 
Koran. Every two hours, guards roust them to conduct a head count. They 
have no contact with each other or their families and limited access to 
their lawyers. Their names appear on no federal jail log available to the 
public. No records can be found in any court docket in New York showing why 
they are detained, who represents them or the status of their cases."

         The ghost of Due Process hovers above the funeral pyre where her 
entire sisterhood burned, drifting between the wafting billows of rancid 
smoke, and I ask myself: What is to be done?
