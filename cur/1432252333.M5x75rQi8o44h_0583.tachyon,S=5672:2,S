Most insurance companies are worth millions, if not billions, of
dollars, and they make huge profits.  Insuring all of the people that
they now deny based on genetic abnormalities would still allow them to
make decent profits.

Also, people cannot simply create insurance companies.  Breaking into
the healthcare business is damn near impossible, unless you have
established relationships inside the industry.

And many people are denied coverage outright, therefore removing the
possibility of simply paying for their coverage.
