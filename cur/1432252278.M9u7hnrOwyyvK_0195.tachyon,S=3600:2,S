How do we expect to even  find them, when they're using mixmasters to
remain anonymous? Do you know what a mixmaster is?   This is exactly the
problem.

from "Can hackers help stop child porn on the Net?"
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/zd/20010411/tc/can_hackers_help_stop_child_porn_on_the_net__1.html

Try not to puke on your keyboard when you read it.

Can a suspected pedophile claim that a virus downloaded the porn without
him knowing?
  Preposterous? But can a cop or a lawyer explain why the defense is
preposterous?

  The point is simply this: Fight fire with fire. In the past, police
have always had superiority. Better
  training, better knowledge, better guns. Not in cyberspace. While
pornographers are usually not the
  brightest intellects, illegal Internet activity is generally
perpetrated by those who know far more about
  the technology than everyone on the other end of the crime. Therefore,
it makes the most sense to
  solicit the help of those who know the technology: hackers.

Maybe they're busy DoS'ing Hamas/ROC/Deutsche Socialist music
and other thoughtcrime sites...
