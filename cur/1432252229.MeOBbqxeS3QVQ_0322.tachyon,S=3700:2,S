2. House approves 4.6 percent pay raise The House voted overwhelmingly 
Wednesday night to give civilian federal employees a 4.6 percent average 
pay raise next year. On a 334-94 vote, the House passed the $32.7 billion 
fiscal 2002 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, (H.R. 2590), which 
contained language approving the raise. Earlier this week, the Bush 
administration issued a statement opposing the 4.6 percent increase, 
arguing that it "would divert critical resources from programs across the 
government." The administration proposed a 3.6 percent raise for civilian 
federal employees in its fiscal 2002 budget. Bush has proposed an 
across-the-board 4.6 percent military raise along with additional targeted 
raises that would boost increases to between 5 percent and 10 percent for 
service members, depending on their rank. "I remain hopeful that the 
administration will drop its insistence on a lower raise for federal 
workers," Rep. James Moran, D-Va., said in a statement. Military and 
civilian raises have been equal in 17 of the last 20 years. Click here for
