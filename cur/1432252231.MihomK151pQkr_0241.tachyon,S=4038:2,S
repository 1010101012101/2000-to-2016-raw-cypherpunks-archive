THE DEPUTY SAID  THE CASE WORKER WAS WALKING ON THIN ICE, AND IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT HOLD UP IN COURT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD. WHEN I CALLED TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED, THEY TOLD ME IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I AM WILLING TO GO TO JAIL BEFORE LETTING THESE GIRLS GO BACK TO THIS SITUATION. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS. I CANT BEAR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO EVER HAVE TO SEE THIS PERSON AGAIN, BUT MY SON, THEIR FATHER DOES NOT HAVE CUSTODY. AT THE MOMENT HE HAS THEM, BUT THEIR MOTHER WILL NOT COMPLY WITH DFS SO THEY CAN GET COUNSELING. THE DFS HAS SENT THE MEDICAID CARDS SO THEY CAN GET THE COUNSELING, BUT SHE HAS TO SIGN THE CONSENT, AND SHE WONT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE DOCTORS FOR AN EXAM, BECAUSE SHE ALSO WONT SIGN FOR T!
HAT. THE LAWS OF THIS LAND ARE COMPLICATED, AND IM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE THE REASON FOR THIS CONSENT FROM THE MOTHER, IS APPROPRIATE, BUT AT THIS TIME, I AM FRUSTRATED THAT THEIR MOTHER AND HER NEW HUSBANDS FAMILY ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE LAW . WE NEED TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ANYONE THAT IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR BEST INTEREST. THESE ARE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND DESERVE TO HAVE A FUTURE, UNMOLESTED.  CATHERINE M.
