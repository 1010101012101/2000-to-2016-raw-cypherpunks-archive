I wasn't under that impression, so far.

living in northern germany, I should add that low german (the local
dialect) is very similiar to english in some respects. even though I can
hardly speak it, I can immediatly think of a dozen or so words where the
english equivalent is closer than the (high) german one.

yes, it is. maybe to a lesser degree, because you DO stay consistent
with the main topic, but it is generally considered bad style to be
repetitive without need, and german classes spend some time on the
topic, drawing up lists of words with similiar meanings that can be used
for variety. the most famous one is "speak", which has a LONG list of
similiar words in pretty much every language.
