"Waaa, he was vicious!  He used a remailer!" Oh my! Well that's just proof
that he's working for Microsoft!  (With a nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no
more to Monty Python.)


You've called him on it several times.  Get over it.  I couldn't give a
fuck whether or not "it" (unless it has expressed a gender clue to the
contrary, I'll randomy assign "he" to it) is Bill Gate's personal buttboy.  
If his arguement is BS it will stand on its own as BS.

Shame on you.  Bad dog!  All you're doing is weaking your own arguements.


IMNHO TCPA sucks balls.  But "anonymous" has the right to speak
anonymously as does anyone, and most of us here will defend that right,
regardless of accepting or rejecting TCPA/Palladium/MSFT.

You remember that old saw about "I may not agree with you, but I will
defend your right to say it to the death" -- just add anonymously in
there.  

It's up to that "anon" or collection of anons to chose to disclose
it's/their affiliation/admiration for MSFT or not.  

Besides, from what I've seen, those anon messages weren't signed.  So I
can claim "I am that anonymous" and so can Vulis, Choate, Lucky, Tim,
Declan, RAH, yourself, your mom, the horse she rode on, the FedZ, the NSA
spook Satelite dancers (like the Rockettes, but they wear stego-panty
stockings and have barcodes on their foreheads sent by Lotus Notes so the
DIRNSA has a copy), and the Man Show Juggies.  So what?

Would the real "anon shady please stand up?"  ROTFL!
