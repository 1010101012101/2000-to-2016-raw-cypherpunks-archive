Here's an informative site on underground structures --
tunnels, military bases, caves, temples, unidentifiables -- 
and the technology, epistimology and religion of them:

  
<http://www.sauderzone.com/ubtlinks.htm>http://www.sauderzone.com/ubtlinks.htm

Nearly all of the world's most secret (and threatening)
technology and archives of information are located
underground.

The relations of secrets to the subterranean, and conversely,
that of liberating thought to the sky, are perhaps not
accidental.

The US government is expected under the new administration
to replace the UK government as the most secrecy-crazed.
As a writer noted recently, this customarily happens at the peak 
of a nation's power when it becomes totally paranoid about
pandemic threats, especially from within.

The US Secretary of Defense said a while back that technology
empowers the citizenry, business, allies and enemies equally
to threaten US power and thus must be controlled.

The USG aims to totally control, or at least surveil, all forms
of communication, not only within the US but globally, in an
attempt to foresee looming threats.

Underground communication intercept facilities which do not 
tap into the atmosphere or land, but rather the extremely 
long-waves transmitted deep within the earth, are 
considered to be a prime tool of omnicient surveillance.

The most heavily trafficked Web site of the holiday season is
NORAD's tracking of Santa Claus -- last year some 50 million
hits.

Francisco Sierra, a Spanish professor of Information and Military
Propaganda, writes that military spectaculars are devised to enrapture
the mesmerized, consumer-ad besotted citizenry, to erase the border 
between war and peace, to expand the military doctrine to all aspects
of culture, in order to justify programs of total domestic and global 
surveillance to assure national and supranational security. He 
views news coverage of the Gulf War and Yugoslavian Bombing 
as such real-time CNN-pleasing propaganda performances
orchestrated as military parades.
