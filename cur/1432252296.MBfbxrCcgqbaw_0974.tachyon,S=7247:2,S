Dear Joe Cypherpunk:

Imagine a wireless Internet that works better than the desktop LAN in your office wherever you need it.

With the approval of 802.11 standards, the evolution of Bluetooth, 3G wireless services, and the availability of high-performance, low-cost access equipment for homes, wireless LANs (WLANs) have leapt from theory straight into the most exciting new high-speed wireless communication technology.

Gartner's Wireless LAN Summit provides rational, unbiased and insightful research and analysis that underpin good decision making. Get on the fast track to receive immediate actionable advice, as well as information to lay down the roadwork for future results. 

For vendors, location owners, infrastructure providers and user organizations alike, this event is the only objective resource today for understanding what's really going on with WLAN technology and what it means for your business.
