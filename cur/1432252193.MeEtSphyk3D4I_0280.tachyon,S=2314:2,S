you can do SSL over UDP if you like - I think most VPN software is UDP 
only, while OpenVPN has a "fallback" TCP mode for cases where you can't 
use UDP (and TBH there aren't many)

PGPfone had that problem, even over landlines (no IP involved) - 
however, I think that was more do to with the compression codecs and the 
crypto than any external problems, as switching to half-duplex usually 
cleared the problems up.

The strength of a pure VPN solution is that you aren't limited to *just* 
VoIP - you can transfer files, use whiteboarding, run videoconferencing, 
support text channels..... even play games :)
