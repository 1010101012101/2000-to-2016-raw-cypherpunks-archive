Seriously, why the hell help Microsoft lift their game by involving
the FTC or any other government body!

Leave them be. Help people who get stung to find a new and partly free
world of libre software. A better Windows OS harms the cause for libre
software, does not help us.

We live in a world where government is decrepit, corporations are
corrupt in their manifestation in the world, and even small decisions
we techies make, can have big consequences down the line. Let's put a
political and ethical intent into our communication and our actions -
our childrens' future needs every bit of leg up we can possibly add.

WHY oh why encourage MS to take -away- reasons that people should not
use Windows!?!

Insanity.

MS is ramping up their criminal Windows 10 upgrade scheme

Microsoft sets stage for massive Windows 10 upgrade strategy

http://www.computerworld.com/article/3012278/microsoft-windows/microsoft-sets-stage-for-massive-windows-10-upgrade-strategy.html#tk.rss_all

  	In an interview Friday, Mayfield said that the Windows
	10 upgrade setting switcheroo on Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs was
	apparently due to continued updates that Microsoft has shoved
	onto the older devices. The Redmond, Wash. company has
	repeatedly re-served its original GWX app to PCs, often with
	undocumented changes, even if the machine already had the app,
	or even if the user had managed to uninstall it previously.
	"Microsoft has released this update several times," said
	Mayfield. "It doesn't change the name of the update, but every
	version is new, with new binary files."

Where the hell is the FTC when we need them? This is the sort of crap
they need to be stopping. Windows 10 in its default settings -- not all
of which are even straightforward to change -- is a privacy nightmare.
On many older computers, its performance is slow and horrific. In many
cases, older devices cease working due to lack of new drivers. What
Microsoft is doing here is the equivalent of black hat hacking of user
computers on an enormous scale. It's criminal. Especially if you're on
an older computer, every time MS tries to get you to install Windows 10,
say no, and strongly consider moving to a different system entirely,
until MS' current leadership is in federal prison where they belong for
computer crimes on a massive scale.
