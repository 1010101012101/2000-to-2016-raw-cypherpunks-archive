Dear Nannie,

How about buying yourself a two Chopard watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
http://www.peonmine.com/

Take advantage of our christmas specials and get yourself {$WATCH$} watch that you've always wanted!

Our Chopard have Weights/feels and looks exactly same as original.

Sincerely,
Mr Mejia
