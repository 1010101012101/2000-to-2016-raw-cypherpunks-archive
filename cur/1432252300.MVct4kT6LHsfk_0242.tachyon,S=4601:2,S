Zombywuf appears to be a Brit - one of those people who have been 
disarmed for so long that he/she has no real knowledge of firearms. 
That, or he/she does not read very well.

I made specific reference to 'frangible, low velocity' ammunition. This is
to
prevent the very scenario he describes. (this is basicly a plastic dumdum
bullet with a low charge of propellent - at short range quite lethal, but 
unable to penetrate objects much more solid than cloth or meat.

If every adult in the US was armed, we'd be a much more polite
society, and have much less crime.
