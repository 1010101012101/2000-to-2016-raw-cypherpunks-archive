RUSSIAN ANALYST PREDICTS DECLINE AND BREAKUP OF USA
Tue Nov 25 2008 09:04:22 ET

A leading Russian political analyst has said the economic turmoil in  
the United States has confirmed his long-held view that the country is  
heading for collapse, and will divide into separate parts.

Professor Igor Panarin said in an interview with the respected daily  
IZVESTIA published on Monday: "The dollar is not secured by anything.  
The country's foreign debt has grown like an avalanche, even though in  
the early 1980s there was no debt. By 1998, when I first made my  
prediction, it had exceeded $2 trillion. Now it is more than 11  
trillion. This is a pyramid that can only collapse."

The paper said Panarin's dire predictions for the U.S. economy,  
initially made at an international conference in Australia 10 years  
ago at a time when the economy appeared strong, have been given more  
credence by this year's events.

When asked when the U.S. economy would collapse, Panarin said: "It is  
already collapsing. Due to the financial crisis, three of the largest  
and oldest five banks on Wall Street have already ceased to exist, and  
two are barely surviving. Their losses are the biggest in history. Now  
what we will see is a change in the regulatory system on a global  
financial scale: America will no longer be the world's financial  
regulator."

When asked who would replace the U.S. in regulating world markets, he  
said: "Two countries could assume this role: China, with its vast  
reserves, and Russia, which could play the role of a regulator in  
Eurasia."

Asked why he expected the U.S. to break up into separate parts, he  
said: "A whole range of reasons. Firstly, the financial problems in  
the U.S. will get worse. Millions of citizens there have lost their  
savings. Prices and unemployment are on the rise. General Motors and  
Ford are on the verge of collapse, and this means that whole cities  
will be left without work. Governors are already insistently demanding  
money from the federal center. Dissatisfaction is growing, and at the  
moment it is only being held back by the elections and the hope that  
Obama can work miracles. But by spring, it will be clear that there  
are no miracles."

He also cited the "vulnerable political setup", "lack of unified  
national laws", and "divisions among the elite, which have become  
clear in these crisis conditions."

He predicted that the U.S. will break up into six parts - the Pacific  
coast, with its growing Chinese population; the South, with its  
Hispanics; Texas, where independence movements are on the rise; the  
Atlantic coast, with its distinct and separate mentality; five of the  
poorer central states with their large Native American populations;  
and the northern states, where the influence from Canada is strong.

He even suggested that "we could claim Alaska - it was only granted on  
lease, after all." Panarin, 60, is a professor at the Diplomatic  
Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has authored  
several books on information warfare.
