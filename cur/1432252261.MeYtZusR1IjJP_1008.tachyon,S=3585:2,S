A friend of mine would be willing to pay $15000 to anyone who could
accurately predict the day of Mr. Auerbach's demise.

Oh, wait.  No digital cash, no AP.  No anonymity, no AP.  Damnit.

(To LEOs reading this: this is a _joke_.  It is supposed to be a

have any clue at all.  In any case, if I had $15000, I'd be paying
bills right now.)
