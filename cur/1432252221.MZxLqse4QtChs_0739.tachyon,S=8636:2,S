I was shocked that almost nobody donates money to Werner Koch. Especially
in the Post-Snowden Era.
Are we so greedy/stupid/so f*cken selfish that we can not donate some money
to a man, whose labor we use to protect our most sensitive information?!
Hell, we buy bread, coffee and cheese and pay at the cash register, but for
privacy we are unable (or rather do not want to) to pay a penny.

And then we wonder, why is that great security software vanish or don't
receive security updates fast enough. And whom do we blame? The NSA, the
GCHQ. But it's not only them. This is us. This is our indifference, dammit!
Each throws off the responsibility on the other. "Someone else will
donate". Or "I have donated a year ago" (wow! And this year the developer
doesn't want to eat, right?!)

Our enemies are investing billions into breaking down these
programs/protocols which are designed to protect us (GPG, Tor, OTR, Tails,
VeraCrypt, Jitsi etc.). And? It turns out, that the developers of these
great programs don't have enough money even for the bare minimum!

It is a shame!

I encourage everyone, right here and now, to donate some money to his three
main security programs, which he uses the most. And donate at least once a
year.

There is nothing to discuss. "Just Do It".

Alexander.
