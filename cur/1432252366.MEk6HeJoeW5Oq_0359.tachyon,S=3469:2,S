Hey there's nothing wrong with Britney except for her music, right?

That's a good way to look at it.  Anyway, the Koran is written in
Arabic, and Joe Taliban speaks some Persian dialect, and he may not be
literate in that, much less literate in Koranic Arabic, so they
basically can't read it themselves, and have to rely on the mullahs,
who, as you point out, have agendas.  I guess it's the same situation
with the Catholic church in the middle ages.

The situation is the same everywhere.  In the US there are some people
who don't believe that the 2nd Amendment means that people have the
right to bear arms.
