Ah yes, good ol' Mike Echols.  A person so low that even rabble-rousers
like Ms. Anne Cox of CPAC refuse to mention his name without spitting.

The feds are very happy that Echols is in business, of course, as long as
he continues to direct his harrassment efforts at people critical of the
governments anti-porn and censorship agenda.  They'll do anything to help
him, particularly through quasi-governmental organizations like NCMEC, as
long as they keep their plausible deniability intact should he go too far.

A pest with friends in high places, one might say.

To a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  To a "child-saver," everything
looks like a pedophile.

One day, not so long ago, I flamed some member of the frothing radical
feminist man-haters contingent, who wanted to shred the Constitution, and
the next day, I was rewarded with my own entry on Echol's page, inviting
people to mail in my personal information so it could be posted.

Later, I engaged arch-kook Noreen Gosch on a CNN IRC server, from a shell
box in Salt Lake City, and Echols happily added "Lives in Salt Lake City"
to my entry.

Noreen is a fine woman who thinks that the International Pedophile
Conspiracy is run under the CIA's MK-ULTRA program, and uses Satanic
Ritual Abuse to produce multiple personalities in their secret child
operatives.  Of course, it's all run by Michael Aquino, who has had his
own problems with the Echols and Goschs of the world.

The Animal Emancipations folks have a very amusing Echols web page of
their own, with audio files of threats he left on their answering
machines.  Yes, Echols not only does pedophiles, he does animal rights
activists too.

>From a Cypherpunkish point of view, I suppose we should mirror Echols all
over the place, and build him his own Eternity Server, should the BoyChat
folks succeed in making him ISPless.

>From a practical point of view, Echols is likely to become a lot more
dangerous, now that we have Ashcroft in office, and the government is
about to embark on another Ed Meese-style "porn causes all crime" campaign
with the help of its conservative fellow travellers.

It would be highly amusing if he managed to mainstream himself, and by the
second Shrub term, had gotten himself installed as our nations first
Pedophile Czar.
