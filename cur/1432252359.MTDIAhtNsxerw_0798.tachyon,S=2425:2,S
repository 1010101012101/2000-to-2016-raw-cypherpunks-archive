No,any generator would do. BBS would be great but I am
not worried of correlations here and would like the
generator to be faster. 

 Thanks though, will use it when the PRNG needs to be
cryptographically secure and rather decorrelated.

BBS's response to the diehard test is also good. I
guess a PRNG passed over SHA-1 wouldn't pass the
diehard test.
