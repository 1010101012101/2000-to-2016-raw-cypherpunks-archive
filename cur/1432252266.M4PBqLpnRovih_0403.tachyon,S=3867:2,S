Subject: Crypto hardware

A couple of years ago at the RSA conference one of the vendors was 
exhibiting a tamperproof that would keep a secret key and perform 
encryptions/signatures using the key.  Since the key never left the 
box, in theory security reduced to physical security around the box.  
The intended use of the box was as a master for a CA.  I thought the 
vendor was GTE, but I didn't find anything definitive on their site.

Does this description trigger any recollection?  Are there similar 
devices on the market from other sources?
