The Berlin wall kept prisoners in.  This wall keeps attackers out.

There is an interesting, and quite deliberate, symbolic historical echo
here.  The wall for the most part runs along an old fortification, a
fortification created long ago to defend a frontier entrepot town against
attackers who wished to loot the trading post, a wall created to protect
trade against brigands and violent monopolists sponsored by hostile states.
