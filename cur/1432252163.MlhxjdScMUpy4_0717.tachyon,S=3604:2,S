You haven't gone to too many conferences lately, have you?


Palmsource 2001:
At door: $1395, early bird $995 (add $745 for tutorials).

Comdex fall 2001:
As high as $2895. if you get a 'flex pass'. Most attendees
will probably be paying from $0 (exhibits only, online reg)
to $1895 (2 conferences).

RSA 2002:
At-door full-conference registration is $1795, not including 
$495 for the tutorials. (that's the worst case - it's half that 
before Dec 4, and there are  a number of lower-cost options).
