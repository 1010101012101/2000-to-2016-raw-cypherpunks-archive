Perhaps indicating a revival of a Red Scare initiative against
Cyperhpunks in connection with promoting Wikileaks panic,
three attacks have been published in recent days:

1. Bruce Sterling, 22 December 2010, opens with naming Tim
May's writing on BlackNet and more:

2. Philip Pilkington, 21 December 2010, attacks Cryptome
by recylcing a Readers Digest smear from 2005:

in-on-the-debate-on-freedom-of-information/

3. Jaron Lanier, 20 December 2010, attacks Tim May, John
Gilmore and others:

upremacy-the-case-of-wikileaks/68217/

If the Red Scare is duplicated more of this will likely come as the
conspiracy 
net is spread to round up co-conspirators, fellow travellers, fronts like
EFF, EPIC,
ACLU, ProPublica and many more.

A long list of suspects here: 


http://cryptome.org/0002/siss.htm

A shorter Wikileaks-related suspects and documentation here:


http://cryptome.org/0003/wikileaks-series.htm

As the campaign heats up it will include deep-pocketed funders, traitors
planted 
inside security agencies, universities and corporations, squeezed informants 
against the ringleaders, congressional hearings, subpoenas, frightened naming 
of names, scouring of files for connecting dots at Archive.org, search
engines, 
social media, mail lists, news lists, chat rooms, IMs, email, and the
bountiful 
data collected by corporations, researchers, governments and their
contractors 
who claimed they were merely studying the fantastic growth of empowering 
digital culture or more sinisterly, preparing to protect the people from
anarchist
enemies of centralized authoritatives.

Now this list predicted this reaction and described how to preposition
defenses. Or was that just pretending overthrow of authoritatives?

Read the EFF and others' letter to Congress yesterday defending Wikileaks
and compare it to similar actions in the 1930s-1950s protesting clamp down 
on the worldwide Red Menace. Then read Sterling, Pilkington and Lanier
more closely. These smart guys know which way the wind is blowing and, 
as they write, they want no part in the insanity of taking freedom of
information 
too literally. In short, punish Assange, Wikileaks and co-conspirators as 
a lesson to others that dissidence is "taken very seriously."
