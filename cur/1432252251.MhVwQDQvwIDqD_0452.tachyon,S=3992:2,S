Yes, one would think that would be the case.

The B61-11 weighs 1200 lbs and can be delivered by the B-2 bomber and even
by an F-16.

Conventional bunker busters weight 5,000 lbs, and have to be delivered by
structurally modified B-52s.

What is worrysome here is that Bush is a big fan of the B61-11, which is
widely deployed throughout NATO, and the defense department recommended at
the beginning of this conflict that the B61-11 be used.

Anthrax Theatre has opened to rave reviews nationwide, and the Defense
Department considers nuclear retaliation appropriate for any WMD activity.

The US threatened to use nukes in Iraq, but backed down after Yeltsin
grumbled.  Putin is not grumbling over Bush's WarOnTerrorism(tm).

All of this makes the use of nukes in this conflict much more likely.

Here's an interesting article on Bush and the B61-11 which predates the
WTC downing.

It's a Bomb!
Bush's Baby Nuke
by Alistair Millar

On October 2, 1992, President George Bush signed into law a moratorium on

The current Bush Administration is studying options for the development
and production of a small, low-yield nuclear weapon called an
earth-penetrator or bunker-buster, which would burrow into the ground and
destroy a deeply buried hideaway of a "rogue" leader like Saddam Hussein.
