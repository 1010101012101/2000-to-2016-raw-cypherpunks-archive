No problem.  I often employ a quoted "x" to convey "so-called x", a 
shortcut that
can lead to misunderstandings.

I'll wager the taxpayer/consumer will foot the bill, one way or another.

Derivative to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it is easier to destroy wealth
than it is to create it.  So, on average, work/energy is required to create
or recreate wealth.  The collapse of a future global PKI, or of the integrity
of banking transactions, would represent a huge shift from order into chaos,
a decoherence of identities and orderliness amounting to a huge destruction
of wealth.  Recovery thus will require the recreation of wealth, in one form
or another.  This will require a correspondingly huge input of work.  So, who
does most of the work, in general?  You know the answer ;)
