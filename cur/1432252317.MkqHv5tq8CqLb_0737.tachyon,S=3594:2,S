By Tom Koehler<http://active.boeing.com/contactus.cfm?directed_to=feature_215>

Boeing engineer George Windsor sat in a small room at a Boeing building in
Seattle and picked up an iPhone. After a short series of finger movements
and taps, a miniature unmanned aircraft that's about as big as a pizza box
started to hover, turn and fly. In some cases, Windsor tapped on locations
on a map on the iPhone, and the UAV went to that spot; in other instances,
Windsor moved the phone up, down, left and right, and the vehicle moved
accordingly.

What made this flight demonstration even more fascinating is that the UAV
was hovering over a baseball field on the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology campus in Cambridge, Mass. b some 3,000 miles away.
