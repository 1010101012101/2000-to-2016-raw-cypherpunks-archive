Give the author a break, he actually cited K's principle in the friggin
WSJ.

Thanks for the forwards, RAH.  Some of us actually do appreciate the
editorial
service you're providing.  (A kindler, gentler cypherpunks.. ;-)

Thoughts about the neo-con nazi enslavement of 3l33ts: What was up with
Schindler's
factories?  They produced such crap for the Fatherland... heh heh
And how 'bout that siberian gas explosion, eh?  Can't even steal good

At first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their chains. Then
he was
enslaved by the kings. But he broke their chains. He was
enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race. But he broke
their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a man has
rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away
from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right of
man, and there is no right on earth above this right.
