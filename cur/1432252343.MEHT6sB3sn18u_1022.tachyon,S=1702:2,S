Isn't it *cheaper* (as well as more accurate) to have
preprinted ballots, optically scanned, then to have
an embedded computer print out a paper trail?

Ie, don't the benefits of volume printing beat the cheapest
printing tech?

Besides the other advantages of being self-verifiable,
more accurate, intuitive, unhackable, not having to be destroyed or
randomized (as
with serial polling-place-kept paper trails), etc?

Methinks the printing press / optical scanner industry is not
resisting the Diebold/tech-fetishist whores adequately...

I think Ben Franklin would agree.
