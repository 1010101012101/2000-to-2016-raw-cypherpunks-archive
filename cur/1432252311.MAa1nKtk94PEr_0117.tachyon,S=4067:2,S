Unfortunately, "whining" is just that.  Not much is done about it.

That's really a separate problem having to do with our insane mandatory
sentencing laws (primarily for drug-related offenses).  When they do release
folks, they are usually the ones convicted of really vicious crimes.

Well that would be nice, but why not focus in on the real problem, too many
laws?  Forget suing, leave parole alone, just get rid of the myriad of laws.

Than what, Utopia?  That isn't the choice now.  It's between getting out or
staying in a hell-hole prison.  Nobody is hurt by parole.  Get rid of the
laws and the parole issue goes away by itself.

Shoulda, woulda, coulda.  It's not, so why fantasize?  Nobody is hurt by
parole, itself.  Eliminate the bad laws, they are the real problem.
