DIA doesn't do background checks - the Defense Investigative Service
does that. And yes, I would talk to them, as they ONLY perform
consensual background investigations; in the language of the trade, they
are exclusively "doorbell-ringers."

Just ask to see the release form - they're required to show it.

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

Rather than make war on the American people and their
liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
