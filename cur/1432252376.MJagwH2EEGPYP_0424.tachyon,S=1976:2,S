No, no, they do not appropriate, they embrace and extend.

You know all the ads for "the butterfly"  (end user controlled 
censorware)   Not only does their censorware technology have a 
striking resemblance to surfmonkey's technology, but their 
human actor playing the butterfly bears a striking resemblance 
to the CEO of surfmonkey, who made a presentation to them 
wearing a monkey suit, that somewhat resembles their butterfly 
suit.

In defence of the brigands from Redmond, their extensions 
genuinely are improvements for the most part.

"Darknet" is an improvement on "blacknet", since it really does
come in shades of gray.
