        Those 3 things you mentioned violate the First on at least two counts,
free speech and press, 
and also the "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof" part --- the obscenity and kid porn
stuff is pure Judeo-Christian 
bigotry. Whose to say other religions wouldn't teach the opposite? Like the
worship of Ishtar (Easter) 
for instance, whose scriptures have Her saying "My father taught me the kissing
of the phallus". Or 
read "Coming of Age in Somoa" by Margret Mead.

  Gee, how pure and simple.

  What is your position on the First Amendment and:

      o "obscenity"

      o child pornography

      o generated non-child child pornography
