...Sinicki, who has been job hunting in his wife's native France,
doesn't blame Bush for what he believes is happening in America, but
he doesn't believe Bush will change things for the better, either.

"All these things were going on before Bush got elected," he said.
"But I also think they got worse since Bush got elected. He's a
symptom of the problem and he's making it worse."
