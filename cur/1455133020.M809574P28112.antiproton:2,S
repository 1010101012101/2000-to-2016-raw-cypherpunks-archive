Your immediate next door neighbor, yes. But forget crossing a street or
wiring the house two doors down if your immediate neighbor doesn't agree.
One should definitely use wired links when possible, but this problem is
why the telcos and cable companies are able to maintain their local
monopolies/oligopolies.

Sneakernet replication is an interesting option if your goal is to be
hyper-local and disconnected, like a micropower FM station or something.
There are villages in Africa that send and receive email using a similar
system, where a van with a server and wifi drives from village to village,
exchanging files with a local village server using something akin to UUCP,
or the van itself acts as a hotspot for villages without a local server.
Could do the same thing with attribution-resistant bootleg servers planted
in stealthy locations.
