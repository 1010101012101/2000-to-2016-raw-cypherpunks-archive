How bad do you two drones want it? I don't work for free (as any
self-respecting C-A-C-L should respect).

3 months, at say $10k/month sounds fair to stroke your egos.

When I get the check with cash up front you got it.

Put up, or shut up.

(and no, I wouldn't become a fucking lawyer under any circumstances. I got
 more self respect.)
