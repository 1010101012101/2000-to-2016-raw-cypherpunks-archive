In an anarchic society, or under a government that did not define 
and defend IP, TCPA/Palladium would probably give roughly the 
right amount of protection to intellectual property by technical 
means in place of legal means.

Chances are that the thinking behind Palladium is not "Let us sell 
out to the Hollywood lobby" but rather "Let us make those !@#$$%^& 
commie chinese pay for their *&^%$##@ software".

Of course, in a society with both legal and technical protection 
of IP, the likely outcome is oppressive artificial monopolies 
sustained both by technology and state power.

I would certainly much prefer TCPA/Palladium in place of existing
IP law.  What I fear is that instead legislation and technology
will each reinforce the other.
