I've put the content from John Young's Cryptome DVDs on http://cryptome.at
(this is just a Cryptome mirror and a Tor (shrek2) appliance, and
nothing else -- you probably can access it from inside Tor though
I haven't checked it yet). I'll try to keep it synched with the main Cryptome
manually.

Despite the .at domain the server is hosted in Nuremberg, Germany.

Thanks go to John Young for making that content available, both
online and via DVDs.
