Which brings me to another point, what if in 1991 Phil Zimmermann said
you must use his bbs/email server to use PGP, and wouldn't release the
source for the encrypting client? I wonder if it would be as popular
as it is today if that was the case.

I find it also amusing:

To me this seems like a big middle finger to totalitarian government
dictating how and who it must be used by. Of course by this point the
government couldn't stop people using it even if they wanted to, the
source was everywhere.

Given his interest in anti-nuclear activism, I wonder if in today's
world that could have been construed as anti-government and possibly a
person of interest by the government.

The other question is what's to stop Apple being legally forced to
push a modified copy of this software to a person's phone that has a
backdoor?

While people might say this isn't possible due to XXX law, what is to
prevent one being created that changes that. Encryption technology's
effectiveness should not be based on what the government is allowed
and not allowed to do. I guess this is an inherent problem with
storing data in the cloud.

Poorer people of poorer nations won't be able to afford this, and
neither will the average citizen care enough to pay this.

I don't imagine some factory worker in china for example who earns 50
cents a day being able to pay for this so he can talk about how shitty
the conditions are.

To me it seems like it will only get used by businesses and enterprise
needing security abroad rather than activists residing in areas where
they would need it in order to have some semblance of freedom.
