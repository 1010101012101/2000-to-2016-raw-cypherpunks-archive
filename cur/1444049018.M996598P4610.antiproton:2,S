Now, the government in the USA owes $46 trillion,
US corporations owe $15 trillion, US individuals
owe $13 trillion plus there are $315 trillion in
outstanding wall street derivatives. (Few Americans
know what a derivative is, but we as a nation are
on the hook for up to $315 trillion in additional
debt because of these derivatives.) These debt
figures continue to escalate with each passing month

Haven't seen the debt about $315T on the interwebs,
possibly due to ignorance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Financial_position_of_the_United_States&oldid=661507517
The financial position of the United States includes
assets of at least $269.6 trillion (1576% of GDP)
and debts of $145.8 trillion (852% of GDP) to produce
a net worth of at least $123.8 trillion (723% of GDP,)
[a] as of Q1 2014.

QUESTION:

Is there a citable reference for the debt of 
$315 treeeeelion?

I mean, if I troll americans about this and cite .ru
they almost surely will call me a commie.

I don't trust pravda.ru much, but lying about numbers
which can easily be disproved doesn't appear very
likely to me.
