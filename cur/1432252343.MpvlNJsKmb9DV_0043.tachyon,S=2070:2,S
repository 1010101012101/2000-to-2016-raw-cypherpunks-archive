I worked on a commercial digital money system a few years ago. One of 
their business models was almost identical to Amos': stick cash in a 
kiosk to get electronic money. It'd be interesting to see how that 
system plays with Amos' patent. (I won't be able to observe directly, 
as I was fired from that company because I'm an incompetent slacker 
(boss's view) or because the boss was a jack-booted jackass (my view).)
