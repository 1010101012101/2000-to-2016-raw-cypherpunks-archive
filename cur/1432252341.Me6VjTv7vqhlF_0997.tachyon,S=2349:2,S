Where did this "of color" nonsense get started?

I thought colored people wanted to be called by other names, now they 
and their whiteliberal supporters are routinely using the silly name 
"people of color."

(Of course, we live in an age where homosexuals call themselves 
"queers" and propagate the name--Queer Nation, Queers of Color, Queer 
Eye for the Pervert Guy, etc.--and yet file lawsuits when others call 
them queers. And we live in an age where negroes call themselves and 
other negroes "niggers" and name their minstrel acts "Niggaz with 
Attitude" but then insist that persons of whiteness call them "NWA" so 
as not to use the "offensive" "N-word.")

If the coloreds want to be called that, fine with me.
