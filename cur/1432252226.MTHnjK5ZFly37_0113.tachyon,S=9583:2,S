For cypherpunks, net-thinkers is a list Vinnie started a looong time ago,
with a bunch of, heh, hoary old mac-internet pioneers :-) on it, including
Adam Engst.

Clearly Adam means to quote Lucky, in the message forwarded below, and not me.


Adam's right, obviously, and I'm proof.

When I first got to cypherpunks, in May 1994, it was with a SLIP feed from
The Internet Access Company (TIAC), in the Boston suburb of Bedford, using
the first(?) edition of Adam's book, which Vinnie made me buy from Quantum
Books in Cambridge.

I was TIAC customer 640 or so, and they sold me a mostly flat rate (I never
used all the hours they charged me a flat rate for) for a static IP address
on their backbone. Or what became their backbone, anyway, as I remember an
excited customer support person telling me so in a very excited voice some
3 years later when they had about 50,000 customers or so. TIAC has since
merged up, but I don't remember who to, as by that time I was long gone...

Cheers,
RAH

This is close to correct, but not quite. In fact, along with bundling
MacTCP with my Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh (which enabled Mac
users to get MacTCP AND a book of instruction for $30 rather than pay
Apple $60 for just MacTCP, if you could find it), the book also came
with a flat-rate SLIP account from Northwest Nexus, my ISP in
Bellevue, WA. What happened was that we'd gone around looking for a
decent SLIP account to bundle with the book, but weren't able to find
anything under $11 per hour. I casually mentioned this to Ed Morin,
the owner of Northwest Nexus (which I'd always used for ISP service
in Washington), and said that I assumed they didn't want to be
bundled because the book would have international distribution and I
thought they wanted to be only a local ISP. Ed said he could have
such problems, and a 4 hour telephone call (which included several
conference calls with Livingston technical support to configure
Nexus's PortMasters for dynamic IP addressing, which had just
appeared in the feature set) later, we had flat-rate SLIP working.
That flat-rate SLIP account was tremendously popular, and Northwest
Nexus attracted customers from all over the world who were willing to
pay long distance charges to avoid the usurious rates for SLIP
locally.

That was the key event in pricing SLIP down, in my opinion, since TIA
came quite a bit later. TIA was another moving force, without
question, but not the first one. I wrote about it in the second
edition of ISKM.

And what I mostly remember about Netcom in those early days was that
their technical support was almost totally non-existent. I helped
many ISKM readers solve problems with Netcom because Netcom wouldn't
respond to email or phone calls. And since I never had a Netcom
account, it was mostly a matter of garnering the specific bits of
setup information from some people so I could help others.

cheers... -Adam

PS: And to bring the story full circle, the person who introduced me
to TIA before it was released so I could write about it in the second
edition of ISKM was Drummond Reed of Intermind, who has subsequently
been the driving force behind the just-released eXtensible Name
Service (XNS) technology that I'm helping guide via the non-profit
XNSORG. Ironically XNS is almost the complete opposite of TIA. Where
TIA was a quick hack that was immediately useful, it also had a very
short lifespan and disappeared entirely as soon as the hardware
appeared for all ISPs to do PPP. In contrast, XNS is a broad
technology platform that has relatively few immediate uses, but
which, if it succeeds, will affect a vast number of things on the
Internet for a long time to come.
