Some thoughts to think about regarding our constitutional rights

Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties
Sung to the tune of Santa Claus is Coming to Town

You better watch out,
You better not pout,
You better not cry.
I'm telling you why.
John ashcroft's coming to town.

He sees you with your lawyer.
He listens to every phone;
He reads everyone's email,
and he locks you all alone.

With little tin guns
And tiny cellphones
Rooty hoot, hoot, he's breaking in homes,
Big Brother is coming to town.

He knows when you are traveling.
He knows who you're around;
Tried in military courtrooms,
Not a lawyer can be found.

He's makin' a list,
and checking for race,
Gonna arrest those who are dark of face.
Big Brother's coming to town.

You better watch out,
You better not pout,
You better not cry.
I'm telling you why.
Big Brother's coming to town.
