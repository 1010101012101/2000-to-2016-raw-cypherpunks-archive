	50 years ago most farmers weren't getting anywhere near the crop 
yields they are today.

	Most farmers who don't use them are lucky to feed themselves and 
their families, much less whole other nations.

	No, he's becoming extinct because (1) The federal government is 
more than willing to pay many of them not to grow food and (b) He's 
getting bought out by the corporate farm companies, which are far more 
efficient and use herbicides, pesticides, genetic manipulation, and 
fertilizer.
