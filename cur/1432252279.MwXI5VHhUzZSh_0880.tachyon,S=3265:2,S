The method used by PGP phone against a man in the middle attack is
impossible for text programs, though fairly easy for voice and video.

A chat program needs a server, or interacting network of servers to
advertise presence.  This server could also act as a public key
server, invisibly to user, guaranteeing stability of identity -- that
this presence was the same entity as had been logged on under the same
name in previous sessions.
