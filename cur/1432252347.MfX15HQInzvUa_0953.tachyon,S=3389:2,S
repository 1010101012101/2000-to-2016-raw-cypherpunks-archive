Um, if there's any hint of a trail back to the sender where's the
anonymity?

Trust the recipient to use a remailer chain for the return path. or not.
Include the return mail address in the body if you choose to. Isn't that
what anonymity is about? Placing the choice for the disclosure of
information and identity in the user's hands and nobody else's?
