I completely disagree with what is apparently the prevailing notion on this
'dead' list.

Encrypted email is ramping upward rapidly, in the form of big business and the
need for their Excos to protect news of mergers/acquisitions/'unexpected'
losses and so on. Oh, and don't forget all of the mundane traffic including
account numbers and so on. And St May for the 'glorious' hackers: Without
their proliferation there'd be less motivation for enterprises to encrypt.

Now the real question I have is whether this helps the little guy in any way,
because the IP addresses of encrypted packets are themselves not encrypted, so
that it's easy for NSA eavesdroppers to throw away the much less interesting
enterprise traffic.

But I have little doubt that we're slowing approaching the knee in the
hockeystick in terms of encrypted traffic.
