Mutual benefit societies didn't arise 
	"due to the inherent weakness of the state"
any more than horses appeared because of the need to pull carts.
Mutual benefit societies arose because they were ways for
people to help each other and to get help.

In some places, the state has taken over functions that people
used to get through social institutions, and in some places,
the state has helped business drive out the mutual benevolence groups
(for instance, in the US, banks and insurance companies had politicians 
make banking and insurance regulations that drove out many of the lending 
functions that benevolence groups provided.)

To some extent, the social institutions were strongest within
immigrant ethnic groups and other frontier social groups,
and weakened as cities grew and people assimilated into them -
in a mass society it's often easier to let the state be the
"somebody" who ought to do something rather than doing the work 
yourself.
