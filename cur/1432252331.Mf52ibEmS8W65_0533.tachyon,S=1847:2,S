First, subscribe to RISKS.

=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or
equivalent)
 if possible and convenient for you.  Alternatively, via majordomo,
 send e-mail requests to <risks-request@csl.sri.com> with one-line body
   subscribe [OR unsubscribe]
 which requires your ANSWERing confirmation to majordomo@CSL.sri.com .
 If Majordomo balks when you send your accept, please forward to risks.
 [If E-mail address differs from FROM:  subscribe "other-address <x@y>" ;
 this requires PGN's intervention -- but hinders spamming subscriptions,
etc.]
 Lower-case only in address may get around a confirmation match glitch.
