"So as the conclusion I was punished by people of Finland after I had told 
them
the truth,which was my job in the first place. I was hired to write my 
thesis on
their business consolidation and I told the truth. As we know now today 
Ahlstrom
Machinery does not exist any longer."

Well, one things for sure. This guy ain't from the US. He actually seems 
suprised that some corporate bigwigs shut him down for putting roadblocks on 
their deal. Next he'll be writing in with the big revelation that, even 
though the company went down the crapper as a result of the deal, the 
deal-makers made out personally like bandits.

Welcome to Capitalism, m'friend.
