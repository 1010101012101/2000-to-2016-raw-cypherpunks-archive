 >-Allen Actually, I have enough background in all these areas, to the 
point where I
think if I were given a plutonium "pit," I could probably implement the bomb
in about 6 months of part-time tinkering.  The main engineering problem
would be finding/producing two different homogeneous explosives with
reliably defined/measured detonation velocities, and calculating the shape
of the "lenses" required to cover the pit, and then machining or casting the
parts.  (I'd probably also want to simulate the mechanical "impedance match"
of the chemical explosive to the (dense) plutonium; and as I understand it
they use the mechanical equivalent of a transformer to do the matching.
Sorry, but I think in terms of electronics, not mechanics.  Sue me.) BTW, I 
think I've already solved the problem of producing a few dozen
absolutely simultaneous trigger explosions (+/- 100 nanoseconds) around the
periphery at the lens foci, without using multiple electronic detonators.
(in fact, a single blasting cap would do nicely.)  "But the margins of this
book are too small to contain it"  Heh heh! Jim Bell
