Bank issues chaumian blinded tokens.  Each token issued must appear in 
the merkle tree.  If you have a blinded token that is not in the tree, 
not a valid token.   Each node of the tree contains the sum of the value 
of all tokens under that node. Further you check the validity of each 
branch of the tree on which your tokens appear.  So total number of 
tokens issued is correct.

Each unblinded token cashed is added into the Merkle tree.  If not in 
tree, could be recashed.  So total number tokens paid out on is correct.

Difference between these two numbers is bank liabilities for outstanding 
bearer tokens. So bank liability is known, even if bankers are lying 
through their teeth.
