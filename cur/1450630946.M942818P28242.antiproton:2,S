*Turkish Internet hit with massive DDoS attack*

By Efe Kerem Sozeri

/Last updated Dec 17, 2015, 10:07am /

Turkey <http://dailydot.com/tags/turkey> is under massive cyberattack.=20

Since Monday morning, the country's official domain name servers have
been under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
<http://turk-internet.com/portal/yazigoster.php?yaziid=3D51709>. The
attack=E2=80=99s perpetrators are unknown, but it reveals the vulnerabili=
ties of
the country=E2=80=99s Internet infrastructure.

All domain names that end with Turkey=E2=80=99s two-letter country code .=
tr
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tr> must be registered by NIC.tr
<https://www.nic.tr/index.php?USRACTN=3DSTATICHTML&PAGE=3Dabout_corpident=
>,
an administration office in Turkey=E2=80=99s capital of Ankara. Besides i=
ts
registration duties, NIC.tr maintains the academic internet backbone for
Turkish universities. It=E2=80=99s also the main service for .tr domain n=
ames,
making it a valuable target.

On Monday morning Turkish time, traces of an attack became noticeable.
By noon, NIC.tr=E2=80=99s five nameservers, ns1.nic.tr through ns5.nic.tr=
,
werecompletely down <http://daghan.net/tr-alan-adlari-problemi.dgn>
under a 40 Gigabits per second DDoS <http://dailydot.com/tags/ddos> attac=
k.

    .@adililhan <https://twitter.com/adililhan> Two of the routes
    hosting nic.tr experienced instability yesterday

    <https://twitter.com/DynResearch/status/676782506172162048>

Europe=E2=80=99s regional Internet registry, the RIPE Network Coordinatio=
n
Centre, serves as a secondary Domain Name System to Nic.tr. RIPE was
also severely affected
<https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/dns-wg/2015-December/003184.html=
>.
As noted
<https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/dns-wg/2015-December/003184.html=
> by its
manager of the Global Information Infrastructure, Romero Zwart, the
attack was =E2=80=9Cmodified to evade=E2=80=9D RIPE's mitigation measures=
=2E As of this
writing, the attack is still going on at around 40 Gbps, disrupting
working hours
<https://stat.ulakbim.gov.tr/ulaknet/omurga_details.php?name=3Dinternet-t=
oplam&type=3Dbps&dev=3Danauc&place=3Domurga&details=3Dyes>
in Turkey.

DDoS attacks, which overload servers with requests for information, are
a simple way of disrupting a website for a brief amount of time. The
cost of hiring attacking
<http://www.dailydot.com/business/botnet-rent-stress-test-paid-ddos-attac=
ks/> botnets
<http://dailydot.com/tags/botnets>, huge armies of compromised computers
that can all visit a site at the same time, is getting cheaper, and the
size of attacks is growing each year
<http://www.scmagazine.com/report-shows-42-percent-of-attacks-leveraged-m=
ore-than-1-gbps-of-attack-traffic/article/399206/>. In
2013, an average DDoS attack was about 2 Gbps. In 2014, it=E2=80=99s near=
ly 8 Gbps.

While a 40 Gbps attack still sounds huge, security experts
<http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/the-new-normal-200-400-gbps-ddos-atta=
cks/>
say that even 400 Gbps attacks, like one recently reported
<https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-behind-a-400gbps-ntp-ampli=
fication-ddos-attack/>
by DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare, are =E2=80=9Cthe new normal.=E2=80=
=9D

What makes the Turkish attack so damaging is the attackers=E2=80=99
sophisticated choice of target. By focusing on a relatively small group
of IP addresses, the five nameservers of NIC.tr, the attackers managed
to =E2=80=9Ctake down the DNS system of a whole country with a 40 Gbps at=
tack:=E2=80=9D

    =E2=80=94 Mehmet Akcin (@mhmtkcn) December 15, 2015
    <https://twitter.com/mhmtkcn/status/676692198738366464>

As the country=E2=80=99s official domain suffix, .tr domain names are ver=
y
popular in Turkey, and many local companies want their businesses
officially recognized for their local audience. There are about 400,000
websites <https://www.nic.tr/index.php?USRACTN=3DSTATISTICS> with
localized Turkish domain names, including 300,000 companies. It's also
used by government institutions, schools, municipalities, Turkish e-mail
servers <https://www.nic.tr/forms/eng/policies.pdf>, and the Turkish
military.

When the attack left NIC.tr=E2=80=99s DNS service non-responding, practic=
ally
all .tr domain names became unreachable. Besides the private Turkish
companies, official government businesses such as vital population
registry queries, remained interrupted for more than a day. Internet
access at university campuses are still down or extremely slow.

On Monday evening, Turkey=E2=80=99sNational Response Center for Cyber Eve=
nts
<https://www.usom.gov.tr/> closed all incoming traffic to NIC.tr from
outside of Turkey, which made 400,000 websites with .tr domain names
unreachable from the rest of the world, all e-mails sent to companies
and organisations with .tr domains bounced back with the =E2=80=9Cunknown=
 host=E2=80=9D
error.

Response Center changed its policy late Monday night, and NIC.tr has
since been running a selective block policy for a number of suspected
root IP addresses. DNS service for .tr domains were also re-configured
<http://turk-internet.com/portal/yazigoster.php?yaziid=3D51709> to
distribute the queries among public and private servers, including a
Turkish Internet service providers Superonline and Vodafone.

It=E2=80=99s notoriously difficult to attribute where a cyberattack comes=
 from.
Many Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia
<http://dailydot.com/tags/russia> as the source of the attack. Russia=E2=80=
=99s
cyber warfare capabilities
<http://cyberwardesk.com/5-russian-weapons-of-war-turkey-should-fear/>
are an established weapon, believed to be used against Estonia in 2007
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia>, Georgia in
2008
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War=
>,
and Ukraine in 2014
<http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Global-Viewpoint/2014/0312/Russia-s-=
cyber-weapons-hit-Ukraine-How-to-declare-war-without-declaring-war>.

With Turkey=E2=80=99s recent downing of a Russian jet
<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34912581> near Syrian border,
and with the ongoingtroll wars
<http://www.dailydot.com/politics/russia-turkey-missle-turkey-troll-war-t=
witter/>
between Erdo=C4=9Fan=E2=80=99s and Putin=E2=80=99s social media campaigne=
rs, DDoS botnets
could be the next battleground. Some experts have speculated this is a
response to Turkey=E2=80=99s nationalist cyber teams, who stand accused o=
f
organising aDDoS attack on Russia=E2=80=99s Sputnik news
<http://in.sputniknews.com/russia/20151208/1016691128/sputnik-turkey-ddos=
-attack.html>.

    It's highly probable that ddos attacks on nic.tr and tr ISPs are
    retaliation to recent @sputnik_TR <https://twitter.com/sputnik_TR>
    ddos attacks

    =E2=80=94 Umut Simsek (@umutsimse_k) December 15, 2015
    <https://twitter.com/umutsimse_k/status/676711878136102912>

DDoS attacks are by nature distributed, therefore the identity of the
attackers could never be found out; but the consequences identified the
vulnerabilities of the target very well.
