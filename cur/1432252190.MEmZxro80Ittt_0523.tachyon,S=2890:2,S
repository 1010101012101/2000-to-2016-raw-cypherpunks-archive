Smartcard readers (some of them with display) are semi-widespread
at least in Germany (a dust-covered ReinerSCT (sans display)) with a smartcard
which was once used for financial HBCI transactions sticking out is sitting on 
the tabletop behind the monitor). Next generation
FinTS (HBCI successor) will be based on mandatory smartcard with readers.
I'm not sure they're doing the entire transaction crypto in the smartcard
reader compartment (can't pull up the specs), but it appears likely.

Simple USB or serial smartcard readers go for 20-30 EUR, and those with a 
display not much more.

The banking and financial industry is one of most insanely conservative
I've ever heard of. It takes massive phishing and keylogging fraud to make
them change their mind over the course of half a decade.
