amazing and alarming (or perhaps not so amazing these days)

(Also, note his wife's firm: Spectrum Print And Mail = SPAM)

>Convicted of 23 felonies for computer crimes, Jeffrey Dean
>was sent to prison for four years. Shortly after his release
>from incarceration, his company was awarded one of the
>largest ballot printing contracts in history, and he began
>programming voting systems that later became Diebold Election
>Systems.
>
>In a 2003 deposition, Dean states that he was a scapegoat
>who was left holding the bag in a series of unapproved payments
>from Culp, Guterson & Grader, one of the most politically connected
>law firms in Washington state.
>
>One of this firm's partners at the time was Egil "Bud" Krogh,
>who headed the White House "plumbers" unit under Richard Nixon.
>Krogh ordered the burglary of Pentagon Papers whistleblower
>Daniel Ellsberg.
>
>Dean claimed that other persons from the firm were involved in
>a scheme, and upon discovery of illicit payments (averaging
>$14,000/month) he was made to take the blame. Krogh became a
>partner at Culp Guterson & Grader in 1984, Dean says he received
>illicit payments of approximately $15,000 per month from 1985 - 1987.
>
>Like Jeffrey Dean, Krogh did time in prison -- four months for
>Watergate-related crimes. Krogh was disbarred, but after a fight
>from a Culp Guterson & Grader attorney, his credentials were
>restored. At the time, the firm was called "Culp Dwyer Guterson
>& Grader."
>
>'He [Krogh] was hired on the merits of his character, intelligence
>and skills as a lawyer,'' said William L. Dwyer, the firm's senior
>partner, who had represented Mr. Krogh in his disbarment fight.
>Dwyer became a U.S. district judge.
>
>DEAN BECOMES A BALLOT PRINTER
>
>Shortly after Jeffrey Dean was released from prison on the Culp
>Guterson Grader matter, a company owned by his wife (but run
>by Jeffrey Dean) was awarded one of the largest ballot-printing
>contracts in history, with King County, Washington. In SEC documents,
>this company (Spectrum Print & Mail Ltd.) lists assets located in the
>Seattle area, British Columbia, San Francisco and in the Norwalk (CA)
>location that houses the Los Angeles County Elections Division.
>
>DEAN DEVELOPS COMPUTERIZED ELECTION SYSTEMS
>
>According to depositions taken in 2003, Jeffrey Dean programmed
>the ballot sorting software used to process incoming and outgoing
>mail-in ballots. He also developed the Vote Remote software used
>to track and authenticate mail-in ballots.
>
>"Key logs" from King County Elections show that Jeffrey Dean was
>given intimate access to the GEMS server (Diebold central tabulating
>software); internal memos from Diebold refer to an ongoing consulting
>arrangement with Dean, and document that he had management
>involvement in the touch-screens, the 1.96 version of the optical
>scan,
>the votercard encoder and the Windows CE operating system used in
>Diebold voting machines. In addition, during recent litigation Dean
>called
>Peter G. Martin as a witness, indicating that he had worked closely
>with
>Martin, who programmed the new upcoming High Speed Central Count
>system.
>
>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH THE DEAN FAMILY
>
>Black Box Voting has learned that Jeffrey Dean and his wife Deborah
>have recently been ordered into Chapter 7 bankruptcy by a trustee
>who become fed up with their "gamesmanship" in recent attempts to
>obstruct discovery of their assets.
>
>A 25 YEAR HISTORY OF TROUBLE
>
>Jeffrey Dean has a 25-year history of financial problems, tax liens
>and litigation, going back to a company he formed while working for
>Boeing. Though he refers to this company in recent depositions as
>"Astec," its real name was Advanced Systems Technology, Inc.,
>a company run by Dean and partner Michael C. Redman. Dean
>represents that this company did aircraft design, and says that
>he sold it to Raleigh-Durham Aviation in 1980. Legal documents
>show that he had a $700,000 tax lien imposed on him in connection
>with the "failed business" in 1984, and several creditors filed civil
>suits against him in 1979 and 1980.
>
>By 1982, Dean was a contractor for Culp, Guterson & Grader. Assets
>began accumulating under his wife's names. When Dean divorced
>his first wife and married wife #2, Lorimay, she began accumulating
>real estate under an entity called "JAL Investments Inc." This entity
>and its real estate was transferred to Dean's third wife, Deborah M.
>[Pederson] Dean.
>
>These efforts failed when it was revealed that over $180,000 of
>inappropriately received funds were spent on Deborah Dean's house,
>and that Deborah had been cashing checks as large as $10,000 at a
>time from the illicit funds.
>
>Although she was involved in litigation over restitution issues,
>Deborah Dean was not prosecuted in the thefts from Culp, Guterson
>& Grader.
>
>Jeffrey Dean entered an Alford Plea admitting to 23 felony counts,
>and was ordered to appear at the Shelton Correctional facility to
>begin his incarceration. Instead, he failed to show up and went to
>Oregon, where he apparently lived under a different name. Bench
>warrants were issued and he went to prison.
>
>Meanwhile, wife Deborah began "Spectrum Print & Mail Ltd."
>According to depositions, this firm was mostly delivering newspapers
>to contract deals like the Washington ferries.
>
>Shortly after Jeffrey Dean got out of prison, however, Spectrum
>Print & Mail got into ballot printing and designing software for
>elections.
>
>This ballot printing plant, using software Dean claims to have
>developed, handles ballot printing and mail-ballot processing for
>counties like King County (WA) and Los Angeles County, Fresno
>County, San Diego County, Alameda County (CA), and for the state
>of Georgia and many other locations.
>
>The Deans were rewarded for Jeffrey Dean's ballot printing and
>election software programming work with a $4 million buyout by
>Global Election Systems shortly before election 2000. The Deans
>became the largest stockholders of Global Election Systems, and
>Jeffrey Dean took a position on the board of directors.
>
>In January 2002, Diebold Inc. purchased Global Election Systems.
>Jeffrey Dean says he resigned on the same day Diebold bought the
>company. Oddly, in a 2003 deposition, Jeffrey Dean claims that his
>contact with Global was always Pat Green -- but Green is a Diebold
>employee, not a Global Election Systems employee. Yet Diebold claims
>it hasn't worked with Jeffrey Dean.
>
>The Dean's ballot printing company was acquired by Diebold in the
>Global Election Systems acquisition.
>
>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
>
>The Vote Remote software and the absentee ballot processing
>software developed by Jeffrey Dean was never submitted for
>certification, has not been examined by anyone, and due to
>technicalities
>in the certification regulations, is not subject to certification.
>Several
>counties have recently announced plans to force voters into all
>mail-in
>voting, including King County, Jeffrey Dean's first elections client.
>
>Exactly what Jeffrey Dean was doing to the GEMS database
>program, what "oversight" he was providing to the touch-screen
>technology purchased by Diebold, and what expertise he provided
>for the votercard encoder, the optical scan 1.96 series, and the
>upcoming High Speed Central Count are not publicly known at this time.
>Diebold claims that the software is proprietary and will not allow
>public officials or political parties to examine the system.
>
>DIEBOLD CLAIMS MERIT FURTHER SCRUTINY
>
>Diebold claims that it did not work with Jeffrey Dean after acquiring
>Global Election Systems in Jan. 2002. However, the Dean depositions
>reveal that in May and June 2002, during the time a "rob-georgia"
>patch was created, Jeffrey Dean was called back to do consulting
>for Diebold.
>
>The Deans have been accused of obstructiveness and
>evasion by attorneys seeking to recover funds in a pending bankruptcy
>case. Specifically, when asked to identify monies paid by or due from
>Diebold Election Systems, they omitted answers.
>
>YA'LL COME BACK NOW: DOCUMENTATION GOING UP SHORTLY
>
>Depositions, documents, and supporting documentation will be
>posted on the Black Box Voting Web site this week. These documents
>include depositions, bankruptcy papers, criminal court records, SEC
>documents and civil litigation records for Jeffrey Dean and related
>companies.
