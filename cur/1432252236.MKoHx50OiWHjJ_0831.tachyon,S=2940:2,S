Georgia County Fed Up with Too Many Rules and Regulations

Excerpt: Fed up with the complexity of zoning ordinances and various other 
land use restrictions already in existence, and a new raft of rules handed 
down by the state government, elected officials in Habersham County, 
Georgia, took a radical and unprecedented step. They voted to eliminate all 
land use regulations for the county, as well as the planning commission and 
building inspectors.
