The bank, of course, has to choose a withdrawer to tag, or a small
subset of withdrawers, or this doesn't work. Note that the depositor is
not tagged, the withdrawer is. And if the withdrawer has simply done an
exchange anonymously, nor is she.

Why would they fail? Since the bank cannot tell its own junk signature
from the invented junk signatures, the bank would have to honour these
requests. This sounds to me like a bank that is going bust fast.

If a bank wants to cheat, it can do so despite a ZK proof - it simply
refuses to cash the coins - claiming, for example, a double-spend, or
just saying "no". So, given that marking coins with junk signatures is:

a) Only effective if you want to mark a small subset

b) Costs you a fortune if anyone finds out you are doing it,

I am not entirely convinced by this argument. Nevertheless, the ZK
option is implemented in Lucre (and documented in the paper) should any
mint wish to use it.

Cheers,

Bven.
