Bear, the net is letting people see who / what their neighbors really
are, and really are interested in.  Whenever you mix cultures
you find xenophobia and suppression of the minor cultures.  The internet
is merely stirring things up a little more.

That's my long-term optimistic take on what you write, which I agree with.
