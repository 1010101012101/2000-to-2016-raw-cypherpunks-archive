Oddly, I've never had to deal with RFID sensors, but an important  
point is that the vast number of exploitable sensor networks were  
never rolled out or designed with any use in mind except very narrow  
and purely benign cases. It is the ability to aggregate and integrate  
these myriad special-purpose sensor networks that no one would ever  
consider to be Big-Brother-esque that creates the most potential.

Mobile phones are a great source, though I think you overestimate the  
extent to which they are regulated for privacy, but  you could  
eliminate directly monitoring mobile phones at the source without  
significantly reducing the amount of information available. Mobile  
phones are the most visible source, but far from a necessary one.

More accurately, the perceived threat is that it creates opportunities  
for people *other* than the entrenched interests.

Defining "data about me" is damn tricky, and anything that remains is  
susceptible to esoteric analytics that can extract "data about me".

That is not the definition of a fair market.  Also, what is germane  
information with respect to a market is very much in the eye of the  
beholder. One man's crap data is another man's gold mine.
