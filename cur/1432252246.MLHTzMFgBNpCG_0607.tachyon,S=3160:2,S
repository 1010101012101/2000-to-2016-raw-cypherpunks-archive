MOSCOW (AP) - Secretary of State Colin Powell made no progress in
discussions with his Russian counterpart in overcoming Moscow's
unexplained refusal to grant visas to Peace Corps volunteers, a U.S.
Embassy official said Tuesday.

U.S. officials are negotiating with the Foreign Ministry and the
Education Ministry, but the visa problem - which has forced Washington
to cancel plans to send a new batch of volunteers to Russia this year -
remains unresolved, said an embassy official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

Goodness!  You mean the US is stuck with only embassy staff, no "Peace
Corp" Spies in the field?
