So why are you publicizing it after the fact? Is it really worth the risk
you're taking by mentioning it just to respond to a taunt by some ignorant
smugster behind a remailer? If questioning your commitment is all it takes
to push your buttons, I'd say that's less than optimal. 

I'm sure anyone who bears ill-will to the group is finding this whole thread
quite instructive--undoubtedly the point of the original post in the first
place. Good show. How sickening to think that now you have to worry
about getting anti-paramilitary training statutes dumped on you (on top of
anything else) just because a few people couldn't resist showing up a stupid
troll.

Even worse,in true "have you stopped beating your wife" fashion, it makes it
appear that everyone who posts here and is passionate about encryption is doing
something rightfully covered by the sedtion laws, which couldn't be further
from the truth. I resent this profoundly, but I'll talk about what and why I do
what I do (or don't do) on my own time, not as a response to someone baiting 
me. 

No need to be on such a hair trigger: the archives speak for themselves.
For you to keep tossing out all this sucker-bait-for-feds in the name of
furthering your one-man strategic deterrence campaign is a bit excessive.
Once you've established your credibility there's no real reason to keep
raising the stakes. Especially not in response to someone blowing virtual
spitwads at you from behind a remailer. 

Here's hoping your temper doesn't get the better of you.

~Faustine.
