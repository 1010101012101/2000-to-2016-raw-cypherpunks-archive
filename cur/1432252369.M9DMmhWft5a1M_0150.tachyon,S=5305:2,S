Or they contacted the NSA alumni working in the industry.

I think it is subtler that that. Trying to block a strong cipher is too
obvious. Much better to push for something that is overly complicated or
too difficult for end users to make use of.

* The bizare complexity of IPSEC.

* Allowing deployment of DNSSEC to be blocked in 2002 by blocking a
technical change that made it possible to deploy in .com.

* Proposals to deploy security policy information (always send me data
encrypted) have been consistently filibustered by people making nonsensical
objections.

Agreed, the PRNG is the easiest thing to futz with.

It would not surprise me if we discovered kleptography at work as well.

I think the thing that discouraged all that was the decision to make end
user certificates hard to obtain (still no automatic spec) and expire after
a year.
