YOUR ADDRESS WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ME BY A GOOD FRIEND WHO WORKS WITH THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, HE ASSURED ME OF YOUR COMPANY’S VIABILITY AND CAPABILITY IN BUSINESS TRANSACTION.I THEREFORE PICKED A KEEN INTEREST IN THE IMPORTATION OF YOUR COMPANY’S   PRODUCTS AND ALSO TO REQUEST FOR THIS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

I AM DR.ALEX CHIOMA, THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC).I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE NNPC AND HAS BEEN  MANDATED TO SEEK FOR THE ASSISTANT OF A RELIABLE FOREIGN COMPANY THROUGH WHICH WE CAN TRANSFER THE SUM OF THIRTY TWO MILLION,  FIFTY THREE THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY 
(US$32,053,000.00).THIS MONEY IS NOW DEPOSITED IN THE NNPC TREASURY ACCOUNT WITH THE CENTRAL

ORIGIN OF THE FUND:
THE SUM AROSE FROM THE DELIBERATE OVER-INVOICING OF A CONTRACT AWARDED BY THE NNPC TO A FOREIGN FIRM FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS PLANT (LNG) IN BONNY, SOUTHERN NIGERIA DURING THE LAST MILITARY REGIME.  THIS CONTRACT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY EXECUTED AND COMMISSIONED AND THE CONTRACTOR THAT HANDLED THIS CONTRACT  HAS COLLECTED HIS FINAL PAYMENT THUS LEAVING BEHIND THE ABOVE STATED AMOUNT WHICH REPRESENTS THE OVER INVOICED SUM.

WE HAVE BEEN SAFEGUARDING THIS MONEY WAITING FOR CONDUCIVE TIME FOR ITS TRANSFER OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR OUR INVESTMENT PLAN.

THE CURRENT FAVOURABLE POLITICAL CLIMATE SINCE THE ASSUMPTION OF DUTY BY THE NEW CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION PRESENTED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS MONEY TO BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

HOWEVER, THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL SERVANTS LAWS) DOES NOT ALLOW US TO OWN AND OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNT, THEREFORE, WE NEEDED  A  FOREIGN PARTNER THAT WILL PRESENT HIMSELF AS THE SUB-CONTRACTOR BY PROVIDING HIS BANK PARTICULARS SO THAT THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO HIS COMPANY’S OR PERSONAL ACCOUNT.  HENCE THE NEED OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS TRANSACTION .  ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PRESENT YOUR BANKING INFORMATION SO THAT THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

FOR YOUR  ASSISTANCE IN THIS BUSINESS, YOUR SHARE WILL BE 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM, I AND MY COLLEAGUE WILL TAKE 60% WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO OFF-SET ANY EXPENSES WE MAY INCURE IN THE COURSE OF THIS  TRANSACTION.  NOTE ALSO THAT SOME PART OF OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE USED FOR IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS INTO NIGERIA WHILE THE REST WILL BE USED FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT YOU MAY ADVICE ON.  IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ASSIST US IN THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE SEND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION .  

(1)NAME OF YOUR BANK AND ADDRESS (2)YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER/BENEFICIARY’S NAME. (3) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY COMMUNICATION.

THIS INFORMATION WILL ENABLE US FILE AN APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT APPROVAL TO THE CONCERNED MINISTRIES AND FINALLY TO THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA AND IT IS GOING TO LAST BETWEEN 7-10 BANKING DAYS STARTING FROM THE DAY WE RECEIVE THE ABOVE INFORMATION FROM YOU.  ALL    MODALITIES FOR THE TAKE-OFF, OF THIS TRANSACTION HAS BEEN WORKED OUT AND FURTHER ACTION WILL  COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY WE HEAR FROM YOU. WE SOLICIT FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION.
