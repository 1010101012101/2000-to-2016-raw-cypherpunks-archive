They STILL want this kind of price? I remember back in 96
looking at some prices for web hosting and thinking
"hmm,  these guys are getting their investment back in
about 2 weeks, and everything after that is profit. That
can't last".

I played around with MN for a while, one of the things that
disapointed me was that you tend to lose mojo just by
running the client.  It seemed to me that the idea that
everything you do should involve a cost one way or another
was a mistake, it seemed to me that the housekeeping/say
hello kind of stuff shuld be free.  Publishing also, since 1)
there's no guarentee that the site you publish blocks to
will keep them for any nonzero length of time and 2)
Theoretically the people you publish to will expect to make their
"profit" from other people requesting those blocks.  

Of course, it's unlikely that Mojo will actually ever cost/be worth
anything, but that's beside the point; assuming that pretty much
invalidates the whole system.

A distributed backup/storage system seems like it ought to be
pretty easy to develop, but of course up front payment doesn't
work at all. You'd need some kind of challenge/response system
to verify that the storers are actually keeping the data, you'd need
lots of redundancy since it doesn't really help you to know that
some bozo dumped the only copy of your critical data,
but if you have like 20 copies out there and you continually
verify that they're all keeping your data (if some of tem lose it,
just replace those guys) it seems like you should be safer than you 
would be using a standard commercial service. And at the prices 
you mention earlier, vastly cheaper.
