I hate google, but for non Supreme Court cases you can use
scholar.google.com and click "case law" and do a search. It seems like
the source you got that quote from messed up because the proper citation
is Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S. Ct. 2502, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555
(1980). Also, that quote isn't found in that ruling.
https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=683186685758382033

Another option is to go to a county or state law library and use WestLaw
Next or Lexis Nexis for free to do a search for the cases you want.
WestLaw has a button that lets you email the court rulings to yourself.

> A good case on jurisdiction is   https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/96-643   "Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment". (1998)From the syllabus (which is not part of the actual decision):
> "(b) This Court declines to endorse the “doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction,” under which several Courts of Appeals have found it proper to proceed immediately to the merits question, despite jurisdictional objections, at least where (1) the merits question is more readily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the merits would be the same as the prevailing party were jurisdiction denied. That doctrine carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental separation-of-powers principles. In a long and venerable line of cases, this Court has held that, without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only note the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit. See, e.g., Capron v. Van Noorden , 2 Cranch 126; Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. ___, ___. Bell v. Hood ,supra ; National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Assn. of Railroad Passengers, 414 U. S. 453; Norton v. Mathews, 427 U. S. 524;Se
 c
retary of Navy v. Avrech, 418 U. S. 676 (per curiam); United States v. Augenblick, 393 U. S. 348; Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U. S. 707; and Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, distinguished. For a court to pronounce upon a law’s meaning or constitutionality when it has no jurisdiction to do so is, by very definition, an ultra vires act. Pp. 8–17."
