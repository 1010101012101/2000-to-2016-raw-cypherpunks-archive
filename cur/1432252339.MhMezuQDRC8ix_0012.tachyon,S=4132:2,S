The independence is not an issue to most Western Canadians.  
We are a subservient bunch to Eastern Canada as it is now.  
Central Canada is where the money and power is seated and the 
way Canada is setup it will always be that way.  Being independent 
or joining the USA is a subject which is often mentioned in Western 
Canada.

Another purpose served by your Electoral College is that it gives 
each senator in a state a vote.  This helps even out the power 
between major population centers and those states with low 
populations.  Couple this with your senate and you have a system 
which balances geographical related issues against that of major 
population centers.  Most Western Canadians would prefer such a 
system.

Back to the main subject, what are your numbers for exports of 
power from the American Northwest to the Canadian Southwest?

I am told by the powers that be that the number is negative.  Again 
you would have to travel this area to understand how the 
environment has been altered in the name of energy production.
