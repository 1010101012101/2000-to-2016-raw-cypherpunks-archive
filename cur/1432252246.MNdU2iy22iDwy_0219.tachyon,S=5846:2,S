Typical Choate, missing the point. A remailer simply gets sent a message,
applies it's decryption key, and sends the contents on to the next address
(yes, this type of remailer does not include nice features such as cover
traffic).

It has no idea if the address it received the message from is a remailer.
It has no idea if the address it forwarded the message to   is a remailer.
It doesn't need to.
Chaining is the sender's problem.
The point here is that the remailer treats other remailers exactly as it
treats source and destination nodes. There is no file on the remailer which
says "I'll treat hosts from this list specially".

This prevents the remop from having to worry about being sucked into a
conspiracy charge for a crime commited by a different remop. He doesn't
know, need to know, or want to know what other sites are remailers. He 
doesn't need to know the other remops, or communicate with them, 
except to inform the world (not just remops) that 'there is a remailer
here."
