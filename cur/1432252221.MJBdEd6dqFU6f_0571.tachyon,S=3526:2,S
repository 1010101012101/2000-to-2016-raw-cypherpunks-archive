Paranoia becomes you. I didn't "come to Aimee's defense" -- I took issue 
with your post. One can (indeed almost has a moral obligation to) do the 
latter without engaging in the former.

As for Aimee, Tim's criticisms of her have been reasonably accurate. She, 
as I have pointed out in the past, writes in strangely stilted English, has 
not done standard things like reading through some of the early 
cypherpunkish texts before suggesting ostensibly novel topics that have 
been well-discussed here before, and so on.

The difference is that she shows promise -- her posts are becoming more 
relevant and comprehensible -- and you do not and likely never will.

I expect this will be my last post in this sad, Reese-infested thread.
