Child sex offenders nabbed after girl sets up Website
August 1 2002
Four men have pleaded guilty to child sex offences after a 15-year-old 
Victorian schoolgirl set up a website with explicit photos of herself.
The Melbourne Magistrates Court today was told the men, all in their 20s, 
allegedly met the girl in internet chatrooms from where she gave them links 
to her site which carried sexually explicit language and photos of herself.
After viewing the site and reading the girl's text, the men arranged to 
have sex with her throughout 1999.
The girl had initially set up the site with schoolfriends using another 
Internet website which allows people to build their own homepage.
The four men all waived their right to a pre-trial committal hearing in 
court today and entered guilty pleas to charges of sexual penetration of a 
child aged between 10 and 16.

One of the men, Geoffrey Townsend, 27, of Pakenham, also faces a separate 
charge of causing a child to take part in prostitution after he paid the 
girl for sex.
In some of the schoolgirl's chatroom meetings, it was allegedly suggested 
that she could make money from the Internet liaisons.
Troy Hill, 26, of Boronia, pleaded guilty to 17 counts of sexual 
penetration of a child and one count of making child pornography.
Rick Gryzb, 24, of Bentleigh, and Aaron Hirt, 28, of Cranbourne, each 
pleaded guilty to three child sex charges.
Police were tipped off by welfare workers who had been contacted by 
teachers when word of the website spread.
Police subsequently closed the site.
The four men will face a plea hearing in the County Court on October 15.
A fifth man, Kent Matthews, 23, of Wheelers Hill, is facing five charges, 
including sexual penetration of child between 10 and 16.
He will face a committal hearing in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 
October 10.
No evidence linking professor rat as a 22 yo to the 5 time fornication in 
one day with a 15 yo has been alleged.Thank Fuck.
