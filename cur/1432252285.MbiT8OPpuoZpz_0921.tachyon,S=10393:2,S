Hush Communications Launch HushMail Version 2.0
Next generation of industry leading solutions now supports OpenPGP compliance

Dublin Ireland - 20 July , 2000 - Hush Communications (www.hush.com), a 
leading global provider of managed security solutions and encryption 
key-serving technology, has launched HushMail Version 2.0, the latest 
version of its world premier secure Web-based email service.  The upgrade 
now supports the OpenPGP standard, offers improved functionality, and 
exciting new features.  Version 2's support for OpenPGP marks a major 
breakthrough in widening the appeal and usability of HushMail, as Version 
2.0 is a major move toward achieving interoperability with the other member 
companies.  Very soon Hush users will be able to communicate securely with 
PGP and other member company applications, creating a universal 
interoperable platform for secure digital technologies.  PGP is the most 
widely used email security protocol and this new version opens up HushMail 
users to an estimated 8 million PGP users worldwide.

Phil Zimmermann, Managing Director of the OpenPGP Alliance 
(www.openpgp.org) said, "I am very encouraged by the support given to the 
OpenPGP Alliance by founding members such as Hush Communications. As an 
early adopter of the OpenPGP standard, Hush is encouraging the widespread 
adoption of secure platforms and improvements with technical 
interoperability.  I am confident that more users will quickly come to 
recognize and appreciate the added security benefits and ease of use that 
HushMail Version 2.0 offers."

The OpenPGP standard has provided a welcome alternative to security 
infrastructure standards. Compared to existing standards, it has been 
rigorously tested, provides a more flexible trust model, has a larger user 
community, is cheaper to implement and more user friendly for its adopters.

"Today's launch of HushMail Version 2.0 signifies a close co-operation 
between Hush Communications and the OpenPGP Alliance to build a reliable, 
easy to use, personal messaging solution for secure data exchange over the 
Internet," said Jon Matonis, President and CEO of Hush 
Communications.  "Hush has a vision to advance secure communications 
worldwide.  It is committed to developing and providing PKI-enabled 
complete solutions and services for both personal and business sectors 
without sacrificing ease of use."

Existing Hush customers that will immediately migrate to the new platform 
include; Daytraders, iEnhance, Therapy Online, Security.nl and 
Napo.org.  HushMail Version 2.0 provides a transparently managed PKI system 
that encrypts, decrypts, signs and verifies incoming and outgoing mails 
using keys retrieved from the Hush Key Server Network All the user needs to 
know is that they can send mail and that it goes out securely.  A HushMail 
user never has to deal directly with key exchange making HushMail Version 
2.0 the easiest form of secure communication available.

In addition, HushMail Version 2.0 offers a new, enhanced Outlook style GUI 
and advanced service features, such as storage management, attachment 
management, and improved folder functionality.  With the improved 
interface, users will be able to conveniently track the status of received 
and sent messages.  The new version is tailored to meet important 
requirements of personal clients for secure on-line communication and 
cost-effective delivery of important documents over the Internet.  To 
upgrade to the new version users will receive notification to their current 
account detailing simple instructions on how to re-register their keys.

Jon Matonis concluded, "With the launch of HushMail Version 2.0, we aim to 
better meet the requirements of personal users for secure on-line 
communication and transmission of critical messages and time-sensitive 
documents. HushMail Version 2.0 and other upcoming PKI applications will 
help Hush maintain its competitive edge in today's digital world and give 
added impetus to the overall growth of secure communications."

As a member of the OpenPGP alliance (www.openpgp.org), Hush products offer 
OpenPGP compliance.  Additionally, Hush is offering the chance to review 
recently released new products.  The features and benefits of HushMail
