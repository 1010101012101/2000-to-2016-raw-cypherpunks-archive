4 November 2003

Cryptome received a visit today from FBI Special Agents Todd Renner and 
Christopher Kelly from the FBI Counterterrorism Office in New York, 26 
Federal Plaza, telephone (212) 384-1000. Both agents presented official ID 
and business cards.

SA Renner said that a person had reported Cryptome as a source of 
information that could be used to harm the United States. He said Cryptome 
website had been examined and nothing on the site was illegal but 
information there might be used for harmful purposes. He noted that 
information in the Cryptome CDs might wind up in the wrong hands.

SA Renner said there is no investigation of Cryptome, that the purpose of 
the visit was to ask Cryptome to report to the FBI any information which 
Cryptome "had a gut feeling" could be a threat to the nation.

There was a discussion of the purpose of Cryptome, freedom of information, 
the need for more public information on threats to the nation and what 
citizens can do to protect themselves, the need for more public information 
about how the FBI functions in the field and the intention of visits like 
the one today.

SA Kelly said such visits are increasingly common as the FBI works to 
improve the reporting of information about threats to the US.

Asked what will happen as a result of the visit. SA Renner said he will 
write a report of the visit.

Cryptome said it will publish a report of the visit, including naming the 
agents. Both agents expressed concern about their names being published for 
that might lead to a threat against them and/or their families -- one 
saying that due to copious personal databases any name can be traced.

Cryptome said the reason for publishing names of agents is so that anyone 
can verify that a contact has been made, and that more public information 
is needed on how FBI agents function and who they are.

Cryptome noted that on a previous occasion FBI agents had protested 
publication of their names by Cryptome.

Cryptome did not agree to report anything to the FBI that is not available 
on the website.
