Is it back yet? (I haven't checked in several hours).

I suppose the argument could be made (though not here) that, in a contract,
one party has the right to in effect hide what they do with the information a
customer gives it. On the other hand, unless that agreement has been
specifically made in advance, the default should not be that my information
can be handled in a way that is kept secret from me. (Yeah, obvious on
Cypherpunks I guess...)

Interesting that Microsoft has backpeddled so quickly away from this...at
least it indicates they have a clue. (Which is better, stupid and ruthless or
smart and ruthless?)

> by Lance Whitney
>
>
> The Web site Cryptome, which publishes sensitive corporate and government

> copyright infringement over the publication of one of its documents.
>
> Cryptome often posts documents detailing the surveillance activities that
> companies and government agencies perform on behalf of law enforcement
> officials. These documents, which Cryptome refers to as "lawful spying
> guides," explain what information companies reveal about its customers when
> requested by legal authorities. Many of these documents are specifically

> analyze it.
>
> After one such document, Microsoft's Surveillance Guide, appeared on the
> Cryptome Web site, Microsoft asked the site's owner, John Young, to take it
> down, alleging copyright infringement. After Young refused, the site's
host,
> Network Solutions, sent him a notice citing the Digital Millennium
Copyright
> Act (DMCA) and telling him to get rid of the copyrighted material, or his
site
> would be removed. Young still refused, and so Cryptome was taken offline
> Thursday.
>
> After the take-down, an alternate site was quickly set up under the name
> Cryptomeorg.siteprotect.net, and most of the documents from the old site
have
> since been re-posted. Young has also included mirrors to other Web sites
where

site
> says that "Network Solutions shut Cryptome.org and has placed a 'legal
lock'
> on the domain name, preventing its transfer, until the 'dispute' is
settled."
> So Young can't use the Cryptome domain name.
>
> In his initial response to the actions of Microsoft and Network Solutions,
> Young filed a counter-notification on Wednesday, backing up his belief that
> publication of Microsoft's file does not infringe upon any copyright.
>
> "The file has not been removed because Microsoft has improperly claimed

users

>
> At this point, the ball is in Microsoft's court. Under the terms of the
DMCA,

days

Microsoft

Young,

law

to

>
> When informed of Microsoft's response, Young seemed disappointed at the

position,

Microsoft,

>
> He further said that DMCA needs to be modified to avoid including

need

to
