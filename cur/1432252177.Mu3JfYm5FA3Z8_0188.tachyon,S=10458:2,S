OK, I'm going to discuss it from a philosophical perspective.
i.e. I'm just having fun with this.

I don't like the idea that users *must* have a "certificate".  Why
can't each person develop their own personal levels of trust and
associate it with their own public key?  Using multiple channels,
people can prove their key is their word.  If any company wants to
associate a certificate with a customer, that can have lots of meanings
to lots of other people.  I don't see the usefullness of a "permanent
certificate".  Human interaction over electronic media has to deal
with monkeys, because that's what humans are :-)

Ouch, that doesn't sound too robust.

The CA has a bit too much power if you ask me.  Those are some really
good reasons not to like the idea of a "permanent certificate" ruled
by one (nasty?) person.

I really, REALLY, *REALLY*, don't like the idea of one entity having
the ability to create or destroy any persons ability to use their
computer at whim.  You are suggesting that one person (or small group)
has the power to create (or not) and revoke (or not!) any and all TPM's!

I don't know how to describe my astoundment at the lack of comprehension
of history.

There's no problem if we just extend our normal concepts of trust between
humans on a face to face level onto the net.  Person to person, peer to
peer, face to face.  It's all the same thing, and using the technology
to make it happen the same way it happens in the street is going to be
the ultimate success story.  Nobody controls everything, but some people
have some control of some resources.  People who attempt to rule the
whole world usually burn out sooner or later :-)

How about everybody on their block signs each other's keys, and when
one monkey misbehaves, the other ones toss 'em out of the troop.
A Web of trust is kind of like a group signature.

If a company wants control of their hardware, they should put their own
private keys in each machine.  They can use that with each persons
public key and create a reasonably secure system for their business.  They
don't need a privacy CA, and they can prove to any other firm that the
person with the box on their premisis *must* be from the right place.

If TCPA is going to fly as a real business it can't just be for DRM.
If copyright owners want people to buy their stuff, they'll have to sell
"copyright owners certificate" which can be based on the customer's key.
Again, nobody needs a privacy CA.

There is no valid argument for centralized control *of anything*.
TCPA is a valid concept in and of itself.  It's way too dangerous
a weapon if forced down people's throats the wrong way.  So the TCPA guys
should sell their boxes as useful tools to lots of big corporations,
and forget about the "content industry".  There's a lot more money to
be made solving real problems for real people.

Patience, persistence, truth,
