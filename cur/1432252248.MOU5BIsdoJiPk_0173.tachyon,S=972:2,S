Dear Randal,

Looking for a Bvlgari watch that no one can tell from the original? You're in luck, because we have the best copies
http://www.peonmine.com/

The best news is that in December you can buy two watches and get an extra 15% off your purchase!

Our Bvlgari have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Whaley
