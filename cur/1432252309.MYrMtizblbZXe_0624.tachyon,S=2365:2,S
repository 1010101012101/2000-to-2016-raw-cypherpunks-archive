I disagree.  Except for the early days, spammers have been little more
than a low volume nuisance on Mix.  What killed mix was it's complexity -
Joe Blow can't figure out how to use it, and new reops have a hell of a
time getting a node running (with pingers and other required tools).

Take away complexity, and Mix *could* flourish - in spite of the fedz.

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
