Well, I think you've been a little too harsh on Scientific American. In the 
past a lot of the best articles were written by the pioneers in their 
fields. In fact, it's where I believe Wittfield and Diffie wrote a great 
piece on their work.

And don't expect anyone (not even a math major) to go grab a quantum 
mechanics textbook and be able to get anything out of it. One would really 
need to have done the classical coursework in order to understand it (or at 
least to know enough to be spurised by it). And if you don't have the math 
then forget about it. Meanwhile, it IS possible to write intelligently on 
quantum entanglement, EPR and Aharnov-Bohm, and it's been done by Sci-Am, 
Penrose, Kaku and plenty of others.
