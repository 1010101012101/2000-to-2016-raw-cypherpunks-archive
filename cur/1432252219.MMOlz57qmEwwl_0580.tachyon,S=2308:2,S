In order. First, "freedom of speech" is a legal issue, not a matter of 
whether one likes or supports or gives a platform for speech. This has 
been covered many times.

Second, I have no power to make people shut up. As for "telling" them, 
I don't.

I do wonder why they are on the list given the implications of the 
technologies. I don't think they've realized the implications for their 
world view and for the breeders and useless eaters they support.

And as in that debate, where "free speech" is tossed around a lot, 
nothing in the Dixie Chicks case has involved freedom of speech in any 
way whatsoever. Think about it.
