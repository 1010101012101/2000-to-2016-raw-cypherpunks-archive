Physical number of lines is far from being the only measure of quality.

Compression has a huge impact, and so do other digital artifacts.

For instance, just take a look at the opening scenes (earth rising on the moon
horizon) in Kubrick's 2001 on laserdisc and DVD. In DVD, the dark blue-black
background consists of funny rectangles.

There are also a lot of motion artefacts which give a certain "feel" do DVD
image - but then, that may become fashionable, as valve amplifiers are again
now or listening to dolby-recorded tapes without dolby players - some just like
that boost in the high end.
