Just As Intended: The U.S. Election Is Tearing Us To Shreds
July 29, 2016

The only credible narrative about the US election is that both the
main candidates are shit and the system is fundamentally broken.

The third-party candidate, while enjoying organic growth in public
support, is largely blacklisted by media and in the last election
cycle was handcuffed to a chair for a prolonged period of time in
order to prevent her from participating in the Presidential debates at
all.

In the backwards Orwellian nightmare we live in, exercising common
sense or stating things as they quite plainly are and thus expressing
views that oppose the monied and complicit status quo, is deemed a
‘radical’ and untenable position.

Radical because too few have the proverbial balls to openly speak
their mind or own the full extent of their true opinions in public,
making those of us who do a rarity.

Untenable because doing so makes you a target for relentless
persecution or worse; a deterrent which is highly effective against
those who treasure their public perception or persona, possessions,
property, prosperity or (perceived) privacy above the need to appease
their conscience by calling a spade a spade, honouring their humanity
and openly advocating for the sociopolitical evolution we so
desperately need.

It was only a few years ago that millions of people were emboldened to
speak up and demand radical (read: common sense) change. The relative
speed with which they were largely subdued and corralled back into the
political mainstream is frankly shocking and testament to the lethal
efficiency of the systems of social control that surround us.

economic power.” – The Occupy Wall Street General Assembly
