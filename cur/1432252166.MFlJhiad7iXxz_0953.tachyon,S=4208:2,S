  Lie detectors may be next step in airline security

  By Reuters

  Story last modified Thu Nov 17 12:10:00 PST 2005


 A new walk-through airport lie detector made in Israel may prove to be the
 toughest challenge yet for potential hijackers or drug smugglers.

 Tested in Russia, the two-stage GK-1 voice analyzer requires that
 passengers don headphones at a console and answer "yes" or "no" into a
 microphone to questions about whether they are planning something illicit.

 The software will almost always pick up uncontrollable tremors in the voice
 that give away liars or those with something to hide, say its designers at
 Israeli firm Nemesysco.

 "In our trial, 500 passengers went through the test, and then each was
 subjected to full traditional searches," said Chief Executive Officer Amir
 Liberman. "The one person found to be planning something illegal was the
 one who failed our test."

 The GK-1 is expected to cost between $10,000-$30,000 when marketed. A
 spokesman for Moscow's Domodyedevo airport, which is using a prototype,
 said "the tester (lie detector) has proved to be effective and we are in
 principle ready to use it."

 The September 11, 2001 hijacking attacks have led to a slew of innovations
 designed to boost airline security. Liberman said several countries had
 expressed interest in the GK-1.



 "Unlike conventional lie detectors such as the polygraph, this is minimally
 invasive, requiring hardly any physical contact," Liberman said, adding
 that the first stage of the test takes between 30-75 seconds.


 Those that fail are taken aside for more intensive questioning and, if
 necessary, searches. Liberman said around 12 percent of passengers tend to
 show stress even when they have nothing to hide.


 "Some may feel nervous because they have used drugs, while having no
 intention to smuggle drugs," he said. "The whole thing is performed in a
 low-key manner to avoid causing anxiety."
