It depends on what the alternatives are, if there are none then there
isn't a lot of difference. How gilded the cage is isn't a relevant issue.

'nearly all'? That's a laugh. It happens in all societies because people
are wired that way psychologicaly.

If one defines 'free' as lacking coercion. Of course you can't have any
sort of human interaction without 'coercion' at some level. If it's not
physical, then it's economical, if it's not economical it's religious, if
it's not religious it's racial, if it's not racial it's what sports team,
if it's not a sports team it's emotional coercion via a SO. If it's not
that then it's self-imposed psychological 'benchmarks' we all pick up and
try to measure ourselves against. If it's not one thing, it's another.
People are about manipulating other people.

All the anonymous reputational capital crypto-anarcy crap in the world
won't change that, and it won't protect the weaker from the strong (of
course that concept is completely alien to 'free market' economists and
supporters of David Friedman's ilk).

> Saying corporations are the main problem is, as Declan says, naive.

You should also talk to Declan, you have a future in the 'press'.

Nobody is saying they are the main problem. What they are saying is that
from a 'power broker' perspective, there ain't no difference. And they'd
be right.

Not now, but how long would it take them to move if they thought there
weren't other organizations that would intercede? Not very long.

As usualy you mispresent 'free market economics' as some sort of panacea
that will elliminate 'government abuse' and give us a 'coercion fee'
society. Bullshit. we'd only be trading one tryant for another. Just look
at the history of the 'company store'.
