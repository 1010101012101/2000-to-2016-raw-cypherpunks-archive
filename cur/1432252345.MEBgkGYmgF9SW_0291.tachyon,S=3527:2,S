1. Shift reg sequences are cryptographically weak.

2. Re-synch'ing with a PR stream is useful for some apps, true.

3. In crypto, we consider the adversary who claims to have a true RNG
but
instead is faking us out with an opaque PRNG.  If We are not privvy to
the
PRNG algorithm (or key) then we can't tell if its truly random or not.

Bit-bias is trivial to correct (see Shannon).  Take a look at Prof.
Marsaglia's
"Diehard" suite of statistical-structural tests for a real obstacle
course.  But
no such "does it look random" test can tell good PRNG from TRNG.
You must peek under the hood.
