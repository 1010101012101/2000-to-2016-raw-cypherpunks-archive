The key was/is on the key server publish well prior to the anouncement of
the bug, actually I believe I published it about a week after PGP 5.0 for
Linux was released.

You have the Key ID, grab it from the server.  I know it was affected due
to a phone call I got at 3:00 am the morning after the bug was discovered.
when they looked through the key server for any key vulnerable.
