Re: CNET Story: PSINet assailed as spam contract surfaces
<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-3417237.html>

We have had a copy of this second pink contract for a few days but were
unable to prove where it came from and so had not published it. However as
CNET has independently verified its authenticity with both the spam outfit
and PSINet, I'll append the full text of the contract below.

I found the following clauses particularly serious:

    Paragraph 2: PSINet acknowledges that this is a contract to allow
    "Opt-out commercial email" (i.e: Spam) to be sent "in mass quantity"
    by the customer, which PSINet acknowledges is in the spam business.

    Clause 2: PSINet agrees that "Opt-out commercial email" (i.e: Spam)
    will be sent "in mass quantity" from the customer's PSINet line.

    Clause 3: PSINet will pass all spam complaints straight to the spam
    outfit. (We know from experience that under these contracts PSINet's
    US abuse desk will send a "the matter has been dealt with" autoreply
    to Internet users, which will deliberately deceive users that the
spammers
    have been terminated. We also know that PSINet's US abuse desk knows
    that we know it does this.)

    Clause 8: PSINet agrees that the spam outfit will also spamvertize
    their web sites.

    Clause 9: This is a "danger money" clause in which PSINet wants an
    non-refundable up-front payment of $27,000 "for PSINet's increased
    risks associated with this Agreement" and states this payment will NOT
    be applied towards the customer's fees.

I think the ISP community as a whole needs to reexamine it's ethics. The
contracts we're finding show that far from regulating themselves some US
backbones are colluding with spammers to profit off the spam problem.
Although I can't prove it, I know this same case exists with the Empire
Towers spammers on OarNet and Qwest (ET even tell their customers they
'buy' the providers ethics, purchasing large lines in exchange for the
provider looking the other way). Perhaps even more disturbing for me is
that these contracts can't exist without the collusion of the provider's
abuse desk, as these contracts rely on the abuse desk eating complaints and
fobbing users off.
