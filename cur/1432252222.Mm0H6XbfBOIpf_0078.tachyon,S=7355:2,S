Hey Al,=20

You=92ve got to have a pretty thick skin to be on a mailing list - =
sometimes people post several messages in a row that may be over your =
head,  in regards to people or events you have  no knowledge of, or just =
plain boring. In these cases it is best to just buddha-up - find your =
delete key and go with the flow. If you really can=92t see why the =
members of this particular list might be interested this particular =
=93celebrity=92s=94 correspondence in this matter =97 if you truly have =
=93no idea what it is about=94 =97 then perhaps you should save your =
comments until you do have some inkling of what=92s going around you. =
Then you won=92t appear petulant or uninformed when you wish to =
participate rationally at a later time.=20

Good luck!
