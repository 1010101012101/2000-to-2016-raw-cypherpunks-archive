Right.

I figured it would only really be relevant here, and I tried to restrain
myself, but couldn't, quite. ;-).

As to sending it to lists which have subscriber-post-only, it is, as usual,
a consequence of spam prevention and not malice aforethought. Kinda sucks,
of course, because anonymous posters can't post. Hope they fix that in
future versions of majordomo, but I bet it'll be a while.

Cheers,
RAH
