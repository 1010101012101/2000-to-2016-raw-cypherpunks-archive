   Or in the middle of the day, for that matter. Anyone who's car stereo can be
heard outside the car should be arrested. I like the way they do that in New

should do the same with houses.

   I wasn't talking at all about private property, I was talking about public
space. If only giving discomfort is okay, how about if I dump a bucket of cold
water on every smoker I meet on the street?
