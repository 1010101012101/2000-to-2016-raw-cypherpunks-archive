Even dieharding the stream since inception is insufficient test.

Unless some of those billion gates are dedicated to
recognizing and modifying software AES to match, and
every separate processor you might have handy to run
software test on since AES came out has also been
backdoored. There is always custom test rig or by hand.

True, if you can't see and verify it you can't trust it. Assuming
there is no aforementioned subversion in other parts of the CPU,
an RNG is then of base importance to much crypto...

So what would be the cost per box to build 10,000 open source [1]
RNG's [2] and sell them for middling/no profit? As assembled boxes,
as you-build kits, or as free blueprints.

If you don't need speed/quantity for speedy/large OTP XOR streams,
these hobby jobbers would suffice to seed software prngs, and work
well in combination with other software sources.

What would be the cost bumps for speedy units, still complying
with [1 and 2], for various definitions of speed?

Dieharding this and any rng since inception over various
block sizes would seem warranted to catch component and other
failures [3], whereupon the /dev/<rng> device would block and
warn until fixed. No one is doing this extra step in kernel or
even in userland yet afaik. Why not?


[1] For example, entirely from breadboard discrete logic you can buy
and validate from any local parts supplier. ie: not using embedded
asics or fancy usb fobs... but resistors, diodes, 74 series gates, etc.

[2] Based on radiation, radio, audio/video, environmentals, etc.

[3] Neutrino and other hits, Intel/AMD on-die gate failure, etc.
