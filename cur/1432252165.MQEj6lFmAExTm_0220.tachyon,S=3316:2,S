Its pretty common to see a "reporter" holding a cell phone up to a
talking head surrounded by more conventional microphones, tape
recorders.

When a major news medium first uses a video snip recorded from a phone
at the
scene, the Brinworld clock will have advanced another second.

And then some Nokia yahoo will introduce some more interesting features
that
used to be found in $10K specialized video/recording equiptment
* snap a frame if something moves (security)
* FIFO the last N seconds
* low light/IR/frame accumulate
etc.
making the 7segment LED Brinworld clock blick closer to midnight.
