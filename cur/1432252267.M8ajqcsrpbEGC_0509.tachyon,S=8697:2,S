Dear Member,

Two decades have passed since the onslaught of the AIDS 
epidemic. The quest for the cure continues, but more 
remains to be done on the prevention front. The New York 
Times's "AIDS at 20" is an ongoing series that examines this 
disease in all its aspects, looking closely at patient 
rights, the vaccine search and public policy, as well the 
origin of the disease.

I encourage you to take a look at "Voice of the Epidemic" -- six 
pieces that examine the lives of AIDS patients of all ages, 
ethnicities and sexual orientations. It reiterates the fact that 
this disease does not discriminate and all people are 
susceptible.

This series includes charts, video, in-depth reports from the 
Kaiser Family Foundation and nearly a thousand articles from 
the past 20 years. Discuss the ongoing pandemic and its impact 
on the world in our AIDS at 20 forum.

1. What Is Software's Future?
------

The Internet has allowed millions of computers to be 
connected to one another over the last 20 years. More 
recently, the spread of high-speed Internet service has 
deepened those connections and allowed software to take 
the first baby step toward a vision that some software 
designers call moving off the desktop and into the cloud. 
Plus: articles on marketing, finance and shopping.

4. Listen to Our Audio Interview With Haruki Murakami
-----

Haruki Murakami, one of the most popular Japanese 
novelists who is now moving beyond his cult following in 
America, talks about the Kobe earthquake and the sarin gas 
attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, a year which he calls 
a "a turning point" in Japanese history. The gas attack by 
the Aum Shinrikyo cult is the subject of a nonfiction book 
by Murakami, "Underground," which, along with his new 
novel, "Sputnik Sweetheart," was reviewed on June 10.
