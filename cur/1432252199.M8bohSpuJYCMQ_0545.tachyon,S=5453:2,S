See United States Code, Title 18, Ch. 40, Section 842. Also see Section 844.
Lookee here: http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/842.html United States v.
Progressive, 467 F.Supp. 990 (W.D. Wis. 1979), was a long time ago. I
recognize that successful prosecution is probably a long-shot.

My point is that I'm sitting here talking to somebody named "bombmonger." Go
back to playing with sparklers and blowing things up in the microwave. If
you have any real bombs, I bet the ATF has a toll-free help-line, offering
friendly and immediate assistance to assist you through the "bomb
registration process."

...."quite possibly" ...FBI "Black Ops Blow-Em-Up" teams? Uh-uhm. If had to
guess, I would bet that explosives take a lot of paperwork. Bombs are not
efficient investigative tools for law enforcement. They blow up the evidence
and the criminal. It's hard to run surveillance on a blown-up target. That
would be LEA "disintermediation." They also make a lot of noise.

Accusing me of trickery on the tribunal? Himf. See US v. EATON, No 00-1276
(10th Cir. August 14, 2001).

Never said it was. However, talking about bombs and arms trafficking along
with crypto is like turning on a "UC bugzapper." You're talking about the
courtroom. Agents make the facts.

AGENT: "Oh, he's just talking about bomb recipes. If ONLY he would just
state his 'intention to deploy' so I could investigate and [...] to see just
what the heck he's doing over there."

AGENT: "Oh, they are talking about bombs, again. Oh, I would I could just
make them stop! Damn this free speech stuff!"

Bzzt.

I am aware of the long-standing, oft-debated, legal analogy between crypto
and bombs related to the First Amendment. (Heck, it's even in court
pleadings.) AN ANALOGY. For some reason, I think crypto + bomb talk = bad
things, and it's a mischaracterization of this forum.
