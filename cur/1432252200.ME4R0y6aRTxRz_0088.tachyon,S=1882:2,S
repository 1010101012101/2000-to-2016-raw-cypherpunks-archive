" The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it difficult to conduct

 That is too restrictive. Innocent people, such as unwitting neighbors of
 terrorists, may, without knowing it, have valuable counterterrorist
 information. Collecting such information is of a piece with data-mining
 projects such as Able Danger."

This says it all - they want the authority to look at "innocent people"
without restriction.  Forget it.
