"...Cryptozoology often receives a bad rep because it is often practiced 
with little skepticism, or regard for scientifically supported facts and 
theories. Likewise, paranormal cryptozoologists do little to help the 
integrity of cryptozoology. It can, however, be a level-headed, interesting 
and possibly even scientific subject, if examined with open-minded 
skepticism and a scientific viewpoint.
Such an approach is the basis of this web site on cryptozoology. Ockham's 
razor, which basically states that the simplest explanation is probably the 
correct one, is a rationale that looms large here."
