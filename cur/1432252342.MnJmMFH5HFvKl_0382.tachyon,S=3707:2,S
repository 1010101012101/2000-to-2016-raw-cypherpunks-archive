Subject: History Channel television show on NSA

The 'History Channel' cable TV network will air a show about the NSA
tomorrow night January 8, at 8 pm Eastern.  Their website says this about
it:

America's Most Secret Agency

The National Security Agency, America's most secret and controversial
agency, is charged with safeguarding the nation's strategic intelligence
information and decoding the secret communications of our enemies. For
only the second time in its nearly 50 year history, the N.S.A. allowed
cameras inside its Ft. Meade, Maryland, headquarters, and the director,
Lt. General Michael V. Hayden, sits for a rare interview and addresses
issues such as privacy. Tune in and find out if Big Brother is watching
you!
