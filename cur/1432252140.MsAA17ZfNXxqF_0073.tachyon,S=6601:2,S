Who cares, that's up to the cpunk. If the cypherpunk is pure, working
with the man to get cpunk shit done is just another hacking skin
to hang on their wall. And a highly prized one of social engineering
at that. Cpunks should bow the fuck down in respect to such a fellow
cpunk, not fling hostile FUD at them just because they're working
the system. For that matter, they should join them to add another
voice. There are probably more US persons on this list than there
are in their entire Congress. Think about that...

Now in the other direction of possible hostility... should The Man
discover a cpunk within their ranks, well yes, there is a risk there.
The usual opsec applies.

That's why the above masses need to activate and throw the FUD back,
and more, at The Man. Two can play that game. Problem is, right now
there is only one real player on the field of politics, his name is The Man,
and he's not on team cpunk.
