This is true. For those that don't have the time or desire or watch, some  
takeaways:

The biggest takeaway is that jig is up with the current business model of  
centralized power distribution. The growth of decentralized power  
production (home solar etc) is driving a stake into the heart of the beast.

The power company execs know this openly admit as much. So they are  
changing business models to one of CENTRALIZED DATA HARVESTING AND  
SURVEILLANCE.

'smart meters' are a massive and global offensive thrust of the 'Internet  
of Things' surveillance state and control grid directly into the home.  
They form a mesh network on the 900Mhz band. They are supposed to have  
2.4Ghz radio (not yet widely activated) for extracting surveillance data  
and controlling 'smart' appliances in the home.

I use the term 'smart' in quotes because it is a goddamn propaganda term  
and needs to be replaced in the popular culture as soon as possible with  
something more apt and mocking, say 'evil-genius'. I will use the term  
'evil-genius' meters from now on.

Anyways, these evil-genius meters douse your house with something on the  
order of 40,000 microwave pulses a day. The meters are built in China, and  
allegedly have not had any real safety testing done on them.

The AC-DC converters used to power the evil genius brain in these devices  
is supposedly a crap one and generates a significant power waste along  
with 'dirty electricity' (that is a choppy or rough sine wave instead of  
smooth clean one) which radiates throughout the home via the electrical  
wiring.

The legal principle of 'implied consent' being used to justify the stealth  
installation of the meters world wide is a very shaky one. The vast  
majority of people that are having these meters installed on their homes  
by the power company are complete unaware of what is going on. It's a  
classic trojan horse.

It's also a contractual violation. To have a valid contract there must be  
an offer, consideration, and acceptance. There is none of this with the  
evil-genius meter roll-outs. They simply are putting them in without  
asking the customer for permission.

Depending on the jurisdiction, you can refuse the evil-genius meter, but  
then you're hit with an extortionate monthly 'meter reading' fee, which  
was not charged before the evil-genius meter roll-out began.

Some people in the Los Angeles area that have refused evil-genius meter  
installation, have been locked into months long battle with the utility  
company and consequently LIVING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY for months on end. Now  
that is some crazy shit, now matter how you slice it.

WHY are the companies so adamant about having these devices installed to  
the point where they're willing to cut off a resister's power for months  
on end, and foregoing that revenue? Perhaps to make an example out of them?

I could go on and on.

If you anybody that sleeps in a room next to one of these devices,  
*especially* if they are pregnant women or young children, get them the  
fuck away from it as soon as possible, ideally by having the device  
removed and replaced with an analog one, or by changing rooms or living  
locations.
