If there is anything to the speculation below, then perhaps
J.G.&Co. are open to be hit where it hurts.  Also Tim May's
complaints about SSN-disclosure and character defamation might
gain legal traction?  And the unsigned, vaguely threatening
messages that have been received by JYA and many other list
members, both recently and immediately after the JB arrest?


There are two possible developments that could yield a really
happy ending here:


1.  CJ's aquittal after a 1st Amendment defense.
2.  Some good evidence of official misbehavior turns up and is
leveraged into a solid criminal case against the loose cannons.


Regards,

Zooko
