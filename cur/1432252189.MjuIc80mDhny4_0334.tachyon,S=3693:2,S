Hello,

You are receiving this message in response to your request for 
a free booklet about a Work From Home business opportunity on 
one of our affiliate web sites.

Hi! there, my name is Kelly.  Like many of you, I have worked very hard my entire life. We have done this because it is what many of our loved ones did and is what we believed was the way to achieve that  "American Dream of Financial Freedom."  Remember those phrases,  "get a good education", "go to college",  "just keep working hard" and you will get somewhere in life.  Well, where is that "somewhere"? After many disappointing employment situations, and the recent lay-offs I have encountered, I decided I truly wanted to work for myself.  Better yet, why not from the comfort of my own home.  No more limitations as to how far I can advance using my talent and skills. No long commutes in treacherous weather to get to work.  And best of all, no employers to tell me I am over or under qualified, and no more excuses for not being paid for my hard work.

When I finally found this opportunity, I suddenly realized that there is a way to obtain that American Dream and the only limitations would be the ones I put on myself.  Finally, a chance to enjoy doing something where I can not only gain the satisfaction of working for myself, but also the ability to achieve my goals and to help others do the same.

I don't know whether this opportunity found me, or I found it.  But I do know, I thank God everyday for opening my eyes and helping me realize that my dreams can become a reality.   

, Join me to work together in obtaining your hopes and dreams.
