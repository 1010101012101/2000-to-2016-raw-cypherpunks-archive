	Georgi, if you are really interested in the topic, do your own
	homework.

	http://jim.com/Molinari.htm


	If on the other hand you think that your questions are
	rhetorical questions that somehow prove anything, don't waste
	your time. And mine.


	The comments I made about statism have not been refuted - at
	all.

	And what is the  political system you advocate? How do you YOU
	justify it?

	They are sold as cat and dog food for the pets of the rich
	people.

	That is, you don't know what "free market" means and yet you
	are wasting time discussing it and apparently trying to refute
	something you don't have a clue about it.
