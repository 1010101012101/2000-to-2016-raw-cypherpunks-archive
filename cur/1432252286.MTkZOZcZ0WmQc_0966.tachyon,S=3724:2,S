No Spooks, Please. We're Academics

By Jodie Morse

The best hope for finding and stopping Osama bin Laden, Donald Rumsfeld has
said, is "a scrap of information." But it remains to be seen whether government
officials would know how to translate that scrap. In the days following the
attacks, the FBI appealed to speakers of Arabic and Afghan languages to sign up
for its $ 27-to-$ 38-per-hour translator gigs. One reason for the shortage? The
dearth of top-notch, well-funded Arabic departments at U.S. colleges.
In the past year, the Defense Department has been quietly working with Congress
and universities to ease this language barrier. A solution gaining favor is the
creation of ROTC-style language academies at several campuses across the
country. In exchange for free instruction in Arabic and other languages key to
intelligence gathering, students would be required to serve in national-security jobs.

But the idea hasn't been welcomed on all fronts. The University of Michigan
declined an invitation last spring to participate in the fledgling Pentagon
program. "We didn't want our students to be known as spies in training," says
Carol Bardenstein, an assistant professor of Arabic language and culture at
Michigan. "By intertwining intelligence and academics, we'd essentially be
recruiting Arabs to later inform on members of their own community." The
advocates of the program will pitch Michigan again next month. Perhaps Sept. 11
will bring a change of heart.
