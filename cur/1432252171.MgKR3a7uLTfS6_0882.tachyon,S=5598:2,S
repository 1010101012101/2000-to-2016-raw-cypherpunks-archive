My two trouble zones (my stomach and legs) just wouldn't budge. I did all the exercises I could think of to target them, but nothing helped! Then I tried  Hoodia 920+ and everything changed! In just 6 weeks I lost the remaining 18 pounds. I always knew that couldn't be the thinnest I could get. I'm glad I found this product. I finally achieved the body I wanted. My husband says I look like a goddess. Thanks :)<br>
