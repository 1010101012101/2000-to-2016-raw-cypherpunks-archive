Isn't there some rule that says "don't start a land war in Asia"?  It
sounds like that's what's going to happen.  The idea of kicking some
terrorist ass may be gratifying, but the practice of it may be more
than the US can stomach.  Salon has a good article sugesting that the
US should treat this as a criminal manhunt, not as a military matter,
for quite a few sound reasons, which include the idea that a military
action will cost the US allies, but a manhunt may help retain allies.

Oh no, Hitler has come up in this thread!
