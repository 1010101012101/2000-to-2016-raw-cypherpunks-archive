I can't imagine this is the stupidest, but there's a state office building 
in Missouri where (no doubt due to some Directive From On High), they've 
put up a wooden shack in front of the main entrance, where anyone going in 
or out has to pass through a metal detector.  The wooden shack isn't 
directly in front of the entrance, however--probably, that would make life 
too hard on the smokers, who now have to go outside to smoke.  It's more 
like about 50' in front of it, completely unconnected to the building.

The really entertaining bit is that, since most people going into the 
building are basically law abiding (state employees), most people seem to 
go through the shack and get checked for weapons, rather than around the 
shack to save time.
