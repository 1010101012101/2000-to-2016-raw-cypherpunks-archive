I forgot to add that the rumor was that Micro$oft was looking into ways to
add software to their applications
to manipulate the generation of these RF emissions so they could broadcast
the application's serial number.

They could then drive a "sniffer" truck around and look for duplicate serial
numbers in order to find illegal copies of their software being used.

As stated by others, this was just a rumor.
