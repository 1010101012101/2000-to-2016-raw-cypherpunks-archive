        Oh, I do see the value of what your master omidyar does. I know
        qute well how propaganda works.

        The 'cracks' in the system are useful to keep the fake
        opposition happy. "Controlled opposition" Look it up. In
        wikipedia.

        Ok. So I'm a 'fanatic nutjob'. I'd rather be that instead of an
        omidyar lapdog.

        Sure, sure, sure. How could I have missed the invaluable value
        of establishment propaganda? Silly me.

        lol rayzer - you are a cheap marxist - you can't get more
        totalitarian than that.

        go kill people who don't obey The State's Traffic Laws.
