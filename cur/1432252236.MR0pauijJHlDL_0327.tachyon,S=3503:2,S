But that's not a problem as that's a small set of players.  You also have
several hundred others who give positive or negative repcaps to Alice,
Bob, Charlie, Doug, Eddie, Frank, Jenny, etc and to each other.

If two people have a bitch out, that's not going to affect them in a
positive way.  If Alice and Bob give opposite repcaps to Charlie, they'll
cancel each other out, so repcaps from Doug, Eddie Frank, Jenny would
provide a closer look.

It would be a very rare thing to have a 50/50 postive/negative repcap.
