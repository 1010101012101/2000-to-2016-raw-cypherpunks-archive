Microsoft's forte is making money. They do this by spending hugely on
what people think they want (ease of use), and not wasting resources on
things which do not impact market share. 

If MS ever decided that they were losing money due to poor security, 
they would get good at it, fast. How many fewer copies of WinXP will
they sell due to Code Red I, II, and III? Not many. A few (a very few) 
sysadmins may decide to go with Apache instead of IIS. It's not like
many home or corporate users are going to switch to Linux purely
due to security issues.

I hate to say this, but until software developers are held (at least at the
corporate level) in some way liable for their failures, there will be little
or no improvement in the situation.

I'm aware of exactly two datapoints - Skipjack (which wasn't good enough

That's not enough to draw broad conclusions.

MS makes crap because their customers buy it. If the customers
(or their insurers) insisted on security, MS would do better. (BTW, 
MS's security rep is now so bad, that I know of security experts 
who would not work for them, due to the damage it would do to 
their reputations).

I occasionally see the argument that NSA can't retain people due
to the much higher salaries, etc, in the public sector. While I have
no doubt that this is partially true, there are plenty of very good
people who find that the non-tangible benefits - patriotism, a sense
that one's work is important, that one is a trusted member of
the inner circle and privy to secret knowledge - are more than 
enough to make up for a civil service paycheck. No one should 
discount these factors just because they don't move them 
themselves.
