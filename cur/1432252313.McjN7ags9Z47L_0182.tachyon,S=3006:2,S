I've wondered for years how much longer this
will be allowed. Cash is still viable. Not
as viable as it was 10, or even 5 years ago.
I am still able to travel with only cash, buy
a pizza with only cash, or other food, still
buy groceries without having to produce mein
ausweiss (why I stopped shopping at CostCo
years back). But it is all getting stickier.
