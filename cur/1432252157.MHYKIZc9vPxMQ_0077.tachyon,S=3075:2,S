For a few days now, a growing (and now 100)
percentage of my cpunks email has consisted
of blank messages from
owner@cypherpunks.cyberpass.net

>From the number and time distribution of the
messages, I suspect I'm getting one for each
posting to cypherpunks.

Am I the only one who is seeing this?

(Reply directly, since I'm not getting
intelligable mail from the list).

thanks,
