Our ursine friend neglects the use of broadcast.  

Consider: An ephemeral anonymous remailer entrypoint (Bob) publishes half a
PK pair.

Alice stegos a message using Bob's key and a snapshot she takes, and posts
it to something widely received, and with some memory.

Bob (and only Bob) sees the message, waits a bit, and reinjects it into the
System, where
it bounces around, encrypted, until it gets released to its destination.
Bob can't
actually read the message because its inside more crypto envelopes.

.....

Yes it would be insecure with sufficient subversion, as all things.
