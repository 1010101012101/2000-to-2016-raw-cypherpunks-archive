Terrorists don't protest in the street, that's for ineffectuals
dancing the tune of yarping heads. Bitchers don't do shit 
except bark a mighty wind.

Killers don't tell you what they are going to do. You get to see 
it in the news or your daughter's head go bowling ball.

19 did 3,000: mighty effectual. Tommy Franks with 300,000
did mighty less.

250 million fish in a barrel.
