     Pheromones are nature's chemical attraction mechanism. Produced    
   naturally  by most creatures (including humans) these are natures <b>sex

     You too have seen the effects of sex pheromones, maybe without ever
       realizing it. Most of us have seen first hand the effects of a female
  dog        in "heat" even if the animal is locked up in your house. Male
 dogs in the        neighborhood will escape their homes, jump fences, slip
 their collars and        chains, all in an attempt to get to and mate with
 the dog in heat. It's        pheromones that are causing this reaction (in
 this case of course female        animal pheromones) but the principle is
 the same in humans.        </font></i></p>

     Now for the bad news. Modern evolution and living in a chemically  
     filled environment has robbed man of the dramatic effect these naturally 
         occuring chemicals once produced and likewise robbed women of the 
 ability        to pickup and sense them to a great extent. Oh, we still produce
 them        naturally and like everything else in nature some men produce
 more than        others (ever wonder why some really ugly guys seem to attract
  women with        no difficulty?) So . . . What can we do to restore potent
  levels of these        pheromones? Modern Science to the rescue.

     Scientists have been studying and experimenting with isolating and 
      concentrating pheromones for years. It started years ago as a way to
        attract insects to traps in order to exterminate them. The poor 
      unsuspecting insects were drawn to "mate" by a concentrated pheromone
         compound instead they get exterminated (how rude) but it worked.
       Eventually scientists got around to isolating and concentrating human 
  sex        pheromones (thank God not for the same reason) the result. <b>

     Now understand, I'm not saying that girls will be beating down your

      <u>   they         will react</u> and be subtly "<u>lured</u>" to you.
They may  choose  to sit        in the booth next to you in a restaurant
or choose the seat  next to you in        a theatre or a bar without ever
realizing why they sat there. You'll        probably notice that they will
