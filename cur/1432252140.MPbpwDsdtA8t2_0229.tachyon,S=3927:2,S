Hello my name is Kamil Wisniewsk, I do not know if i found the right

internet site, but I am looking for software that crates voices

depending on measurements of an individuals body. For example if I would

like to have Bill Clintons voice i would type in the measurements of his

body, and the software would calculate his speech pattern. If you may

know any thing about this technology I would greatly appreciate it.
