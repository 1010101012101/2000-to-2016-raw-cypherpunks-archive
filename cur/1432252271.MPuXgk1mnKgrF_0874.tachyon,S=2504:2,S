Why the heck would you need a password this big? There are 94 printable
characters (0x33 .. 0x7E); a random password 32 chars long (like the above)
will thus have ~ 1.38 x 10^63 possibilities, meaning 210 bits of entropy
(10^63 = O(2^210)). What, do you intend to use your password as a public
key?

A password made of the same character set, but only 8 chars long, will
provide 94^8 ~= 6 x 10^15 = O(2^50) combinations. I'd say that's plenty -
remember, it's a password, not a key.
