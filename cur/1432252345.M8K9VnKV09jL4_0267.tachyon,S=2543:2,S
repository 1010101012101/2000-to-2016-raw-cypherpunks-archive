     I think also a great many of the young guys joined the National Guard in a
patriotic fervor right after 9/11, but by the time the crusade against Iraq got
started, quite a few had become well aware that Iraq had nothing to do with
9/11, that the invasion was all about oil, etc, and weren't willing to go. 
    It seems that the military is claiming that we are in a "national
emergency" and they can do whatever they want, despite laws to the contrary.
