I think "overlooking" is too strong a word,  I think it's more 
reasonable to call it mitigating circimstances.  The guardsman
needs to have it explained to him (in a way that the lesson will
stick) that he does not have the authority to block travellers 
because he doesn't like their attitude or their political views.
I'm not sure what disciplinary action is appropriate,  probably
a reptimand is good enough as long as it's made VERY clear that
any sort of repeat performance will result in sever consequences.
