Yes it is the case.  But many of us regard State force as a *very*
different thing
than a property owner's whims.  So the State can censor, but an
individual
merely doesn't want your bumper sticker on his car.  Individuals *can't*

censor in the 1st amend sense.  (Similarly with compelled speech.)
The State *must* treat everyone the same, but private entities are not
similarly bound.

The State must permit citizens to bear arms, but in
my saloon you leave them at the door, or don't enter.  Simple.
Entering my saloon is a private transaction.

1. Tech point: Any passive media for human consumption can NOT be
guarded
by gremlins.  ADCs handle that.  The "analog hole".
Active content (eg programs) can be though.

2. Many of us do worry about eroding conventional rights by these same
gremlins, *when they are supported by wrong law*.
E.g., I have a right in the US to lend a book.  A digital book
could make doing so a pain, but not impossible.  And again, I (as
reader)
have *no* right to compel the publisher to use a large font (if I've got

bad eyes) or make it easy to xerox.  Or backup or lend or sell.

Now, if it is simply some publisher's whim to release content protected
by gremlins, that's their decision.  *What gets our goat* is when the
State
uses its force eg  to make tinkering with our property illegal.

You'll need to understand that difference around here.  Many of us
(unlike many working for the State) still respect private property,
and *mutually consensual* transactions.

If you want to publish a book on paper that
prevents its xeroxing, that's fine.  Might be annoying, but its
within your rights.  But when the State says that say
scanners or image processing or figuring out how the book
is bound is illegal (DMCA), well...

A gremlin is a nuisance, a gremlin backed by the state.. indicates
that someone "needs killing", and its not the gremlin.

Again, you can publish in fonts that don't photocopy.
Its your right.  And its my right to try to get around that, to exercise

my right eg to fair use.  But it is immoral and unconstitutional for the

State to interfere with *either* of us -publisher or reader.

Because we're both choosing to enter a mutually consensual transaction,
the State has no grounds to interfere.  That's basically what freedom
is about.  It doesn't even matter if the transaction is harmful to one
or both of us; masochism (pharmaceuticals, N-ary sex between
arbitrary conspecifics, etc) should be legal.  Life liberty and the
pursuit of whatever.

Some of these journals have announced that

So?  And other journals are free to everyone.  (Is that unfair
competition?  No)  Its up to the journal, their contributors,
their readers.

Nice pun.  But librarians are merely acting in accordance with contracts

they chose to sign.  No one put a gun to their heads; only the State
does that.

I've bought some helically grooved vinyl disks.  This also gives me a
license
to play their content, or make a Wimshurst generator from them, or go
skeet shooting with them.
Should the vinyl object warp, I retain that license.  Should I
download an MP3 of the same content (which may have been derived
from diffraction-grating polycarbonate disks), this is no different than
making
a tape for my car.  It is not copyright infringement.

If I lend, or sell, my disks, I also transfer that license for the
duration of the
transfer.  Now forget that the content happens to be embedded in a slab
of plastic.

Bingo!  Librarians have the same rights as the rest of us mortals.
Similarly, it doesn't matter if 1 or 1e6 read my blog, we are
all reporters, and better recognized salaried reporters have no
special rights.

Its looking particularly grim because the Congressvermin are 0wn3d.
That doesn't change the principles.  Just makes us yearn for regime
change.
