>TOP SECRET CRYPTO - THE ONLY DATA ENCRYPTION PROGRAM TO USE THE ONE-TIME 
>PAD SYSTEM WHICH IS UNBREAKABLE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.
>
>With the current world situation after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, your 
>freedoms and privacy are under attack as never before by governments 
>around the world, all in the name of "safety". The Fourth Amendment to the 
>Constitution of the United States, in regards to e-mail and the Internet, 
>is being thrown out the window. Protect your right to electronic privacy 
>with Top Secret Crypto, the most powerful data  and e-mail encryption 
>program in the world. Do it now before it is too late and encryption 
>programs are made illegal worldwide.

>Top Secret Crypto (TSC) vs. PGP:

>  Maximum RSA Key Size:                       PGP: 2,048

>  Maximum Conventional Key Size:           PGP:    128 bits           TSC:

> File:                                       PGP:     N/A 
> TSC: Same size as file or e-mail message - Method 3
>
>TAN$TAAFL Software Company announces the release of Top Secret Crypto 
>v1.10 which includes the following new features (Writing, sending, 
>receiving, and reading encrypted e-mail messages just got a whole lot easier):
>
>(1) - Import and export Public Keys through the clipboard in radix-64 text 
>format.
>
>(2) - Encrypt and decrypt portions of documents, or whole documents, 
>through the clipboard.
>
>(3) - Write e-mail messages using a Rich Text Edit Box, encrypt the 
>message into a Top Secret Crypto Encrypted Message, and send it via your 
>MAPI enabled e-mail program. Include file attachments and request a read 
>receipt.
>
>(4) - View the contents of your e-mail inbox, read all messages in text 
>format, decrypt messages that are encrypted, and view the decrypted 
>message in a Rich Text Edit Box in its original format. Reply to, or 
>forward, any message.
>
>(5) - View and manage the contents of your Address Book.
>
>(6) - Send a regular e-mail message using your default e-mail program.
>
>(7) - Select a file to attach to a regular e-mail message using your 
>default e-mail program.
>
>Note: Items 4 thru 7 requires that your default e-mail program support the 
>Simple MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) Protocol, which 
>is used by e-mail programs such as Outlook, Outlook Express, or Eudora. 
>AOL 4.0 and 5.0 do not support this protocol.
>
>Top Secret Crypto is also the only encryption program that lets you create 
>and use True One Time Pad Files for use in encrypting files. A True One 
>Time Pad File provides one byte of random data for every byte in the file 
>you are encrypting. The encryption key is therefore as long as the file 
>you are encrypting. This constitutes a one-time pad encryption system that 
>is unbreakable in theory and practice. Privacy maintained by mathematical 
>law is now a reality.
>
>Using removable media drives that support disk sizes up to 1, 2, 10, or 
>even 20 gigabytes of random data; you can now create your own one-time 
>pads to encrypt files with. Using a new, extremely fast algorithm to 
>generate random data, a 1 gigabyte True One Time Pad File can be created 
>in under 7 minutes on a 400 MHz Pentium II computer (22+ hours on an 
>unregistered version using the original algorithm to generate random data).
>
>Top Secret crypto utilizes RSA Public Key cryptography with key sizes 
>ranging from 480 to 8,192 bits. It's conventional encryption algorithm, 
>used by Methods 1 and 2, strings together 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 256 pseudo 
>random number generators to provide extremely large key sizes. This is a 
>stream cipher whose output is considered a pseudo one-time pad. Method 3, 
>which encrypts with a True One Time Pad File, does not use any pseudo 
>random number generators. Each byte in the file is encrypted against one 
>byte of random data in a True One Time Pad File.
>
>Top Secret Crypto provides three methods to encrypt your files and e-mail 
>messages with, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
>
>Method 1
>========
>A randomly produced session key for the conventional encryption algorithm 
>is encrypted within a RSA Encrypted Integer. Depending on the size of the 
>smallest RSA Key used, Top Secret Crypto will seed 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 
>random number generators, which require 325-353, 613-669, 1189-1301, 
>2341-2565, or 4645-5093 random bits as the key. As long as the NSA cannot 
>break the RSA Public Key Encryption System, these key sizes should be 
>sufficient. I recommend a public key size of at least 4,096 bits. If you 
>have a fast computer, use 8,192 bits. This should ensure adequate security 
>for the foreseeable future.
>
>The advantages of using a randomly produced session key encrypted within a 
>RSA Encrypted Integer are (1) you can send an encrypted file to one or 
>multiple recipients at the same time and (2) no extra material, such as a 
>True One Time Pad File or One Time Pad Key File, is required to be 
>exchanged between the sender and recipient.
>
>The only disadvantage is if someone ever figures out a fast method of 
>factoring large integers into their prime components. The key to the 
>conventional encryption algorithm can then be extracted from the RSA 
>Encrypted Integer and your file can be decrypted.
>
>Method 2
>========
>A One Time Pad Key File is used to seed 256 pseudo random number 
>generators for the conventional encryption algorithm. This method provides 
>a key space of between 18,469 to 20,261 bits for the conventional 
>encryption algorithm. It is impossible for anyone to ever duplicate a key 
>space of this size. I consider this method 100% secure.
>
>The one advantage to using a One Time Pad Key File is its security. No one 
>can decrypt a file encrypted with a One Time Pad Key File unless they 
>steal a copy of the One Time Pad Key File.
>
>The disadvantages are (1) you can only send an encrypted file to one 
>recipient at a time, and (2) the sender and recipient must have a secure 
>method of exchanging One Time Pad Key Files.
>
>Method 3
>========
>A True One Time Pad File is used to encrypt your file with. This method 
>provides one byte of random data for each byte in the file you are 
>encrypting. The key space is just as long as the file. There are no pseudo 
>random number generators used, just random data. This is 100% secure and 
>cannot be broken in theory or practice.
>
>The one advantage to using a True One Time Pad File is its security. No 
>one can decrypt a file encrypted with a True One Time Pad File unless they 
>steal a copy of the True One Time Pad File.
>
>The disadvantages are (1) you can only send an encrypted file to one 
>recipient at a time, and (2) the sender and recipient must have a secure 
>method of exchanging True One Time Pad Files.
>
>Top Secret Crypto is particularly suited to businesses, (i.e. auditors, 
>newspaper reporters, agents, buyers, troubleshooters, etc.) where the True 
>One Time Pad Files, or One Time Pad Key Files, can be created in house for 
>use by individuals when they go out into the field to conduct their work. 
>They can then send back encrypted reports that are 100% secure from the 
>preying eyes of any government's intelligence agencies, here or abroad.
>
>Most individuals will find Method 1, a randomly produced session key 
>encrypted within a RSA Encrypted Integer, more convenient. After 
>exchanging Public Keys they can immediately start sending encrypted e-mail 
>and files.
