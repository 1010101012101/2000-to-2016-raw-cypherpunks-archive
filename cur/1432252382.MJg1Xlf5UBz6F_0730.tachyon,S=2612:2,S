General Ashcroft has announce the Second Amendment
applies to individuals.

This will apparently affect the case of a Tim Emerson,
a Texas physician accused of violating a 1994 law
barring people under restraining orders from having
guns. The DOJ is currently appealing the case claiming
the Second Amendment does not extend to an individual
the right to guns.

http://www.bradycampaign.org has filed an ethics
complaint against Ashcroft.

    WWW illiterate: http://usdoj.gov doesn't work.
