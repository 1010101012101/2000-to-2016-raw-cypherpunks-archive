Which is one of the very reasons people hesitate to break contracts. It's
just more advantageous the concentrate on mutual cooperation. Plus,
anonymity even rids the parties of a possibility of confrontation, be it in
court or on the street.

That's just the point. Anonymity might well create a new carrot leading
people to deceive. End-game performance and all that.

Yet one is left with more traditional means of redress, e.g. exposing the
other party to the public or the law enforcement, and the internal
bookkeeping mechanisms of the shadier markets themselves.

However, if the former group is large enough, as one suspects, it may well
repress any attempt to accommodate the needs of the latter. For instance,
legislative attacks on any widespread anonymity infrastructure are pretty
much a given when people, most of whom have precisely the kind of idealistic
conception of the legal system you describe, realize that law can't touch an
anonymous economy.
