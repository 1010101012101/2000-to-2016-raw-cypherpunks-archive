Perspective:  E-tracking, coming to a DMV near you
By Declan McCullagh
December 5, 2005, 4:00 AM PST

Trust federal bureaucrats to take a good idea and transform it into a
frightening proposal to track Americans wherever they drive.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has been handing millions of
dollars to state governments for GPS-tracking pilot projects designed to
track vehicles wherever they go. So far, Washington state and Oregon
have received fat federal checks to figure out how to levy these
"mileage-based road user fees."

Now that electronic tracking and taxing may be coming to a DMV near you.
The Office of Transportation Policy Studies, part of the Federal Highway
Administration, is about to announce another round of grants totaling
some $11 million. A spokeswoman on Friday said the office is "shooting
for the end of the year" for the announcement, and more money is
expected for GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking efforts.
