It's in one of the two paperback collections of Vinge's short stories 
and novellas, either in "Threats and Other Promises" or "True Names 
and Other Dangers." Both are out of print. I have both, but not in 
locations known to me as I write, so I can't check which one has "The 
Ungoverned."

The best bet has always been for folks to snap up Vinge novels as 
they are found in second-hand book shops. I bought several copies of 
"The Peace War," "Marooned in Realtime," and, of course, "True 
Names," in just this way.

Vinge just won a second Hugo Best Novel for "A Deepness in the Sky," 
so maybe this means the long-delayed re-issue of "True Names" will 
finally happen. (Alas, my essay for it was written several years ago, 
so is even more out of date. From the instant publishing on the Net 
to several years' delay in publishing in pulpspace.)
