What is the procedure (or are they secret :-) for passports which
become damaged whilst travelling out of country?

With a drivers license, if the magstrip doesn't work, they type
in the numbers.  But the biometrics are not encoded, its just
a convenience.  With a passport, they're relying on the
chip or no?

(Mechanical damage to the chip should work as well as
RF or antenna damage.  You will have to find the chip
and crack it, mere flexing of the paper carrier doesn't work
by design.)
