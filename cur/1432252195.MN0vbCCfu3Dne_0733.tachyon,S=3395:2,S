That may be so, but stories abound of drunk state legislators,
corruption, bribery, and other shenanigans involved in the ratification
of every Amendment from the Reconstruction up to the point people became
serious about doing the Right Thing (tm) with stuff like female suffrage
and the repeal of the prohibition amendment.  There are serious
questions about the validity, specifically, of the 16th, 17th, and 18th
amendments, and it is quite clear that even were there no trickery
involved in the passage of the civil rights amendments, Confederate
States were required to ratify them as a condition for re-joining (read
cessation of occupation) the Union.

Just like the 16th, if someone got a serious opposition movement going
against the 14th, Congress and the States would quickly ratify an
amendment authorizing ex-post-facto law in the specific instance in
question (and probably for all the Amendments that were questionably
ratified so they'd only have to deal with it once), and a follow-on
amendment similar to the 14th which would have effects retroactive to
the "ratification" of the 14th.
