There are no elections in a socialism.

One of my main complaints about Democratic Socialist is they have never
explained how one has a central party running everything and yet let
everyone have a choice on how it should be run.

Of course there is NOTHING in the Democratic Socialist part that actualy
commits the central party to the outcome of the elections either. Sort of
a empty promise.
