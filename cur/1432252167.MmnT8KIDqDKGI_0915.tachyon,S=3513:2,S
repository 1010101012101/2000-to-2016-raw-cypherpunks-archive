That's part but not all. Anarchy is not an absolute, only
an opposition to the prevailing archy whether capitalist,
socialist, capitalistic-socialism, socialistic-capitalism,
and their mealy-mouthed democratic-communistic-
oligarchic-theocratic precursors, successors and 
variations.

Anarchy is wonderfully chameleonic, which is why it
is the favorite cloaking for undercover agents of the
all the rest. And best, there are no leaders, only those
who disavow being leaders and thereby reveal their
true colors.

True leaders, a contradictory oxymoron, never preen,
are never courageous, never perform exceptional
actions, would never call attention to themselves so
ineptly, and do not exhibit exhibitionistic characteristics
such as lecturing and preaching to obsequious 
non-followers how to follow obediently without orders
being issued.

At least that is what the anarchist bible commanded
before it became discredited by overspin.

Then came the prefixes to fix that with branding.
Now those prefixtual brands get hammered, rightly so, 
and leftly so, so what, so easy, so ignorant.

Old Time Anarchy was invented by authoritarians
to entrap firebrand fools. Not much has changed.
Old fools hustling the youngsters.

This is not a confession merely, but a bible quote,
or I forget which list this is.
