I think there is even less "I" than most people suspect. I've recently
taken to some manual sampling of  SSL domain name server certificates ...
and finding certificates that have expired ... but being accepted by
several browsers that i've tested with (no complaints or fault
indications).

there was thread in another forum where I observed that back when
originally working on this payment/ecommerce thing for this small
client/server startup that had invented these things called SSL & HTTPS ...
my wife and I had to go around to various certificate manufactures with
regard to some due diligence activity. I think w/o exception that they all
made some comment about the "PK" being technical ... and the "I" being
service ... and providing "service" is an extremely hard thing to do (and
they hadn't anticipated how really hard it is).

some past ssl domain name certificate threads:
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/subtopic.html#sslcerts

As i've observed previously there are a number of ways that the technical
stuff for "PK" can be done w/o it having to equate to (capital) PKI ...

  "Opinion is divided on the subject" -- Captain Rum, Blackadder, "Potato".

The use with SSL is what Anne|Lynn Wheeler refer to as "certificate
manufacturing" (marvellous term).  You send the CA (and lets face it,
that's
going to be Verisign) your name and credit card number, and get back a
cert.
It's just an expensive way of doing authenticated DNS lookups with a ttl of
one
year.  Plenty of PK, precious little I.

You can play with semantics here and claim the exact opposite.  All of the
cases you've cited are actually examples of global distinguisher + locally
unique name.  For example the value 1234567890 taken in isolation could be
anything from my ICQ number to my shoe size in kilo-angstroms, but if you
view
it as the pair { <ICQ domain>, <locally unique number> } then it makes
sense
(disclaimer: I have no idea whether that's either a valid ICQ number or my
shoe
size in kilo-angstroms).

(This is very much a philosophical issue.  Someone on ietf-pkix a year or
two
 back tried to claim that X.500 DNs must be a Good Thing because RFC 822
email
 address and DNS names and whatnot are hierarchical like DNs and therefore
 can't be bad.  I would suspect that most people view them as just dumb
text
 strings rather than a hierarchically structured set of attributes like a
DN.
 The debate sort of fizzled out when no-one could agree on a particular
view).

I think the unified view is that what you need for a cert is a global
distinguisher and a locally meaningful name, rather than some complex
hierarchical thing which tries to be universally meaningful.  Frequently
the
distinguisher is implied (eg with DNS names, email addresses, "for use
within
XYZ Copy only", etc), and the definition of "local" really means "local to
the
domain specified in the global distinguisher".  I'm not sure whether I can
easily fit all that into the paper without getting too philosophical - it
was
really meant as a guide for users of PKI technology.

Peter.
