Why wouldn't the 'betting' part simply be another aspect of 'speech'? It
demonstrates POV only, neither the lottery operator or the party placing
the bet are acting alone or together to initiate harm to any individual.

There is also no clear mechanism to guarantee the winner is the same party
as the 'executer' of the act. So the lottery operation itself can't as a
result of its operation be shown to contribute to the executer.

So why isn't it 'speech'?
