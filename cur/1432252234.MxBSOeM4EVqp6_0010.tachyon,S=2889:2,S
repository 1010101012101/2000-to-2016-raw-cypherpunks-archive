I think that is exactly what we want.  When multiple, creditable, 
contributors approach a candidate (who have different, perhaps opposing 
agendas) and tell them they have made substantial contributions to the 
campaign what will the candidate do when the bank account figures don't add 
up and it comes time for delivering on requests from these 
contributors?  You know that once special interests understand that the 
candidates can't tell who contributed many attempt to cheat.  The result 
could be to greatly reduce special interest campaign contributions and 
their power in government.  It could make for an interesting study in game 
theory.
