This is exceedingly and wonderfully strange.

Let me suggest point 1 can be easily prototyped with a negative transaction fee
using an existing coin (might I also suggest a copycatcoin)

However, I think the phrase 'effectively unlimited wealth' is a dangerous phrase,
as there are some things which are effectively unlimited, like the amount of solar
energy that could be captured using existing rooftops. But what is limited is the 
*time and attention* of the people who know how to install and maintain said rooftop
solar.

I think it is wise to separate 'basic needs' from 'wealth wants' and that one can 
be quite happy and content with all basic needs met, but very little wealth. My 
view is unlimited wealth is somewhat of an inherent contradiction in terms. The very
function of 'wealth' is to provide a sorting function
