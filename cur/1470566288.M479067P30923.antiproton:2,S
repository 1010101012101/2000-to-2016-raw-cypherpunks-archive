But, apparently, they can predict what the other will see with > 85%
accuracy, whilst theory says they should only be able to do so with 75%
accuracy.

So, each side tests their respective entangled photon (85% certainty of
what the other side saw), then does it all again (another 85%), giving:
85% + 85% = 169% probability that each will "guess" what the other side
saw! That sounds pretty close to certainty to me...

PS: I'm sure someone can do the math better than I... but hopefully you
get the idea - each side "simultaneously" 'observes' their 'half' of an
entangled photon pair, say each second, and use these to reduce the
uncertainty, thereby reaching "1 bit" of information transfer...
