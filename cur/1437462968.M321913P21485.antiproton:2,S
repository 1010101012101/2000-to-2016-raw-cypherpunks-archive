The Pentagon et al are protecting a large portion of the world from being overrun.  Nobody else will do it.

Whatever you gotta believe.  Most of their job is to understand the world, publishing both a nice public database and the 
presidential daily brief (today's news).  And to consult with the President as need so that hopefully reasonably intelligent 
decisions are made, but that depends on the intelligence of the current president.

DOJ, Treasury, State, HHS, etc. are filled with worthless murdering scumbags?

There are certain people, Marines et al, who are trained to be very lethal.  Sucks to need that, but being anything less than the 
strongest & baddest isn't an option for the US.  They are concentrated, supposed to be carefully deployed and directed. Create 
people like that from the subset of people who want to be like that and a few are going to go off the rails occasionally. That's a 
bummer, and needs to be constantly protected against, but there's no obvious alternative.

The US is the least imperialist top superpower that ever existed. Still not perfect, but better than all the rest.

You haven't been watching long or closely enough.  Things have changed a lot in the US in my lifetime, and it's only speeding up.
