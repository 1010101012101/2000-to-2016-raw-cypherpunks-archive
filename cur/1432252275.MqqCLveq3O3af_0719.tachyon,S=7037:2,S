My experience is that there s already an easy method of identifying Tor  
hidden service nodes and this takes little time to do.

Let me explain why I come to that opinion.

Having  a static IP net connection, I set up a test web site as a Tor  
service on a Tor middleman server. That server had been a middleman server 
for about a year, no problems, no attempts to hack it in all that time.

Within 24hrs of making that Tor hidden service live I could see, in my  
firewall logs, hundreds of repeated attempts trying to hack my server,  
directly from the internet, not via my hidden Tot service. All were  
attempting to access various types of services/permissions which were  
mainly focused on attempting to gain control of a "web page server". All  
attacks were from US based places of higher education (colleges and  
universities), most from establishments where Tor servers were situated  
but not from Tor servers themselves.

Now bearing in mind that I had only EVER requested 1 web page (a blank  
test page - requested about 4 times) from my own Torrified web browser  
(out and back so to speak), and no OTHER (external) page requests were  
EVER received via the Tor hidden service, as shown by its log. Then  
someone must have been able to immediately see the service enter and track 
its source, who then attempted to hack the web server itself and it 
appeared to be a group of about 3 or 4 persons, each trying different  
attack strategy over a 12 hour period. Hundreds of commands were sent,  
many in quick succession as if they were in some sort of script file, but 
some were live, at one point I even watched them live as they were coming 
in as I countered their hack attempts.

As a result of this I did some serious thinking about Tor and came to the 
conclusion that someone out there and I believe it is THE global adversary 
(USA mil/sec) is able see with perfect transparency all Tor traffic.

Consider.:

Most Tor users see the Tor connections as merely a set of 3 or 4 connected 
nodes over which their traffic is routed, e.g. Tor1 - US, Tor 2 - Germany, 
Tor 3 France - EXIT. But in reality then internet is not like that, this is 
only the UPPER structure level. At the lower level the packets are routed 
over many dozens of sub-nodes, these nodes are invisible to the Tor map of 
your traffic. You can find out this info yourself if you wish to test out a 
single ROUTE to another IP address just by doing a traceroute url (tracert 
url for windows) command from a command line prompt window.  As you will 
see this is about a dozen hops to the average local url. But this is not 
the end of the problem, as some hops are hidden and they report only a 
virtual hop back to you.

e.g. lets say a node is in a server in an IBM/US telecoms company based in 
France, then that server will almost certainly be routing ALL its traffic 
through the USA and back to itself (or another node in the same company) 
before sending it on to the next external node. This diversion is NEVER 
reported as ONLY a single "virtual node ip" is quoted. The only way you can 
ever tell its been done is by looking at the time delay, however this is 
also often difficult/impossible to spot because these routes are often the 
fastest on the internet. OK - I know this goes on for certain because there 
are internal tools used within these companies to trace the TRUE route and 
I have seen such servers send their traffic in this manner 24/7 - 365. 
Having discussed this as "wasted effort" with a network engineer I was told 
there is a "payment" made somewhere to compensate. At the same time all of 
this is camouflaged in apparently nice and legitimate reasons for it being 
that way, but when you pull it apart you see the lie, but you can't PROVE 
it.

As about 70% of Europe's internet traffic passes through an IBM/US telco's 
servers then it almost certain that in any one of these Tor node to Tor 
node connections there is at least one sub-nodes that passes the traffic 
through the USA, who is the global adversary using Total Traffic Timing 
Tracking.


You should be able to work the rest out for yourself.
