Since when did people stop trying? The last time I heard a researcher talk 
about trying to break a Cypherpunks-interesting cipher was last Thursday. 
Hearsay and hot air? Probably; nothing that merits repeating. But it's 
hardly a dead issue.

We've all heard that line before, but I still don't think it's too far-
fetched to assume that anyone who does work in this area might appreciate 
50 megs of free software to create his own supercomputer.

You never know what might come from putting that kind of computational 
power in the hands of people here. Create, break, do whatever you want.
