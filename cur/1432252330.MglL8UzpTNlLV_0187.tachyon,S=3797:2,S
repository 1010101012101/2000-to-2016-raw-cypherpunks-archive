There has recently been some discussion on UKcrypto of a  hypothesised
eavesdropping-safe boot CD containing OS & necessary software to get
encrypted IP links to a (predetermined?)  safe site.

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.fairbrother/

The "won't be able to import files" and so on sounds familiar from a
long time ago. Isn't this the case in the maximum implementation of the
old coloured book standards? (Too boring to look it up)

Also I'd like to see a "multi-platform CD that users boot from" that
would work with OC, Mac, Sun etc...
