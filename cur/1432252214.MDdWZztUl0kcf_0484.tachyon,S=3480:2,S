Has anyone here smoked any federally grown grass?
How does it compare to stuff you can buy on the
street?

The idea of getting approval from all states he
flew over (below) is clearly absurd.  But insisting
on carrying smoking materials when smoking is prohibited
is also absurd -- it doesn't say if he was keeping
it on his person or trying to put it in checked
baggage, but it seems unlikely he would have had
any problem if it was checked.
