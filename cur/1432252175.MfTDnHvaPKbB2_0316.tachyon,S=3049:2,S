Informative post by Seth.

But why would Google Docs be any more trustworthy than
Google search and other freebies by the Gorgon? With the
admitted cooperation of Google with authorities by law
and by commercial opportunity?

Same dubity applies to cloud servers whose biggest most
lucrative customers are governments and those most
eager to gain government favor.

The seemingly endless pursuit of the holy grail of online
security, yet remain within government protection, is daunting
if Sisyphean: the Soviet-style collectivization of hiding, exposing
and faking vulnerabilities and illusory defenses; Guevara
insurgencies of work-arounds, Cheney-like enforcing of fire
rediscovery and wheel reinvention; David Blaine levitation
of wizard coding reputations to cover deliberate back-dooring
for personal gain and patriotism; TLA-grade proliferating
outlets for inseminating infected blood into coding with
rigged modules under cover of malware combat aka as
freedom fighting for chauvinistic-tainted comsec validation
as diseased as Crypto AG.

It was for a brief period security-wise to reject any major
enterprise as a means to protect communications due to
certainty those will be compromised by commercial
interest and state protection. Now the bigger the better,
the more venal the more desirable.

Never mind the obvious trickle down from accumulated
wealth to needy researchers ready to wear whatever hats
fit ambition, personal debt, family obligations, withering
of courage, no apologies for changing camps offered.
