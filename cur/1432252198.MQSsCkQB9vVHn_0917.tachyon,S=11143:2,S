          <font size=2>IRPC was founded in 1999 by experienced insurance claims personnel with over 35 years combined experience in the property and casualty insurance industry. The Company was formed in response to the needs of local insurance adjusters who desired reliable product information.<P>
          Over the past two years, IRPC has incurred over ten thousand working hours in research and development to establish a proprietary, personal property knowledge base, complete with a technology infrastructure and training program. With a network of alliances, the adoption of advanced technology, and management expansion expertise, IRPC will prosper in a traditional industry that is prime to readdress the legacy fragmented management systems and bring them into current business procedures.

        We think any investor looking into acquiring a position in Insurance Replacement Center Inc. should first look at the staggering potential of insurance replacement services and then think about how to get into it.
		<p>
		You then have to ask yourself, as an investor, if all of these things what is the best way to participate in this burgeoning industry? You would certainly expect that among the winners would have to be one or two of the companies that are in early and driving this potential <b>multi billion dollar market</b>.
		<p>
		If over the next 12 months, <b>IRPC</b> with their proprietary database, and with rapid commercialisation of their service, on an annualized basis were to generate <b>just $13.25 Million Dollars in revenue</b> and EBITDA of $1.9 Million, or just a quarter of the Company's next year projections then applying the Industry's <b>Price to Earnings Ratio multiple of 13.5 times</b>, would equate to <b>a market cap of $25.6 Million Dollars</b>.
		<P>
		Thus, when applying the comparative group's price to earnings multiples (for insurance adjusters and services it is currently 13.5 times) to <b>IRPC</b> and shares oustanding of we can arrive at a relative valuation of $2.98 per share over the next 12 months.
        <P>
        <P>
        <font size=3 color="#2D09FF"><b>Conclusion</b></font><br>
        <b>IRPC</b> is a development stage company. With many development stage companies, there are many risks as well as the potential rewards.
		With the stock today trading today for pennies on the dollar, one way to look at <b>IRPC</b> is as a perpetual call option on the future success of the company.
		<P>
		In our opinion, the risk in owning <b>IRPC</b> is no greater than owning an out of the money six month call option on Intel, Cisco, or Microsoft. You may lose some of your money or you could make a sizeable profit.
