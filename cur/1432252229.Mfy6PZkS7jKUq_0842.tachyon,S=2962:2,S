That seems almost the opposite of politics to me. The actual 
politics - the arguments, the decisions - has been done in some 
smoke-filled room beforehand. The public meeting is nothing more 
than the product launch.

Well, yes. If only because the buyer and seller are both extending 
the reach of their lives to influence others to behave in the way 
that they want. Using money in this case rather than votes or 
threats, but still in a sense a kind of politics.

And of course on a large scale more obviously what is more 
conventionally called politics - that small transaction, a dollar 
for a cup of coffee, multiplied by millions can cause armies to 
move, can set up and tear down governments, induce luxury in one 
place, famine in another. If we can say that war is  politics 
carried on by another means we can also say that markets are 
politics carried on by other means.

Not unless we are living as hermits.  Our entire lives involve 
rubbing up against other people and negotiating our relations with 
them. Which is basically what politics is
