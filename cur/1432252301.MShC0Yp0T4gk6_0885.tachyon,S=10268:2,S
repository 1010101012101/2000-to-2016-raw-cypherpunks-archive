About This Conference

Proper credentialing enables federal agencies to enhance government
efficiency, reduce identity fraud, protect personal privacy and comply with
government mandates.  The Credentialing and Identity Assurance Conference
will delve into the current political, logistical and technological
implications and issues surrounding Homeland Security Presidential
Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and the Federal Information Processing Standard 201
(FIPS-201).

This conference will give federal and state employees, government
integrators and industry stakeholders insight to the interoperable and
future-proof solutions needed to ensure proper credentialing.  It will
cover compliance and interoperability issues between various components
including PKI, smartcards, middleware, card management systems and physical
access systems to minimize integration challenges.  It will highlight the
significant impact and challenges of government agencies' policies,
processes and technologies, as well as provide an overview on the status of
compliance.

Attendees will learn about the latest technologies that are being utilized,
such as biometrics, and the technical specifications required integrating
these advancements into legacy, current and future credentialing systems.

Attendees will also be given an opportunity to get an overview of new
government credentialing programs such as the Western Hemisphere Traveler
Initiative (WHTI), also known as ePassports, and the REAL ID Act on
driver's license reform.  Attendees will come away from this conference
with insights into the timetables, opportunities and challenges ahead for
government issuers at both federal and state agencies, accreditation and
testing authorities, procurement programs and the industry as a whole.

This conference provides an ideal forum for attendees to share experiences
and challenges with their peers, receive an update on policy fronts, and
more importantly, learn proven methods, processes and approaches for
learning the latest on credentialing and achieving compliance.

Industry trends represented in the credentialing market
