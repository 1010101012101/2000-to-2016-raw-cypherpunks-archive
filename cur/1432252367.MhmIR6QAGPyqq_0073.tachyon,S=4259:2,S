Depends on what one is meaning by 'anonymous'. Context is quite important.
Can somebody go through their entire life completely anonymously? Not
likely. Email on the internet? Likely, if they are very careful and nobody
has any reason to suspect them of anything for some other reason.

It's a set theory sort of issue. Thinks like 'signature analysis' come in
handy. When people engage in ANY activity there is 'evidence' left behind.
The trick is to understand the (hopefully) distinctive differences in
different activities. Then one can 'measure' the sample at the site and
(supposedly within some delta of error) determine what did happen. The
only way to be truly anonymous would be to never leave any sort of
evidence. That's (at least for any practical intent or purpose)
impossible.
