Hard to say because you were only exposed a few times.  If you don't have
any genetic triggers, it may have no effect at all.  Not to mention all
the other chemicals you've been exposed to that might couteract any
effect, and lack of exposure to accelerants.  I've seen pictures of DDT
fogs at beaches crowded with people.  At the time, it was considered
harmless to humans.  It may actually be harmless to us, it's just not
harmless to everything else.

A world without mosquitoes would be pretty bleak given how many other
things eat them.  Better to wipe out the malaria and swat the mosquitos!

Patience, persistence, truth,
