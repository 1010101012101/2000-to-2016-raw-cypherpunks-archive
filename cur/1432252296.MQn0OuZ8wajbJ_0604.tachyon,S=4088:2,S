While I would expect that Dr. Chomsky didn't "manufacture" some "consent"
of his own here, I wouldn't be surprised, given his fetish about same, and,
since it's pretty trivial to prove or disprove, I'll get back to you when I
get around to looking it up. Someday.

If you're in a hurry to actually back up your assertion, however, you're
welcome to do so sooner, if you would like. :-).

Cheers,
