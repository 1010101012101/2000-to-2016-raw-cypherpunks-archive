They would seem to be at war with any non-believers/non-muslims,
America and its foreign policy simply make it the most attractive target
for such war.

Well, it wouldn't go over well for a country whose very foundation was
based on the premise of freedom of [approved] religion. My take on it is
that in our infinite wisdom, we are not realizing that to make "war on
terrorism" and then going around saying that we should put all ragheads
in an internment camp is going to produce a negative sentiment within
muslim populations. Regardless of what the Government says, look at the
public reaction by and large. We arent going after the "freedom
fighters" of americam,  We dont read about the public clashes between
"concerned citizens" and any of the alledged terrorist groups within
this country. We do read about mosques being arsoned, mulsims being
beaten and so on...

who could have the right picture right now and share it and be believed?
