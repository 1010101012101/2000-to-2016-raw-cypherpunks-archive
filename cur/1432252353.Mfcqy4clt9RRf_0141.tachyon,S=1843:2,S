Subject: Syria blackout?
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.1278)

Customers (from UAE) who have servers with us in Atlanta - one of the companies I work for, remaining anonymus for the moment - are reporting that their sub-customers and viewers from Syria can't access FTP or download any kind of Flash/video/multimedia content from inside that country. Completely blocked.

Anyone confirms?

Another government blockage to avoid social captiruing of massacre videos and photos?
