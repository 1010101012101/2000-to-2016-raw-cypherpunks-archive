A deadly weapon triggered by unreliable SW using a nonexistant database
would just give away the fact that you're on to the enemy and cause you
undue legal grief. If your own surveillance remains a secret you're in a
stronger position. Besides, should you care to tip your hand you might
start with something simpler like indelible purple dye. IIRC human skin
has a replacement period of ~3 weeks. Chances are your intruders would
be from some local or regional installation. Purple people shouldn't be
too tough to spot as they make their way to the office and home again (
unless you live in California ). Your more aggressive tactics could then
be employed at a time and place of your choosing.

 Much funnier would be a spray of DMSO mixed with DMT. And reapplyed evertime 
they tried to get up. That way, if you made a mistake, and it got
you -- oh well. But for a tensed up, uptight LEO -- he'd probably 
never recover. And still be there babbling for you to have a little fun
with when you got home.
