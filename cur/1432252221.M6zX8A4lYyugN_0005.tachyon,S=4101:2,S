Personally, I prefer the strategy Israel uses with Palestinian
territories' telephone booths. - They all come pre-installed with 
explosive devices that can be remotely activated, for example
if and when a certain number is called (like mossad suicide-attack
volunteer recruitment office.)

Maybe US airplanes should have remotely activated explosive devices 
in them, so that when the next inevitable revenge of a revenge of a 
revenge highjacking occurs, the people in Washington can just press
the button and explode the plane over the sea.

I mean, now the fighters were too slow to shoot down the three first
planes. (Yeah, it's just a "heroic passengers" cover-story for the
ugly truth..)
