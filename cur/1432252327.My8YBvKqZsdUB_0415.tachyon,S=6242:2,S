Maxim's comments match my thoughts with regards to both current
Cryptocat over SSL and my analogy to Riseup webmail over SSL.

If Riseup does what they say they do[1], emails sitting on their servers
are not mined for advertising or LE (unlike Facebook chat, or as Maxim
suggests, gmail); their servers do not log IPs; IPs are not embedded in
emails; and outgoing emails to other secure email providers are
encrypted (StartTLS).

Furthermore, it appears Riseup plans[2] encryption for stored emails on
their servers in the future. Such a scheme would make the emails
difficult for LE, or more broadly, attackers, to get, even with a
warrant -- not only would they have to obtain forced decryption power,
which I don't think they have as of yet in the US, but also Riseup might
not be able to provide the relevant keys in any case. (That the NSA has
copies is a vulnerability, but perhaps not a relevant one, as to my
knowledge LE can't introduce NSA copies as evidence.)

Similarly with current Cryptocat over SSL: if the server and server
operator do what they say they do, there aren't data-mining operations
going on for the benefit of LE or advertisers.

Both Riseup and current Cryptocat over SSL rely on good SSL connections
and also trust that the server and server operator aren't compromised
(including incorrect implementations). Those 3 dependencies are far from
ideal, but at least the risk calculations are ones some activists
without access to OTR or PGP or their own .mx can make. Better than
known bad actors, known bad servers.

Maybe my technical understanding is lacking something here, but I
believe the above to be correct.
