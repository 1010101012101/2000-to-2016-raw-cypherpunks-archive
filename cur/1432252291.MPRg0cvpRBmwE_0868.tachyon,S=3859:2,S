I could add an X-Toad: line to the header that you can filter on. The openpgp.net node is using listproc and the removal of the Received: lines is hard coded into the software (I have tried to override it in the config file but it just ignores that setting).

Jim could modify his tagging method to add the CDR: tag between the Re: and the subject. This would prevent the Re: CDR: Re: CDR: Re: mess that shows up on to many subject lines.
