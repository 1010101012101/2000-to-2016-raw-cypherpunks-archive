There Is Absolutely 
Nothing To Worry About
By Diane Harvey

I realize people are nervous and unsettled but I don't understand why
anyone should be upset or worried about anything. 
Personally, I feel just fine. I believe "They", our wise leaders, are
doing as well as can be expected so far, if I am understanding any of
this correctly: 
They don't know where their main target is. 
They aren't sure if it matters anyway. 
They aren't sure that going after Afghanistan is necessary, but maybe
it is. 
They aren't sure where they can base their stuff, but certainly
something will work out. 
They want to do some serious stuff immediately, but some of them
don't. 
They think maybe a lot of bombs would be really good, but maybe not. 
They think that nuclear weapons are probably not a good idea, but
maybe they are. 
They aren't sure what sort of stuff they want to do, or where, or
when, or to whom, but they are sure there must be something. 
They say that some of their allies aren't sure if they really want to
help, but maybe they will. 
They have lots of evidence that it was bin Laden and the Taliban's
fault and maybe they will share this soon, but maybe not. 
They aren't sure if it was Lebanon's fault, but it might be. 
They aren't sure if it was Iran's fault, but it might be. 
They aren't sure if it was the Palestinian's fault, but it might be. 
They aren't sure if it was Saudi Arabia's fault, but it might be. 
They think maybe Saddam did it, but maybe not. 
They do know for sure it was certainly many people's fault anyway,
whoever and wherever they are. 
They know that the countries in the current deployment and attack
regions are extremely volatile, but assure us that maybe nothing will
happen. 
They know that biological, chemical, or even nuclear attack in this
country may be immanent, but maybe not. 
They say that our water supplies are in danger, but maybe not. 
They say that there are probably a lot of people here who are going
to do terrible things, but maybe they won't. 
They say not to worry about this because there is nothing you can do
to protect yourselves anyway. 
They say the economy will remain strong, but maybe it won't. 
They say that the best thing we can do about all this is to go out
and buy more stuff. 
They say that we need a whole lot of new laws immediately because we
are in grave danger and this is no time to be fussy about an outdated
and hampering Constitution. 
  
Doesn't this sound like a good plan to you? I don't see anything here
for any normal person to bother worrying about.
