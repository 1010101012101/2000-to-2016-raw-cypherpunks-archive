It ain't luck. Unless I worked for the publisher or a major distributor,
I would never consider wagering on the ship date of a book that has been
delayed for so long. Amazon's page still states as of the writing of
this email that the book is not yet shipping and claims that the book
will ship in the future, but since some list members have received a
copy of book, the page appears to be in error.

Looks like you might win your wager with the unnamed Cypherpunk after
all.
