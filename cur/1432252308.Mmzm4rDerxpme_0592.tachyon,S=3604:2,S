   You have to realize that there are any number of fedzis who subscribe to this
list, it's a well authenticated fact, matter of court testimony. And fedzis
aren't noted for brains, or even being able to read, which is why he attacked
you instead of me. And of course most fedzis positively foam at the mouth when
hearing the truth being spoken, thus the rabid nature of his spewing.

"War is just a racket ... something that is not what it seems to the
majority of people. Only a small group knows what its about. It is
conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the
masses."  --- Major General Smedley Butler, 1933

"Our overriding purpose, from the beginning through to the present
day, has been world domination - that is, to build and maintain the
capacity to coerce everybody else on the planet: nonviolently, if
possible, and violently, if necessary. But the purpose of US foreign
policy of domination is not just to make the rest of the world jump
through hoops; the purpose is to faciliate our exploitation of
resources."
- Ramsey Clark, former US Attorney General
