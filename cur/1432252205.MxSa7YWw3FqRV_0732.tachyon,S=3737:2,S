>From 14 users of Safeweb scattered around the US and 
several overseas, the same range of IP addresses
were used. Which makes sense if all users logged into
the same Safeweb home page and from there logged
onto Cryptome. A few users logged in from their own
addresses just before or after using Safeweb for
comparison.

No triangulation with that method.

One thing my co-cpunk found by pinging Safeweb is that
the last couple of hops were in the NYC area:

13  lga1-ord2-oc48-2.lga1.above.net (208.185.156.158)  112.562 ms  111.984
ms  112.53 ms
14  core2-lga1-oc192.lga2.above.net (208.184.232.198)  114.423 ms  113.431
ms  112.688 ms
15  main1colo45-core2-oc48.lga2.above.net (216.200.127.174)  113.138 ms
113.855 ms  111.581 ms
16  208.184.48.189.safeweb.com (208.184.48.189)  113.78 ms  115.876 ms
113.534 ms
17  64.124.150.130.safeweb.com (64.124.150.130)  112.797 ms  112.937 ms
112.228 ms

This is on the assumption that "lga2" refers to "La Guardia,"
but that is not certain for the tag may have nothing to do with
physical location. However other above.net hops used airport
tags.

If you would like to ping Safeweb we would appreciate getting
the logs for comparison. Just be alert to this being a scam to snarf
your true identity, so leave off the first hop if you like, or just send in
the
last four or five hops leading up to Safeweb.

The IP addresses of 64.124.150.130 et seq. is what we are tracking, but 
note the other Safeweb address in the ping log. So we would like to get any
fresh safeweb addresses in ping logs beyond this range and altogether
different domains:

  64.124.150.130 - 64.124.150.144

Thanks.
