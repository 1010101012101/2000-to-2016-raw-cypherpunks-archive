Your customer may have seen this article (or a similar one):

http://www.oreillynet.com/etel/blog/2006/03/strangely_ssl_vpns_can_help_vo.html

After reading it a year ago, I've found their discoveries to hold true
on my own (small) projects with voip.  In a nutshell:

"In every case, adding an SSL VPN to a VoIP call over a good broadband
network improved call quality. So in effect, wrapping a VoIP call in
SSL gives it more structure, kind of like the rind of good Brie. What
we had not counted on was the huge difference between what VoIP
requires (64Kbps) and a typical broadband connection of 500Kbps or
more. Because the broadband connection was so fast, TCP was able to
repair the impairments without reducing voice quality. "

May or may not apply to your situation, but if bandwidth isn't scarce
then I wouldn't be surprised if your customer is correct, at very
least they are not crazy :)

Good luck
