>>"The subject line says 'Hi' and will be from someone you know,"
Symantec security response group manager Kevin Haley said. "The
text will say 'How are you? I saw this screensaver and immediately
thought of you.' That's a giveaway."<<

Authors, How can you put so much effort into writing cool virii
and do such an amateur job on the social engineering?

Include a hundred different, likely sounding subject lines (encrypted
of course, but you knew that).   A single constant subject line is *so*
easy to warn
against.  You are defeated by word of mouth and a little medium-term
memory.
Exceed the human memory requirements, gentlemen.   You'll have a better
chance of a truly inspiring piece of electronic performance art.
