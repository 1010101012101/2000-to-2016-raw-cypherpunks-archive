Osama Bin Laden can already send orders by PGP, or even S/MIME --
but fortunately he did not, perhaps for lack of comprehension.  No
one is cracking down on PGP or S/MIME.  A few assholes floated
some trial balloons, and spread some stories, but the Bush
administration, while selling out to everyone else, blew that one
off, perhaps figuring that if Bin Laden could not understand the
issue, neither would the critics.
