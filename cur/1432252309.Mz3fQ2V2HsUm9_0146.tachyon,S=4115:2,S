New Mexico appears to be having a problem ...

Some ballots are not found.
What would YOU do about it?

A computer glitch left out 60K+ ballots.
What would YOU do about it?

For the violently anti-Gore types:  This state
appears to be the opposite of New Mexico in
terms of political pursuasion.  A re-count or
a re-do could very well put Bush ahead.
