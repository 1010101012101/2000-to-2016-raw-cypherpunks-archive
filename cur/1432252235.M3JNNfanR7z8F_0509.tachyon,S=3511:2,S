While this may be true in the theoretical sense, it doesn't mean that
one can't make correlation attacks less practical. I find it hard to
believe that right now NSA, for instance, has Tor traffic analysis
tightly integrated into its worldwide communications sniffing
framework, simply because it's too much of a logistic problem, and
anonymous networks are unlikely to be sufficiently high-profile
targets so as to warrant expending the resources to deal with the
logistics (yet). But I think that it is entirely believable that NSA
has a dedicated project (even if only for research purposes) where the
traffic from all known relays (a relatively stable pool of ~3000
nodes?) is sniffed and analyzed b that would be relatively simple to
setup and maintain, given the unlimited interception capabilities. And
you can combat the latter b by extending and popularizing the entry
bridges concept, implementing exit bridges, making all clients relays
by default (even if that won't contribute significant bandwidth), etc.
