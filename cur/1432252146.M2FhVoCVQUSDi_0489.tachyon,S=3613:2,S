How would they even know one's views on this thing you're talking about?

(I'm not sure I know the name of this thing you're talking about, 
especially because I decided a long time ago not to carefully 
investigate this thing you're talking about, and especially not to 
carefully remember the name of this thing you're talking about, just so 
that I could honestly shrug and say "No, I don't know what that thing 
you're talking about is about.")

Also, my experience in 1973 with a jury trial (the last time I was 
registered Republican, the last time I served on a jury) was that the 
jurors were of course selected for a specific trial. I don't think your 
model works, where they quiz the prospective jurors and then shunt the 
un-PC off to traffic court. Basically, one doesn't have to answer _any_ 
questions until voir dire for the specific case has begun.

And then it's best to just play dumb about that thing you mentioned, or 
find a reason to mention that thing you talked about if one's intent is 
to be immediately drop-kicked out of the jury pool. (Which ends one's 
involvement...there is no "stick you on traffic accident cases" 
exception.)

But that thing you mentioned is curious...I seem to have forgotten 
about it already.
