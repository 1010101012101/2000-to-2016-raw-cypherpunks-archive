There is a common example of this corner case where the memory is paged.
The page containing the key is swapped out, then it is read back in and the
key is overwritten, and then the page is deallocated.  Many OSs will not
zero the disk copy of the key.

Crypto coders have discussed many kludges to ensure that keys are not
swapped out, but they are all quite system specific.  Since the problem we
were trying to solve is different environments producing different results,
I don't feel we are any closer to safe, portable code.
