Thanks for the BS, Josh. I was on the original cypherpunks list back in =
the day and have been on email lists since 1989 or so. Maybe I can =
explain to you how the Internet works.

That said, spam is spam and Bell=92s personal problems are not something =
I give a shit about. I=92m obviously not the only one. I know several =
people who have left this list recently due to the almost complete lack =
of signal to noise. Perhaps you embrace this though.
