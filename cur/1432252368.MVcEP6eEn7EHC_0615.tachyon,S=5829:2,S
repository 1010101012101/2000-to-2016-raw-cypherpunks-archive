Bravo! I would have done it anonymously anyway.

That is a MAJOR issue with anonymity. But you are mistaken: not only
text, but HTML / XML can be clean with a careful, but fast examination.
Also the derivates like EPUB. Otherwise, hairy and badly written
standards always will have places to watermark. Imagination is the
limit. That goes for PDF for example. Most of the watermarks could fall
with a succession of conversions which will degrade the quality of the
document, but will erase the less imaginative watermarks (say PDF ->
DJVU -> PDF). To downright criminal formats like .DOC which are ready to
store information about your configuration and private document path.

You could, for example, process PDFs or scans through Abbyy Finereader
which is quite fast and reliable. The OCR results will discard part of
the image fingerprinting if not all and also the metadata.

That's because the major players of the Internet are LIVING out of
selling data to third parties. An anonymous individual is not a
liability as they declare, but a loss of revenue. Still, at the time,
they can't really verify everybody so a lot of people just slip in. But
Google and Facebook are pretty decided to close this gap ASAP. And the
less than very big players still can get a nice income out of selling
data, or are plain careless. Myself I'm amazed of how many sites are
ready to share their data with Facebook or Google for free.

That is very hard to achieve. Once things become a few clicks away
carelessness shows its head. And people are already so very used to give
their private data expecting someone else to take care and hide it. And
it takes a few more steps in terms of thinking than the regular ways.
Because it's not enough to buy a new GSM prepaid card in order to
receive calls from a third party. Because the phone in which you use the
card has a serial number that is already associated with an identity.
Because nobody from the botherb life can use that number for a chat.
Because you can't spend those extra credits just about to expire by
midnight talking with your dear mother. Because mobile phones reveal
location.

Wikileaks had the advantage of filtering data and protecting the source.
But they could not protect Bradley from talking too much with a
mercenary. People publishing themselves is a huge risk. And that without
couting people trained to find out stuff. It can be as easy as a couple
of exchanged comments.
