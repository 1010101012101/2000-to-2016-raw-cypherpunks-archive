If this approval by the ITU is true - then it is no surprise at all, but  
what one would expect. What else has the ITU in the past ever been than an 
instrument that supports capitalist interests and commodification of the 
ICT and telecommunications industries?

DPI can advance large-scale monitoring of citizens by the state-capital  
complex that is connected by a right-wing state ideology of fighting crime 
and terror by massive use of surveillance technologies and a neoliberal 
ideology of capitalist organisations that want to make a profit out of 
surveillance and want to hinder the undermining of intellectual property 
rights.
See this:
Christian Fuchs: Implications of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Internet  
Surveillance for Society.
