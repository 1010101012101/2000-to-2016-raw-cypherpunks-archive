A friend of mine recently applied for a US Passport, having never had one
before.  On the application form it stated that the requirements for getting
a US Passport were to fill out the form, and present it in person to an
"acceptance agent" with a certified copy of ones birth certificate, and
state ID over 6 months old, and raise your hand and swear to some stuff.

That having been done, my friend was surprised to get a letter from the
Feebs a few weeks later, saying that "The Identification You Provided is Not
Sufficient for Passport Purposes" and stating that the application would be
denied unless he submitted AT LEAST 5 additional documents containing a
photo and/or signature and an issue date, "issued over a period of time", as
well as identification, and filled out a Feeb-provided form demanding
contact information for all his relatives, and contact information for all
his employers in the last ten years, as well as a list of all the schools
he's attended with dates, and all the places he's resided.

The letter also warned, "Failure to comply with this request will result in
a delay for any future requests."

They also kept his birth certificate.

Which raises the following questions.

1. Why does the Department of State fail to disclose the real documentation
requirements on the passport application?

2. Can the government refuse to issue a passport to a US citizen,
effectively making them a political prisoner, unable to travel, by demanding
unreasonable documentation, and then filing their passport application in
limbo if they refuse to provide it or it doesn't exist?

3. Is there a way to get a passport without being forced to give the
government information that is none of their business?
