 FFIEC Guidance
  Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment
 FIL-103-2005
  October 12, 2005


 Summary:
 The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has issued
 the attached guidance, "Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment."
 For banks offering Internet-based financial services, the guidance
 describes enhanced authentication methods that regulators expect banks to
 use when authenticating the identity of customers using the on-line
 products and services. Examiners will review this area to determine a
 financial institution's progress in complying with this guidance during
 upcoming examinations. Financial Institutions will be expected to achieve
 compliance with the guidance no later than year-end 2006.

  Highlights:
 	* 	 Financial institutions offering Internet-based products and
 services should use effective methods to authenticate the identity of
 customers using those products and services.
 	* 	 Single-factor authentication methodologies may not provide
 sufficient protection for Internet-based financial services.
 	* 	 The FFIEC agencies consider single-factor authentication, when
 used as the only control mechanism, to be inadequate for high-risk
 transactions involving access to customer information or the movement of
 funds to other parties.
 	* 	 Risk assessments should provide the basis for determining an
 effective authentication strategy according to the risks associated with
 the various products and services available to on-line customers.
 	* 	 Customer awareness and education should continue to be
 emphasized because they are effective deterrents to the on-line theft of
 assets and sensitive information.
