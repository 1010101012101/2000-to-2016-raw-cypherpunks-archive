Nifty little tool showing the estimated cost of controlling the majority of
the Bitcoin network:

https://www.resallex.com/bitcoin/brix

Would love to see something similar for the Tor network - my guess is that
the cost there is probably at least an order-of-magnitude lower, but that's
just my intuition.

equal to 51% of the present value (&quot;PV&quot;) of all future revenues derived 
from bitcoin mining using current Mt. Gox prices.
                                        Revenues include both block 
rewards and transaction fees. The purpose behind using PV as a measuring
 tool is to approximate the incentives to miners to build upon the 
Bitcoin network.
                                        The measure can be viewed as an 
aggregate of all the cost-benefit analyses done by individual miners.

independent of technology advancements.
                                        Under the equilibrium model, 
miners will continue to invest in equipment until they reach the point

aggregate cost equals aggregate revenue.

can affect mining revenue are held constant ($/btc &amp; transaction 
fees), then it is easy to calculate aggregate revenue and therefore also
 aggregate cost.
                                        Since we know aggregate revenue 
equals aggregate cost, by calculating 51% of aggregate revenue we
