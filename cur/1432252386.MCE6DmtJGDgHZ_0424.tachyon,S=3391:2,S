So, the pledges pour in.  Now the intended target figures, hell, I'll just
predict my OWN death, fake it and anonymously collect those pledges.  Then
I'll use whatever portion of the $60 million I actually receive to buy
better security.  Rinse and repeat.  Do you really think folks are going to
play the game again with Joe Target after he is resurrected?  Especially if
he tells everyone exactly what he did and promises to do it again if another
price is put on his head?

Please folks, that took me all of 30 seconds to figure out.  Do some
analysis before you spout off about AP.  IT WON'T WORK.  Please make a note
of it.

Is "free range bank" supposed to convey some sort of meaning?

a) Define "free range bank."

b) Give three examples.  (There are "a lot" of them "out there," right?)
