Naw, he's been around longer than that.  This is the earliest
message I can find:
    http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/11/msg00633.html

It's interesting to note how much more pleasant Choate was in his
early days on the list.  In those days, he was not so intent on
showing everyone that he was an authority on all possible subjects.
