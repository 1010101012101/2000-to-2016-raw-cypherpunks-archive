And there was a star in the east...
I actually updated my webpage, not as fully as I would like, but
I updated all the dead links and added about a dozen or so papers.
In particular there is now a link to the "Why I'm not an Entropist"
paper, the "Practical Vulnerabilities of the Tor Anonymity Network"
paper that Andrew asked me to post over a year ago, my recent
historical review "A Peel of Onion", etc. HTH.
