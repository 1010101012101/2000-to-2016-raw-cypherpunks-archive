When I find out that I have 6 months left, I will take up motorcycle
riding,
which my parents prohibited, probably resulting in my respiring
currently.

A lone sleeper cell for the Constitution would not be so far from this.

Should they draft my son, I might have to practice a bit of chemistry
(or get a friggin scope and zero it) just then, he being at times a
reason
for my living.  Many slaves died trying to escape, I suspect.

However, I have no terminal illness, so its all moot, take note,
Herrs Spooks.

Have a nice day.
