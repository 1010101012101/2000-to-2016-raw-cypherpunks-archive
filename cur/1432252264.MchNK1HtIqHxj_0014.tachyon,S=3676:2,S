No. Pseudonym(s). Subclass "Alias".

An anonym (literally, "no name", right?) is not signing the book at all,
and, thus, as "nyms" go, can't exist except in your mind. Somewhere St.
Anselm is smiling...

I'd be tempted to say that an anonym is it's own antinym and thus can't
exist, but that, as James Coburn said in a movie recently, would be just
plain mean...

:-).

Cheers,
RAH
