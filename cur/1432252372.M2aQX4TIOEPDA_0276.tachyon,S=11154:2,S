	In order to arrest someone they have to have some sort of evidence that not only was a crime committed, but that the person they arrested has some reasonable probability of actually having committed that crime. 
	
	Maybe "know" is a little strong, "suspect" is probably a better way of putting it.

	Nonsense. In a LARGE percentage of the stuff a police officer deals with, there are no constitutional issues (other than the 4th). Robbery, murder, drunk driving, and the vast majority of traffic violations there aren't many constitutional issues involved in the laws the enforce, there may be some issues in *how* they enforce them (4th, 5th, and 6th) but little on what they enforce. 

	Rarely will you find a street cop, on his on initiative, making arrests in questionable areas (1st and 2nd).

	Interesting "rumor" on this front. Don Kates spoke to a group of us on Thursday. He wrote an amicus brief for the Emerson case, and I asked him what if he'd heard anything about what was going on. According to him, rumor has it that one of the judges in that case is writing a long (150 pages was mentioned) decision.

	Here's how it works (and there is a case going on right now about this). The government says "you have to have a tax stamp to own <x>". Then doesn't provide you any mechanism to actually *get* that stamp. 

	A portion (and I don't have the percentages, this comes from discussions with a local attorney active in Firearms Rights) of the firearms cases prosecuted at the federal level are prosecuted as tax violations. It is (allegedly) done this way to avoid second amendment issues. Since the Government has the constitutional power to tax, there is no problem. 

	It may not be 1/2 of all cases, but it's 1/2 of all justifications, and a signigificant number of cases.

	Nonsense. 

	The second prevents *infringement* of the right to keep and bear arms. It doesn't prevent *regulation*. It doesn't prohibit the setting of standards, or any one of a number of piddly little regulations. 

	There is no mandate that any and all firearms be available. The second amendment was intended to insure that the citizens had the tools at their disposal to defend themselves and their land/town/city/state, and to provide a (somewhat final) check against a tyrannical government forming. 

	It is not necessarily "any and all" firearms, just firearms that would be useful for those things (which amounts effectively to almost all firearms). It would probably not be unconstitutional for the Federal Government to insist that all arms produced or imported meet reliability standards so that anything you buy *can* be used such. 

	Look at voting--it is perfectly legal and constitutional in most places to force someone to register before voting. To provide "is a real person" type ID.

	Oh, I do want thinking humans in most positions. 

	Given a choice, I'd rather have thinking people in the Legislature, where they laws they write protect our rights. Right? (sorry).

	I also want police who are going to provide--as much as possible--for uniform enforcement of the laws. 

	There are times and places where an officer has to worry about whether his actions are going to violate someones rights--usually 4th and 5th (search and seizure, as well as self-incrimination) but it is my contention that this is only in *how* the laws are enforced, not *which* laws.
