Bingo b in the first graph in the ticket [1] you see that the
probability gets to ~80% when the number of nodes gets to 40. What
this graph doesn't show, however, is that many of these nodes are
attached to the same switch, or even run on same machine in different
VMs, or on different IPs (some even run on same IP). After accounting
for that, the number of tiny networks (at least /28, from going over
the list in the original message) and nodes one needs to intercept in
order to get the same 80% figure gets down to ~25. And of course, if
one is smarter about choosing which nodes to intercept, the
probability of seeing both entry and exit traffic is also significant:
~25%. It is also possible to do something in between (choose some
Guard-only and Exit-only nodes), but my laziness kicked in at that
point of analysis.

Here are the network again, in case anyone has the resources and is
curious enough about who does what with Tor:
