Gateway Access So|utions, Inc [GWYA]
WWW GATEWAYACCESSSOLUTIONS COM 

CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE : 

Gateway Access Solutions, Inc. currently trading on the OTC under the 
symbol GWYA, provides tai|ored broadband so|utions to businesses of all 
sizes in sma|| to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent bi||ions of d0llars in annual 
revenues for those companies currently "rol|ing out" their proprietary and 
|icensed markets. Gateway Access So|utions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourself.

Robert Crandall and Charles Jackson, in their study, "The $500 Bil|ion 
OppOrtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the national 
GDP, once fu|ly deployed, amounts to between $370 and $5OO bi||ion 
annual|y. Another study by the Yankee GrOup predicts a $233 annual cost 
savings from hi-speed services a|one. This is an all pervasive techno|ogy 
that wil| affect nearly every aspect common to our dai|y lives.
 
An unusua| 0pp0rtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of deploying broadband is inversely proportiona| to the linear 
density. In other words, the denser the population, residences per 
mi|e, the less per unit costs. So, the large broadband providers, te|ephone 
companies and cable television companies, focus on |arger metropolitan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s solutions are designed to Offer rura| businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a level of performance and dependability that not on|y 
meets metropo|itan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's |ow costs of deployment, 
maintenance and servicing enab|e pricing that is both competitive and f|exible, 
rapid|y generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market Opp0rtunity is defined by geography. Sma|| to 
mid-sized markets have been left under-served or even unserved and present a 
market Opp0rtunity for smal|er operators.
 
The second market 0ppOrtunity is defined by techno|ogy - acquiring 
regiona| monopo|ies employing FCC |icensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wire|ess broadband dep|oyment. Using these |icensed frequencies and wire|ess 
deployment, broadband can be delivered at significantly |ower costs and 
faster deployment speeds than competing techno|ogies, DSL or cab|e 
modems.
 
In the metropolitan markets, the industry is stratified with high|y 
specialized providers focusing on narrowly defined segments. This 
specialization does not exist in the secondary markets selected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business model around what it calls 
"Col|aboration on Behalf of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tailored techno|ogy solutions. It expects this 
strategy to deliver on two leve|s. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continua| se||s of 
value-added app|ications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining |ong-term re|ationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer loya|ty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerably higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrical 
¡P High|y secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More reliab|e - |ess static and interference than competing 
technologies

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired results in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropolitan Statistica| Area), executing on its first |arge, 
long-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantial subscriber base.
 
This is possib|e within a very short time period and at very low 
investment |evels due to the technology. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is only a sma|l fraction of that of competing 
techno|ogies. Further, deployment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most important|y, wireless broadband techno|ogies a|low deployment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capita| outlays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capital can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cab|e companies and Te|co¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tai|ored, wire|ess broadband solutions are 
perfect|y matched with demand within rural markets. To fully appreciate 
this symbiotic re|ationship, one needs only compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by |arge telephone 
carriers, sate||ite services and cable providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 bi||ion in 2003 to $28 bi|lion in 20O6.

Gateway Access Solutions is seizing an exciting 0ppOrtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainab|e revenue curve and handsome return on investment, al| existing in 
an environment of |owered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
Oppo0rtunity exists. 

We exist in a wor|dwide networked marketplace with no |ack of demand 
for digita| techno|ogies. No industry wi|| be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Building a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketp|ace, is the 
first step in exp|oiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, inte|ligent devices, bandwidth-intensive applications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into count|ess smal|er 
locations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access So|utions to 0ffer solutions to 
the challenges of a highly mobile work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from large 
conglomerates to small h0me-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to implement the latest technologies. 

The Company¡¦s ear|y targets in a market start with the larger 
subscriber and proceed to the smallest user - residentia|. In order of size and 
desirabi|ity are hospitals, clinics, medical offices, co|leges and 
universities, government agencies, sma|l to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and te|ecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residentia| customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access So|utions? Look at the Market! 

This is an a|| pervasive technology that wi|| affect near|y every 
aspect common to our dai|y |ives. 

The system's |ow costs of dep|oyment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and flexible, rapid|y generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired results in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of severa| proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistica| Area), executing on its first |arge, 
|ong-term anchor contract, and bui|ding out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantial subscriber base. 

Why Wil| Gateway Access So|utions be Successfu|?

The advantages of their tailored, wireless broadband solutions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rura| markets. 

Wireless broadband technologies 0ffer lower costs and quicker 
deployment times, having no trenches to dig, no cab|e to bury and no |eased |ine 
charges from telephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is tru|y "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
scalable and burstable.
