<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><strong>Learn the secrets to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This famous financial author, TV
personality and money manager has distinguished himself with one of the finest,
most consistent performance records among all managed investments. An article
about Mr. Ansbacher, The Art of Option Selling, published in <i>Derivatives
Strategy</i>, August 2000, states, And who can argue with his success? He's<span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue'>&nbsp;</span> made lots
of money over the last quarter century and has yet to be caught egregiously
offside.<b> </b>Unlike many of today's crop of young stock fund managers, many
of whom have never even experienced a bear market, Mr. Ansbacher has developed
his trading expertise over a 30-year period. Investors can take comfort in
knowing that Mr. Ansbacher's trading approach offers them an investment
opportunity to potentially capitalize on bull <i>or</i> bear markets. In
essence, the beauty of Mr. Ansbacher's<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;color:blue'>&nbsp;</span>strategy is that the market environment doesn't
matter: On Bloomberg Financial national T.V., near the peak in technology
stocks, in March 2000, he correctly warned of an imminent crash. </p>
