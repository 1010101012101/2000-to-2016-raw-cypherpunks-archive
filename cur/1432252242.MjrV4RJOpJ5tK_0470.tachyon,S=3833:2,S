Right. I know people who are NSA employees, technical ones, with
surprisingly enviable jobs. They put in four 10 hour days and can
count it as a week.  In fact, because in some areas (system
administrators, hardware techs) NSA has more people than they need,
the people I know often stay home one extra day a week.

So that's a three day work week, with a high-five figure salary, a
security clearance that will instantly get you a better paid job in
the consulting/contracting industry if you leave, and the security of
government work. Not a job that'll let you change the world, perhaps,
but not terribly dismal either.
