[Apologies in advance for the multiple posting; this had to get
 to everyone -pt]

Jim (and other cypherpunk node operators):

The spate of "Mail Delivery Failure" messages we've been
seeing for the last few days are due to messages sent to a
user "rob@nihilist.com", apparently a very temporary (and
now dead) web mail address at www.another.com.

I've exchanged mail with the postmaster (richard@uk.another.com),
and he clearly regards this as Someone Elses Problem, and has no
intention of ceasing to send the bounce notices.

I strongly advise everyone running a cpunk node to check for, and
delete rob@nihilist.com. It's not like he/she/it can't resubscribe if
they want to.

Sigh.... Yet Another Attack now exists against the cypherpunks
S/N ratio.
