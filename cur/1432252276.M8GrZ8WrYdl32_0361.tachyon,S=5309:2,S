This. Pirate Party anyone? Granted, the PP does have some great, active, 
ideologically pure chapters (Iceland, Sweden to large extent). But looking ta 
the Pirate Party in Poland -- there is no hope.

What this all boils down to is this:
Party/logo stays, people change.

If we start trusting the WikiLeaks party, or the Pirate Party, or any other 
centralised entity, inevitably at some point people that created these and 
might have even had their hearts and minds in the right place -- will go away, 
others will come in and take over. That's a natural process.

Problem is, political processes tend to reward those able to compromise (in 
both senses), those able to lie, cheat and deceive. And this is what we will 
get at some point in the future, we can be certain of that.

So once we start putting too much trust and hope in a logo (WikiLeaks party; 
Pirate Party), we're in for some serious disappointment.

Only if it would indeed be created in a way that ensures that it will be 
disruptive and will not become a career party like the others. This would 
require clear set of *achievable* goals, and a time limit written-in into the 
statute.

Something along the lines of:

http://rys.io/en/80

Both texts are a bit naive, I grant you that, since I hadn't had enough time 
to work on them yet.
