It's interesting because one outcome seems to be that almost everyone
agrees that plaintext should not be considered reasonable. That's a
great outcome so far - I remember a time when people felt that it was
fine, most of the time, to have unencrypted communications as the norm.

I look forward to the day when those same people start to get the big
picture on general social graph style traffic analysis.

All the best,
Jake
