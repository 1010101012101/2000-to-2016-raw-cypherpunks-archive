Yep, it's a good counterexample to the general rule. But I recall that
when land acquisition began, that area near Lessburg was still
primarily farm country, which is easier to accumulate in terms of parcels.
Also it's unclear that it was entirely private -- the web page talks
about planning beginning after a 1988 state law was enacted...
