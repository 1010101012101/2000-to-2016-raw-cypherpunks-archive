Austin,

Thanks for your note. I respect what you're trying to do at ZKS. I think 
that if ZKS succeeds, the world will be a better place. Further, I have a 
tremendous deal of respect for some of the very excellent people you have 
hired.

But wishing something to be true does not make it so. My statement about 
ZKS' sluggish Freedom sales is based on extensive conversations over the 
last year with folks in this industry, web searches to see how many ZKS 
nyms appear to be in use, ancedotal information, and conversations with 
other ZKS employees.

As Greg says below, I was writing an article with 
less-than-perfectly-complete information, but information that I have and 
had every reason to believe is accurate. You did nothing to refute that 
belief, and saying "[we are] pleased with our results for Freedom" is an 
analytically and semantically null statement. The Subject: line of your 
message complains about "false statements," but you offer nothing by way of 
identification and refutation.

As you say, you did send a note to my Wired editor demanding a retraction. 
You received a response yesterday saying that Wired identified no errors of 
fact in my article and you were welcome to submit a letter to the editor. I 
hope you will, and I wish you luck at ZKS.

Yours,
Declan
