are the companies and folks who got your tax dollars to build equipment at the NSA's
bidding for TAO.. the whole SBIR was facilitated by DARPA is my unerstanding

Mr. Victor Civie

the beginnings of the NSA Tailored Access Operation began here in part

at least the ones der speigel is complaining about.. may have changed nowadays.. but here is the original culprit..
for those doing betting death pools I suggest Mr. Victor Civie  and those of his ilk as
one people would pay to nominate

from the description

Sophisticated Virus, Parasite and Resource Management systems are to be constructed to alter or report on the operation of a designated target. Specific systems include the Tape Worm, a low profile smart Parasite featuring comprehensive resource management operations, the Stealth Striker, an ultra low profile targeting virus, the Transport, an ultra low profile utility virus used to transport, load and excecute large programs and various surveillance and maintenance systems. Virus/Parasite objectives include securing a stable base, fixing, relocating and reproducing in teh target system, the ability to find and infect other systems, alter/record/monitor/recall computer operations, and alter/record/monitor/recall data and output. The effort will also produce a Code miniaturization strategy and apply the principals to the EMC programs. compact Task Oriented Routines are designed to create code to perform assigned tasks.
