the state of oregon just passed a law (yet to be put into effect) that
requires a prescription from a doctor for all sudafed (pseudo
ephedrine) purchases.  the problem isn't drug addicts killing
themselves with corrosive fluids, as this would be a problem that
solves itself in short order, but rather that meth heads are idiotic
crime machines.  i've had numerous friends and acquaintances affected
by this (vehicles stolen or broken into, property damaged and/or
stolen, tweakers robbing at knife point, etc, etc) and it's getting
ridiculous*.

big brother isn't the answer, but when you get a lot of pissed off
citizens and overwhelmed police involved the solutions they settle for
are going to be ugly and invasive.

what a fucking mess...

* last week a tweaker out of jail for only a few weeks went around to
our hay growers neighbors and stole all sorts of random crap from
homes up and down the road he lived on.  everything from elk antlers
to hand made arrows for bow hunting, power tools loaded into a wheel
barrow, the most random crap.  the only reason he didn't hit our hay
grower was that last time he stole from them they went to his parents
house and told him "the next time your son steals from my home you'll
be attending a funeral".  now that's closer to an effective solution.
