Here's the full (20min, 60MB interview) youtube link from the bottom
of the article below, which is kind of needed since then you can hear
the full interview (the questioner and the other side):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQw6CryE9M

USAGov/CIA lies - back then (August 2013) as we see in this interview
team USA was saying 'We don't want regime change - we just want a
limited (100 frigate-based missiles) strike against key Syria targets
to send a message that chemical warfare is not ok', whilst:
a) the leaked emails from a few days before the interview already
showed that it was not Assad government, but 'terrorist' chemical
warfare actions (not Assad govt) which also were a false flag done by
CIA, and
b) today we see team USA saying 'Assad must go, regime change is
required to protect human rights'

So team USA says what it wants, when it wants, in order to fuel more
war, which in turn funds Lockheed, Raytheon etc. See here:
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/10/10-companies-profiting-most-from-war/1970997/
"The business of war is profitable. In 2011, the 100 largest
contractors sold $410 billion in arms and military services. Just 10
of those companies sold over $208 billion...
These companies have benefited tremendously from the growth in
military spending in the U.S., ... in 2000 $312 billion ... 2011 $712
billion ...
#1 Lockheed Martin notched $36.3 billion in sales in 2011
"

Them missiles are expensive, highly profitable.

"Ken O’ Keefe is a former US Marine turned anti-war campaigner who
appeared on a Press TV debate called Syria: War of Deception, and
absolutely owned his opponent in such an awesome way that you’ll be
cheering at his every comment.

Recorded in August 2013, this interview is now two years old, but in
light of the current European refugee crisis it’s more relevant today
than ever before. Passionate, articulate and knowledgeable about the
subject matter, O’Keefe is the perfect guy to step up and tell these
home truths...
