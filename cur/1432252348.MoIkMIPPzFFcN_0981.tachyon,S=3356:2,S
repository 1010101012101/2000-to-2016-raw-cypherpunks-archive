Of course their brains are mush, they are *religious*.

Much like the xian loonies in DC
"God, we pray that our actions here give some glory back to you.  We
live in grace even here, and we are not afraid of death. ... None of us
wants to die here, but death is the blink of an eye, and you wake up in
paradise."

But you get better post-mortem sex if you're Muslim.

They are not after sympathy, they are after your attention.  As in,
"don't tread on me".  As in, "get your filthy hands off my desert".
As in, death to the Romans.

The pentagon hit was apropos, but the pilot hit the wrong side.
Still, nice taking it home like that.

Not even UBL, who knows civil engineering, expected
a pair of implosions.  The pigs, fireman, civilians, etc
were collateral damage --the point was the video.

But architects have to show off, so down they went.
Live and learn.  But the replacement will be taller,
a tower of Babel.

More targets: soft targets with videocameras.  Disneyland,
Olympics, and of course kindergartens on days when parents
would be there with cameras.  Synchronized of course,
so you have zero doubt who it was.

Although they're religious, they know engineering and psyops
as well as the xian loony hegemonists in DC.

Basically its like this: even neighborhood bullies have to sleep.
A wimp with a gallon of gasoline can make a point.
David & Goliath, remember?

All's fair in love and war, baby.
