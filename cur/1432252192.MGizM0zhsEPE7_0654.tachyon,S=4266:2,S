Attention Please,

May I take the privilege to introduce myself; my name
is Mr. Bello Sese Seko a brother of the late
President of the Federal Republic of Zaire, President
Mobutu Sese Seko (now Republic of Congo, under the
leadership of the Son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I am currently
under political asylum in the Netherlands. I
presume you are aware there is a financial dispute
between my family (the Mobutu’s) and the present
Civilian Government. Based on what they believe as bad
and corrupt Government on my late brother part, May his
soul rest in peace.

Following the above mentioned reasons, I am soliciting
for your humble and confidential assistance to take
custody of Fifteen Million,United States Dollars only
 (US$15M) also to front
for me in the area of business investments you desire
profitably well.

Presently, this Sum of US$15 Million Dollars has
secretly been deposited into a confidential security
Company, where it can be released to you by the
Security Company based on my recommendation on that
note; you will be presented as my partner who will be
fronting for me and my family in any subsequent
ventures. For you might have heard how a lot of my
brother’s bank Account has been frozen.

To show my preparedness and appreciation to conduct
this business with you, I shall give you
25% of the total money and 5% for miscellaneous
expense and 10% on any profit realizable in the
process of investment of this fund in your country.

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation
for the success of the business venture, your utmost
confidentially, sincerity and secrecy is highly
required, due to my family’s present predicament.

Details of how I intend to carry out this project will
be discussed as soon as I get a response of your
willingness and interest. I sincerely will appreciate
your urgent acknowledgment as soon as possible by
contacting me on my Telephone number:+31-618-850-030
or E-mail address. Thank you.

Yours truly,

Mr. Bello Sese Seko
