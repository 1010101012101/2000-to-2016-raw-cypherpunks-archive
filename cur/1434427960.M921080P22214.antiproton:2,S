Tom Harper, the Sunday Times' journalist who wrote the article. The man 
who repeatedly lied about the the state of affairs regarding Ed landed 
himself an interview with CNN. It was aired a few hours ago. The man dug 
himself a hole, jumped into his hole and buried himself with an 
explanation of how he reports what.

Effectively he told CNN that it is speculation, that he reports what he 
feels to be the truth as provided by his sources within the government 
but that what he reported is not explicitly mentioned as such, and that 
it is up to his sources "the government" (whatever that means) to 
provide proof.

In other words, he lied. Many bad things did not happen. And I'm sure 
that the OPSEC that Glenn et al. have been maintaining is for the sake 
of all parties involved. And I bet that three-letter agencies have 
reached out to him to let him know that he's walking a fine line and I'm 
sure that Glenn also knows that they have a vested interest in the 
information not becoming freely available.

And that's the end of that story.

We're also not discussing the semantics of how Glenn handles his files 
in the face of what is an obvious push to erode civil liberties. Because.
