I know, but it wasn't really lightweight. Session setup between
new hosts shouldn't take more than a few UDP packets; theirs
took publishing DNS records. If ad hoc encryption needs to happen
on a wide level, it need to be part of the usual suspect TCP/IP
stack, and work out of the box, without adding too much to 
the initial latency. It should also have key caching, and at
least a rudimentary logging to be able to catch MITM.

Once there's significant amounts of host key caches available,
it would become worthwhile to P2P publish those, and build
primitive trust by number of votes.

Aye, that's the rub. Most hosts are in dynamic address space,
and anything involving DNS will not fly.

Even if 1% of all hosts would be using it it would be extremely worthwhile.
There are some quite nice FreeBSD-based firewalls (m0n0/pfsense) which 
support IPsec quite well between themselves. It would be definitely very 
nice to have any such firewalls set up IPsec VPNs ad hoc whenever they 
talk to each other.
