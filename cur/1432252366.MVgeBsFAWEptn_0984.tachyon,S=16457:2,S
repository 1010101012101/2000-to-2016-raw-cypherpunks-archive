Ed Pilkington at Fort Meade
theguardian.com, Tuesday 30 July 2013 13.30 EDT

Bradley Manning has already spent 1,157 days in detention since his arrest=
 in May 2010.

Bradley Manning, the source of the massive WikiLeaks trove of secret disclo=
sures, faces a possible maximum sentence of more than 130 years in military=
 jail after he was convicted of most charges on which he stood trial.

Colonel Denise Lind, the military judge presiding over the court martial of=
 the US soldier, delivered her verdict in curt and pointed language. "Guilt=
y, guilty, guilty, guilty," she repeated over and over, as the reality of=
 a prolonged prison sentence for Manning =E2=80=93 on top of the three year=
s he has already spent in detention =E2=80=93 dawned.

The one ray of light in an otherwise bleak outcome for Manning was that he=
 was found not guilty of the single most serious charge against him =E2=80=
=93 that he knowingly "aided the enemy", in practice al-Qaida, by disclosin=
g information to the WikiLeaks website that in turn made it accessible to=
 all users including enemy groups.

Lind's decision to avoid setting a precedent by applying the swingeing "aid=
ing the enemy" charge to an official leaker will invoke a sigh of relief fr=
om news organisations and civil liberties groups who had feared a guilty ve=
rdict would send a chill across public interest journalism.

The judge also found Manning not guilty of having leaked an encrypted copy=
 of a video of a US air strike in the Farah province of Aghanistan in which=
 many civilians died. Manning's defence team had argued vociferously that=
 he was not the source of this video, though the soldier did admit to later=
 disclosure of an unencrypted version of the video and related documents.

Lind also accepted Manning's version of several of the key dates in the Wik=
iLeaks disclosures, and took some of the edge from other less serious charg=
es. But the overriding toughness of the verdict remains: the soldier was fo=
und guilty in their entirety of 17 out of the 22 counts against him, and of=
 an amended version of four others.

Manning was also found guilty of "wrongfully and wantonly" causing to be pu=
blished on the internet intelligence belonging to the US, "having knowledge=
 that intelligence published on the internet is accesible to the enemy". Th=
at guilty ruling could still have widest ramifications for news organisatio=
ns working on investigations relating to US national security.

Once the counts are added up, the prospects for the Manning are bleak. Barr=
ing reduction of sentence for mitigation, which becomes the subject of anot=
her mini-trial dedicated to sentencing that starts tomorrow, Manning will=
 face a substantial chunk of his adult life in military custody.

He has already spent 1,157 days in detention since his arrest in May 2010=
 =E2=80=93 most recently in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas =E2=80=93 which will=
 be deducted from his eventual sentence.

A further 112 days will be taken off the sentence as part of a pre-trial ru=
ling in which Lind compensated him for the excessively harsh treatment he=
 endured at the Quantico marine base in Virginia between July 2010 and Apri=
l 2011. He was kept on suicide watch for long stretches despite expert opin=
ion from military psychiatrists who deemed him to be at low risk of self-ha=
rm, and at one point was forced to strip naked at night in conditions that=
 the UN denounced as a form of torture.

Lind has indicated that she will go straight into the sentencing phase of=
 the trial, in which both defence and prosecution lawyers will call new wit=
nesses. This is being seen as the critical stage of the trial for Manning's=
 defence: the soldier admitted months ago to being the source of the WikiLe=
aks disclosures, and much of the defence strategy has been focused on attem=
pting to reduce his sentence through mitigation.

With that in mind, the soldier's main counsel, David Coombs, is likely to=
 present evidence during the sentencing phase that Manning was in a fragile=
 emotional state at the time he began leaking and was struggling with issue=
s over his sexuality. In pre-trial hearings, the defence has argued that de=
spite his at times erratic behaviour, the accused was offered very little=
 support or counselling from his superiors at Forward Operating Base Hammer=
 outside Baghdad.

The outcome will now be pored over by government agencies, lawyers, journal=
ists and civil liberties groups for its implications for whistleblowing, in=
vestigative reporting and the guarding of state secrets in the digital age.=
 By passing to WikiLeaks more than 700,000 documents, Manning became the fi=
rst mass digital leaker in history, opening a whole new chapter in the age-=
old tug-of-war between government secrecy and the public's right to informa=
tion in a democracy.

Among those who will also be closely analysing the verdict are Edward Snowd=
en, the former NSA contractor who has disclosed the existence of secret gov=
ernment dragnets of the phone records of millions of Americans, who has ind=
icated that the treatment of Manning was one reason for his decision to see=
k asylum in another country rather than face similar aggressive prosecution=
 in America. The British government will also be dissecting the courtroom=
 results after the Guardian disclosed that Manning is a joint British Ameri=
can citizen.

Another party that will be intimately engaged with the verdict is WikiLeaks=
, and its founder, Julian Assange. They have been the subject of a secret=
 grand jury investigation in Virginia that has been looking into whether to=
 prosecute them for their role in the Manning disclosures.

WikiLeaks and Assange were mentioned repeatedly during the trial by the US=
 government which tried to prove that the anti-secrecy organisation had dir=
ectly steered Manning in his leaking activities, an allegation strongly den=
ied by the accused. Prosecutors drew heavily on still classified web conver=
sations between Manning and an individual going by the name of "Press Assoc=
iation", whom the government alleges was Assange.
