Murder?  A crime.  Again, you have some proof?  You've shared it with
the D.C. police?  With any police?

It doesn't seem that you have much to say, just sling some accusations
about and call it a day, eh?

Try again?  Make sense this time?

I lied, includes included.

What you don't understand, we have a system in this country.  Innocent
until proven guilty.  Sure Condit is guilty, he's a politician, right?
But what is he guilty of?  Where is the proof of that guilt?

Go sleep it off.
