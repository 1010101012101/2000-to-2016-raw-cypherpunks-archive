Yes, we used to talk about this kind of stuff a lot. We had a few 
people very interested in this kind of stuff in the early days. 
People like Hal Finney, Robin Hanson, Nick Szabo, myself. Alas, most 
are long since gone.

Polycentric law is still with us, of course. One hundred or more 
nations, law of the seas, the UCC, etc. Anarchy is the norm in most 
parts of our lives.

However, Aimee, your summary here is very good. I'm pleasantly surprised.

Debating with Choate is not useful, however.
