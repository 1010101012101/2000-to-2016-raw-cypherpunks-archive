Police have opened fire on Bush protestors with rubber bullets, pepper 
spray and gas. The crowds of people are moving around and regrouping. The 
crowd was standing at the barricades and the police had called a state of 
emergency. Pepper spray was used on group early on. Batons were used on 
some people. Group included babies in strollers and older people, also 
people in wheelchairs. Those that could get out of the way were cut off 
surronded by police. There are snipers on the roofs.
