No, I haven't read that story, but I was wondering if, in the dual-message 
cryptogram we've been discussing (under "eJazeera") if, instead of two 
messages, there are two executable files.The "true" one will spit out the 
desired message (which may in inself be an executable, of course), and the 
fake one belches up a trojan, or whatever (or a virus plus a viable fake 
message).

I assume this kind of thing has been discussed previously?
