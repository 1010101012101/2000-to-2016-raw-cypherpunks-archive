Dear cypherpunks ,

Get Paid To GET E-mail!
http://www.skybusiness.com/mer/paidemail.html	

	Hello, fellow opportunist! I have found a wonderful, easy, FREE way to make money 
using the Internet.  I'm sure you're used to receiving SPAM, those annoying advertisements that 
you didn't want for items that you would never want. Well, how would you like to be PAID for 
simply receiving e-mail advertisements?  Sound to good to be true?  Trust me, this is an 
opportunity you don't want to miss.

	There are several companies on the Internet that are paying users like you to receive 
targeted e-mails.  Advertisers pay them to send the ads and they pay you to read them.  This is 
completely FREE, you don't spend any money at any time.  Most of these programs simply send 
the e-mail, you click on a link included in the message and your account is credited.  You don't 
even need to read the ad if you don't want to.  As an added benefit, most of these companies will 
ask you what you're interested in, so you receive ads of interest to you.
	
	You can use your existing e-mail account or make a new one specifically for this 
purpose, so you don't clutter your existing account.  It only takes a few minutes a day to get 
through all the ads sent to you.  The payout rates may seem small for these companies, but to 
really make money out of this opportunity, there is one more step.  These companies will not 
only pay you to receive e-mail, they also pay you when someone you refer receives their 
advertisements.  The key is referring as many people as possible.  This may seem difficult, but 
most of the work has already been done for you.  
	
	Every time you sign up for one of these programs, you will receive a unique referral 
address of a web site to send potential referrals to.  When anyone signs up using your site 
address, your account is credited every time they receive an advertisement.   Simply copy this e-
mail, then either include a section with all your referral addresses or, if you know how to, build a 
small website with the addresses on it, like I did.  Then send this e-mail out to those you think 
will appreciate a good money making opportunity.  How ever you choose to do it, generate as 
many referrals as possible.  This is the key to making real money.  You get out of these programs 
what you put into them.
	
	Below you'll find the address to my website.  There is a small description of what to do, 
then a table that has the program names, the amount of money you get per e-mail, the amount of 
money you get when a referral gets e-mail, the minimum balance that your account must be at 
before you receive a check and how often checks are sent.  Simply click on each program name 
to go to the site to sign-up, sign-up for the programs and you will receive your unique referring 
address in your e-mail, then start referring.  Don't forget to keep clicking on the links to credit 
your account in each advertisement.  This is not a scam or a get-rich-quick scheme.  This is a real 
opportunity that only takes a little effort and WILL put some extra cash in your pocket.  You've 
got absolutely nothing to lose, so just give it a try.  Best of luck referring!
