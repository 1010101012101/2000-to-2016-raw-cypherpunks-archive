I've been rereading this a bunch of times trying to figure out
what,  if anything,  it's supposed to mean.  I've come up with two
slightly different interpretations:

1) If you release your results at a university-sponsored conference
you're an exempt researcher,  but if you release identical results at
Defcon you're a criminal.

2) Anyone with the financial resources or legal background to get 
this law overturned on Constitutional grounds is not to be
prosecuted in the first place.

I think 2 is actually the more accurate reading.
