  article#199578

A call to arms by a militant APster warrior and professor was pulled off 
the Portland IMC.
Is repression so bad now we have to censor ourselves?

Now as a comment...Why pull me off?

And the next one and the next till they get the message...that you can fuck 
with some of the people some of the time but the day you try to fuck with 
all of the people all of the time is the day you wind up in a body bag or a 
pine box.Am I going to wack the shrub out? Physically that presents some 
problems as I live in au,however I will pledge to pay into a pooled fund 
that may be payed to the closest prediction of the permanent retirement of 
the shrub.Kinda like stiffs.com and,yes,APster or 'assassination 
politics.(my 2$)

earth, the one that'll take down ALL the governments? James Dalton Bell."<<
