There's a great anthology of more technical essays previously published in JAMA
called "Biological Weapons: Limiting the Threat" (Joshua Ledford, BCSIA Studies
In International Security, MIT Press, 2000). I remember a particularly
interesting study someone did which compared potential death rates on an
unprotected target city versus one in which the population knew rudimentary bio-
civil defense procedures, (ie. masks and protective clothing at the ready,
sealing all windows and doors with duct tape, etc.) Huge difference.

Another great resource:

Bioterrorism: Homeland Defense Symposium: The Next Steps -- An Executive
Summary, ed. Maurice Eisenstein (RAND conference proceedings, 2000, PDF): Seeks
to identify the elements of an integrated homeland defense against
bioterrorism, identify critical gaps, and offer suggestions on how a relatively
cost-effective homeland defense program might be achieved.

And a word to everyone stocking up on antiboitics: don't forget to stockpile
gatorade or some other rehydrating solution! "Have a nice day" indeed...
