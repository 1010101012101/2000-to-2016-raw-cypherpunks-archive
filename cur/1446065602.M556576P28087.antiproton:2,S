Prediction markets can be structured in (at least) two ways: =C2=A0One, in =
which the current status of the prediction is kept known, for instance what=
 the Policy Analysis Market was apparently intended to do. =C2=A0("Bet on t=
he probability of a bombing attack at an embassy in Beirut during a given w=
eek"). =C2=A0In such a system, everybody can see the value of such a predic=
tion coming true, varying up and down in amount over time. =C2=A0The second=
, such as my AP essay, where the predictions are kept carefully secret unti=
l after the prediction comes true. =C2=A0One potential weakness is that peo=
ple might tend to game the system, concealing the death of a person, or alt=
ernatively, faking his death. =C2=A0I can certainly see that there is a rea=
son to turn things into futures-type market, as long as information about t=
he predictions can be kept secret for long enough (days) to not give non-sp=
ecial predictors a hint as to the outcome, early.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
