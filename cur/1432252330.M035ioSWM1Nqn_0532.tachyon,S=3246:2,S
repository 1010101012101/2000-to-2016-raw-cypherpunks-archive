Well, if you wouldn't be so coy about mirroring, I would love to push
anything cypherpunkly to Mojo Nation and Freenet. It is going to be very
difficult to block next generation of Freenet.

However, if you block at IP level after pulling more than 100
documents/day it becomes too dificult for me to so. The difference is
picking a spider off the shelf, or heavily customize one to throttle it.

So, consider burning a few CDs (the site is currently what? 200 MBytes,
300?), and mail them to whoever asks you. If you publish diffs in
identifyable directories and opens them in robots.txt it would really
reduce the load on your site, too.
