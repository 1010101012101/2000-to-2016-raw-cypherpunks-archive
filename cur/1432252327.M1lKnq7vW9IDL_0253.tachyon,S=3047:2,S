(People with Arabic-sounding names being detained with little or no
court supervision)


Can you think of any better way to push people into hating the US? What
if the IRA were suspected of committing a terrorist act in the US? Would
people with Irish-sounding names be locked up in max cells with no
access to lawyers on the _chance_ that they might know something?

I normally attribute acts like this to incompetence rather than malice,
but this is really pushing it. Could someone be ensuring there'd always
be a supply of terrorists in the US to cause a continuing crisis?
