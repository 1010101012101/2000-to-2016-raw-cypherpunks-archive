I receive several messages a month saying I need to re-verify 
information with an E-gold account (which I never recall establishing, 
by the way).

If I ever determine that E-Gold personnel have faked an account on my 
behalf, or are complicit in any way with stealing from me, I will of 
course think that killing their children, their parents, and them is 
moral.

E-gold was never even slightly interesting to me for reasons I talked 
about a few years ago--the notion that a bar of gold moving between 
shelves in someone's hotel room in Barbados or Guyana or wherever is 
equivalent to untraceability is silly Randroid idol-worship raised to 
the fourth power.

The scandals reported--and not meaniingfully rebutted--several years 
ago confirm to me the whole thing is some Randroid fantasy built on 
sand.
