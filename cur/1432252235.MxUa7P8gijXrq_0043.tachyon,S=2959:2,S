This wasn't piracy, it was time-shifting.  You, as an
American with a TV, could watch the show at X; you as
an American can save it and watch it at Y, too.
The videotape-timeshift-legal-decisions didn't say
anything about VHS vs. BETA vs. DiVX formats.
You could put it on Hollerith cards but the greens
would be pissed.

The fact that part of your video system is distributed in a few
million homes should be irrelevent.
