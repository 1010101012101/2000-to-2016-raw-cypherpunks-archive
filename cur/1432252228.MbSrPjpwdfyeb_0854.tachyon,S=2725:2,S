Internet Poker is a big money activity.

A major problem with this activity is that the site can choose
to allow certain privileged players to cheat.

In principle it should be possible to create poker playing
software where the server cannot cheat, but it is not obvious
to me how this can be done.

Does anyone know of a cheat proof algorithm?
