I don't quite get what you're suggesting.  Could you give a more concrete
example?

Well, I wouldn't complain. :)  (Although pairings are quite slow, on the order
of hundreds of milliseconds.)  Hilarie Orman presented it at an IETF meeting
to what was reportedly a lukewarm response, and they also raised the patent
issue.  Dan Boneh is sensitive to the issue of patented crypto, and was quite
considerate when I asked about it, but www.voltage.com still has the same
vague statement in their FAQ about how they're not going to be evil with the
patent, so it's still up in the air whether IBE will be useful in IETF
standards.
