Until Sep. 11, at least, we may have adopted a cost-benefit
approach. Non-oil fuels are far more expensive, and more radical approaches
like wiring homes for solar would be quite intrusive and also expensive.

So perhaps (note I'm not saying our politicos were actually this smart or
that this is good foreign policy) the thinking was that by interfering 
in the middle east, which has a high cost, the benefits of cheap oil
justified it.
