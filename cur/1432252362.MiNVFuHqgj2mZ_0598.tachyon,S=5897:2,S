What you've designed is a classic password manager application, like
Lastpass, Keepas. It's a good design for when the site requires a passwor=
d.

However, as every website has their own rules for password, lengths,
allowed characters, it makes it a bit of hit and miss whether a certain
generated password will be accepted. It would lead to having a list of
sites and recipes of what is allowed. It doens't scale.

Besides, most sites also require an email address, so anonymity is lost.

Client certificates are already implemented in most web servers. It's a
one-line setting to accept a certain certificate authority for a site.
If that is the Ca of the site owner themselves, it's even easier.

The price to pay (for end users) is to have a computer that cannot
easily be subverted by malware. Notice that's the same requirement for
password managers.

I've written about my ideas on client certificates on my site:
http://eccentric-authentication.org/

Feel free to ask if anything is not clear

Regards, Guido.
