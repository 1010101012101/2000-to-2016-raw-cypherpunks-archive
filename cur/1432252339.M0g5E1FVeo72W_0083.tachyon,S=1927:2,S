The main purpose is for academic gain.  If you'd looked at the paper a
bit, you'd have read it took about 1/2 an hour to reconstruct the image
from one screen.  It is a proof of principle concept, enough so that
multi-billion dollar espionage agencies can think about it.  At 30 fps
for a game, forget it.  But for a slow typist who has to go get a cup
of coffee because the phone rang....

It does make the game more interesting, but it's mighty easy to defeat.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
