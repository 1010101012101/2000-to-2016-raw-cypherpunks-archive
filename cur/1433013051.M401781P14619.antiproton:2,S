>From Reuters
World=C2=A0|=C2=A0Fri May 29, 2015 2:59pm EDTEclusive: U.S. tried Stuxnet-s=
tyle campaign against North Korea but failed - sourcesSAN FRANCISCO=C2=A0|=
=C2=A0BY JOSEPH MENNThe United States tried to deploy a version of the Stux=
net computer virus to attack North Korea's nuclear weapons program five yea=
rs ago but ultimately failed, according to people familiar with the covert =
campaign.The operation began in tandem with the now-famous Stuxnet attack t=
hat sabotaged=C2=A0Iran's nuclear program in 2009 and 2010 by destroying a =
thousand or more centrifuges that were enriching uranium. Reuters and other=
s have reported that the=C2=A0Iran=C2=A0attack was a joint effort by U.S. a=
nd Israeli forces.According to one U.S. intelligence source, Stuxnet's deve=
lopers produced a related virus that would be activated when it encountered=
 Korean-language settings on an infected machine.But U.S. agents could not =
access the core machines that ran Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, said=
 another source, a former high-ranking intelligence official who was briefe=
d on the program.The official said the National Security Agency-led campaig=
n was stymied by North Korea's utter secrecy, as well as the extreme isolat=
ion of its communications systems. A third source, also previously with U.S=
. intelligence, said he had heard about the failed cyber attack but did not=
 know details.North Korea=C2=A0has some of the most isolated communications=
 networks in the world. Just owning a computer requires police permission, =
and the open Internet is unknown except to a tiny elite.=C2=A0The country h=
as=C2=A0one main conduit for Internet connections=C2=A0to the outside world=
, through=C2=A0China.In contrast, Iranians surfed the Net broadly and had i=
nteractions with companies from around the globe.A spokeswoman for the NSA =
declined to comment for this story. The spy agency has previously declined =
to comment on the Stuxnet attack against=C2=A0Iran.The United States has la=
unched many cyber espionage campaigns, but=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0is only th=
e second country, after=C2=A0Iran, that the NSA is now known to have target=
ed with software designed to destroy equipment.Washington has long expresse=
d concerns about Pyongyang's nuclear program, which it says breaches intern=
ational agreements.=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0has been hit with sanctions becau=
se of its nuclear and missile tests, moves that Pyongyang sees as an attack=
 on its sovereign right to defend itself.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry=
 said last week that Washington and Beijing were discussing imposing furthe=
r sanctions on=C2=A0North Korea, which he said was "not even close" to taki=
ng steps to end its nuclear program.SIEMENS SOFTWAREExperts in nuclear prog=
rams said there are similarities between=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0and Iran's o=
perations, and the two countries continue to collaborate on military techno=
logy.Both countries use a system with P-2 centrifuges, obtained by Pakistan=
i nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, who is regarded as the father of Islamabad's=
 nuclear bomb, they said.Like=C2=A0Iran,=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0probably dir=
ects its centrifuges with control software developed by Siemens AG that run=
s on=C2=A0Microsoft=C2=A0Corp's Windows operating system, the experts said.=
 Stuxnet took advantage of vulnerabilities in both the Siemens and=C2=A0Mic=
rosoft=C2=A0programs.Because of the overlap between=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0a=
nd Iran's nuclear programs, the NSA would not have had to tinker much with =
Stuxnet to make it capable of destroying centrifuges in North Korea, if it =
could be deployed there.Despite modest differences between the programs, "S=
tuxnet can deal with both of them. But you still need to get it in," said O=
lli Heinonen, senior fellow at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Scien=
ce and International Affairs and former deputy director general of the Inte=
rnational Atomic Energy Agency.NSA Director Keith Alexander said North Kore=
a's strict limitations on Internet access and human travel make it one of a=
 few nations "who can race out and do damage with relative impunity" since =
reprisals in cyberspace are so challenging.When asked about Stuxnet, Alexan=
der said he could not comment on any offensive actions taken during his tim=
e at the spy agency.David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science an=
d International Security and an authority on=C2=A0North Korea's nuclear pro=
gram, said U.S. cyber agents probably tried to get toNorth Korea=C2=A0by co=
mpromising technology suppliers from=C2=A0Iran,=C2=A0Pakistan=C2=A0or=C2=A0=
China."There was likely an attempt" to sabotage the North Korean program wi=
th software, said Albright, who has frequently written and testified on the=
 country's nuclear ambitions.OLYMPIC GAMESThe Stuxnet campaign against=C2=
=A0Iran, code-named Olympic Games, was discovered in 2010. It remains uncle=
ar how the virus was introduced to the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, =
which was not connected to the Internet.According to cybersecurity experts,=
 Stuxnet was found inside industrial companies in=C2=A0Iranthat were tied t=
o the nuclear effort. As for how Stuxnet got there, a leading theory is tha=
t it was deposited by a sophisticated espionage program developed by a team=
 closely allied to Stuxnet's authors, dubbed the Equation Group by research=
ers at Kaspersky Lab.The U.S. effort got that far in=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0=
as well. Though no versions of Stuxnet have been reported as being discover=
ed in local computers, Kaspersky Lab analyst Costin Raiu said that a piece =
of software related to Stuxnet had turned up in=C2=A0North Korea.Kaspersky =
had previously reported that the software, digitally signed with one of the=
 same stolen certificates that had been used to install Stuxnet, had been s=
ubmitted to malware analysis site VirusTotal from an electronic address in=
=C2=A0China. But Raiu told Reuters his contacts had assured him that it ori=
ginated in=C2=A0North Korea, where it infected a computer in March or April=
 2010.Some experts said that even if a Stuxnet attack against=C2=A0North Ko=
rea=C2=A0had succeeded, it might not have had that big an impact on its nuc=
lear weapons program. Iran's nuclear sites were well known, whereas=C2=A0No=
rth Korea=C2=A0probably has at least one other facility beyond the known Yo=
ngbyon nuclear complex, former officials and inspectors said.In addition,=
=C2=A0North Korea=C2=A0likely has plutonium, which does not require a cumbe=
rsome enrichment process depending on the cascading centrifuges that were a=
 fat target for Stuxnet, they said.Jim Lewis, an advisor to the U.S. govern=
ment on cybersecurity issues and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategi=
c and International Studies, said there are limitations to cyber offense.A =
cyber attack "is not something you can release and be sure of the results,"=
 Lewis said.[end of quote]
