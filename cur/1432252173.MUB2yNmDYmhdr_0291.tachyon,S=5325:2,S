With contributions by: Anders Albrechtslund, Thomas Allmer, Mark  
Andrejevic, David Arditi, Roberto Armengol, Kees Boersma, Miyase  
Christensen, Christian Fuchs, David W. Hill, AndrC) Jansson, Deborah G.

The publication has been supported by EU COST b European Cooperation in  
Science and Technology and the EU COST Action IS0807 bLiving in  
Surveillance Societiesb.

This book is the first ever published volume that is dedicated to Internet 
surveillance in the age of what has come to be termed bsocial mediab or 
bweb 2.0b3 (blogs, wikis, file sharing, social networking sites, microblogs, 
user-generated content sites, etc). The Internet has been transformed in 
the past years from a system primarily oriented on information provision 
into a medium for communication and community-building. The notion of bWeb 
2.0b, social software, and social networking sites such as Facebook, 
Twitter and MySpace have emerged in this context. With such platforms comes 
the massive provision and storage of personal data that are systematically 
evaluated, marketed, and used for targeting users with advertising. In a 
world of global economic competition, economic crisis, and fear of 
terrorism after 9/11, both corporations and state institutions have a 
growing interest in accessing this personal data. Here, contributors 
explore this changing landscape by addressing topics such as commercial 
data collection by advertising, consumer sites and interactive media; 
self-disclosure in the social web; surveillance of file-sharers; privacy in 
the age of the internet; civil watch-surveillance on social networking 
sites; and networked interactive surveillance in transnational space. This 
book is a result of a research action launched by the intergovernmental 
network COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).
