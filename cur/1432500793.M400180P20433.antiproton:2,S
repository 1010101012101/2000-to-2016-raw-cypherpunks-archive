On Fox News 5/22/2015, Karl Rove displayed his ignorance about the data cap=
acity of the NSA's data center, which he said was intended to store telepho=
ne metadata, not the actual audio data from phone calls or (perhaps) the co=
ntent of emails. =C2=A0http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/05/22/rove-cr=
itics-dont-understand-nsa-terror-tools/=C2=A0Rove said: =C2=A0"What it does=
 is, it keeps a record of a phone number that is being called from to a pho=
ne number being called to and the date and time. So, unless the Tsarnaev br=
others talked to somebody abroad to talked to the phone number of somebody =
who is identified as a possible terror suspect, they wouldn't -- they would=
n't have been caught by this program whatsoever.And, again, I repeat, why i=
s it that the opponents of Section 215 feel compelled to exaggerate by sayi=
ng, oh, they're listening to our conversations?""Senator Paul on the floor =
of the Senate said, oh, they're listening in to thousands -- I mean, to mil=
lions of conversations. I mean, if we have to build a gigantic center in Ut=
ah to keep track of these phone numbers, how big a center would we need to =
have in order to keep the digital tapes of everybody who is having a teleph=
one conversation? It simply does not happen." =C2=A0[end of quote by Rove]R=
ove is clearly assuming that the size of the data center in Utah is necessa=
ry to hold the metadata alone. =C2=A0The article =C2=A0http://en.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center =C2=A0states:"An article by=C2=A0Forbes=C2=A0esti=
mates the storage capacity as between 3 and 12=C2=A0exabytes=C2=A0in the ne=
ar term, based on analysis of unclassified blueprints, but mentions=C2=A0Mo=
ore's Law, meaning that advances in technology could be expected to increas=
e the capacity by orders of magnitude in the coming years." =C2=A0 [3 and 1=
2 exabytes is 3,000-12,000 petabytes, or 3 million-12 million terabytes.]ht=
tps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130621/03390823552/how-much-would-it-cost=
-to-store-all-us-phone-calls-made-year.shtml
There are about 900 billion telephone calls made in America per year. =C2=
=A0If it took 100 bytes to store the needed metadata per call, that would b=
e 90 terabytes of information needed. =C2=A0The capacity of the center is, =
therefore, 33,000x to 131,000x larger than would be needed to store that da=
ta for the US alone for one year. =C2=A0The data stored in a single call co=
uld probably be compressed to 8,000 bits per second, so every second would =
require 80 times as much data to be stored as just the metadata alone. =C2=
=A0If the average phone call is 120 seconds, that would require about 9600x=
 the data size, well within even the lower estimate above of 33,000x.So, th=
e answer to Rove's question, "I mean, if we have to build a gigantic center=
 in Utah to keep track of these phone numbers, how big a center would we ne=
ed to have in order to keep the digital tapes of everybody who is having a =
telephone conversation? It simply does not happen." is simple: =C2=A0"No, K=
arl, The center is just about the right size to store not only the metadata=
, but in fact the audio to all phone calls made in America in one year. =C2=
=A0And in fact, a good deal larger, probably enough to store the audio of e=
very phone call made in Europe as well, and most of Asia." =C2=A0Would Rove=
 be surprised to hear THAT?!? =C2=A0Well, he'd probably claim to be surpris=
ed. =C2=A0I suspect he'd defend himself by raising a newly-found fact that =
at the time that data center in Utah was proposed, hard drives were probabl=
y 1000x smaller in capacity than today. =C2=A0In 2000, as I recall, a typic=
al large hard drive was 2 gigabytes. =C2=A0Today, the largest I've heard of=
 is 8 terabytes, 4,000x larger. =C2=A0=C2=A0http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/2=
