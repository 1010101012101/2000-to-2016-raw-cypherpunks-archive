"Pursuant to the Defense of the Homeland Act of 2001, isolation of 
regions deemed hostile to the Reich, er, the Heimat, er, the Homeland, 
shall commence after the 9-11-01 Event of next week, er, last week. You 
do not need to adjust your Internet connection--we  are in control. We 
will control all that you see and hear."
