Most likely, you have set your Explorer options to show file extensions (as
most any sane person would).  The install default is to hide them (along
with opening each folder in a new window and not showing the full path in
the title bar, all of which I find most annoying), which is why the average
sofa spud luser is apt to fall for these tricks.
