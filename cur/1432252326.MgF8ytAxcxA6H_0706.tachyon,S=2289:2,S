   from the fight-of-the-year dept.
   [1]gManZboy writes "Two researchers in China has taken a look at the
   [2]steganography vs. steganalysis arms race. Steganography (hiding
   data) has drawn more attention recently, as those concerned about
   information security have recognized that illicit use of the technique
   might become a threat (to companies or even states). Researchers have
   thus increased study of steganalysis, the detection of embedded
   information."
