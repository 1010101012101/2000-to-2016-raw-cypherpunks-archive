"...some of your contributors to this debate remind me of the kind of 
gentlemen who live in Montana and bury food and ammo caches around their 
houses for when the UN troops come to round them up. It seems that the era

crime was in the business of disseminating computer viruses. Why the

excitedly about the Mafia carrying out hits over the Internet."
