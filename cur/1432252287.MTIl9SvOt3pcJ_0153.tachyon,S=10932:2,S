3: FUN AND GAMES:  WORLD WAR II GOES GLOBAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Massively Multiplayer Gaming has been around for some time, but continues to gain popularity as gamers demand more from their online gaming experience.  Today, games like Ultima Online attract thousands of would-be heros, each paying a monthly subscription fee, participating in an online fantasy world of demons, dragons, and social interaction.

Game publisher Strategy First hopes that their new game, World War II Online, will push the genre to the next level.

WWII Online combines the aspects of first-person shooters, like Quake, with the ability to play with thousands of other players simultaneously in a virtual world set on the heart of WWII.

Strategy First will release several components to game, each centering on different era?s in WWII?s historical tract.  This first release, WWII Online: Blitzkrieg, is a massively multiplayer online game of WWII combat, fought on land, air, and sea.  Players can command tanks, pilot combat aircraft, or fight 'down and dirty' in the infantry or marines.  

Players can tailor their game play experience to a degree of detail that has never been available before. A player's ability and experience can be leveraged on a 'career path', which can lead to high command positions within a specific branch of service.  Yet, within this same system, WWII Online still supports a player who simply wants to log on for a fight without concern for rank or power.

4: BONUS GAME REVIEW:  SIMCITY MEET FIDEL CASTRO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In stores now is Tropico - a game in which you play the dictator of a small, carribean country, and must lead your people to a life a happiness and prosperity (while lining your pockets with a few greenbacks as well).  

'Tropico has a unique, tongue-in-cheek humor that is very appealing to gamers,' said Phil Steinmeyer, president and lead programmer of PopTop Software. 'Its simple interface allows for an easy learning curve for casual gamers, and at the same time its many layered modes of game play will challenge hardcore gamers.' 

Diplomacy and politics factor heavily in Tropico, as players must pacify various internal factions and external threats. If the island's growth is well planned, the player will have plenty of money to buy the peoples' favor and ensure prosperity. If growth is poorly planned and the economy falters, the population may revolt, forcing the player to institute martial law. 

One of the most interesting features is that your individual citizens each have unique personalities.  There are more than 45 different character types, and over 500 individual characters.  Some intelligent, some not, some friendly, and some violent.  You?ll get to know individual characters as they perform their daily tasks, or cause you daily headaches.   Even more intriguing is that individual citizens have a circle of family and friends, so what you do to one individual could have wide-sweeping consequences if they are popular-or may go unnoticed if they are not.

Fans of economic simulation games can rejoice as well, as Tropico features a wide breadth of Caribbean industry.  Grow tobacco, corn, bananas, and more (10 different crop types), explore the wonders of tourism, cigar and rum manufacturing, logging, and mining.  

And, classic city builders have a lot to play with too.  Build over 80 types of structures, from hotels to sugar plantations, to churches.  And, you?ll be able to watch how those structures effect the lives of individual citizens.  

This is no game of military conquest however.  While you do have soldiers to help ?keep the peace? (sometimes by whatever means necessary), this isn?t another game of conquer-your-neighbors.  It really is a nice mix of Simcity-like building simulation and economy building, with a twist of humor, in an interesting setting.
