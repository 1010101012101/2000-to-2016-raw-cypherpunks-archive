For procmail (available on Linux systems; for other
Unix systems download from procmail.org):

1. Use a .forward file to forward to procmail:

Mine looks like this, your might have a different
path:

"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail"

2. Edit a .procmailrc for procmail to use.  It's
not that hard, there are some good docs ("man procmailrc")

Some extracts from mine:

-- start of snippet from .procmailrc
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin/
MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
DEFAULT=/var/mail/gbnewby
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/procmail.log

# Backup the last 32 messages (per 'man procmailex')
:0 c
backup
:0 ic
| cd backup && rm -f dummy `ls -t msg.* | sed -e 1,32d`

# Temporary redirects while I'm out of town:
#:0 H
#* cypherpunk
#  cypher-unread

# Grep the header for @toad.com; put it in 'toad' mail folder
# This might cut down on cypherpunks spam
:0 H
* @toad.com
  spam

:0 H
* ^Subject:.*Snowhite
  spam

# tcmay's a pain in the ass
:0 H
* From:.*tcmay@got.net
  spam

# Yes, people still use friend@public.com!
:0
* ^To: Friend@public.com
  spam

# Everything else just gets appended to DEFAULT
-- end of snippet


In the above, "spam" is a mail folder (literally, just a file).
So, you can still read the stuff there...  if you want to 
delete it permanently, use /dev/null instead of "spam"

This will work fine with any Unix mail program that uses
local files -- you'd need something different if you use
IMAP or POP.

3. test, test test!!!  You can do much more sophisticated
filtering with procmail, but I find that most of what I want
is to filter the To, From or Subject line based on a
string or substring.
