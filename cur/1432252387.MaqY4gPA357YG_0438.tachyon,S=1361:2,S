3 [2capital] a : a city serving as a seat of government b : a city
preeminent in some special activity <the fashion capital>

However it seems the "ol" version is correct when capitalized:

Etymology: Latin Capitolium, temple of Jupiter at Rome on the Capitoline
hill
1 a : a building in which a state legislative body meets b : a group of
buildings in which the functions of state government are carried out
2 capitalized : the building in which the U.S. Congress meets at
Washington
