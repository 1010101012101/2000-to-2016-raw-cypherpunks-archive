Only if the round pieces of plastic in decorative jewel box cases
are labelled "CD-ROM" and/or use the "CD" logo.
I've heard that some of the recent sellers of user-preventing round plastic
have responded, correctly, to Philips's announcements about the issue
by no longer labelling them as CDs.

At that point, the implied assertion that the round plastic container
for intellectual property packaging is a "CD" is no more deceptive
than the implied assertion that it contains "music".
