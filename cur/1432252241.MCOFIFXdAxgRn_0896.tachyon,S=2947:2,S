C'punks,

Fox News had a retired general on to discuss the purported billion dollar
bounty on Bin Laden.  His take was predictable.  He was afraid that
mercenaries would get in the way of government efforts to get OBL.  Of
course, he never consider that the government efforts might get in the way
of the mercenaries nor that the two might have a community of interest in
working together.

I have been saying for 15 years that the solution to hijackings/kidnappings
is bounty insurance.  (A relatively small premium pays for a $10,000,000--or
more--bounty on the heads of those who kidnap and kill an insured person.)
Any insurance/entrepreneurial types out there who want to step up to the
plate and put together such a policy?


 S a n d y

P.S.  Bounties are NOT "assassination politics."  Those who believe they are
the same are unclear on one or both concepts.
