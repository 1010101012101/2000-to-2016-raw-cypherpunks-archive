The next question is: What do they do with this info?  Insurance
companies and the like use it to justify discrimination against people
likely to develop certain medical conditions.

The point is, the government is being used to do corporations' dirty
work.  And I'm much less afraid of a government that is (in theory, if
not always in practice) somewhat connected to the people
(representatives want to get reelected, after all) than I am a
corporation that can do basically whatever the fuck it wants, with
little or no hope of punishment.
