Something stinks in Tenn, and its not the Gores this time:

Among his recent cases was the death of Harvard University biologist Don
Wiley, whose fall from a Memphis bridge in December fueled fears of
terrorist kidnappings. The medical examiner also helped identify the
body of Katherine Smith, 49, who was found burned beyond recognition in
February the day before a hearing on federal charges of helping five
Middle Eastern men obtain fake driver's licenses.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. - Medical examiner O.C. Smith, who has worked on some of
the city's most puzzling deaths, is at the center of another perplexing
case: He was attacked over the weekend, bound with barbed wire and left
with a bomb tied to his body.

The spooks are getting careless in Tenn.   First they do the
car-accident/injection thing with a
anthrax-saavy microbiologist, who floats up 300 mi away, then a
DMV-weenie-roast, now games
with the coroner?   What, was he going to tell?
