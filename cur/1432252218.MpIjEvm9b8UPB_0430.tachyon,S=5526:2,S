ok. this is sounding like classic traffic analysis (on the "metadata"
rather than the content, so to speak).

ok.

Tor cells use padding, but this alone is not sufficient to defeat
traffic analysis.

this is why i am fond of everything dark!
namecoin to hidden services,
  no DNS, no plaintext.

(not entirely defeating QUATUMTHEORY, but much of it!)

the anonymity set is large, but maybe that isn't sufficient.

this is exactly the same argument for or against zero knowledge mixes.
sure, they offer stronger protection from traffic analysis, but the
anonymity set of users is tiny, making that theoretical hardness
useless in practical terms.

depending on where you stand, and what network you egress, it may make
absolutely perfect sense - Tor use alone drawing scrutiny that draws
conflict.

from my personal experience, _not_ in places where Tor use alone is
suspect, it has been a essential tool.


if you're concerned about NSA/TAO/SSO then you're speaking of two
broad domains of concern:

1. pervasive, passive global intercept - this is where Tor and
encryption come in.  you've just made it harder, and turned something
global and passive ineffective, pushing activity toward:

2. tailored access - the black bag jobs, weaponized exploits, HUMINT
attacks, etc.  if you've pushed your adversary to these means, you've
achieved a COMSEC and symbolic victory.

you don't defend against #2, you just fail less quickly...[0]



0.  there are exceptions.  these are left an exercise for the reader :)
