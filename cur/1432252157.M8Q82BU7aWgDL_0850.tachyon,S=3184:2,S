Illegal?  Dude, there are much better reasons to use remailers.  I use 
remailers in basically any situation where I am responsible for keeping 
something confidential, or when I'm writing from an account where I 
don't want to get spammed.  I don't do a damned thing illegal, I don't 
think, online -- but remailers are still useful.
