I built a thumbnail page leading to reduced-JPG-quality images from John's 
files; that's online at <http://www.parrhesia.com/wtc100301/>, with a 
temporary mirror at <http://daisy.parrhesia.com/wtc100301/>. That was 
finished last night, but my mails back & forth with John to coordinate the 
mirror were delayed by the need for some sleep. I left the image size alone 
because I couldn't find a good way to get convert or mogrify to do 
height/width-proportional scaling; maybe my fast read of the man page failed.
