Pentagon protects their people by distance - being it by bombing from high 
altitude, or by using cruise missiles.

Everybody uses the technology available to them. What's bad on it?

Invariably, the side that uses the defensive measure - being it smart 
weapons[1] or human shields - classifies it as tactical, while the other 
side considers it cowardly.

A nice example of symmetry in asymmetry.


[1] The defensive aspect here is to allow the attackers to attack from 
distance beyond the reach of the other side's active defenses, thus not 
risking anything more than a piece of overpriced electronics.
