no, peerio, problematic due to, in part,

1) third party broad spectrum surveillance from cromnibus.
(kind of a serious problem for anything that involves initial setup or
later login through website actually)
 See Title III, Subtitle A, Section 309
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr4681enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr4681enr.pdf

this is mitigated in part for such services where keys are not hosted
by the service (e.g. w/ keybase you can refuse to have stuff hosted on
keybase, and can (if you wish) do commands only from CLI after
deciding to host keys on your own machine, but assuming you log in
through web-app / website, then you end up subject to this third party
stuff mentioned above)

2) If I understand this correctly with peerio (and I don't possibly,
since I am unlikely to ever use it as it appears to be a centralized
service), but:
"Instead of dealing with key storage, Peerio generates a userâ€™s
private key from his passphrase every time he or she logs in."
from:
http://www.wired.com/2015/01/peerio-free-encryption-app/
That may or may not accurately describe the process, however.

3) Free, or not?
Apparently there is a paid option, and a free option initially at
launch, there is a open source repository on github.  To the extent
that the crypto is tied to a company (kind of assumed, if there is a
paid option and there is an LLC or something like that), then the
corporation is vulnerable to being shut down or at the very least
"conditioned" ~ being told what to do when "crypto licenses" come into
play, which already exist in Russia, for example, are anticipated in
the UK (see also Belarus, where the Info Minister thinks that the
Internet exists to "serve the Fatherland"), and in the US, where Obama
is developing a really warm friendship with Cameron on the anti-crypto
front.

Frankly I am just going to stay far away as I can from anything that
involves this kind of web-based model.  There is too much compromise
involved and too much insecurity.
