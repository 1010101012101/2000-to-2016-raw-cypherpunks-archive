C'punks,

If you ever watch the SciFi Channel, you've probably seen John Edward.  He
supposedly conveys messages from dead people to their grieving friends and
family.  I can't watch it more than a couple of minutes without getting
really angry.

Penn Jillette--following in Houdini's footsteps about such matters--has
expressed similar outrage.  Recently, Penn wrote:

     	If you want [a] number to call John
	Edward and tell him how wrong what
	he's doing is, I got through on this
	one 631-574-6043.

If you have an opinion to share with John Edward, you might wish to give him
a call.


 S a n d y

P.S.  What was the *SCI*Fi Channel thinking?
