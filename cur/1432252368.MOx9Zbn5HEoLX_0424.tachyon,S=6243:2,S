And I disagree with your big raspberry. Suppose auto makers started 
building in the "radio signal ignition cutoff" feature that has been 
discussed here, where a remote signal can disable a running vehicle. 
Suppose that this is done without any legal regime in place to give 
law enforcement access. Would it be fair to say that building this 
technology into a product has made it more likely that lawmakers 
would make such a system mandatory?

I think the answer is clearly "Yes."

This is why Cypherpunks were so adamantly against PGP/NAI building-in 
the capability for escrowing of keys.

I think you are missing the point. Think in terms of the ignition 
cutoff example above, or similar examples involving building video 
surveillance into hotel rooms, or building keystroke capture and 
storage tools into PCs, whatever. No one is suggesting limiting 
research into video technology, for example, just saying it's a Very 
Bad Idea for hotels or apartment buildings to build-in a capability 
very widely which could then be mandated by law at some later time.

(Loosely related to why so many folks fear gun registration: gun 
registration often has led to gun confiscation.)

Yes, people and companies should be free to do as they wish. I've 
never claimed otherwise...nowhere have I said that ZKS should be 
constrained by men with guns to not develop such products!

However, others of us are free to comment on the dangers of company 
plans and to urge changes in policies. Sounds fair to me.
