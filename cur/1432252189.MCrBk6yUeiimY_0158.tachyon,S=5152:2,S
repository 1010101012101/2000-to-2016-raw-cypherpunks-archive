I've seen nothing from Nathan Saper that warrants the level of 
response we've been giving him. I regret having wasted my time 
writing replies to his puerile points.

It's not so much that he's "wrong" as that he's "naive." He arrives 
on the CP list and begins regurgitating socialist blather he heard in 
his poli-sci and sociology classes. Junk about mandatory health care, 
feeding the poor, raising taxes to make the world a better place, 
government doing what it "needs to do" without regard for 
constitutional restraints, all said with utter disregard for basic 
economics.

As I have said, and as Lucky just said this morning, the list has for 
some reason attracted a whole set of such naive and puerile people. 
One theory is that it's the "fall crop" of students. Another is that 
the noise coming out of "privacy rights organizations" is 
increasingly leftist and interventionist. (We have a Canadian branch 
of the Cypherpunks which is apparently led by a neo-fascist civil 
rights crusader who wants guns banned and is distrustful of free 
market solutions.)

The Saper-Warped Hypothesis.
