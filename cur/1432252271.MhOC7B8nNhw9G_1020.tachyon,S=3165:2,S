Sorry, you're right.  I was too short.  "Live in a cold climate and return 
to the home insulation standards that prevailed before "energy crisis" 
fascism.  (And arrange to be fat like me if you can so you'll remain 
comfortable in a cold house.)  I think the toxic mold thing is a side 
effect of modern wallboard and insulation standards.
