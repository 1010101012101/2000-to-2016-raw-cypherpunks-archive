JYA is temporarily dead online due to work load in the DC area, near the
armageddon push button, which is located, in case you give a, out on Route 7
disguised as FAA Leesburg.

We paid a surprise Sunday morning visit to the CIA back entrance, got
surrounded by HMMVs and spiffy guards with hands on guns, interrogated by a
swell looking Ms. Security who ran our Duncan Frissell ID card through the
master file, idled for 1/2 hour observing gaps in the maginot line, and then
received a heartfelt thanks for cooperating, Duncan, wink.

Mrs. Frissell hissed bitch as we serpentined the Jersey barriers back out the
way in.
