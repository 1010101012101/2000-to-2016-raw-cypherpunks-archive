                    Single-Number Plan Raises Privacy Fears
                       Technology: System would link telephones, faxes
and Web addresses
                    while creating giant databases.

                    By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer

                    WASHINGTON -- A controversial technology
                    under development by the communications
                    industry that links Internet addresses with phone
                    numbers has quietly picked up key government
                    support as concern mounts among critics that the
                    technology will broadly undermine privacy.

                    The technology, known as e-number, or ENUM,
                    would link phone numbers to codes that
                    computer servers use to route traffic on the Web.
                    Proponents say the technology would improve
                    communication for consumers and marketers
                    alike.

                    The industry envisions a sophisticated electronic
                    address book that would be able to direct
                    messages to virtually any fax machine, computer
                    or telephone, using a new 11-digit e-number. As
                    a result, a fax could be sent to someone who
                    lacked a fax machine but had an e-mail address.
                    Likewise, cell phone users would only have to
                    key in 11-digits to send e-mail, not a
                    cumbersome alphanumeric address.

                    But privacy advocates fear the system could
                    undermine online privacy and erode the security
                    of the public phone system as well. They worry
                    that the system would destroy a pillar of Internet
                    privacy: the assumption by users that they enjoy
                    anonymity in cyberspace.

                    The government's endorsement of the technology,
disclosed in interviews and
                    outlined in an Aug. 21 letter distributed to an
industry group, is seen as
                    critical in pushing it forward.



                    "The United States does see merit in pursing
discussions regarding
                    implementation of a coordinated, global [system] . .
. for ENUM," Julian E.
                    Minard, a State Department advisor to the
International Telecommunication
                    Advisory Committee, wrote to representatives of AT&T
and other
                    companies. But Minard cautioned in the letter that
aspects of the technology
                    advocated by industry "go beyond what is prudent or
necessary."

                    ENUM is likely to be voluntary, requiring users to
sign up for the service.
                    But privacy experts say it will not be worth the
time and investment the
                    industry is making in the technology unless it is
widely used. So they expect
                    ENUM will be aggressively promoted.

                    "We believe that ENUM raises serious questions about
privacy and security
                    that need to be addressed before it's widely
deployed," said Alan Davidson,
                    associate director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a privacy
                    watchdog group based in Washington. "They are
promoting this as a system
                    that is going to make it really easy for people to
find you in all kinds of ways.
                    Well, we want to make sure that consumers can opt
out if they don't want to
                    be found."

                    Today, vigilant Web surfers can maintain a high
degree of anonymity because
                    e-mail and other Web addresses contain little
personal information. What's
                    more, Web addresses under aliases can easily be
created to cloak the
                    identity of the sender. As a result, marketers have
been forced to spend
                    millions of dollars to get Web surfers to
voluntarily give up personal
                    information.

                    By contrast, a phone number has a wealth of personal
information associated
                    with it, including a street address, billing records
and dialing data. Marrying
                    such information to Web addresses would represent a
leap in private data
                    warehousing in cyberspace and dramatically increase
the risk of privacy
                    invasions, experts say.

                    "Someone could write a program to query the ENUM
database and obtain
                    every line of your contact information and send spam
to every
                    communications device you own," said Chris
Hoofnagle, legislative director
                    of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington.

                    Hoofnagle added that industry claims that consumers
would be able to opt
                    out of the system, or otherwise protect their
private information, are hollow.
                    "There could be coercion down the road [by
marketers] to push consumers
                    to use ENUM to store their contact information.
Absent legislation, there is
                    likely to be abuse."

                    Since the Federal Communications Commission
regulates the nation's
                    telephone industry and the Commerce Department
administers key contracts
                    that allow private firms such as Mountain View,
Calif.-based Verisign Inc. to
                    register Internet domain names, the government is
likely to play a powerful
                    role in the outcome of ENUM.

                    Its backing of further ENUM development is the most
significant support yet
                    for the technology. It comes as a newly created
industry group, called the
                    ENUM-Forum, agreed last week to an ambitious
schedule to conclude
                    work on ENUM by next May.

                    "This is a big milestone," Gary W. Richenaker, of
Telcordia Technologies
                    Inc., said of the group's first meeting last Monday.
Richenaker, who chaired
                    the gathering, said that officials of the State
Department, Federal Trade
                    Commission and Commerce Department attended.

                    ENUM would work by combining two massive electronic
databases: North
                    American telephone numbers now administered by a
Washington company
                    called NeuStar Inc. and the main database that
routes Internet messages,
                    which is largely controlled by Verisign.

                    An ENUM address reverses a standard phone number and
appends
                    "e164.arpa" to it. For example, the toll-free
directory assistance number
                    would be converted to
2.1.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa. ENUM would
                    recognize both the e164.arpa address and the phone
number as belonging to
                    directory assistance.

                    With some software tweaks to the current Internet
system, computers could
                    be made to route messages to such 11-digit ENUM
addresses in much the
                    same way they now use up to 12-digits to send e-mail
and display Web
                    pages.

                    Although industry engineers recently completed
technical specifications for
                    ENUM, AT&T, Cisco Systems Inc., SBC Communications
Inc. and more
                    than 20 members of the ENUM-Forum agreed last week
to work out
                    additional critical details of the system.

                    ENUM-Forum players also include AOL Time Warner
Inc., British
                    Telecommunications plc and NetNumber.com Inc.--a Web
start-up that has
                    been operating a private, volunteer ENUM system for
nearly a year.

                    The companies will tackle operational and security
issues, such as who
                    would be authorized to make service changes. Phones
are ordinarily
                    associated with street addresses, not individuals,
so businesses and
                    households with more than one person or phone would
need to determine
                    who has control over the ENUM associated with the
phones.

                    The State Department's Minard said his Aug. 21
letter reflected the input of
                    several government agencies but termed the document
a "draft" that could
                    change as industry details about ENUM evolve.

                    Minard declined to elaborate on the misgivings
expressed about ENUM in
                    the letter. Other sources say ENUM is most strongly
supported by the
                    Commerce Department, while the FCC and State
Department remain wary
                    of the potential political fallout from embracing
the technology.

                    The industry, too, is divided over how much the
government should be
                    involved. The heavily regulated telephone industry
supports a broader
                    government role than do Internet companies such as
Verisign and AOL Time
                    Warner.

                    Stacy M. Cheney, an attorney for the Commerce
Department, said the
                    government has not decided whether to play any
regulatory role. But he said
                    officials support "continuing discussions" on ENUM
and would send
                    representatives to a Sept. 12 meeting of an
International Telecommunication
                    Union panel to discuss the technology.

                    Industry officials liken ENUM's potential effect to
the introduction of
                    touch-tone dialing in 1963. That advance paved the
way for a host of
                    modern phone features, including the ability to bank
by phone and navigate
                    voicemail menus.

                    ENUM "could be a huge boon to Internet telephony and
basic
                    communications convergence," said Aristotle Balogh,
vice president of
                    technology at Verisign.

                    ENUM, however, may never be embraced by businesses
or consumers
                    because of the privacy concerns. The technology will
also require support
                    from Internet service providers, software
developers, phone carriers and
                    others.

                    Still, ENUM is expected to gain momentum with the
government's support.
                    It could also get a big boost from efforts by
Microsoft Corp. and AOL Time
                    Warner to make new versions of their software
support ENUM technology.
