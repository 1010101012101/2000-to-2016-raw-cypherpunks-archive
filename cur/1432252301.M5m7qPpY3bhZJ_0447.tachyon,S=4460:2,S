I'm gonna have to challenge this bit here, Variola.

Let's back up. You've got an OC-48 or OC-192 fiber and you want to grab ALL 
of the data in this fiber. Now I'll grant that in real life there's going to 
be a lot telephony circuit in there, but let's take a worst-case and assume 
you need ALL the data.

What's in this OC-192? Right now it definitely ain't 10Gb/s of packets. It's 
going to have LOTS of DS1s, DS3s and, if you're lucky, and STS-3c or two. So 
you'll need to first of all demux ALL of the tributaries.

Next, you've got to un-map any ATM in each of the DS1s, etc, and then pull 
out the IP data from the ATM cells, remembering to reassemble fragmented 
packets (and there will be plenty with ATM). And remember, you may have to 
do this for 5000 simultaneous DS1s. Oh, and let's not forget pointer 
adjustments. You can't just blindly grab stuff...remember that all those 
tribs come from different STRATUM 1/3 clocks, so they'll be moving at 
different speeds and as a result have periodic slips w.r.t the STS-192 
container.

And that's just one fiber. How will you actually get all of this traffic 
back to HQ? Remember, it keeps coming and won't stop.

No, I think I'm becomming convinced that they can't yet get ALL of it. But 
they DO probably grab complete wavelengths and backhual them, storing them 
for later study. (They must do some grooming too. For instance, they 
probably CALEA everything into and out of Brooklyn, and then that will get 
switched over to the Beltway where it will be packed into a GIG-BE OC-768 
back to storage and processing.)
