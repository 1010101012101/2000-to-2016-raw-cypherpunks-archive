Scarce resources (programmer time) go to this, not that.  Given the
small pool of people writing code, I'd like to try to convince them to
write code that I think is more useful.  I'd write it myself, but that
just makes work for someone who says "My god, I need to re-write
this!" ;)

Sorry, I think you missed my point a little.  Let me explain, then
I'll respond to what you said.

If Charlie is willing to kill someone to achieve his goals, then he is
pretty dedicated.  He may be able to trade that willingness to commit
violence for technical help, etc.

I agree that there are groups who might not be able to defeat the
remailer system who'd like it to go away, but its not clear to me how
many of them would go to the extent of kidnapping or killing a
remailer operator to achieve the goal of getting rid of the remailer
system.

So?

True, but how many groups are willing to go that far?
