So, are you now claiming you plan to build one? Why else the "part of 
the appeal lies in the satisfaction of" bit?

As I showed in some calculations a few days ago, power costs dominate 
hardware costs with older CPUs. Not cost-effective to use older 
processors.

As with AI and other speculative applications, 99.9% of solving a 
computational problem is finding the right approach, the right 
algorithms.

I strongly doubt that there is anything along the lines of "run 
problems...simulation...code-based qualitative analysis" that you "need" 
a mere factor of 10 or 20 speed improvement with. (Said 10-20x speedup 
needing roughly 30-100 times as many CPUs, as I outlined in my recent 
post on using 66 MHz-300 MHz Pentiums and Pentiums IIs in place of 1.1 
GHz Pentium IIIs, 1.4 GHz Athlons, 1.7 GHz Pentium 4s, etc.)

It's sort of like astronomy: having a Keck or Hubble telescope sounds 
like a nice thing, but keeping it "loaded" is difficult for a user 
unless he has a very clear observation program in mind. Hence the 
intensive reviews for proposed uses.

If you are already running a CPU-intensive task on a "mere" 10 GOPS 
machine, and you think that you can load a 500 GOPS machine efficiently, 
and you are willing to spend more in electrical power in the first year 
than buying faster CPUs would have provided (!!!), go for it.

But if you just think it would be "neat" to have a 500 GOPS machine 
tripping your power mains when you turn the array on (you _did_ think 
about the additional power you'd have to provide, didn't you?), think 
harder.

The Terascale machine is one of several such _large_ arrays. My old 
company, Intel, makes the IA-64 (Itanium, and followups) architecture.

And, of course, tasks for this machine will be very carefully picked.

By the way, the involvement of IBM is an important point. No mention of 
their own "Power" architecture in this project. This is yet another hint 
that they moving in the same direction Compaq just signalled when the 
dropped the Alpha and adopted the IA-64.

Since H-P is already a partner with Intel in the IA-64 effort, this 
means that every significant computer and server maker has adopted the 
IA-64 except for one: Sun Microsystems. They're still using the SPARC 
architecture, but clearly it has not become the building block they once 
hoped it would (for others). The fact that they don't control their own 
manufacturing of the chip is also an issue.

MIPS has become a microcontroller and game machine CPU--consumer 
electronics. Alpha is being discontinued. H-P's PA-RISC is being merged 
into the IA-64 path, and IBM is hedging its bets on "Power" (PowerPC a 
la G3/G4 and its higher-end Power chips for large computers) by 
aggressively marketing Pentium, Xeon, and Itanium machines. That's all 
the major architectures gone or going, except for UltraSPARC.

And knowing what I know about upcoming chips and processes, I'm hanging 
on to my Intel stock for the rocket ride that is coming.
