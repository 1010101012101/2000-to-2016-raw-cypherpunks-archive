Well, if I were running the fucking NSA, I'd make sure that all staff
and consultants were on high-priority watch lists. Snowden wasn't the
first, you know. He was one of few idealists, though. Most of the rest
were just in it for the money.

I think that it was more than a few days. It took a while for Glenn to
get up to speed with encryption, as I recall.

That's arguable, I admit. Would they have actually killed him? Probably
not, at least at first. But I still like it, cheap rhetoric or not :)

Yes, I was disagreeing. But even if it were a "red flag", what would
that signify? Don't the documents speak for themselves? Why do we care
about his politics, philosophy, etc?
