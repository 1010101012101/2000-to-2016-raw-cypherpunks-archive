I'm not convinced this is legal[1], but if it is: then Napster tools that
work only for "buddy lists" would also be untouchable.  With what
constitutes a "buddy" decided by some judge, eventually.

[1] Not familiar with the HRA in detail... yes you can make personal 
backup or other-media copies for yourself, but distributing them while
you retain copies yourself?
