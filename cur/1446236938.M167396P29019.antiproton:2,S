Could be true; there was an alleged murder plot involving DPR and Silk 
Road, which may have been more of an influence than AP simply by being more

Wendigo is an old legend, but more recently was very prominent on Hannibal. 
 My guess would be the latter was where they borrowed from.  Nothing is new 
under the sun...
