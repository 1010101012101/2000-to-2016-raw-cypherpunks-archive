Is this as good as it sounds.  Anything this simple has to cost a lot to =
get started or has to have some kind of catch. If it is this easy why =
isn't everyone in the world doing this instead of having high stress =
jobs.  Yes, I am skeptical, but I have heard about so many scams, it is =
kind of scary especially if you invest money into it. Could you please =
send me some information on this envelope stuffing job.  Quite frankly I =
am tired of my high stress job and want to stay home and play with my =
kids and my dogs and pick my garden.  If it is  this  easy to make this =
kind of money at a no brainer job at home  please send me the info on =
how to get started.  Please send info to melissastockstill@hotmail.com


Thanks,


Melissa K
