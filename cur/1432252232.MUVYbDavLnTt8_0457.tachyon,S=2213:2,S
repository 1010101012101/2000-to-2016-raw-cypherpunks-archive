A Houston (TX, USA) public library? Could be next to impossible, as well
as excellent cause for revocation of your library card and possible
criminal prosecution if caught. Needless to say, I haven't tried. The
best you could do from Houston libraries would be a proxy accessed via
HTTPS. At one time you could telnet, but that has long since passed.

Other public libraries? Who knows.
