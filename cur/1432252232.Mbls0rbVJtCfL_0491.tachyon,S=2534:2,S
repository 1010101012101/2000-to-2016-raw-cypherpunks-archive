   Must be something like that -- weird tho. I can get to news.bbc.co.uk just
fine, but the one I'd been using for a long, long time on a daily basis,
www.bbc.uk.com, just disappeared. Oh well. Makes me wonder tho, about who/what
the sites actually are that we go to -- maybe nothing is as it seems.
