('Identifying the difference between Pravda and Izvestia'.)   An approximation I once heard is that a lens or mirror of about 4.5 inch in diameter can resolve an angle of one arc-second.  A mirror of the size of the Hubble Space Telescope (which I assume approximates that of the typical spy satellite today) is about 20x larger, so the resolution should be 20x better, or 1/20 arc-second.  That's 1/(57 degrees per radian)(3600arcseconds per degree)(20) = 1/4,100,000 radian.  From an altitude of 500 kilometers, that's about 1/8 of a meter, or 120 millimeter.  Maybe that's a pixel-pair, but it's far too large to resolve the text on a newspaper.

Such a mirror array would at some point reflect enough light at odd angles to be visible with the 
naked eye.

I find it more likely that multiple-mirror-telescope tech would be implemented with a swarm of small
satellites and extremely precise location tracking and a lot of signal processing later on.
