	Too bad your comparison doesn't work. Gold has been used as a
	medium of exchange for thousands of years, all over the planet.
	Comparing the price of gold to the price of tulips in one city
	in 1637 is economic nonsense.

	
	Gold was priced at ~$1800 per ounce 5 years ago. Now it's at
	$1200. Was it overpriced 5 years ago? Technically, you can 
	argue so. Does it mean that in five years we will be using gold
	to "build public lavatories in the streets of some of the
	largest cities of the world" ?

	Again, that's not a price that can be directly compared to the
	price of gold. But if anything it's more evidence to support my
	position. The dollar has been greatly 'inflated'(devalued) by
	the inflationist quacks.

	I don't mind learning chinese. Better than the language of the
	anglo-american empire. Regardless, your economic analysis is
	flawed.
