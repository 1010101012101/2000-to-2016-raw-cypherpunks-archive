I was specifically trying to avoid such mentally-unnourishing
but visually tasty scifi candy as "Matrix" etc.   Mostly Choate polluted the list,
what a surprise.  1984, because of the televisors and surveillance
is ok; Brazil (although brilliant) isn't CP though fantastic
in many other respects.  If I'm wrong, its because it been
years, and I welcome correction.
