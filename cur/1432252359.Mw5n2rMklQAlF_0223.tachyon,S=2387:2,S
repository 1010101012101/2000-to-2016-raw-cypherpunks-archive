Ahhh... My bad: I had not considered my audience when I replied :-)

Yes, I suppose that the more technical amongst us could selctively jam
only the one signal, however, cellular phones are mighty low power
devices, and I would not hazard a guess as to whether it would be possible
not to overpower the wanted signals on something like this.  Even if this
is doable, it is out of reach of Jane Citizen.
