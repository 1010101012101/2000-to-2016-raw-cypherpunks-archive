I don't think so.  If they are fool enough to sign a document without
reading it, it's the same as using a pen to sign a contract without
reading it.  A fool is a fool, why try to protect them?  It's pretty
hopeless to try because fools are so clever!

I don't have a problem with a signing system that requires the user to
do something (like maybe even use a pda stylus and actually sign with
their own handwriting), but *forcing* them to read a contract is just
plain silly.  When enough fools have been burned by a scam, the word
will get out and the rest of the fools who don't read contracts might
think about not signing.

An e-signature can have the same weight in law as an ink one, and the
same rules apply.  A fool and their money are soon parted.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
