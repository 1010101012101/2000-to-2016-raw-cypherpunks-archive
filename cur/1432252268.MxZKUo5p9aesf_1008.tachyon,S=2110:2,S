that would be my email provider - and hence me. sorry. They suck in many
ways, but they give an efficient free service with tls support; one of the
ways they suck is to either
a) hide some of your mail in a folder invisible to pop3 (so you have to
use their german-only and non-fishable interface to go look)
b) add that bloody stupid header to random emails that they think are spam
(no idea what criteria is in use as it is all in german)

I meant surprising for Sarad - Much of this discussion pre-assumes that he
*does* misunderstand probability but is willing to substitute our
collective insanity for his current ignorance :)
