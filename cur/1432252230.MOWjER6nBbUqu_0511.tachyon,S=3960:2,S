I guess the argument would boil down to who has copyright and who or what
has "moral right".  For sculpture and painting the duplication rights are
kind of obvious, but the destruction/use/"first sale" is complicated.
For digital art/music duplication rights are complicated, and use in
other works ("fair use") gets really messy.

And if I take a digital photo (well many pictures) of a sculpture and
reconstruct it in a 3D virtual world, is that "fair use" or copyright
violation?  Blech, this is gonna get worse before it gets better!

Patience, persistence, truth,
