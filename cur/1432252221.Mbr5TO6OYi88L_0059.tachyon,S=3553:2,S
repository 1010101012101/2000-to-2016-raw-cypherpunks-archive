Marsh apparently assumes that sorting into 'good' and 'bad' buckets is 
actually based on evaluating background factors (which the evaluator
is somehow, all magically aware of)), and is in fact done by people
with plenty of quality eyeball time.

Oh good grief. Do you even know how many subscribers this list has? If  
not, one shouldn't make such a statement without basis. The subscriber  
count wasn't public last I checked (today). Perhaps Jack Lloyd will tell 
us.

My guess is the majority of subscribers hardly ever post. Of those who do, 
many are noted academics, professional engineers, industry executives, 
public speakers, and others of good repute.

If you're looking for someplace to feel subversive around, this isn't it. 
Crypto is a mainstream engineering discipline these days, and one greatly 
needed by modern civilization.

Can we kill this thread now please?
