that deserves to be QFT, so it's included below:

Echoing Seth's sentiment, but wanted to be sure your post was read by 
anyone who might have missed it.

I truly don't have the time right now to pen the kind of response I wanted 
to after reading those state apologist diatribes.  Upon reading your reply 
below, I see you have it covered (and you made your point without the salty 
language I may have used.  Heh.)

+1, +1, +1...
