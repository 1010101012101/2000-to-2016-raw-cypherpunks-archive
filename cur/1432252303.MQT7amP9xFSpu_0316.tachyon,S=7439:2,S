>POLICE have created a database of more than 6000 vehicles of suspects

>On major roads across Scotland, the cameras, which look similar to

>scan them against the database.
>
>Those on the list are flagged up with the local force control room
>with details of the direction in which they are travelling. Depending

>stopped immediately by officers or monitored during its journey.

>Senior police say there are a "substantial number" of cameras across
>the country aimed at detecting drugs traffickers, sex offenders,
>suspected terrorists and banned or unlicensed drivers. Owners on the
>list are not told, and civil rights campaigners have raised concerns
>about whether the scheme is compatible with human rights legislation.

>However, officers say Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR),
