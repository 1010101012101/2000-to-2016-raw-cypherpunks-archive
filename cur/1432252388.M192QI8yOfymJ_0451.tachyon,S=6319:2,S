A "D based rocket" is no great amount of force. If it was light enough to go 
as fast as you say, then it wouldn't go through plate glass, much less a 
windshield.

On the contrary, someone throwing a fire extinguisher at me - window glass, 
safety glass, or barred gate - does create a reasonable fear of death or 
great bodily injury. Not necessarily because the fire extinguisher will ever 
reach me, but because I have rather clear evidence that someone intends on 
causing that harm somehow or another. If they don't, then why are they 
throwing fire extinguishers?

Your opinion. My opinion is that if anyone wants to hit me with a 2x4, fire 
extinguisher, baseball bat, whatever, then they'd better expect to be hit by 
anything I have handy, up to and including .45 chunks of lead travelling at 
400 fps.
