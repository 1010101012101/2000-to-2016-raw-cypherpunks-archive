I purchased the latest smartphone with a slider qwerty keyboard. A 
Motorola Droid 4 with CM11 and a T5 torx screwdriver from Ebay. The two 
T5 screws to the battery ribbon cable had been glued. I discarded the 
smartphone.

Nook Tablet with CM 10 arrived DOA. I could not go past the CM welcome 
screen. Tablet wouldn't shut down or reboot. I returned it to the 
seller.

MIPS tablet #1 didn't charge via USB port, was missing file manager, 
Adobe Reader, Skype and app installer, would not mount my SD card and 
bricked my 16 GB SD card. I tried to use tablet #1's micro USB port to 
copy my personal files but tablet's USB port would not function.

MIPS tablet #2 did charge via USB port, was missing app installer but 
had file manager, Adobe Reader, Skype and two games whereas tablet #1 
did not have any games, mounted my SD card but bricked my 8 GB SD card. 
I was able to copy my personal files using the tablet's micro USB port.

aLogcat logs disclose secret GSM in MIPS tablet #2:

Hours after posting the above thread yesterday, my MIPS tablet #2 was 
stolen from my room.

Were my laptops implanted with GSM and infected with firmware rootkits 
when they were interdicted? I had assumed FM radio transceiver/beacon 
implants or badBIOS.

Many of the linux /var/logs I was denied permission to read even though 
I had logged into the graphical desktop on my laptops. A few of the 
/var/logs were of unknown file type. The type was unknown to the file 
manager. Had the firmware rootkits not tampered with the /var/logs, GSM 
may have been reported in the logs.

"Last year, California’s Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) was 
required after an investigation to pay $390,000 to the state’s General 
Fund after it was discovered that they were spying on anti-smart meter 
activist groups."
