"Beaners"

BTW, I wonder if anyone else on this list is aware that the inmate
population of Phoenix Federal Correctional Intitute is about 40% Mexican.
Not "mexican-american."  The average American's illusion is that when an
illegal alien is found he's immediately kicked across the border.  Well, the
first time maybe, but there is now a 2-year sentence for illegal entry for
repeat offenders.  Very convenient, because the majority of prison guards
are probably ex-US Military-types who "need" to be kept in the Federal fold.
For every couple of beaners they keep, they get to hire another guard.
