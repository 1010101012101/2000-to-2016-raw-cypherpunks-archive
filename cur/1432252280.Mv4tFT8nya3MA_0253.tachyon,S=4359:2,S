I think it's a typo. I think Declan meant
reputation punishing tool.  

If he didn't, he should have.  Good riddance
to bad rubbish--though, as I suppose would Declan
or even Choate, I'd defend the bastard's right to
be a bastard, so long as he's willing to pay up 
when he causes real damage--or just gets caught
in an arbitrary system not of his own arbitrary devise,
such as the courts.  

If you're going to be a tyrant, you'd better
be able to cope with it.  Apparently Mr. ORBS
wasn't.
