proof-of-delivery protocols might help (but they're patented, as I 
discovered when I reinvented them a few years back).

Simultaneous release is (provably?) impossible without a trusted third 
party.

I think this is one of the interesting applications of capabilities. 
Using them, you can have a TTP who is ignorant of what is running - you 
and your vendor agree some code that the TTP will run, using capability 
based code. In your case, this code would verify the eGold payment and 
the code (difficult to do this part with certainty, of course) and 
release them when both were correct. Because of the capabilities, the 
TTP could run the code without fear, and you would both know that it 
performed the desired function, but neither of you could subvert it.

Cheers,

Ben.
