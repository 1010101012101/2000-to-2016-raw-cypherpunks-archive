The opinion I am repeating ( not mine, but seems plausible ) is that the
supply of numismatic quality St. Gauden's may be such that the current
premiums are not justified.

The premium over the bullion value is a very large component of the
price.

I've tried to learn a bit about coin collecting but I find myself
hesitant to plunge right into it. It's just like any other "investment",
subject to bubbles, busts and shady operators. I don't know enough to
feel comfortable with it.

Having watched bullion prices for a while it appears to have two major
factors : a bet on fear ( peaked during the India/Pakistan prick wagging
contest ) and against a strong dollar. Yet another trading option.
