I can agree that Russia is no better than USA, only weaker and thus
has to achieve its goals with different means. As of "bad because
Russian", I do not say things like that. It is not my way. I suppose
if I was actually prejudiced, you would be feeling much more
comfortable...

I am rather busy pursuing my things. Maybe I will spare a while over
one of coming weekends. Did he delivered it somewhere on the net? Was
it edited or is it presented as it was?

Seems like you think there is something wrong with being one or another?

Too bad we will not share our experiences with Russian language. But I
have just learned about one guy, Dmitry Merezhkovsky. And Russian
symbolism. Like I wrote, Russian culture is vast and rich, so whenever
I look at it, I always come out with something interesting to learn
about. So you called me a troll in just right moment. Thanks!
