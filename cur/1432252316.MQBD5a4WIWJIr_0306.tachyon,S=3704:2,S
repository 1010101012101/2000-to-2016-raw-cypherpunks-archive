nice idea - micropayment and all. (i.e. a mail would cost $0.0001 so
that ordinary people don't exactly pay anything).

however - here's a bummer: you've got a chance of pretty much 0.00% to
move into that direction, because a different system is already in
place. since it works reasonably well, it'll not get replaced, not even
by a vastly superior one. that's just how things work. unfortunately.
