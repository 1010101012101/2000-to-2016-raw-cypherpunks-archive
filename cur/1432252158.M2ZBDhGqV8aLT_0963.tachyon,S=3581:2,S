lne.com's sendmail now supports START_TLS.  Not that that adds
any security to cpunks list mail of course.  But it does
increase the amount of encrypted traffic.

It's relatively easy to turn on TLS in sendmail.  It's not secure 
against active attackers that can modify the data in the TCP stream
but it's better than nothing.

Besides START_TLS which is built in, there is probably an auto-PGP patch
for sendmail.
