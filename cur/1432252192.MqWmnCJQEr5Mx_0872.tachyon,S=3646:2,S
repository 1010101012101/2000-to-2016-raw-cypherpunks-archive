Sure, it has it's momentum changed. Think about it. The photon comes in
from one direction and is absorbed/interacts with the atoms. As a result
they get re-emitted (reflected) in the exact opposite direction. The point
is the photons that get re-emitted ARE NOT THE SAME PHOTONS THAT WERE
ABSORBED.

You can't do that without losing something. photons only have one thing,
energy as represented in their wavelength. The beam that gets re-emitted
is less energetic than the beam that came in. Even if it does have the
same phase and time coherence as the incident one. 2nd law of
thermodynamics.

You're confusing the intermediate vector boson as the carrier of
information with the information itself.
