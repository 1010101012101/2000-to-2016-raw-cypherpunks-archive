Hypocrisy is the name of the game in Washington, as in all imperial 
cities.

Robert Novak, a reporter, revealed the name of a clandestine CIA 
operative, which is said to be a felony (the revealing of a name, that 
is). Will he face jail time, or does he get one of those special 
"exemptions for reporters"?

Long time readers here know that I argue we are all reporters, we are 
all writers, we are all ministers, we are all preachers. There are no 
special rights for "badged" or "licensed" reporters, writers, 
ministers, witch doctors.

If it's a felony for _me_ to say "Sources tell me that Valerie Plame, 
the wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson, has been a CIA covert operative 
since 1980," it is a felony for Robert Novak to do so.

And yet he will not be prosecuted, while Jim Bell was prosecuted 
essentially for "outing" the names of some lower-ranking investigators.

(As for the Plame case, Novak will not be prosecuted, because he's a 
loyal Republican and Ashcroft won't touch loyal Republicans. But were I 
to talk about Plame's role in assisting with CIA-sponsored diamond 
smuggling in Niger and Gabon, and her involvement with the death squads 
in South Africa in the early 80s, I could expect a visit from the 
Thought Police. So I won't talk about these things. Novak can talk 
about her, we cannot.)

And in the Lamo case, reporters who clam up will face Patriot Act 
consequences.

Will Robert Novak and Karl Rove get the same Patriot Act treatment? 
Don't be silly.

Washington is corruption on earth. The Great Satan needs to be 
destroyed with a 40 megaton bomb.

Corruption on earth.
