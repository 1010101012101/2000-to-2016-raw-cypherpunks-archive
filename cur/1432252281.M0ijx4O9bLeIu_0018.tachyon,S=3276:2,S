This site? Let me look around. Ah, yes. 

This site is the secret Cypherpunk nuclear launch bunker from which we
can rain nuclear fire down from the heavens with a single
thought. Over in that corner over there is the closet where we keep
almost ten years worth of food, for use in case we have to go into
hiding or nuclear winter falls upon us all. And in that corner over
there is the weapons locker. And there is the Beowulf cluster with
16TB of drive space, hooked to the Internet with multiple T3s.

And that over there is an airlock. Do you want to see it? Ah, of
course you do. Just step in there. Yeah, that's it. Now those lights
up there show the door status. Let me show you. Now, we close the door
like this, and that light changes, then I can push this button. Ignore
that click. Then if I push this button, that digital display will
start showing increased air pressure. And we let it run for a few
minutes... What? Yeah, I saw that James Bond movie too. Now I just hit
this rapid decompression switch and *that* light will change... 

Hey, someone get maintenance over here. Some idiot was in the airlock
again and he exploded. I hate it when that happens. It's such a mess,
and the tissue is really hard to get off the glass.
