I fully agree with this point...I thought I indicated this by frequently 
referring to professors, academic programs, etc. The only "lawyers" who 
get to do any substantive research are those working for or with 
prestigious law professors, or for a few dozen justices.

Everyone else is processing writs and regurgitating old boilerplate. Or 
maybe teaching young larvae who think they're about to change the world.

Many parallels. Nearly all programmers and engineers are doing what they 
are told to do. Only a small fraction are able to strike out in new 
directions. While we celebrate programmers like Linus Torvalds, most 
programmers are doing the programming equivalent of processing wills and 
divorces.

Drones rule, especially in a drone-dominated field like "the law."

Only study law if this is the kind of dronedom you prefer.
