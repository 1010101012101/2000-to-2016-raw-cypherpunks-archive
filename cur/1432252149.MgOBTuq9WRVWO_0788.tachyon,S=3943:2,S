As a matter of fact I'm studying it right now (for my Software Engineering
Economics Class).

Heaven forbid Here's a good quote even:

"The use of dollar profit as the only criterion to be used in decision
making often leads to decisions with good short-term profit properties, but
poor social outcomes for the people  involved (and often, as a result, poor
long-term profit prospects)."
.
.
.
"The net value approach used in this book assumes that ALL  [Author's
emphasis, not mine] the relevant components of effectiveness--employee's
need-fulfillment, customer's good will, users' information privacy,
operator's ease of use--have been translated into dollar values and
incorporated as such in the total value function".

(p 212 - Software Engineering Economics by Barry W. Boehm)

In other words the Alice should take into account more than just what it is
going to risks/cost
to treat Bob.

But most companies are going to only consider their short-term interests
(There's that "Tragedy of the commons" again) unless they are forced
otherwise.
