Since no one has yet mentioned it, Ryan Lackey once mentioned a 
secure chat program.. Zephyr? Gale? (the name was related to some
other existing, insecure chat program)

I don't see why a secure text-chat program would be any different than
PGPfone (using DH, not RSA).  Maybe easier i/o, tougher authentication
since PGPfone uses human voice recog in part.
