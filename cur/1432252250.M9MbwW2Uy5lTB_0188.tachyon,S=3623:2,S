<snort>  When will people stop falling for this?

Remember that when you register a second-level domain, you can assign any
subdomains you want through your own DNS service.  The owners of KLUGE.ORG,
for example, could add RAYMOND.D.MERENIUK.IS.A.MORON.KLUGE.ORG.  If
Microsoft itself had such a juvenile sense of humor, it could strike back
with LINUS.SUCKS.DONKEY.BALLS.MICROSOFT.COM.  A few hours to propagate, 
and
it's visible to everyone.

Duh.
