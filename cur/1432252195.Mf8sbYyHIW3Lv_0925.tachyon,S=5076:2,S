As long as MS Office isn't mandated by law, who cares?  So what: somebody
sends me a file.  I tell them I can't read it.  Now, they have a choice,
they can give me MS Office or they can send me ascii.  The market will
determine if "secure" OS's are useful.

DRM isn't the problem.  Legislating DRM is the problem.  You can go buy
IBM portables with secure key chips built in right now to help protect
your box and your business data.  That's TCPA.  Nothing wrong with it,
it's a good idea.

It doesn't become wrong until it becomes forced down our throats.  That's
where S.2048 becomes something to worry about, it forces us to use
hardware we don't need (or may not need for our purposes).  TCPA and DRM
are not the problem here, and privacy and copyright are side issues too.
There is no need for the law to intervene, the market will decide how all
this stuff can be used efficiently and effectively.

And that's what the entertainment industry needs to figure out and fast
too.  The law is slow.  Technology is fast.

Patience, persistence, truth,
