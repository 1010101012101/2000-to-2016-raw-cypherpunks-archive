Since it's coming up in some of my historical research, and definitely
relevant with all of the HRC email stuff in the news right now, I thought
I'd check and see if anyone here happens to know what agency has custody of
the 3,000 White House emails that were released to the NSArchive after
their lawsuit. About 250 were published by NSArchive, but the rest haven't
been made available yet.

If anyone happens to know what agency has them, let me know. I'd love to
get my hands on them. My initial check with NARA shows only the million
restricted emails held by the GHWBush Presidential Library, but I'll check
with the archivists at NARA II next week.

Let me know if you have any leads!

-Mike
