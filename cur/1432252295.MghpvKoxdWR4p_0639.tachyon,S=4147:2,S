The Great EU Sugar Scam (PDF)
NGO briefing paper on gross inequities in the world sugar market - 'Under 
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU has emerged as the world's 
largest exporter of white sugar. Subsidies and tariffs generate vast 
profits for big sugar processors and large farmers - and vast surpluses 
that are dumped on world markets. Smallholder farmers and agricultural 
labourers in poor countries suffer the consequences' ( Oxfam )
