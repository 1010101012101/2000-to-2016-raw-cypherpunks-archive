However, it's not entirely reliable. At some point, the suspect tells you
what you want to hear, whether or not it is the truth, just so you leave
him alone. It can even happen that the suspect convinces himself that what
he really did what he was supposed to do.

Of course, the solved-crimes statistics doesn't care about this subtle
difference.

This brings another ofren underestimated problem into the area of
cryptosystem design, the "rubberhose resistance".
