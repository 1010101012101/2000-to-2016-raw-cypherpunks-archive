Um ... this is a good technical argument, but it does not address
the basic premise that what the voters wants is what the voters
should get.  There is no question what the voter wants.  They
knew ahead of time that they would be voting for a dead man's wife.
The appointment may be technically flawed, but for a judge to throw
this out would require finding a serious problem.  Technicality is
probably not a serious enough problem to go against the electorate.

Even more significant is that a dead man cannot take the oath of office.

If he can't take the oath of office he can't occupy the office.  The
governor only has the power to replace a senatoratorial position if 
the current office holder dies.

Since Carnahan died before he took office, the office remains unfilled.  The

governor does not have power to appoint senators willy-nilly. The office
must 
be held before it can be filled.  The correct solution would be to hold a 
special election so that the public has a chance to know who they are voting
into office.  What the democrats are afraid of is that his wife might be
less fit to hold that office than her husband in some democrat's minds
(after debates etc).

Here is a question?  Would it be vote fraud to run one person's name on the
ballot and replace him with someone else when he won?
