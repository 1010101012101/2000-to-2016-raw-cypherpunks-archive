No, no, no.  This is all planned.  After all, how can you have a war on
terrorism in order to clamp down on freedoms, if there is no terror?  How
can you incite patriotism and support of the government?  How else can you
bring about the police state?  

And while you're at it, you can make most people far more maleable if it
happens during an economically shaky time.  And having a war that costs
nearly a trillion dollars plus another billion every two weeks or so might
just do the trick.
 

Of course the above is all hypothetical, nothing like this could happen in
real life.
