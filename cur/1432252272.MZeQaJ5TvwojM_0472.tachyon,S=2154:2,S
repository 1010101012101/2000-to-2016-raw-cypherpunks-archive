Firewalls may munge the TCP headers, and if you're just protecting the 
session setup,
you still need to worry about eavesdroppers and session hijackers.
Also, this doesn't strike me as the right protocol layer to address the 
problem at.


If you want to be secure, either use IPSEC (in which case this isn't that 
necessary),
or else use SSL if you'd rather wrap things in Layer 4.
Alternatively, do the job at Layer 7.
