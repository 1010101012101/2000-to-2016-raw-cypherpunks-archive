My own view is that the sole function of the State it to convert money
into power, then back into money.  Partial reinvestment of State
partons' capital gains produces an accelerating feedback cycle,
concentrating more money (=power) into fewer hands over time.  I don't
anticipate this changing as corporations become more sovereign and
States less so.

I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.

This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.

I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.

I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.

Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.

I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
personally.

It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.

A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.

Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."

If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.

The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
technology.

- From Subvert Comix #3, by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:

http://pilobilus.net/xfer/Subvert_no3_pg35.jpg

But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.

Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.

Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...
