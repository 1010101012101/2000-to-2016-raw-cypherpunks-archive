Just goes to show how far ahead some countries are... such crude 
measures as monitoring the voting booth (and the voting booth itself) 
are no longer necessary, thanks to E-Voting.

Through the use of violence or threats, force the voter to use his 
mobile-phone to E-Vote the way you want.  Dispense with inconvenient and 
costly voter payments!

For extra points, set up a cellphone eavesdropping system in your voting 
district, to assure people are voting your way.  That way your 
enforcement staff can concentrate on remediation rather than direct 
physical encouragement.

Of course, things like vote-rigging would never, ever happen in a 
civilized country.  Much less vote-rigging based on threats and 
violence.  And certainly never in the USA <cough>
