Any man who keeps a cat is either sensitive. Or gay. Or both. Tim
keeps two.

 I have two cats. Raised from kittenhood. They are delightful...no
 scratching, no tearing up of furniture, a joy to be around. Both are
 males, both were fixed (neutered) at the usual age.

 Have you considered having him be mainly an outdoor cat? Just a
 little bit of food and medical care, and maybe a warm place to
 sleep, should be enough. Many people with "outdoor cats" let them
 in at night and put them out in the morning. This minimizes the
 "tearing up while owners are out" effect.
