FYI,
The author of GEOM has just added the first straw man crypto provider to
the FreeBSD 5.0 drive/partition manager.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/geom/geom_aes.c?rev=1.1&co
ntent-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup

Yes, I know it is a modest start. But given how much interest there has
been on the list in transparent drive encryption, those inclined to
provide constructive feedback, ideally in the form of source code, may
wish to do so.
