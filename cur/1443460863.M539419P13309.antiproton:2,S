As far as I can see, VW recognized that there was/is a tradeoff between the=
 emission of CO2 and NOx. =C2=A0(Where NOx is used as a shorthand for nitro=
gen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2; which when at high concentration =

 lot, perhaps it is 10%. =C2=A0VW made the choice to cheat, to reduce the e=
mission to "Y" but only when the car recognized that it was undergoing emis=
sions testing. =C2=A0

Maybe other car manufacturers were aware of it. =C2=A0But they may have bee=
n cheating, too, greatly reducing their motivation to report VW.

That would have been a major clue. =C2=A0But presumably the testers didn't =
have any way to know how much diesel fuel was actually being consumed on th=
e road by VW's cars.
