The police riot at last week's A22 Bush Protest outraged many people in 
Portland and around the U.S. Mayor Vera Katz delivered her response on 
Friday by subjecting Critical Mass riders to pepperspray and police 
violence. With this choice, she has made it clear that she stands with 
tyranny and against freedom. Katz's track record of affronts against civil 
liberties includes the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Sit-Lie-Stand 
Ordinance, and the humiliation of Dignity Village. Her committed opposition 
to basic human decency has never been more obvious. She is a disgrace to 
the caring, progressive, justice-seeking people of this city and if she had 
a shred of honor, she would step down. In my book, Katz is more dangerous 
than Dubya; her brand of petty fascism is endorsed by the clueless liberals 
of the Democratic Party, whose only difference with the Republicans is that 
they kiss you before they fuck you over. It's time for you to resign, Vera, 
and take that thug Police Chief Kroeker with you.
800+ riders showed up for this Friday's Critical Mass, the biggest of the 
year so far. Just before arriving, we heard over the police scanner that 
the cops were bringing vans and pepperspray. We figured that the city was 
somehow planning "revenge" for the victory that the people of Portland 
enjoyed on A22, which sent positive ripples out across the nation. And 
while the city certainly tried to use the cops against us -- and certain 
cops were brutally dedicated to the cause -- the Critical Mass was not 
deterred
