So?  Everyone *everywhere* is 'affected' by everyone elses' decisions.
Everything
you consume or make affects the global supply:demand and therefore price.

The effects of unfree localized trade are well known: regular folks
see higher prices.  Even if trade is global but unfree, they see
artificial tariffs.  To say nothing of the peasant who can't *choose*
a better job in a factory because of unfree trade.

Additionally, free trade leads to (purely voluntary, emergent) optimization.
(If I can make X or Y, but you can make X but not Y cheaper, I'll make Y
and you make X.)

No one forces a farmer to the city to look for an industrial job.
No one forces industrial folks to seek service jobs.  Its economics
and psychology.

Guess what: in a free society, no one is in charge of optimizing happiness.
Well, each individual is responsible for their own.  Since others can't
tell what makes each individual happy, this is again optimal.

\begin{asbestos}
In a centrally-ruled (statist) society some elites decide what *should* 
make *others* happy.  And forces everyone to pay for it.
Not only doomed in reality, but immoral.
