What these people ought to be doing is using the
PGP messages only to transmit authentication data.
eg: "When I talk today, I'm going to mention the Yankess".
That way if a criminal cracks their system and reads
plaintext copies of their email, they can't decrypt stored
traffic. What they propose destroys the Perfect
Forward Secrecy property of SF. 

SF also should display part of the parameters used to
generate the ephemeral key, allowing the users to
assure themselves that there is no Man In The Middle
attack underway.

(yes, this is obvious to most cpunk subscribers, but
apparently not to all SF users)
