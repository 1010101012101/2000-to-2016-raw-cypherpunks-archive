Oh, my - you're saying that Bush has *credibility* in the rest of the
world?  :-)

This reminds me more of the tail-wagging-the-dog situations that
parliamentary systems get into when some minor religious party
or right-wing-wackos or the Monster Raving Loonie party gets to
tell the bigger party what to do because they need three more seats
for their coalition. 

Too bad Florida has a winner-takes-all system - under proportional
representation they'd have been done weeks ago, with 
one electoral vote for Nader, 12 for Gore, and 12 for Bush, 
and that would fairly accurately reflect the opinions of Florida's voters,
unlike the current situation where the margin of error in the counts
is much wider than the difference between the totals.
And it's not even available as a compromise, because Gore's in the lead
without the Florida votes, so that would give him the election.
				Thanks!
