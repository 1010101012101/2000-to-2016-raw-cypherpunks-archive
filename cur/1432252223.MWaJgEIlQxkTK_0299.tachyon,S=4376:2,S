URGENT:

I just received an urgent message from Mr. Fred Leuchter, who has traveled the nation for many years as a consultant for execution methods.  His job is to review and improve the instruments by which the death penalty is imposed in each state.

If you are like me, you probably wonder why a person would concentrate his life on instruments of death when he doesn't even believe in the death penalty.  I asked Mr. Leuchter that question and he replied that, but since we insist on employing state sanctioned murder, at least we should be as humane as possible about it.

He's very concerned about an upcoming electrocution in Ohio.  The electric chair there is defective and the death of John Byrd Jr will be exceptionally horrible unless the defects are corrected before the execution.

If you have media and authority contacts in Ohio, get this message to them!

Subject: Ohio Electric Chair

Dear Kay, 

I have been in touch with Attorney Richard Vickers of the Ohio Public Defenders office in Columbus.  He represents John Byrd, Jr. who is about to  be electrocuted in a chair with defective electrodes and voltages which are too low.  His blood will boil while he is conscious, almost like being burned at the stake in the chair. 

I have sent him a sworn opinion as to the problems with the chair.  In the meanwhile, a legislator has filed emergency legislation to eliminate the chair entirely.  He can use all the help he can get.  If you can advise your Ohio subscribers to contact their reps and senators to support the legislation it would be helpful.  The 

Attorney is Richard Vickers, Esquire
Public Defenders Office
Columbus, Ohio 
614-466-5394. 

Fred. 

p.s. I am back in Boston (Malden) permanently now (moved 2 weeks ago).
