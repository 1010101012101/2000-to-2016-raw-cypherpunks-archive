Whoever said that law enforcement officials actually had a clue as to what
the law said anyways?  All you have to do it get an emotional issue like
"bombs" or "kid porn" (or anything else that gets the average person's
brain to stop thinking rationally) and add "the Internet" to it and you
have a "means-of-promotion" case for some publicity seaking DA.  Then,
when it gets let go because of lack of illegality, you have yet another
group of publicity hounds screaming "There Ought To Be A Law!".  The press
will report it because it is emotional and it scares people. (That is
what local and national news ratings are based on.)  It will then be
repeated with the next case when the previous one fails to get the proper
emotional support.

People are easily lead into tirrany when they allow themselves to be lead
by people exploiting their emotions and their hatred of others.
