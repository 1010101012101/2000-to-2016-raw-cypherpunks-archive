Well, although I am willing to agree that a giant corporation does not act 
very responsibly, I have to say that even though I use their email software 
here at home, I've never had a problem that I can detect: I don't even open 
email from folks I don't know, never mind attachments. I also have a 
firewall and a router, neither of which I have truly geek-levels of intimacy 
using.

The tool analogy may be a weak one, though. Imagine a drill that somehow 
pollutes the electical supply so much that the guy next door can't use his 
electronics. Or imagine a car that actually disengages the steering wheel at 
random while driving: it's one thing to affect the driver, but if he's going 
to take me out because of his tool then it's time to get that crap off the 
road. Is that the case with MS? The "Geeks of Consequence" tell me so...
