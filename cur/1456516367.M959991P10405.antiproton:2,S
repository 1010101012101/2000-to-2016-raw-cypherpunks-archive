	Yeah, except, apple claiming "we don't have the key we 
	burned into the phone" isn't too 'plausible' ^-^

	Anyway, the government gets the uid key one way or another and
	then brute force the passcode. Depending on passcode the
	process can take something like 0.000001s or less.

	
	It's technically possible that the passcode itself is a
	'big' ( > 90 bits?) random number or equivalent passphrase.
	But, likely? I doubt it.

	Also, from what I read, people can use their fingerprint as
	passcode? So, all the gov't has to do is look up the fingerprint
	in their archive? (ok, some format conversion required, but I
	suppose they can manage that)

	Yes, they can pretend...  ^-^

	Maybe. So, they don't have the keys, they already gave them to
	their partners in crime at the nsa. 

	It also should be noted that NOTHING that ANY subject of the US
	mafia/government says can be 'trusted'. Any one of these
	subjects may be under a 'secret order' 'gag order' 'liberty
	order' or whatever the correct newspeak term is.
