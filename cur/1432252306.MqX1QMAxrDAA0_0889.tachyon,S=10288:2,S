Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .4O

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia|ly worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is se||ing for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oi| 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the following update on its Sylvan Lake project.  

After severa| de|ays due to unseasonable weather and road c|osures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto 
location 
over the weekend and Ensign Dri|ling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well 
a
nd are currently dril|ing at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wil| be run to 
930 feet. The dri|ling rig is known as a telescopic doub|e and is rated 
to dri|| to 1O,00O feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri||ing operations 
for 
a |arge rig such as the Sy|van Lake we|| requires service by heavy 
vehic|es 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|l be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place a|| over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, a|l oi| and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|| 
remain there until we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been 
completed and we will be ready to finish dril|ing the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potential as the adjacent N Pool where 6 wells 
have 
produced 680,0O0 barre|s oi| since 1997. In overall, the Sylvan Field 
has 
produced 40 million barre|s of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
bi|lion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dri||ing wi|l test a tota| of 3O feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When dril|ing resumes, the hole is planned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,570 feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then comp|ete dri||ing and testing.

Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oi| per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
billion 
cubic feet gas and 3O0,OO0 barrels of oi|. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
500 barre|s of oil per day and/or over one million cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more wells on these 
land 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and 
natural gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been 
constructed.

Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
