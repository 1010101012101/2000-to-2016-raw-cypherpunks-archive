I'm not sure what you think the requirements for "efficient offline
ecash" are, but I should note that the double-blinded version of lucre
doesn't require the ZKP, and there's also a non-interactive variant of
the ZKP for the single-blinded variant. They are both described in the
current version of the paper (at least, I'm sure the first as, and
somewhat sure the second is).

Cheers,

Ben.
