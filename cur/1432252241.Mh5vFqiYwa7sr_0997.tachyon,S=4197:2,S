Both more apparent and more physically difficult.

:-)  Only modern sealing waxes don't melt, adhere extremely well,
and make tampering evident.  They also mean the Adversary
has to spend a lot more time... maybe more than one visit.

You seem to think I thought the epoxy would be used like a seal,
with the signet ring and all, visually verified when you sit down.
That's too lame, any hobbyist whose good with casting can dupe it.
I just meant that if Scarfo had epoxied his keyboard to his chassis
properly, (and epoxied the keyboard, etc.) he might still be free
(to pick shitty passphrases, it turned out).

And some "sealing waxes" such as those used on nuclear weapons
and verification devices, are very difficult to duplicate.  Given, they
require special equipment to read.  (Fine reflector particles dispersed
in clear epoxies)

Or, as has been discussed here before, if Nico did his crypto work on
a handheld that stayed with him.  (An epoxy-sealed one, of course.)
Your suggestions re USB, PCMCIA, etc. are in the same line.
Better, because they're smaller.  However, I don't know of a card that
you can
*shower* with, which is frankly what's required.  It can't ever leave
you.  A keychain fob is not good enough.  Even a finger ring gets
removed
sometimes.

Yes, but Scarfo's DirOpSec should have been able to convince him
that at the hourly rate the Company pays him, he should put up with
it :-)  He can surf for porn on a different machine.  As long as he
knows to use different passwords there...

I like the dual use of keeping a security-sensitive PC in a gun safe
which also keeps the guns dry :-)   You could have the door opening
silence
the PC, too.  A nice lead lining will keep the black bag x-ray team
(they'll borrow a unit from the bomb squad) from seeing much.

"The ultimate in paranoia is not when everyone is against you
but when everything is against you."  PKD

(and quite apropos here)
