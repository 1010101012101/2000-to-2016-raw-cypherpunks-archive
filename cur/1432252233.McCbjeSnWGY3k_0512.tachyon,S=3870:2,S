Yeah, no shit.  Think how much trouble they'd be in if they turned around
and said this:

"Pshaw, we ain't gonna support the Feds trying to catch rag head
terrorists, drug dealers, kiddy porners, and other bad guys.  Yeah, our
virus detector will stop them Feebs from doing their job..."  uh huh....

If there is interest in getting a detector for this magic lantern shit,
it's a very easy thing to do.  You set up an account with one of the ISP's
that you know has bent over using an Arab sounding name, install a shitty
OS like Windows, and start posting PGP encrypted messages with hotmail
accounts with other Arab sounding names...
