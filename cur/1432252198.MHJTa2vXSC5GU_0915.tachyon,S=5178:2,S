There is a way of keeping informed that is disturbed by HTML (and 
sometimes by top posting). Firstly, HTML-forums with threads are out of 
the question because it takes way too much time to find out if something 
of interest has been posted. You can't rely on thread subjects for that. 
The old mail-list format is much more reliable if you don't want to miss 
anything.

Also, if you don't want to miss anything, you are probably subscribing 
to the cypherpunks, cryptography@randombits, cryptography@metzdowd and 
cryptopolitics (low volume at the moment) lists, often receiving a 
hundred postings every day, or more. Including doubles and triples 
reposted by Eugene Leitl. To scan these postings with the 
quick-browse/delete-method (3-4 posts a second) is significantly, 
irritatingly slower if you have to wait for the fractions of a second 
that the HTML needs to load.
