Peter, what would be wrong with having a machine in the booth that
prints
any valid receipt BUT is not connected to the voting system.  "To vote
use the red machine; if you're being coerced you can use the blue
machine
to print as many receipts as intimidators."

A trade off between (mild) user complexity and the desire for receipts
(without coercion).
