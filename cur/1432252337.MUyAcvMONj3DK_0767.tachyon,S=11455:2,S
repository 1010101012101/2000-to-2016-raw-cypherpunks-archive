I'm failing to understand what it so new about "specifismo." I've been 
arguing for a strategy like this for many years, as have many anarchists. It 
sounds like something related to "practical anarchism" and "ecumenical 
anarchism" which have been focuses of my work for many years. I think the 
anarchist emphasis on practical daily struggles, creating counter 
institutions, and long term resistance to the state and capitalism, is what 
sets anarchism apart from vanguardist socialism.

If Albert and other leftists are finally accepting anarchist ideas and 
methodology, that sounds good to me.
