Any informed speculations why there is so much apparent leverage?
Is there blackmail, or a global conspiracy? I don't get it, but then,
I'm a naif. Please clue me in.

Subject: FYI: New US/EU passenger name records treaty leaked

Dave,

The new passenger name record  agreement between the US and the EU has
been leaked. The draft treaty text looks ready for a closing. A foreign
office spokesperson here in Vienna confirmed that, so this should be
more or less identical to the final version.

The letter from the EU presidency to COREPER dated june 28 includes the
draft agreement on PNR plus the US position in ANNEX2.

Full text [English]

Analysis of the new treaty in German [from today]
http://futurezone.orf.at/it/stories/204742/

The gist: The new "push" system demands even more data from EU passenger
databases. What Mr. Frattini told the public about "reduction" is a
blatant swindle: more has been packed into the 19 points of the new PNR
agreement than the previously equired 34 datafields contained.

The withdrawal of the US from the Amadeus pnr data base comes at a dear
price to the Europeans: They have to deliver more and better
pre-structured data, fitting to the technical requirements of the DHS.
So data mining will much easier for DHS, as correct data extraction is
the first critical step to get the results desired.

Credits go to Tony Bunyan from statewatch.org who dug out that draft
agreement.

Erich
