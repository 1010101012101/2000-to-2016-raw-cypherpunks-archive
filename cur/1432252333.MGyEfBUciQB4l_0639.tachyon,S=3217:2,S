One cannot scratch one's bum without fear of being sued 
for patent infringment.  The wheel, and a common story
line in novels, were recently patented.Why should strong
passwrod protocols be different?

But in practice, patent claims are seldom resolved in 
court.

It seems to me that this is more a matter of normal 
deployment delays, than widespread fear of patents.

With early deployments, it is far from clear whether 
those paying are paying for patent  licenses, or paying 
for sofware and expertise.

Over time, in any given software technology, the cost of 
software and expertise tends to fall, eventually to near 
zero.  At that point, it then becomes apparent how 
seriously people take any patent claims.
