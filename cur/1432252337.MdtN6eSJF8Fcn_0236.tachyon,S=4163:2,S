If it's not meant to be a high-performance server, then slowing it down
another 20% by doing RSA timing things is probably fine for most uses,
and either using compiler flags or (better) friendlier options of some sort
to turn off the timing resistance is probably the better choice.

I'm not sure how flexible things need to be - real applications of the
openssl code include non-server things like certificate generation,
and probably some reasonable fraction of the RSA or DH calculations
don't need to be timing-protected, but many of them are also things
that aren't CPU-consumption-critical either.
