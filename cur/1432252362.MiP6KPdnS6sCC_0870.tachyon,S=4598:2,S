Exactly! It is what the whole point of Open Source software is supposed to
be about. Give the technology away and sell the brains on how to use it to
solve somebody elses problem who doesn't have the drive/self-confidence/
whatever to do it themselves.

One of the great missed opportunity of most Open Source development is to
re-sell -specific versions- in a closed source model to individual buyers
to fulfill -local- goals. More Open Source licenses should have a clause
that states that if you want to use this software in a closed license
model please contact the author for special pricing".

It continues to amaze me the way many believe that because the software is
'free' the access and utilization of those who know how to apply it
should also be free. Ignorance of market dynamics; pure, plain, and
simple.
