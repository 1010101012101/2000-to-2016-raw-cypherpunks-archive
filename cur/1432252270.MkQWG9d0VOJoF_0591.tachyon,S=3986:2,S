How can I prove Churchill did not say this?  The problem is the curious 
absence of evidence that he did say it.

The words sound more Chomskian than Churchillian.  As with so many 
remarkably Chomsy sounding quotes the source is so vague that failure to 
find it can never be held as proof that Chomsky made it up.

If Churchill really said such a thing, we would have some source better 
than Chomsky for it, and if Churchill really did say it, Chomsky would have 
given us a source that was possible to verify.
