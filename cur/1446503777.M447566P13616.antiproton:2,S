What do you mean? Seriously! Millions of civilians a year? What???

WW1 totalled       < 260k
WW2 totalled       < 55000k (including famine and disease related)
Afghan war totals < 3k (including anti-US casualties)

Or, more completely,
"In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths down from 72,000 deaths in 1990."
from wikipedia, after
http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(14)61682-2.pdf
(thanks Bill)

Industrial casualties are (usually..) actively minimized, and are doubtless
lower per product produced than they were in whatever method came before.
In the US in 2014 there were 4679 workers killed in total (according to OSH=
A
<https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html>), but obviously that
number will be better than in less developed nations. Not seeing your point=
.

The Ghenghis Khan comment is like.. what? The Mongol conquest killed over
40 million according to wiki!

I might write to /dev/null instead if this is all the response I get..
