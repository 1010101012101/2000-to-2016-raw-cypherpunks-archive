Surely they don't intend to outlaw using the words at all. Even 
outlawing the use of specific words in specific contexts would probably 
be difficult to enforce as a practical matter. The only way I can forsee 
this being used is as an enhancment charge like when a person is 
sometimes charged with carrying a gun during commision of a felony even 
if it's not displayed or used.
