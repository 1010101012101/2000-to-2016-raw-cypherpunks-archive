	Wrong. 

	Did you even bother to skim the text I linked to?

	There's no 'regulation' in a free market. Your question shows
	that you don't what a free market is.

	Better offer of what? A free market isn't defined by outcomes.

	LMAO! Sure. Competition leads to monopoly and 'free' actually
	means regulated.

	It's quite clear that you don't have a clue rysiek. FIRST you
	do your research about liberalism and THEN you try to come up
	with something that at least looks like criticism.

	I wasn't vague at all. Check the literature I linked.

	But you're right about something. I don't want to waste time
	with people who only have knee-jerk reactions and dismiss 
	something they don't even know what it is.

	We've been clear all the time. I know that you don't have a
	clue and only parrot establishment propaganda.

	Drop the bluffing rysiek. I know that you don't know
	what you're talking about.
