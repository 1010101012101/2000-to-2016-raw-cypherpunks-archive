Some of the world's most elegant hotels and resort spas, from the Sheraton =
in San Francisco to the Sonesta Beach Hotel in Curacao to the Renaissance W=
ailea in Maui, have pleased guests for years with the ergonomically designe=
d <a href=3D"http://r.mb00.net/s/c?1dx.2p6x.2.hyb.fsi52"><b>Oxygenics Sh=
ower Head</b></a>.
<P>
Health and beauty experts praise this showerhead for its health-enhancing q=
ualities:
<ul>
<font color=3D"#3366CC"><b>
<li>Revitalizes the Skin=20
<li>Rejuvenates Skin Cells=20
<li>Retards the Effects of Aging=20
<li>Prevents Skin Damage
</b></font>
</ul>

Using the same principle as a jet engine, this showerhead continually sucks=
 in fresh air and infuses it into the water creating a powerful Oxygenating=
 spray of revitalizing oxygen enriched water. The moment you turn it on you=
 realize this is like no other showerhead you=92ve ever experienced. It inc=
reases the water's oxygen content up to ten times, helping to purify your s=
hower water, and leaving your skin and hair cleaner than ever before.
<P>

ow, giving you the greatest showering sensation ever achieved with the adde=

e half the hot water and water heating cost wasted by your old shower head.=
 In fact, the Oxygenics Shower Head will quickly pay for itself in savings =
on your utility bills. That's guaranteed!
<P>
The Oxygenics Skin Care Shower is guaranteed never to clog or fail. It uses=
 fluid technology, and is backed by a lifetime performance guarantee. Inclu=
des teflon tape for non-leaking installations.
