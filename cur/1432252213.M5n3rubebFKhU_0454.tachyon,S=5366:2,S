Yes, perhaps it was inevitable anyway. Consider the fact that the browser is 
set to swallow the PC Google-style anyway, maybe the PC will be relegated to 
a souped-up entertainment device. Waitaminute: It already is, in the form of 
the X-Box. Maybe that's also why Gates backed out when he did: He knows the 
era of the PC as we knew it is drawing to a close...Microsoft will become a 
media company, making game & movie consoles along with some of the software 
that runs on it.

The PC as we know it will evaporate, and in its place will come a variety of 
different devices, running a variety of OSs. In fact, 5 years from now most 
computer-owners won't even know what OS their machine is running, or at best 
if you ask them they'll answer: "Uh, I think it's Firefox."

The leaves an interesting question: Does a networked computer even NEED an 
OS? With a nice big, fat pipe it might suffice for it to have the BIOS & 
Firmware, and then boot a TCP/IP stack to go get the OS.

>"Windows Vista includes an extensive reworking of core OS elements in
