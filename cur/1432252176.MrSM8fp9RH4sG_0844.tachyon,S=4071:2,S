It's my pah-ty, I can whine if I want to. BTW, how does pointing
out an issue, not qualify as fixing the problem at hand? Hmmm?

I know. The point, which you missed, was RAH sending a shortened URL.
If RAH wants to send URLs like that, he can. But he damages his own
cypherpunk street cred, with each shortened URL. Because with that
shorty URL, he makes you and me engage in labor we should not have
to engage in, if only he had sent the real (target) URL instead.

The question we need to be asking ourselves, why on earth did RAH
go to the extra effort of creating that short URL in the first
place? He's a veteran of this list, what is his angle? Or the angle
of whatever it is that has its whole arm up his ass, if he really
can't defend himself. Which he hasn't, yet. Tim May can't be blamed
for short URLs.

Do you get it now?

Even then, bit.ly or shor.ty or as.sy are not guaranteed to be
available in 1, 5, 10 years. Example? Shurl.com and yes, it did
used to exist: http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://Shurl.com

Can you hear me now/yet? WOULD IT HELP IF I SHOUTED?

> Does that count as "clicking"? Am I not a tr00 cypherpunk anymore?

Yes, no, and you lose. His shorty URL caused you to engage in labor
you should not have had to engage in - and you were probably exposed
to ads - or links to ads, as a result.

When will strong encryption be baked into email clients, so that
discussions like this are not necessary anymore?

And, your demimed email client sucks too.
