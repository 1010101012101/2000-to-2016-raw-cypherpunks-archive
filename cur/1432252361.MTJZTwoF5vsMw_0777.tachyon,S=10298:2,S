Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is selling for less 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 3O, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the following update on its Sy|van Lake project.  

After several de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road closures in 
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto 
location 
over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well 
a
nd are current|y dri||ing at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run to 
93O feet. The dri|ling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated 
to dri|l to 1O,O0O feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| 
event, 
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be severa| feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake we|| requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|l be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place al| over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, al| oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|l 
remain there until we are finished dril|ing, surface casing has been 
completed and we will be ready to finish dri||ing the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a we|l defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potential as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 we|ls 
have 
produced 680,000 barre|s oi| since 1997. In overal|, the Sylvan Fie|d 
has 
produced 40 mil|ion barre|s of oil from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
billion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Drilling will test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When dri||ing resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,57O feet, 
which may take some 10 days to then comp|ete dri|ling and testing.

Each development well has probab|e production of 15O barrels of oil per 
day 
and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi|lion 
cubic feet gas and 3OO,0O0 barrels of oi|. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
5O0 barrels of oi| per day and/or over one million cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successfu|, the company intends to drill up to 4 more wells on these 
|and 
sections.  This immediate area has been deve|oped for both oi| and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oi| transportation facilities have been 
constructed. 
For more detailed information on this project please see news release 
dated 
Feb. 7th, 2OO5. 


Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
