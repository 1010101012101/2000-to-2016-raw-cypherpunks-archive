on the topic of Bitcoin philosophical musings and pressures:

There unusually a lot of btc discussion on the list lately: technical (the
fork), philosophical and practical.

On the philosophical/political side: btc is great, I like it, I use it,
but, come on, we all know that by design (increasing difficulty of the
chain and proof-of-work system) btc is determined to be a space race.
Before you can maintain the network with simple hardware, and get btc for
it, now you have to be a mining rig. We know that btc is good for P2P
financial transactions, but the first important question now is:
How do you earn bitcoin? (as an individual, you can't mine, if you are not
a programmer or a designer, how do you earn btc?)
It becomes less and less of a question how do you spend btc, but still,
unless I mined a lot in the past or bought it for cash, where do I get it?

Secondly, the rhetoric we hear often in the mainstream btc discussion is
"it is a solution for banking the Unbanked" This talk is obviously dodgy -
lets say "the unbanked wants to be banked" if you have an account with
nothing in it, and no way of filling it in, there is no point.
The only good thing about btc walled vs bank account when its empty is that
there is no one is proposing you to get an overdraft or a loan. But still,
empty btc wallet is pretty useless.

Rather decent response to poitical btc frenzy I found in this post -
https://blog.caseykuhlman.com/entries/2014/bitcoin-somaliland.html?utm_sour=
ce=3Dfeedburner&utm_medium=3D%24feed&utm_campaign=3DFeed%3A+underWater+dese=
rt+Blogging

Another mainstream talk is: its not about bitcooin, it is all about
blockchain technology. Thats correct, it can be useful for some stuff. But
what drives me up the walll is a hype around it mixed with vagueness. "We
can build all this amazing socio-technical systems with it" and very
rarely, amongst general public (not blockchain devs) you come across
concrete ideas of a design. What exactly does this weird data structure
does in a very specific social context? What are exact detailed functions
it has, how does it integrates with other layers - software and hardware.
So the talk "some devs will write cryptographically verifiable scripts for
us which interact on the blockchain and it will give the world some cool
ways of interaction" is just dangerous. Similar rhetoric brought humanity
things such as Facebook.
The only thing which i consider right in the blockchain discussion that
"ok, it allows adding some features to a system that can be useful in some
particular cases"

On the technical side: fork, xt-code etc - I would like to organise and
stream a panel discussion on WCN <http://www.worldcryptonetwork.com/>
channel soon-ish. I dont want to turn cypherpunk list into a Bitcoin Talk
:) but will ping a link here and the time we will schedule it.

<br>
&gt; Then again maybe I am missing the key reasoning for this fork.<br>
<br>
People often miss the fundamental reasons Bitcoin exists,<br>
the various conjoined ethos behind its creation. This is to be<br>
expected, it&#39;s so far ouside any thinking or life process they&#39;ve<b=
r>
ever had to do or been exposed to. It&#39;s also partly why figuring<br>
out what to do or code or adopt, is hard. And certainly not made<br>
any easier by the long term need and the current value at stake.<br>
<br>
Creating a system in which a Botswanan can give a few bits<br>
of their impoverished wages to their friend in Mumbai without<br>
it being gated, permitted, hierarchied, middlemanned, taxed,<br>
tracked, stolen and feed-upon until pointless... this simply<br>
doesn&#39;t compute for these people. Their school of thought is<br>
centralization, profit, control and oppression. So of course they<br>
see txrate ramming up against an artificial wall as perfectly fine,<br>
it enables and perpetuates their legacy ways.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whichever technical way the various walls are torn down,<br>
what&#39;s important is that they are. And that those who are thinking<br>
outside the box do, and continue to, take time to school these<br>
legacy people such that they might someday become enlightened<br>
and join the ethos.<br>
<br>
Otherwise might as well work for ICBC, JPMC, HSBC, BNP, MUFG<br>
and your favorite government. Probably not as much fun though.<br>

&gt; Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information=

&gt;<br>
&gt; Abstract:<br>
&gt; This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the<br>
&gt; networked sphere, =E2=80=98surveillance capitalism,=E2=80=99 and consi=
ders its<br>
&gt; implications for =E2=80=98information civilization.=E2=80=99 Google is=
 to surveillance<br>
&gt; capitalism what General Motors was to managerial capitalism. Therefore=
<br>
&gt; the institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google=
<br>
&gt; Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in<br=
>
&gt; two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated<br>
&gt; transactions: =E2=80=98data extraction and analysis,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=
=98new contractual forms<br>
&gt; due to better monitoring,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98personalization and custom=
ization,=E2=80=99 and<br>
&gt; =E2=80=98continuous experiments.=E2=80=99<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds<br>
&gt; light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global<=
br>
&gt; architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This<br>
&gt; architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new<br>
&gt; expression of power that I christen: =E2=80=98Big Other.=E2=80=99 It i=
s constituted by<br>
&gt; unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction,<br>
&gt; commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their=
<br>
&gt; own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and<=
br>
&gt; modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and<=
br>
&gt; departs in key ways from the centuries long evolution of market<br>
&gt; capitalism.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Really? What rich person has gotten richer through Bitcoin so far?<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 It seems kinda obvious that virtually all bitco=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 and users *in the west* are richer than people =

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 India.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 That&#39;s what I was getting at. Bitcoin devs=
=C2=A0 - *already<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 rich by &#39;third world&#39; standards* - are =
richer now. Millionaires<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 even (notice that grarpamp was talking about im=

<br>

<br>
&gt; Remittances seem like the biggest use of Bitcoin at the moment. Sure,<=

&gt; there&#39;s plenty of speculation, but your claim that Bitcoin&#39;s p=
urpose<br>
&gt; is to make the rich richer is also speculation. And FUD.<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 So what amount of btc is being used to make pay=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Botswana and Mumbai?<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Bitcoin hasn&#39;t led to any me=
aningful political/economic<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0change yet, apart from possibly =
triggering the demise of<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0government cash, which would be =
a complete disaster. Talk<br>
&gt; &gt; about &#39;unintended consequences&#39; (unintended?)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;ve read a single thing written by the peop=
le who<br>
&gt; influenced the creation of Bitcoin if you think that the collapse of<b=
r>
&gt; fiat currencies is an unintended consequence.<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 But I said *cash* not fiat.=C2=A0 And the colla=
pse of relatively<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 untraceable *cash* is *bad*.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 What we may end up with is FIAT currencies and=
=C2=A0 NO CASH<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 option* for those fiat currencies. Bad. Pretty =
bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *aka credit cards.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Any fiat currency that<br>
&gt; is so bad that its users prefer to use Bitcoin deserves to collapse.<b=
r>
&gt; Of course, so far, while Bitcoin has become popular in places like<br>
&gt; Argentina<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Do you know where I live? Of course you don&#39=
;t have to know<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 where I live. But you&#39;ll know it in a secon=
d anyway. I live in<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 argentina - and let me tell you, bitcoin isnt e=
xactly &#39;popular&#39;<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 here.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; and Venezuela, the US dollar remains by far the more<br>
&gt; popular alternative currency in those places.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Yep, that&#39;s quite correct as far as argenti=
na goes. I suspect<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 it&#39;s true regarding venezuela as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; And if Greece exits the<br>
&gt; Euro and starts printing Drachmas there, they will have to worry<br>
&gt; about people trading their Drachmas for Euros, not for Bitcoin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0A likely scenario exists in whic=
h there wouldn&#39;t be any<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0independent crypto-currency. The=
re would be fully<br>
&gt; &gt; &#39;traceable&#39; electronic currencies controlled as always by=
 the state<br>
&gt; &gt; and the banking mafia.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 By what evidence do you estimate that this is a &quot;likely&quo=
t; scenario?<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The evidence is called &#39;history&#39;. That,=
 and the nature of<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 government and its business &#39;partners&#39; =
- or accomplices.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; You may be right that many nation-states and banks will be loathe to<b=
r>
&gt; accept an untraceable and uncontrollable crypto-currency, but that&#39=
;s<br>
&gt; the whole point;<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 You seem to be assuming that an uncontrollable =
and untraceable<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 crypto-currency exist? I&#39;m not seeing anyth=
ing of the sort.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; they&#39;re not going to have a choice. Cryptocurrencies<br>
&gt; don&#39;t have to be legal to be disruptive.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 And yet there seems to be a fair amount of peop=
le in the bitcoin<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;community&#39; who are quite eager (or des=
perate) to have bitcoin<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;regulated&#39; so that it becomes &#39;res=
pectable&#39;, &#39;legal&#39;...and<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 usable.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Of course, this isn&#39;t a shortcoming that on=
ly affects btc.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Anything that the government &#39;outlaws&#39; =
becomes harder to<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 transact.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; The main problem that<br>
&gt; they&#39;ve run up against before now is the lack of healthy undergrou=
nd<br>
&gt; markets to take advantage of them. Given time, governments&#39; and<br=
>
&gt; banks&#39; opinions and policies about cryptocurrencies will become<br=
>
&gt; irrelevant.<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I do wish that was actually the case, but I thi=
nk that view<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 doesn&#39;t fully take into account the capabil=
ities of the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;enemy&#39;.<br>
