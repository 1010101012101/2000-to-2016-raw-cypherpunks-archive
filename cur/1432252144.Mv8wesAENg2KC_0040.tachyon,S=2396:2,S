Yup, and I'd prefer signature batches, I think. You can easily determine whether which signature was used at the time of redemption.

As to the duration of a given tranche, or epoch, or whatever, that would be pre-announced, and probably calculable by the number of signed coins in a given batch, and, yes, you wouldn't have to be absolute in your redemption-expiry policy, particularly if there's still an outstanding balance in an epoch's reserve account. :-).

Cheers,
