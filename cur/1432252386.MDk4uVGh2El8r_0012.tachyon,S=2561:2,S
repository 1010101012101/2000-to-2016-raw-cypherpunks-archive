There are results available on this issue: First, a paper by 
Boneh, Joux, and Nguyen "Why Textbook ElGamal and RSA Encryption 
are Insecure", showing that you can essentially half the number 
of bits in the message, i.e. in this case the symmetric key 
transmitted. 

Second, it turns out that the tricky part is the implementation 
of the decryption side, where the straight-forward way -- ignoring 
the padding with 0s "They are zeroes, aren't they?" -- gives you a 
system that might be attacked in a chosen plaintext scenario very 
efficiently, obtaining the symmetric key. See my paper "Side-Channel 
Attacks on Textbook RSA and ElGamal Encryption" at PKC2003 for 
details.

Hope this answers your question.
