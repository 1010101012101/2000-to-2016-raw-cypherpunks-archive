The $100K is predicated upon access to surplus NASA and aerospace parts
and having in hand the necessary testing facilities. This last one is the
killer. You are aware that the failure last year of the amateur race to
orbit was one of funding in all three cases? You should definitely look
into the cost analysis of those projects.

I'd suggest you contact Reaction Research Society as well,

http://www.rrs.org

$250K? Look into 'OSCAR' and 'can-sat', there's a link on /.
about can-sat currently .

A cell phone repeater with a 100W linear is sufficient. Surplus cell
transceivers are under $100. A PC-104 controller running Plan 9 (or Linux
if you're a conservative). Packet is much cheaper and it's reliable.

The project I've been working on is spun mirror telescope primaries, the
weight savings is incredible over glass. My goal is to put up a PC-104
running packet radio broadcasting one-way a view of the ground directly
'down'. I'm working up up to a larger effort.

If you ever get around to acting upon this please consider me for your
project.
