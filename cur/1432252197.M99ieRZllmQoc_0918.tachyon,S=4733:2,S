LECTURE 30 - POISONOUS AND ALLERGENIC PLANTS 

[...]

2. Saponins (e.g. tomatine in tomato, solanine in potato) 
a. Natural soaps (as in century plants (Agave))- develop bubbles 
    but poke holes in membranes (by aggregating cholesterol)
b. Causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
c. Solanine present in potato (Solanum tuberosum) - most of 
    plant except tubers is poisonous. Tuber contains solanine
    too, but toxic dose is about 100 potatoes. Green potatoes 
    (which turn green after exposure to sunlight) can cause fatal
    poisonings. Green and damaged potatoes are even more toxic.
