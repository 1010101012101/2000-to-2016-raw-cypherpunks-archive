I was one of those people, a decade and a half ago, on the cypherpunks
mailing list.  In fact, as I recall I once discussed with John Gilmore
after a Bay Area Cypherpunks Physical Meeting whether he would pay me to
implement some sort of solution to spam, but we didn't agree on a
strategy.

Coincidentally, I just blogged today about how we are much closer to
this now than we were then, even though none of the smart people that
you were probably thinking of are involved in the new deployments:

WoW-gold, for example, appears to have at least millions of transactions
a day.  Does anyone have more detail about the scale and scope of these
currencies?

Thanks!  I'll read this.
