They do?  Where?  That's funny, I didn't think the dudes who wrote the
Bill o'Rights knew anything about operating systems, much less
computers.  Wow!  So were they time travelers?  Or did they have crystal
balls? (Huh huh, huh huh, he said 'balls'!  Yeah, yeah, that was cool!)

9th and 10th ammendments...  What do they say inChote'?

Amendment IX: The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Amendment X: The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
states respectively, or to the people.
