For various reasons, what little faith I had left in the government has been
whittled down to nill over the past year or so.  And recent events (likely
none of which any of you have heard of) have brought my faith in police to
approximately the same level.

Does this mean, after two years of semi-lurking, I'm on my way to becoming a
cypherpunk?
