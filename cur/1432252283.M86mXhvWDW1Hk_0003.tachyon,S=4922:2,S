I guess statements like these come about when there is a disconnect 
between the brain, the eyes and the fingers who type out these words. I 
suggest you go back and re-read the arguments.

Ah, so now we agree that neither war was justified. So, there you go. 
The end not always justifies the means. As in the case of Iraq which is 
pretty much everybody saying here.

Well, in america instead of being the slave to "the man" (just yet) 
you're the slave to your credit card bills, your employers and all the 
other robber barons you have in the industry, while under Castro you 
are.... Well what? You can't travel to the US? You are not necessarily 
always able to state your political opinions (which sound vaguely 
familiar in the US right now) etc.

Yeah, I see how much freer the US is.

Repeat after me: Freedom is something that is defined differently by 
every human being.
