This is because they are in fear of the people. So they feel the
need to mass surveil them in order to stay on top of potential
issues with their position that could lead to, ultimately, revolt.
Why are they in fear? Because they are doing wrong, if not for their
own individual selves, for the collective power at the top.
Any true servant of the people will have no such fear or need because
no one can point any finger at them... they serve, they do not rule.

You will never, ever, under any circumstance, vote for (in the US)
either of the two parties so long as they continually play into an
effective one party system. You will only vote for other third and
further parties, and rarely choose incumbents among such, unless
they are shown to serve the people. You will not fail to vote such
thirds unless there is no third candidate. A vote for Dem/Rep (in
US) is an obviously wasted vote supporting maintenance of power,
the effective 'one party' system... not servants.

It is exactly right. Only reason media focus wins is because sheep
eyeballs believe and flock to it. It is self reinforcing. Media is
especially guilty of choosing to profiteer from these sheep rather
than pursue real journalism. You must break that bullshit feedback
loop.

Hope and Change... lol.
