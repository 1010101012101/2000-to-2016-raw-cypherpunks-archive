I should've added the obvious, if a bit conspiratorial, point that 
that ABA could conceivably be the ones behind such a lawsuit.

Br'er Rabbit be sayin': "Oh, puh-leese, don't be suin' me over dat ADA shit!"

Anything the American Bar Association loses by being forced to make 
Web materials readable to the blind, the spastic, and the retarded 
would be repaid many times over by increased business to their 
shysters.


(I doubt such a lawsuit is in progress, or could be won. Just a 
talking point, basically.)
