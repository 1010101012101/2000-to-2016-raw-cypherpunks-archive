The world has a long memory; true propaganda, distorting or outright lyin=
g about the actual facts, is going to be quite apparent
later.  It's fine for Russia to be proud of themselves, but it seems like=
 they have been embarrassing themselves frequently.  In the
unlikely event that we elect Trump, we might return the favor for a while=
=2E  But everyone would see through it and know it would stop
in 4 years, so it would likely be more humorous than anything.  The US is=
 too open and too self-examining in public for much false
propaganda to get very far for long.

I'm not sure that American Sniper is propaganda, even unintentionally.  S=
eems mostly like highlighting the sad situations people
have allowed to happen.  Perhaps in the Strongest Tribe sense it has some=
 weight, but snipers are a narrow, special breed.  I would
think that the magical hand of God like drone war would have more weight.=
  The effect depends on what those people are thinking: Do
they realize that they can never win in any serious sense?  Do they care =
or are they fine with just proving a point?

The US almost completely holds back on propaganda / education in the worl=
d, maybe for fear of or a general policy against being seen
to be promulgating propaganda.  In most cases, where media and news and t=
he Internet flow openly, it isn't really needed.  However,
when hardly anyone in Afghanistan knows anything at all about 9/11 or sim=
ilar, that is a failure of the world to provide even basic
knowledge to everyone.  Separate from that, just understanding how a mode=
rn culture works, whether the US or Europe or any other
high-functioning society, would be an important thing for some seriously =
problematic masses of people to know.  I don't care who
causes effective education to bring these people up to date with understa=
nding modern cultures, but it needs to happen.  In the
absence of some other paths, it would seem like an important strategy for=
 both US State and Defense, but I don't see it happening much.

The US has no need to try to make people like it; that should not general=
ly be a goal.  But the world, especially including the
capable Western world, both governments and populations, has a responsibi=
lity to educate those with abject ignorance, poverty, and
knowing nothing but conflict that there are better ways of being, limitle=
ss opportunities, and that they could effectively work to
modernize and become effective societies and cultures.  We need something=
 similar to 'genocide' to identify pathological ignorance,
recognize that it leads to the ruin of many lives, and determine how to t=
ake action to stop it.  There is no need for each culture
to be exactly like the West or a particular form of government, but they =
should understand the options, understand how things can
work effectively and why, and be able to incorporate elements in a local =
way to eventually make it work.  We need to decide how
hands off we should be in allowing large areas to fumble about without ma=
king progress and even regress.  The prime directive should
only apply to societies that are functioning to a reasonable degree.

An interesting question is whether and how poisoned thinking, i.e. bad me=
mes, are shared, instilled, and propagated to eventually
create terrorists and criminals:  What should we do to prevent spreading =
poisonous ideas?  Should we be rooting out bad imams,
literature, religious leaders?  Ideally, our values and culture is an eff=
ective answer to these sources, but, just like in the
biological world, eventually a successful defense will occur.  If you've =
read The Selfish Gene, you know that truth, rightness, or
goodness are not the goals of particular genes or memes (ideas).  The onl=
y thing that determines success is successful competition
and replication.  Our Western ideas can successfully compete and replicat=
e against these bad meme sets, but only if they are
present.  We seem to be in a situation where some of our allies are suppo=
rting the teaching of memes that are directly opposed to
modern knowledge, including social and political knowledge.  What should =
we do about that?

All of this is crosscutting to security, encryption, communication, publi=
shing, and surveillance.  Distrust is healthy, and
sometimes prudent.  And, if we fail totally as a modern society, we may n=
eed it to maintain a modern underground in our new dark
ages.  In addition to safe commerce and social connection, and balancing =
government and keeping it healthy, we should even better
organize and extend the ways that we help enlighten the ignorant while co=
mbating meme cancer.

I imagine that soon we'll have universally available Internet (LEOs for i=
nstance), ultra-inexpensive devices (smart phones are down
to $50 or less now), and organized, complete, and effective educational m=
aterial that is somehow available, safe, and effective for
everyone.  There should be some kind of support systems of various kinds,=
 to the extent possible.  We are failing for not working
toward these kind of things effectively enough.
