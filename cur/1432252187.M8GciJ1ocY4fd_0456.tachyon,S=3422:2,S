I just checked yet again...the 2nd link has Bert cropped.  I
resized my window, so it's not some funky javascript.  They're
not the same image.  The images don't have the same filename.

Maybe this is some sort of artifact, because it seems like
they should be the same article.  The %2c on my Apache server
does map to a comma.

The image filenames on the server are:
http://www.tctubantia.nl/gfx/gfx_nieuw/kranten/TC/artikelvisuals/772741-41140-groot.jpg (no bert)

and

http://www.tctubantia.nl/gfx/gfx_nieuw/kranten/TC/artikelvisuals/772741-40533-groot.jpg  (with bert).  I've reloaded etc., this isn't just a Web
cache artifact.

Thanks, FogStorm for pointing out it's a stealth bomber being
refueled, and not ET.  You gotta admit, it looks like ET, with
air intakes for eyes.
