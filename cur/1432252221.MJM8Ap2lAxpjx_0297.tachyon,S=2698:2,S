Hi All,

The most recent New Yorker has an article called
"Heres Looking at You: Invasion of the drones" by
Nick Paumgarten. I haven't actually read the article yet - online
access is behind a paywall, so I'm going to buy this on the
newsstand. For those of you who are New Yorker subscribers,
here is the link:

http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/14/120514fa_fact_paumgarten

Apparently (based on the article description at the New Yorker
web site that's not behind the paywall),the article does
consider privacy concerns, though I don't know to what depth,
or with what conclusion or point of view.

Thanks,
John
