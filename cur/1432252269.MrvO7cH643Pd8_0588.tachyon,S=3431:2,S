Well, they spent $3 billion on this election, I hear.

A new vote in this county would let them spend another billion or 
two, just for that one county.

You are right that if they order a new election in that county--which 
is not beyond the pale, as the judges are pols--they should order a 
new election in the entire state. And even that would not be "fair," 
of course.

This may actually be the event which accelerates a move to electronic 
voting. Which is not an unmitigated good, despite the high "Wired" 
score it would undoubtedly garner.
