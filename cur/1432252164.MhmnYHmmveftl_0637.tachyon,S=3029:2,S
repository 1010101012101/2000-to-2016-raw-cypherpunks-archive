I see zero evidence that anyone is furious. It's pure political 
theater to appease those few percent of voting cattle that are 
privacy-minded. 

Notice everybody is carefully staying away from mandating simple
and the only measures which would work: strong end to end encryption,
with secrets held by end users, in tamper-proofed compartments.
Because this would seriously compromise their own surveillance
capability. And we certainly can't have that, oh noes.

People in power are used that the common laws are strictly for
the commons, so for those few clueless the outrage to be no
longer exempt might be even genuine.

So ruthlessly machiavellian, or clueless and entitled, pick
your poison.
