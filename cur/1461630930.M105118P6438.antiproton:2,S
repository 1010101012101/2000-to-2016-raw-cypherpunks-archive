Exactly. This one time, about 25 years ago, when the latest "global
warming" media scare started, something just got to me, irritated me,
so I started expressing my 'sincere' concern about global cooling each
time "global warming" was raised - e.g. "actually, they firetrucked
up, it's global cooling that's coming". This one time, someone got
really concerned asking "REALLY?!!" and got all worried about global
cooling as I had an internal chuckle whilst maintaining my austere
frown and nodding sagely.

Then this one time, it all changed to "climate change" and I knew we
contrarians were on to something.

Then this one time, a few years ago, a science major said to me words
which rang loud, "the most abundant times we've been able to ascertain
in the Earth's history are when the carbon dioxide levels were 6 times
what they are now, and so for life on this planet the only thing we
have to worry about in the next few million years is a new ice age".

But hey that's probably all bullshit since the TV tells us we're about
to die and the solution is carbon tax.
