Right now, attempts to control the internet lean on ISP's and 
backbone sites pretty heavily.  Most of the nodes on the internet 
have exactly ONE route to the internet, and if you can get to 
somebody's upstream, she's toast. 

In the long run, I don't think the machinery of freedom is going 
to work very well until most of the nodes on the internet have 
at least three or four different routes to the internet.  

One person connected to one ISP is easy to monitor, easy to 
interfere with.  But if a dozen people connected to a dozen ISP's 
are also all connected to each other directly, then each and 
every one of them becomes much harder to interfere with. 

Unfortunately, extra phone lines and nailed-up connections 
cost money, and at that point they'd just start going for the 
phone companies instead of the ISP's anyway.  The benefit is 
that  common carrier anti-censorship laws might be a little 
stronger with phone lines.
