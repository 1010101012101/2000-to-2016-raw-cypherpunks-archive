Actually the term of art is "NETWAR", one word, first used by John Arquilla
and David Ronfeldt in their essay, "Cyberwar is Coming!" available at
www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR880/MR880.ch2.pdf .

So what is netwar?

"Netwar is an emerging mode of conflict in which the protagonists--ranging from
terrorist and criminal organizations on the dark side, to militant social
activists on the bright side--use network forms of organization, doctrine,
strategy, and technology attuned to the information age. The practice of netwar
is well ahead of theory, as both civil and uncivil society actors are
increasingly engaging in this new way of fighting. We suggest how the theory of
netwar may be improved by drawing on academic perspectives on networks,
especially those about organizational network analysis. As for practice,
strategists and policymakers in Washington and elsewhere have begun to discern
the dark side of the network phenomenon--especially in the wake of the "attack
on America" perpetrated apparently by Osama bin Laden's terror network. But
they still have much work to do to begin harnessing the bright side, by
formulating strategies that will enable state and civil-society actors to work
together better."
