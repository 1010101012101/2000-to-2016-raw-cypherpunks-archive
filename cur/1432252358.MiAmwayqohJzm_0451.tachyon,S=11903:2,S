Juan,

I totally agree with you - I think its also important to note that there
are some other things nefariously invented by the US military that you
should investigate:
Duct Tape
The Internet

You may find an incomplete list here:
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_invention

Please let me know when your research on things I shouldn't use is
complete. Please ensure that your arguments are half baked and
sensationalist... actually I'm not worried. You've got this!

In other news:
It's good that you researched who originally created the technology. The
motivations behind that and individuals involved are important pieces.
Where the money comes from certainly is important. As well as picking up on
the projects governance. This should make you wary of the Tor project - and
prompt additional research.
Should your technical or cultural research raise anything alarming - let
someone know.

This list is comprised of a good many intelligent and wary people who have
carried out the same research - it has informed their use of the tool but
so far not caused any wholesale abandonment.

Travis
