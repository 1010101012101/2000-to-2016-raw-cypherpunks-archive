Ok Choate, what do you think happened in the 5 minutes between your post and
mine?
    Do you think that perhaps you missed the article in it's new location
(i.e.- removed from the front page & placed in the archived news list, as it
was yesterday's headline, which - and I'm throwing a hint here - is
procedure before putting up the new front page stories) or do you think it's
a bit of random luck that in the 2 minutes between your post and my search
for the article (mind you this is 6-7 hours after the Mirror put up the
daily news site & most of the web-staff are probably out of the office for
lunch - if not out till the next morning) they changed the site and put the
article back up?
    Think hard & please be really specific, especially if you think that
your post had anything to do with the Mirror "putting it back up".
