This is actually a phenomenal result.  If one makes a large enough apparatus
so that the cavity is very, very large with a correspondingly small port is
drilled, you've then got the makings of a great beam weapon.

However, aiming a multi-cubic parsec block of metal may limit effectiveness
somewhat.
