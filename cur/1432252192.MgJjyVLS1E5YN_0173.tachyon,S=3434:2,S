Declan,

The larger problem notwithstanding there's at least one little bit of
language in this piece that is odd :

  "He said the government is 
   seeking all of Leggett's 
   material, including all 
   originals and copies."

Even if we make the extreme assumption that there is some pressing and
justifiable need for federal prosecutors to have access to her materials
how do you explain the need to possess "all originals and copies?" It
doesn't make sense. Why should she not be allowed to keep a copy of her
work? How does the existence of an uncontrolled copy lower the value of
the original in the case of a recording? Or in the case of her own notes
why would a copy not suffice.

Looks like a reporter ( or anyone else for that matter ) should keep
well hidden backups of their notes and work so that they can comply with
Napolean complexes, fishing expeditions and spin control operations and
not lose their life's work.

Mike
