Generic identifier of specific individuals who have distinguished 
themselves by performing specific behaviors, "as fucked up as a 
football bat" would be similar to the informational content of "cunt"
as I used it, note that I used "prick" and "cunt" in reference to
males (yourself and Choate) in similar contexts.

That didn't stop you from decrying my lack of "socialization," then
scant days later when you called Choate a "pompous ass" it struck me 
that you are not a bona fide pc-ist, you are just a hypocrite.

>and b) your use PC accusation makes sense ONLY if

I disagree - it wasn't a general reference to women, it was a general
reference to a specific person who happened to be a woman, I suggested
you call Choate a "dumb cunt" too.

>You cannot have it both ways.

I don't think I am having it both ways, but in any event I won't play 
this game with you any longer.
