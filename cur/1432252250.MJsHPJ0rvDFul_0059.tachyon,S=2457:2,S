True nuff.  I recently fired up M$ FS '98, and on my first attempt was
able to Atta the WTC in a 747-300, whereas a more nimble plane
was too responsive to my commands and stalled, spiralled, etc.

And I could cycle my 7.52x54R bolt-action in under a second on my
first try, but again, grace under pressure is cool.
