China is pulling away from buying the debt of the US and hence pulling away
from the dollar as its backed exchange rate ... meaning when a country
holds in its banks enough US currency so that it can exchange the currency
easily it is backing its money w the US dollar BECAUSE it cant then go to
the US and say ok give me chinese yen ... it just has to hold the dollar in
its system and therefor ownes the debt
Presently the chinese see the futility of the system and are shifting i
cant remember into what exactly ... will dig that up when i get a minute
but they dont want to be basing econ on debt papers anymore

The ever fucker nixon ... with dick cheney in his cabinet took the dollar
off the gold standard and kind of fucked the world ... didnt warn anyone or
nothin just did it

In india the government just ask the people to loan their banks personal
items of gold ... people buy it here as a personal investment like real
estate such a contrary notion than the US
