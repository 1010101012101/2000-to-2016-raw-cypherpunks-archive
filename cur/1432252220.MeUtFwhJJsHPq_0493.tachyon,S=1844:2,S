BERLIN  In the first case of its kind in Germany, a right-wing rock
band was deemed a criminal organization and its lead singer was
sentenced Monday to more than three years in prison for lyrics that
venerate Nazism and incite racial hatred.

A Berlin criminal court sentenced 38-year-old Michael Regener to 40
months in prison after a six-month trial that tested the boundaries of
free expression in a nation with strict laws against hate speech.
