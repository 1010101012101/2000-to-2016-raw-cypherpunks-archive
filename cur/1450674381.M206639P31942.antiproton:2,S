Just call it "TheCthulhu Archive," or something other than Cryptome, 
then good to go.

Make many archives, many are being made, many more needed. All start by
and are sustained by thieving, like Wayback's, Google's, WikiLeak's, 
Snowden's,
Manning's, CIA's, NSA's, In-Q-Tel's, LoC's, Cryptome's.

Mirrors, torrents, copies, siphoning, are tampering, rip-offs, fake 
goods. A long
tradition of that banditry. Note the offerings of this list, most of 
the Internet, all
of education, religion, law, the media.

"Respected repository of information," oh my, what a false honor presaging
a spit in eye. A dual hat locution worthy of ever-duplicitous cryptology.

Claims of authenticity, anonymity, updates, are pickpocketing, shysterism,
verily spy trade, inevitable tampering, cheating, deceiving.
