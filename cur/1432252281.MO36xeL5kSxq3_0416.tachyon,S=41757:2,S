***IPO QUESTION OF THE WEEK***
----------------------------------------

QUESTION: What is a “reload provision”?

ANSWER: A reload provision is a feature in an option plan (or option
agreement) that allows companies to issue new option grants to
option-holding employees in exchange for retiring their former grants.
The new exercise price is usually pegged to the current market price.

“The number of reload shares granted is equal to the number of shares
delivered to exercise the option plus, in some cases, any shares
withheld for tax withholding obligations,” says Bruce Brumberg,
editor-in-chief of MyStockOptions.com. “The option generally expires on
the same date that the original option would have.”

----------------------------------------
***IPO COLUMN OF THE WEEK***
----------------------------------------
IPO Market Returning to Normal?

IPOs have stopped going down.

After months of battering, new equity offerings have shown faint signs
of life in March. Six of the seven IPOs that began trading this month
finished their first day in the black. Rather than soaring tenfold, as
hot issues were doing a year earlier, they finished ahead modestly –
mostly in line with the traditional norm of leaving 10% or so on the
table for aftermarket investors.

“Only the cream of the crop are getting through the IPO window, and they
are performing more as they did historically, delivering reasonable
returns,” says Clint Morrison, head of equity research for Miller
Johnson Steichen Kinnard, an investment bank in Minneapolis.

The most successful launch was AFC Enterprises (AFCE), the No. 2
operator of fast-food chicken restaurants, such as Church’s and
Popeye’s. Priced at $17, it finished its first trading day, March 2, at
$20.38 – a gain of 19.9%. At press time the shares were trading around
$18.75, up 10.3% from the IPO price.
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/company.asp?company=5222

The most highly touted deal of March, Loudcloud Inc. (LDCL), finished
its first day of trading, March 9, at $6.16 – some 16 cents, or 0.4%,
ahead of the IPO price. It subsequently slipped to $5.50, 8.3% below the
initial price. Loudcloud’s chairman is Marc Andreessen, formerly of
Netscape.
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/company.asp?company=5036

Stelmar Shipping (SJH) found favor in the aftermarket, and has preserved
it since its March 8 debut. Priced at $12, the shares finished their
first day at $12.80 and were trading at press time at $13.20, a gain of
precisely 10.0%.
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/company.asp?company=5280

The month’s sole loser was SureBeam Corp. (SURE), a maker of electronic
pasteurization equipment for the food industry. Launched March 16 at
$10, the shares closed their first day down 14.1% at $8.59. They have
since recovered, but only to $9.25.
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/company.asp?company=4912

In its registration statement with the SEC, SureBeam reported a pro
forma loss of $330,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2000, on
revenue of $9.3 million. Losses, says Morrison, are not something IPO
investors will tolerate these days.

“What we’re hearing from our customers is, they’re not interested;
everything else is on sale, so they’ll buy the stuff they already own,”
he says. “To get them interested, it’s got to be very compelling, which
means there’s got to be immediate visibility in earnings and growth. It
doesn’t necessarily have to be a low-risk deal, but there’s got to be a
level of comfort with the story.”

***COMPANY PROFILE***
----------------------------------------
Agere Systems (AGR) $6 Price Called Bargain

The scaled-down IPO of Lucent Technologies (LU) spin-off Agere Systems
was priced Tuesday at a rock-bottom $6 a share, leading at least one
major Wall Street firm to recommend buying the shares aggressively.

Agere, which begins trading today on the New York Stock Exchange with
the ticker AGR, is a world-leading maker of communications
semiconductors, but investment bankers struggled for months to close the
deal. It will fetch only $3.6 billion, far less than the $6.5 billion
Lucent originally sought.

Sanford C. Bernstein analysts Paul Sagawa and Matthew Nagle speculated
in a research report Friday that Lucent would “likely pull” the
offering, but wrote that if it didn’t, “We would be aggressive buyers.”

Debt-burdened Lucent is transferring $2.5 billion of debt to Agere in
the deal, and could retire more if a 90 million share Green Shoe is
exercised by the underwriters, which are led by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. 

Only hours before the pricing, IPO followers were skeptical the deal
would be done. “There’s a lot of doubt that that one will make to the
Street,” Clint Morrison, head of equity research for Miller Johnson
Steichen Kinnard in Minneapolis, said early Tuesday afternoon.

Agere’s IPO was filed in December, but nearly every passing week has
seen the market for technology stocks decline and, with it, interest in
this deal ebb. In February Agere set a price range of $15 to $20 for
370.3 million shares. Later that month it slashed the range to $12 to
$14 and boosted the number of shares to 500 million. Last week it
dropped the price to the current range, and increased the number of
shares to 600 million.
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/company.asp?company=5197

The Bernstein analysts say a $12 price for the offering would still be a
discount to rivals such as JDS Uniphase (JDSU) and Infineon Technologies
(IFX). “We believe the reduced price range is the product of poor market
conditions, negative LU sentiment and the sense of desperation to get
the deal done,” they wrote in a March 23 research call.

If the deal got the green light, however, the Bernstein analysts urged
clients to snap it up. “In the ($6 to $7) price range, Agere would trade
at 2.1 times calendar year 2000 sales of $5.1 billion – a 36% and 75%
discount to comparables IFX and JDSU, respectively,” the wrote. “Already
a strong business with leading products and attractive margins, we
believe Agere will experience strong synergies as an independent
company. LU’s competitors will be more inclined to purchase components
from an independent Agere.”

Allentown, PA-based Agere manufacturers communications semiconductors,
including optoelectronic components and integrated circuits. It calls
them “the basic building blocks of electronic and photonic products and
systems for terrestrial and submarine, or undersea, communications
networks and for communications equipment.”

The 16,500-employee company had revenue in the fiscal year ended Sept.
30 of $4.71 billion, and a loss of $76 million.

In addition to Morgan Stanley, the underwriting syndicate includes Bear
Stearns, JP Morgan Securities, Salomon Smith Barney, Deutsche Banc Alex
Brown, ABN AMRO Rothschild, SG Cowen Securities and Blaylock & Partners.

Agere will have 1.64 billion shares outstanding.

NuGenesis: Pharmaceutical and scientific data management

Last year, pharmaceutical companies spent $26.4 billion dollars on R&D,
triple the amount spent a decade ago, says the industry trade group
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).  A firm
that can help drugmakers use their R&D dollars more efficiently should
expect to do well.

Five year-old NuGenesis Technologies Corporation (www.nugenesis.com) –-
formerly known as Mantra Software -- designs data management software
for science-based organizations. Applicable from research and discovery
through manufacturing, it is for use by anyone who views data generated
in a lab, or a large volume of data produced by disparate sources. “For
a pharma, that could be as much as 30% to 40% of their employee base,”
says Mike McGuinness, president and CEO. Based in Westborough, MA,
NuGenesis provides product installation, training for users and
administrators, and follow-on support. The software is deployable on a
small scale – five to 20 users – or on an enterprise-wide scale where
thousands of individuals contribute to a database. The software can be
used to share data sets, graphs and reports.

Though most of the firm’s customers are in pharmaceuticals and biotech,
NuGenesis is branching out into medical devices, chemicals and food. “We
target our software to science-based industries, but the software is
applicable to many markets,” says McGuinness. NuGenesis has revenues,
but no profits. Current clients include Abbott, Eli Lilly, Merk, Pfizer,
Genentech, Biogen, DuPont, and Philip Morris, among others. “We feel the
total market for our products is $5 billion worldwide, that includes all
science based industries,” says McGuinness.

In May 2000, the firm closed on a $25 million round of equity financing.
Investors include TA Associates, BancBoston Ventures, Brentwood Venture
Capital, Highland Capital, and St. Paul Venture Capital. NuGenesis is
not planning any additional funding rounds at this time. “We’re very
well funded, we have plenty of cash,” says McGuinness. 

In February, the 180-employee firm announced it would partner with
Oracle to allow users of NuGenesis software to share scientific data
online. Competition comes from software giants International Business
Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Siebel
Systems, Inc. (SEBL). 

*** Siebel Systems (SEBL) revenue grew 120% to nearly $1.8 billion in
2000, according to its 10-K405 filed Monday. Earnings per share doubled
to $0.24 from $0.12 in 1999. 
http://www.edgar-online.com/secrets.asp?d=1006835-0001006835-01-500005

*** Perkin Elmer’s (PKI) 10-K405 filed on Monday mentioned NuGenesis in
its new products summary on chromatography data management software:
“The seamless flow of TotalChrom data into the NuGenesis(R) SDMS
database provides laboratories with an integrated method of data capture
and management,” the Perkin Elmer filing said.

QUESTION: What is a “reload provision”?

ANSWER: A reload provision is a feature in an option plan (or option

option-holding employees in exchange for retiring their former grants.
The new exercise price is usually pegged to the current market price.

“The number of reload shares granted is equal to the number of shares

withheld for tax withholding obligations,” says Bruce Brumberg,
editor-in-chief of MyStockOptions.com. “The option generally expires on

was priced Tuesday at a rock-bottom $6 a share, leading at least one
major Wall Street firm to recommend buying the shares aggressively.

Agere, which begins trading today on the New York Stock Exchange with
the ticker AGR, is a world-leading maker of communications
semiconductors, but investment bankers struggled for months to close the
deal. It will fetch only $3.6 billion, far less than the $6.5 billion
Lucent originally sought.

Sanford C. Bernstein analysts Paul Sagawa and Matthew Nagle speculated
in a research report Friday that Lucent would “likely pull” the
offering, but wrote that if it didn’t, “We would be aggressive buyers.”

Debt-burdened Lucent is transferring $2.5 billion of debt to Agere in
the deal, and could retire more if a 90 million share Green Shoe is
exercised by the underwriters, which are led by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. 

Only hours before the pricing, IPO followers were skeptical the deal
would be done. “There’s a lot of doubt that that one will make to the
Street,” Clint Morrison, head of equity research for Miller Johnson
Steichen Kinnard in Minneapolis, said early Tuesday afternoon.

Agere’s IPO was filed in December, but nearly every passing week has
seen the market for technology stocks decline and, with it, interest in
this deal ebb. In February Agere set a price range of $15 to $20 for
370.3 million shares. Later that month it slashed the range to $12 to
$14 and boosted the number of shares to 500 million. Last week it
dropped the price to the current range, and increased the number of
shares to 600 million.

The Bernstein analysts say a $12 price for the offering would still be a
discount to rivals such as JDS Uniphase (JDSU) and Infineon Technologies
(IFX). “We believe the reduced price range is the product of poor market
conditions, negative LU sentiment and the sense of desperation to get
the deal done,” they wrote in a March 23 research call.

If the deal got the green light, however, the Bernstein analysts urged
clients to snap it up. “In the ($6 to $7) price range, Agere would trade
at 2.1 times calendar year 2000 sales of $5.1 billion – a 36% and 75%
discount to comparables IFX and JDSU, respectively,” the wrote. “Already
a strong business with leading products and attractive margins, we
believe Agere will experience strong synergies as an independent
company. LU’s competitors will be more inclined to purchase components
from an independent Agere.”

Allentown, PA-based Agere manufacturers communications semiconductors,
including optoelectronic components and integrated circuits. It calls
them “the basic building blocks of electronic and photonic products and
systems for terrestrial and submarine, or undersea, communications
networks and for communications equipment.”

The 16,500-employee company had revenue in the fiscal year ended Sept.
30 of $4.71 billion, and a loss of $76 million.

In addition to Morgan Stanley, the underwriting syndicate includes Bear
Stearns, JP Morgan Securities, Salomon Smith Barney, Deutsche Banc Alex
Brown, ABN AMRO Rothschild, SG Cowen Securities and Blaylock & Partners.

Agere will have 1.64 billion shares outstanding.

NuGenesis: Pharmaceutical and scientific data management

Last year, pharmaceutical companies spent $26.4 billion dollars on R&D,
triple the amount spent a decade ago, says the industry trade group
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).  A firm
that can help drugmakers use their R&D dollars more efficiently should
expect to do well.

Five year-old NuGenesis Technologies Corporation (www.nugenesis.com) –-
formerly known as Mantra Software -- designs data management software
for science-based organizations. Applicable from research and discovery
through manufacturing, it is for use by anyone who views data generated
in a lab, or a large volume of data produced by disparate sources. “For
a pharma, that could be as much as 30% to 40% of their employee base,”
says Mike McGuinness, president and CEO. Based in Westborough, MA,
NuGenesis provides product installation, training for users and
administrators, and follow-on support. The software is deployable on a
small scale – five to 20 users – or on an enterprise-wide scale where
thousands of individuals contribute to a database. The software can be
used to share data sets, graphs and reports.

Though most of the firm’s customers are in pharmaceuticals and biotech,
NuGenesis is branching out into medical devices, chemicals and food. “We
target our software to science-based industries, but the software is
applicable to many markets,” says McGuinness. NuGenesis has revenues,
but no profits. Current clients include Abbott, Eli Lilly, Merk, Pfizer,
Genentech, Biogen, DuPont, and Philip Morris, among others. “We feel the
total market for our products is $5 billion worldwide, that includes all
science based industries,” says McGuinness.

In May 2000, the firm closed on a $25 million round of equity financing.
Investors include TA Associates, BancBoston Ventures, Brentwood Venture
Capital, Highland Capital, and St. Paul Venture Capital. NuGenesis is
not planning any additional funding rounds at this time. “We’re very
well funded, we have plenty of cash,” says McGuinness. 

In February, the 180-employee firm announced it would partner with
Oracle to allow users of NuGenesis software to share scientific data
online. Competition comes from software giants International Business
Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Siebel
Systems, Inc. (SEBL). 

*** Siebel Systems (SEBL) revenue grew 120% to nearly $1.8 billion in
2000, according to its 10-K405 filed Monday. Earnings per share doubled
to $0.24 from $0.12 in 1999.

*** Perkin Elmer’s (PKI) 10-K405 filed on Monday mentioned NuGenesis in
its new products summary on chromatography data management software:
“The seamless flow of TotalChrom data into the NuGenesis(R) SDMS
database provides laboratories with an integrated method of data capture
and management,” the Perkin Elmer filing said.

in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy.
