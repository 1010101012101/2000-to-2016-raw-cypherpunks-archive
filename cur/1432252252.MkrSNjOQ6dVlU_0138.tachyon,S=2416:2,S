No, it's silly because he said "becoming". Had he said "is", it would've 
been criminally stupid.

For example, the US has a long, long, long, long way to go before 
becoming anything remotely like North Korea, in terms of 
totalitarianism. Of course, North Korea is a radical example; there are
many countries much more totalitarian than the US and extremely likely
to remain so in any foreseeable future. All the Patriot Acts and 
increased surveillance and whatever else has been happening in the US
lately is a drop in the ocean of difference between the 
US and those other countries, in that respect.
