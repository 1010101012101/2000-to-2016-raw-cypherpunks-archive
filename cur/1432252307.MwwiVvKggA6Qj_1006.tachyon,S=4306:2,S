Hardly! Anyway, define "feds"--FBI field agents and the folks from Ft. 
Meade and the think tanks are entirely different species. When, where and 
to what degree the former implement recommendations from C3D2 studies done 
by the latter is anyone's guess. And why be sure it's safe to assume they 
aren't learning from past mistakes? That isn't exactly what I'd call being 
in your best interest.

Bah, it's dangerous to be so sure. And all the fevered talk about Aimee 
being a fed is hysterical.  Haven't you ever gone to a usenet group and 
baited people just for the hell of it because you were bored? Because it 
was fun to pull everyone's strings and watch them whine and howl and stomp 
their tiny feet at you? I'm not saying I have the first clue about her 
motivations, but you might want to keep in mind you dont have to be a fed 
to enjoy playing the Devil's Advocate.
