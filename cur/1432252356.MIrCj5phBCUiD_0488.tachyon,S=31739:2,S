                     And Issues A 'Strong Buy' Press Release

               The Stewart Report is a special situations financial
              newsletter that has been the focus of feature stories
                 in Barron's, Money magazine, The New York Times,

              Neptune Society Leads As Death-Care Stocks Buck Market
                                      Trend

             DANA POINT, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- In recent
             weeks, one of the market's most progressive sectors has
             been the death-care industry with national mortuary
             chains such as Service Corp International, Carriage
             Services and Stewart Enterprises, Inc. having risen to
             within a few points of their 52-week highs.

             However, it's The Neptune Society  (OTC Bulletin Board:
             NTUN),  the nation's only cremation specialist and the
             only death-care provider with a brand name familiar to
             consumers nationwide that seems to be at the forefront
             of the latest move, allowing it to buck today's
             downdrafts in both the Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq
             Composite averages.  Neptune's price resiliency and
             strong volume have been attributed by some observers to
             The Stewart Report, a West Coast research letter that
             initiated coverage on the stock this week.  Moreover,
             Stewart believes expanding awareness of Neptune's
             intention to list on a senior exchange will carry the
             stock higher still.

             The Stewart Report's analysis of The Neptune Society
             highlights its niche opportunity in the marketing of
             pre-need cremation services, payments for which have
             generated a rapidly growing company trust fund that
             presently totals more than $40 million. Analyst J.
             David Stewart says the trust fund which has already
             endowed the Neptune network with a 13-year backlog of
             business in the midst of its best operating year ever,
             will likely grow to $99 million by year-end 2005.
             Stewart also sees a string of steadily improving
             operational years, thanks to a diverse set of
             socio-economic factors presently coming into play.
             These include the aging baby boomer population, the
             expanding geographical range of American families, new
             consumer attitudes towards land usage as it relates to
             traditional casket funerals, and an increasing cost
             consciousness in death-care planning.

                                      ###

                         Highlights Of The Stewart Report

                       *** Key Investment Considerations ***

             The Neptune Society® is positioned for the market
             maturation of the "Baby Boomers" and the "Graying of
             America."

             A compelling value proposition for cremation is its
             simple; the average funeral runs from $10-15,000 and
             the average cremation runs $1-3,000. That's a $9-12,000
             spread.

             The $15 billion death-care industry has recently
             survived a five-year shake-out by attrition,
             acquisition, or merger that has left the U.S. with only
             four publicly traded chains and 22,000 independent
             mortuary operators. The Neptune Society is the only
             public "pure play" in the cremation segment of the
             death-care services industry and the company benefits
             from extensive goodwill from its reputation and high
             visibility brand name built during its 27-year
             history.

             The Neptune Society received a 'Strong Buy'
             recommendation from J. David Stewart of The Stewart
             Report with the stock under $8 and a 6-12 month target
             price of $17.50.

             The Neptune Society has 18 locations in 7 states with
             strategic growth initiatives to add to those numbers in
             2001 as they expand to meet demographic concentrations.
             The company also has a dedicated "call center" with 20
             telemarketers in Tempe, AZ.

             The Neptune Trust Fund to facilitate 60,000 'Pre-Need'
             contracts sold and not fulfilled  approximately $40
             million strong. It is estimated the Trust will reach
             $99 million by 2005.

             "The Neptune Society offers the industry's best price
             leverage due to its petite market cap of less than $50
             million."

             To date, 2001 is breaking all company records with
             estimated gross sales for the year at $18 million, new
             'Pre-Need' contract sales estimated at 10,000, and
             'At-Need' sales and administrative fees coming from an
             estimated 7,000 fulfillments.

                                 Recent Events
                             Of The Neptune Society

             Cremation service revenues were $2,242,000 for the
             three months that ended March 31, 2001 compared to
             $1,328,000 in 2000, nearly double the same period last
             year.

             The Neptune Society provided 6,639 cremations in 2000
             and has already provided 5,098 in the first five months
             of 2001, that is double the same period last year with
             a very conservative projected total for 2001 to be
             approximately 7,400.

             The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled
             since 1999, has substantial industry expertise. The
             management has implemented a multi-pronged marketing
             strategy focused on selling "Pre-Need" cremation plans.
             Including direct sales over their Web site, the
             strategy also includes direct mail of approximately six
             million pieces being sent in 2001 and the support of
             five sales managers with approximately 200 independent,
             commission-only sales representatives providing
             follow-up.

             The Neptune Society recently received an 'Aggressive
             Buy' recommendation from Banyan Capital Markets with a
             target price of $8.00.

             The company has a guaranteed 13-year business backlog.

             Due to the nature of the company's business, it is
             virtually recession-proof.

<p><b>About The Neptune Society</b>
<br>Headquartered in Burbank, CA., The Neptune Society Inc. is one of North
America's largest cremation specialists, and is the only publicly traded
company dealing solely in cremation services. The Neptune Society, operating
for nearly three decades with locations in California, Florida, New York,
Washington, Iowa, Oregon and Arizona has provided thousands of cremation
services and currently has close to 60,000 active contracts and nearly
$40 million in trust in its unique Pre-Need program. The Neptune Society's
goal is to provide a simple, dignified and economic alternative to the
traditional funeral burial service system.&nbsp;

Key Investment Considerations ***</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The Neptune Society</b>&reg; is positioned for the market maturation
of the "Baby Boomers" and the "Graying of America."&nbsp;
<p>A compelling value proposition for cremation is its simple; the average
funeral runs from $10-15,000 and the average cremation runs $1-3,000. <b>That's
a $9-12,000 spread.</b>
<p>The $15 billion death-care industry has recently survived a five-year
shake-out by attrition, acquisition, or merger that has left the U.S. with
only four publicly traded chains and 22,000 independent mortuary operators.
The Neptune Society is the <u>only</u> public "pure play" in the cremation
segment of the death-care services industry and the company benefits from
extensive goodwill from its reputation and high visibility brand name built
during its <b><font color="#000000">27-year history</font></b>.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Society received a <b>'Strong Buy'</b> recommendation from
J. David Stewart of The Stewart Report with the stock under $8 and a 6-12
month target price of $17.50.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Society has <b>18 locations in 7 states</b> with strategic
growth initiatives to add to those numbers in 2001 as they expand to meet
demographic concentrations. The company also has<b> </b>a dedicated "call
center" with 20 telemarketers in Tempe, AZ.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Trust Fund to facilitate 60,000 'Pre-Need' contracts sold
and not fulfilled&nbsp; approximately <b>$40 million strong.</b> It is
estimated the Trust will reach $99 million by 2005.&nbsp;
<p>"The Neptune Society offers <b>the industry's best price leverage</b>
due to its petite market cap of less than $50 million."&nbsp;
<p>To date, <b>2001 is breaking all company records</b> with estimated
gross sales for the year at $18 million, new 'Pre-Need' contract sales
estimated at 10,000, and 'At-Need' sales and administrative fees coming
from an estimated 7,000 fulfillments.&nbsp;

<p>Cremation service revenues were $2,242,000 for the three months that
ended March 31, 2001 compared to $1,328,000 in 2000, nearly<b> double the
same period last year</b>.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Society provided 6,639 cremations in 2000 and has already
provided 5,098 in the first five months of 2001, that is <b>double the
same period last year</b> with a very conservative projected total for
2001 to be approximately 7,400.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled since 1999, has
substantial industry expertise. The management has implemented a multi-pronged
marketing strategy focused on selling "Pre-Need" cremation plans. Including
direct sales over their Web site, the strategy also includes direct mail
of approximately <b>six million pieces</b> being sent in 2001 and the support
of <b>five sales managers</b> with approximately <b>200 independent, commission-only
sales representatives</b> providing follow-up.&nbsp;
<p>The Neptune Society recently received an <b>'Aggressive Buy'</b> recommendation
from Banyan Capital Markets with a target price of $8.00.&nbsp;
<p>The company has a guaranteed <b>13-year business backlog.</b>
<p>Due to the nature of the company's business, it is virtually <b>recession-proof.</b></blockquote>
