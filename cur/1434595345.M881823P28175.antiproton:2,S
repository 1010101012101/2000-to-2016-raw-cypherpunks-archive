Master Han's advice seems appropriate:

"Your tread must be light and sure, as though your path were upon
rice paper. It is said, a Shaolin priest can walk through walls.
Looked for...he can not be seen. Listened for ... he can not be
heard. Touched ... can not be felt. This rice paper is the test.
Fragile as the wings of the dragon fly, clinging as the cocoon of
the silk worm. When you can walk its length and leave no trace.
You will have learned."

Assange has, most likely, been anticipating and planning for the
interview for a couple of years.  His potential interviewers will
be under enormous pressure to produce specific results, most
likely with conflicting directives from various Authorities and
whatever bit of moral compass, er I mean care for their
professional reputation, may apply.  Advantage:  Anyone who ever
used the handle Mendax.

For whatever that turns out to be worth.
