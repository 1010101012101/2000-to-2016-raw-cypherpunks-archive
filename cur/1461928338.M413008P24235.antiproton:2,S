This sounds exactly like how the inform-on-your-neighbor
system worked in Stalinist regimes and in fascist Germany 
before that. There were never enough actual secret police
to keep an eye on everyone - the system relied on the
willingness of average citizens to vociferously out their neighbors
and friends who may have spoken or implied a line of thought
outside the state approved ideology.
