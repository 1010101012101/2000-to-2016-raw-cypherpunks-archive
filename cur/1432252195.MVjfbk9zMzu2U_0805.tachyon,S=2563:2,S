   [1]FrenchyinOntario writes "Researchers at a University of Toronto lab
   are getting ready to release a computer program called Psiphon, which
   will [2]allow Internet users in free countries to help users in more
   restrictive countries (like China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, etc.) to
   access the Internet by getting past the firewalls and hosing "rubber
   hose cryptoanalysis" which is a drawback of other anti-firewall
   programs as it reveals a user's tracks if discovered by authorities.
   Operating through port 443, Psiphon will allow users in monitoring
   countries the ability to send an encrypted request for certain
   information, and for users in secure countries to send it back to
   them. The UofT's Citizen Lab hopes to debut Psiphon at the
   international congress of the free speech group PEN in May."
