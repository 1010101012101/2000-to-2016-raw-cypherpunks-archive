Wish you had a faster system and Internet connection? Join the club. We all turn on
our computers and log in to the net, sometimes for hours every day. When you add up
all the time you're plugged in and online, it's amazing how much more productivity
(and free time!) you could gain if your computer and Internet connection
weren't holding you back from what you *really* want to be doing.

But at what cost? A high-speed Internet connection can cost
hundreds or thousands of dollars annually, and the latest high-end systems start
at $3,000. If you don't want to shell out, what can you do instead?
The secret lies in Windows, which (not surprisingly) has built-in "bottlenecks"
that clog the travel of data through your system's internal pathways,
seriously slowing down your computer and Internet connection.
Windows arrives on your computer "optimized" for a large corporate LAN.
That makes sense for Microsoft, which has to meet the expectations of
demanding corporate buyers who extensively test new systems on the LAN before
making a purchasing decision.
But where does it leave the home user? You've shelled out good money for your
computer and Internet connection, but you can't use it to its full potential because
you're not on a large corporate network.
Fortunately, there's software to optimize how Windows uses *your* system hardware and
Internet connection, boosting your computer and Internet performance.
