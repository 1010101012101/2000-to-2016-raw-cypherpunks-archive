In this case, a "letter to the editor" which suggested that the quote
wasn't true because 

A.  Sharon couldn't have been that stupid.
B.  One of the places the quote appeared was in a magazine sympathetic to
    Arabs.

was proffered as "proof" that all 256 references to the quote on the Web
were in error.  It is hardly a huge leap here to suggest that this
"proof", albeit of a negative, was less than airtight.
