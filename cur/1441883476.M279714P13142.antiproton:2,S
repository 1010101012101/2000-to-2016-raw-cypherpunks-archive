One man's brain-rot drivel is another man's "ahah!" moment.

That's what I thought ... except every now and then there are those
who don't want to hear comparative Russia-USA political talk, or
pro-Russia bias, or Australia-is-kinda-off-topic, or etc.

It is not my will to bypass the consensus intention for cypherpunks@
list; far from it - thus in the face of the "please can we keep
cypherpunks@ on-topic" whines, I figured we must be missing the list
some of us would like.

Whatever people want ... just needs to be clear, since "that's
offtopic!!!!!" and "you know who you are" get a little tiring after a
while...

Sure. My intention with politicopunks@ was to actually be "everything
that does not fit on cypherpunks@".

Some fokls around here seem to think various political topics are
offtopic for cypherpunks. I've only been here a year, so I don't
really know and just want a forum where it's ok to post anything I
personally find worth discussion.

Forbidden fruit indeed - perfect terminology :)

If cypherpunks be unforbidden - as long as a poster has the stomach to
post - great :)
