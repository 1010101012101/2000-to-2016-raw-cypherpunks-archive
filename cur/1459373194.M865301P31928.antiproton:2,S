	No, I was only referring to the fact that you are not
	completely hostile to IDs, even gov't issued IDs.
	
	I do agree that uber is a scam. I would describe it as the next
	step in the development of 'western' corporate cancer. 

	I don't know why the masters of marketig would call something
	like uber 'sharing economy'. But then again by definition it's
	just meaningless marketing jargon.

	the 'nazi' adjective was attached to ID requirements from uber,
	which rely on the ID systems of different police states across
	the world. (and I was commenting about the 'local'(to me) case)

	Well, as a matter of fact, one of the requirements for drivers
	is to present their STATE ISSUED 'criminal record'...

	To clarify again : the part about uber I was teasing you with
	was their ID requirements...They obviously require a government
	issued driver's license...
