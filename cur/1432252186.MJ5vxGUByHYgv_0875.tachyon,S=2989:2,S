Ive seen a good story somewhere on the e-dinar,if it was protected with 
world wide AP/PGP served by huge remailing networks it could be the 
one.Nomen RUN! The end is nigh.
The other story this year (its not 2002 yet numbnuts) to raise a smile was 
the keystone Kops raid by the SS.Easy to see what freaks them 
out...Everyfuckinthing! Suckers! If anyone in that goon squads got any 
sense they'll put some lead in prime rib.
You dont want to catch mad cow disease do 
you?KILLTHEPRESIDENTINUNTRACABLEENCRYPTIONITSINVISIBLE.
My superintelligent rats in the W/house tell me they are getting fat on 
pork cracklings and gingerbread and its dead boring after El Bubba.
