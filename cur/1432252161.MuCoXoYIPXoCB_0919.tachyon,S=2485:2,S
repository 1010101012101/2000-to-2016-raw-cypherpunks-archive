That is the revisionist version - that china was a free and 
capitalist society, therefore freedom is not enough to ensure 
modernity and industrialization - a proposition as ludicrous as 
similar accounts of more recently existent despotic states.

China during that period was the classic exemplar of "oriental 
despotism", the place on which the idea is based.

But the Cultural Revolution was merely a bunch of teenagers 
obeying orders, merely the simulation of a mass movement, with
mass compliance instead of mass initiative.
