Who plans to steal the 2004 US elections?

Some people have it figured out


By Egan Orion: Monday 29 September 2003, 06:04
AFTER THE VOTING MESS in Florida during the 2000 elections, the US
Congress passed the "Help America Vote Act". They should have more
accurately entitled it the "Help Steal America's Vote Act" instead.

However, at least one journalist has cottoned on to what's happening, and
it is simply outrageous. We reprint by permission Chris Floyd's dynamite
article at CounterPunch exposing these sordid facts.

<SNIP>

<<the original story is
here: http://www.counterpunch.org/floyd09262003.html >>

It's a shell game, with money, companies and corporate brands switching in
a blur of buy-outs and bogus fronts. It's a sinkhole, where mobbed-up
operators, paid-off public servants, crazed Christian fascists, CIA
shadow-jobbers, war-pimping arms dealers--and presidential family
members--lie down together in the slime. It's a hacker's dream, with
pork-funded, half-finished, secretly-programmed computer systems installed
without basic security standards by politically-partisan private firms,
and protected by law from public scrutiny.

It's how America, the "world's greatest democracy," casts its votes. And
it's why George W. Bush will almost certainly be the next president of the
United States--no matter what the people of the United States might want.
