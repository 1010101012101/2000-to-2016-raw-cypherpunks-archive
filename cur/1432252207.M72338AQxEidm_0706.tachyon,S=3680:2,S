"No malice", not "no lies"

The reason he concludes "no malice" is that he concludes the
reporters really believed the US had used nerve gas, not
because he believes the reporters had truthfully reported the
evidence.  The edited Moorer seemingly admits to the use of
nerve gas, and another witness seemingly admits to personally
massacring civilians.  In the unedited versions, they do not.

The reason it was "no malice" is that the reporters actually
had some evidence -- but not evidence persuasive enough to
report on television.
