Nonsense.  Once a nym has developed enough reputation some (perhaps many)
people will trust them to deliver physical goods in exchange for anon
DM.  These might be any number of gray/black market items (e.g., firearms,
 drugs, child porn, etc.)  To help thwart stings or sell-outs, some of
the buyers can intentionally provide the names and addresses of upstanding
citizens (preferably those who would not want to be associated with such
items or even oppose them).  If LE people are doing the sales and attempt
to prosecute the recipients they will only cause a tidal wave of protest
against such stings which catch up innocent citizens who knew nothing
about the real buyers.  Sort of a legal mixmaster.
