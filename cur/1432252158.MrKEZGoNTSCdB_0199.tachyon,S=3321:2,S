Um, no, it's explicitly stated in the article that you speak for OmniPay. 
Jim, you're a good guy, but when you give an on the record interview to a 
reporter and he asks you what title to use and you say (after some more 
colorful suggestions) "vice president," it's reasonable to conclude you're 
speaking for the company.

An officer of the company not speaking for it? It would be like Bill Gates 
not speaking for Microsoft.
