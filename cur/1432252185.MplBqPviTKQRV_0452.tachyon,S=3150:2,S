Nope, never expected it. This proves what those wise and neutral folks

(Me, I would say that voting is such an inefficient process of getting
what you want that it is not rational to read up on all policy
positions of the candidates, and you might as well focus on character,
or what you perceive to be the same.)

If I wanted to be a partisan political reporter, clearly it would be
higher-profile. But that doesn't interest me much, so I shall
diminish, and remain, well, you get the idea.
