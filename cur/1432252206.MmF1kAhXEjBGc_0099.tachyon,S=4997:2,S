Which of these phones have built-in GPS? Gonna be a real shock to 
Trimble, Magellan, and Garmin that the GPS units they're still 
selling for $100 and up are competing with cellphones given out free 
with new accounts!


GPS is getting cheaper, and may someday appear in even inexpensive 
cellphones, but that day has not yet come.

Why do you believe this to be so?

A backup battery is likely only usable for the local storage of 
temporary parameters, and probably not even that. I don't recall any 
mention with either my Motorola Star-Tac or my current Nokia about 
backup batteries.

Which means that when the main battery pack is removed, the circuitry 
is "OFF." No power to transmit. (And forget passive sensing, as with 
some radio or t.v. tuning coils of old, as that required being very 
close to the coils to detect resonances. And no longer even 
applicable, what with digital tuners.)

Removing the battery is easier. Turning the phone off is _probably_ 
(I am convinced of this, but haven't studied it in detail) enough to 
stop any location detection, at least with the current generations of 
cellphones.

(The very long battery life of a turned-off Nokia vs. a turned-on 
Nokia tells us a lot about what it could possibly be transmitting.)

As for Faraday cages, there are easier options that a fruitcake tin. 
Reception is bad enough in mountainous areas  like mine.

Ray, you seem knowledgeable in some areas. But your pontifications on 
California basements, cellphone GPS, etc., are very "Choatean" in 
nature. Something you might want to look at.
