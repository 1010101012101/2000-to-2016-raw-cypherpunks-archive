 >>TCDD or, 2-3-7-8-tetrachlorodibenzo-P-dioxin (C12,H4,Cl4,O2), is a
CONTAMINATE artifact of the heat exchangers used in the reaction process
not a constituent as so often stated.<<

Thanks for that,the story about the west au batch is that fire/heat damaged 
a primary constituent during its manufacture in Singapore.The CATO 
institute is believed to be writing a new press release on how Toxic waste 
is good for you.One of the reasons I dump my recycled raw material here is 
to get free input such as yours,Its viewers like you that keep me 
going,Thank you.

Last year 75,000 gallons of Round Up sprayed on Columbia leading to more 
clearing of tropical rainforest.Genocide AND suicide.(fact or factoid?)
