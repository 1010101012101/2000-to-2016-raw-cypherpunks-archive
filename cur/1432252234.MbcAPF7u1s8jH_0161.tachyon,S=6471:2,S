What a bunch of silly bullshit. This is the view of blacks one gets by 
watching TV. The vast majority of blacks in this country don't have a 
"leader" per se. What percentage of black folks do you think "follow" Al 
Sharpton, Farrakhan, or anyone else for that matter?

Ah well. Not a lot of black folks in his part of Silicon Valley, I guess. 
Tim May needs to get out more and stop watching COPS or whatever.
