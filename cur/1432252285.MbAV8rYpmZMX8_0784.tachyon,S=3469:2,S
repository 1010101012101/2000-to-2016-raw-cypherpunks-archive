Subject: Swedish Police to censorware "Pirate Bay" as child porn site?

[Can any IP'ers who read Swedish check out the comments in the post
thread, and indicate whether their story is credible or not? The abuse
of ISP censorware blacklists for "mission creep" is an obvious
slippery slope. But anything coming from a site which calls itself
"Pirate Bay" needs to be treated with some skepticism. One might
cynically conjecture about a tactic of releasing an alert on Friday
afternoon, knowing officials won't be around to deny it until Monday
morning, and by that time the Pirate Bay version will be echoing all
over the Net]

  "PRESS RELEASE: Swedish Police Shuts Down Pirate Bay - Again"
  Inskrivet av Nyhetsgruppen 6 juli, 2007

  This Friday, it became known that the Swedish Police Board will shut
  down The Pirate Bay, the popular file sharing site, by classifying
  it as a child pornography site in the blocklist that Swedish
  Internet Providers respect. Some time next week, an update to the
  blacklist will include The Pirate Bay.

  This means that anyone from Sweden visiting the well-known file
  sharing site The Pirate Bay will be greeted by a block page from the
  Police Board saying they're not allowed to visit child pornography  
sites."
