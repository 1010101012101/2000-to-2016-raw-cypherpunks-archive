Geoff,
the security protocol that you're describing---i.e., generate a symmetric 
key and ship it encrypted with the recipient's public key---seems very 
expensive for a layer 3 forwarder (or, better, for what I think that that 
beast is, really). I understand that  a) you have limited a forwarder's 
scope to processing signalling data only, and b) PGP email, for one, use 
keys pretty much the way you said. Yet, I think one could do much better 
with a Diffie-Hellman cycle producing a batch of symmetric keys, which need 
not to be exchanged across the wire. This is what IKE (rfc2409) does. IKE 
has all sort of wrinkles to it in order to thwart DH vulnerabilities to 
men-on-the-middle attackers. A forwarder implementing such solution could 
attain a wide range of throughputs, possibly exceeding 1Gb/s with hardware 
crypto-assists (as commodity VPN boxes show today). Public key operations 
as you scoped will definitely lock you out of these ranges.
