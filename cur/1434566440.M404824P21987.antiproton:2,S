I think that for the most part we're on the same page. The only thing 
is, is that, there is a reason a lot of these things happen the way they 
are decided upon by impressionable people basing their decisions based 
on wrong information. Or people trying to prolong the status quo.

And the way I get  exposed to things are different. I'm not trying to 
cloud the issue. It's just that you don't want/can/able to see what 
drives (bad) decision makers.

I actually do know why certain decisions are being made by investigating 
usually the person who made them.

A great example is the current head of the the Federal Reserve, Janet 
Yellen. I have predicted how she is going maneuver current policy and 
what she is pushing for by reading her husband's research with a 100% 
accuracy. No magic involved. And I don't even understand the economics 
behind it, or her or her husband's reasoning!

And I'm absolutely sure they don't either!!! Because it makes no fucking 
sense.

Anyway, sorry for my digression, but I'll tell you anyway. She and her 
husband have convinced themselves that there is a hard correlation 
between minimum wage and inflation. And instead of controlling the 
inflation by in or decreasing the money supply they raise the minimum 
wage. Which increases unemployment. But at least controls inflation.

So she is a-ok to fuck over a bunch of Americans in order to control 
inflation. Because unemployment is not a controlled variable in her big 
experiment. TA-DAH. Now I can argue until my hands fall off with you on 
how that is A-OK or NAY-OK. But this woman is like three times my age it 
seems. Much better looking and soft-spoken unlike me. So. We'll just 
have to fucking stick with her no-solution.

So the straightforward reason is hereby given. The alternative is 
raising interest rates which will crash/panic Wallstreet. Now I could go 
give you a straight-ass-forward reason as to why Georgy Herbert needed 
money for fighting in Guatemala, but you'd say it is a bad reason and it 
gets us nowhere.

I just suggest they defund the CIA for those particular programs that 
are retarded. CAN WE HAS NO MORE CONTRAS PLEASE.  Can we agree on 
fucking just that. CIA let them go back to solely intelligence and let 
the federal police or the military take care of the rest. Which is 
something they are currently doing anyway.

No, and I'm no hypocrite either, because I understand you fully. 
Regardless, a hypocrite usually has a valid point. That is why people 
don't like 'm. You can concede to the point I'm making without 
entertaining my world view.

Yes. I agree.

I don't speak about a moral high ground.

How about stop referring to yourself as a peasant. Members of Congress, 
your King or Queen or representative maybe shit and piss like the rest 
of us. The main difference between you and me is that you hold these big 
institutions to your own standard.

I don't expect the CIA to operate on my watch.

Maybe. But all that abuse of rights got you things like Google (could 
not have existed under European privacy laws), Apple (Foxconn), NASA 
(Nazi scientists), IBM (more Nazis), Microsoft (US-centric patent abuse, 
unfair business practices). I.e.: You can't make an omelet without 
breaking a few eggs.

And I don't share your sterilized worldview where everything outside of 
the U.S. is so humane and everyone has the best intentions. Actually, 
it's quite the opposite.

Yea, I'll put that on the list-- right next to the second coming of Jesus.

Yea, if you think that Thomas Paine was nice but he is everything but a 
popular guy, so forget it. Most of them were slave owners with such 
ancient antics that I'd have to severely paraphrase them in order not 
misconstrue their intentions or how they really thought about the world.

True.
