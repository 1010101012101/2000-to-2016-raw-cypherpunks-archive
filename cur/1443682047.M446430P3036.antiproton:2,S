Yeh, that opinion came after an exchange with Greenwald on Twitter about
releasing the entire cache but unfortunately that Twitter account is
gone now due to Twitter's hatred of Tor so I can't fish it out.

But if you read through quotes from Snowden himself you see that he
leaked the information to cause a debate about how we should be
governed, not because he thinks the Government should be transparent.

A quote from his Wikipedia page (yeh I know no-one trusts Wikipedia but
sometimes it's handy):-

"For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already
accomplished. I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to
work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because,
remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a
chance to determine if it should change itself. All I wanted was for the
public to be able to have a say in how they are governed."
