"We don't pick up weapons to kill people to start the revolution. A 
revolution is really easy to do these days. What is the system? The system 
is built on the power of the banks. So it must be destroyed through the 
banks," he said.

While the idea should be sound, the fact is that the banks *own* the 
governments now, so they'll just get new bailouts and big bonuses for the 
executive.  If were were actually playing by the rules, the banks that 
impoded would be dead, and their corpses would be scavenged by others 
(leaving the burned consumers to either sit there awaiting an endless 
string of re-runs, or to work hard for appropriate legislation designed to 
prevent recurrences).  But the "rules" went out the window in 1984 
(Reagan)...

Still, watching this should be amusing.
