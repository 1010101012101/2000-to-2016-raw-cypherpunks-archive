Perhaps. On the other hand, it is clear that people attach connotations to
expression based on their experience of where that expression is used. Think
of Carmina Burana after it was used in the Omen, or the associations carried
by heavy metal. E.g. both sorts of music can be used in a movie as a
leitmotif to satanistic themes. Similarly a Goth attire and a suitable
amount of group aggression will likely be as efficient on a child with a
Christian fundamental worldview as a direct threat. And as time goes by,
such connotations may well subsume the original meaning. A good example of
this is what being a skinhead is today and was in the sixties.

If the community at large embraces religious intolerance, Christian chant
may well be the ultimate threat to a young Wicca. If it has a significant
part in an incident leading to teenage suicide, this lends credibility to
the claim that what in other communities might be a legitimate form of
religious self-expression, is in this one used to taunt the misfit. This
gives Christianity the bad face the writer talks about, and gives the
majority an incentive to silence the story.

While the few Wiccas I know are introverted enough not to even try. 'Guess
they come in all shapes and sizes, like people tend to.

Huh? Apparently you've never had the treatment; children can be intolerant
as hell. Primary school gave me the most frightening examples of herd
behavior I've *ever* seen.
