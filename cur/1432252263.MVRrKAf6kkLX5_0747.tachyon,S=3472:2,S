Hironari Noda, the ex-official in the Japanese 
Public Security Investigation Agency, was arrested
yesterday:

   http://cryptome.org/noda-arrest.htm

The charge is assaulting one of the PSIA agents
who were constantly surveilling Noda.

Noda has been getting information from former
colleagues about upcoming raids by PSIA and showing
up to videotape them. Noda has been reporting on 
PSIA activities to a public bulletin board.

This has led to a series of confrontations at raids
and increased harassment of Noda with ostentatious
surveillance and tailing. A couple of days ago Noda 
verbally insulted a PSIA watchdog through a closed 
car window. The watchdog yelled you touched me 
(touching is a legal offense, insulting is not) and called 
the cops. 

The cops dutifully arranged a raid a day later, kicked
in Noda's door while he was emailing and phoning
friends about the assault, and arrested him -- claiming
his description of the raid by telephone and email 
constituted assault.

One of the raiders was an undercover PSIA agent
who posed as an AUM groupie to infiltrate an AUM
fan club -- several clubs have arisen that collect
AUM memorabilia and mementos. The cover agent
was said to have posted to an AUM fan BB that a gas 
attack was imminent. No doubt a technique learned at
the footstool of the CIA special services school.
