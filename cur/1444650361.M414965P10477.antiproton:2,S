IMHO this is a potential hole:

Assuming Snowden got the slide from the NSA, he didn't fake it and his
slides weren't modified by others AFTER he got them, some of your
options don't make any sense.

I don't know if these are sound assumptions, but Snowden appears widely
believed by non-us-natsec crowd (which call him a "traitor").

As pointed out in another thread, the usa wants to torture Snowden for
alleged crimes like "stealing classified stuff", NOT for distributing
fakes.

There appears to be quarrel between the usa and eu about surveillance:

EU Digital Commish: Ja, we should have done more about NSA spying

I wish you call the EU "fake believers".
