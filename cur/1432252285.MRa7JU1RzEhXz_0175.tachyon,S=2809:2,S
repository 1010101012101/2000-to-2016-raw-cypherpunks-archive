The Secret Service Uniformed Division is not new (see http:// 
www.secretservice.gov/ud.shtml). You see them all over DC.

I don't know a whole lot about police powers, but can't a police  
offer arrest anyone if he has probable cause the person has committed  
a crime? Perhaps "reasonable grounds to believe" is different, but if  
the author doesn't know about a branch of law enforcement that has  
been in existence since 1860, I don't have much trust in his other  
information.
