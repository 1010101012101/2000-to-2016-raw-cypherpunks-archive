RAH;

Thank you for the perfect illustration of pure evil, and the perfect
illustration of how ones altruistic nature and desire to do good can
lead one to support crimes against humanity so long as they are
committed by "your" side.

I respond in detail below.

Just how is an unborn fetus a commie? I seem to recall your side
being really defensive of fetuses, except, I guess, when they are in
the bodies of innocent civilians (well, guilty of being born Mayan)
who are unfortunate enough to live in mountainous areas that are
where guerrilla fighters (naturally) base their operations?

Oh, well I think Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot and Ho Chi Minh were
fighting wars too. Remember? So, does your line of reasoning
suddenly reverse or were their slaughters OK also? And let us see
how this war started...oh yeah, WE OVERTHREW THEIR DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED GOVERNMENT because we did not like its policies. So we
started the war and were the aggressors and the fact that a very few
of them may have been "communists" justifies a genocide?

Well, the Guatemalan truth commission found that 90% of the
violations of human rights, the murder, rape, genocide, was done by
government forces. They found that 3% was done by the guerrillas,
and the rest they could not be sure. And there is absolutely no
evidence, or even accusations, that the democratically elected
government we overthrew was killing anyone or had policies that
would lead to their deaths. In fact there is no evidence that the
government we overthrew was a communist government. There just is no
place for you to go on this one, you are supporting genocide and
mass murder even of fetuses in the name of profits for one US
company. This is pure evil and it comes from you. The government we
overthrew was doing nothing more than exercising its rights of
eminent domain in exactly the way that our own government does. They
paid the company for the land, paid what the company had claimed it
was worth. How does the exercise of eminenet domain rights by a
sovereign government make them Communists? And does this argument
not mean that a violent overthrow of the Communist President Bush
would be justified?

So, little children, fetuses, illiterate peasants who never even
heard of Marx (and this makes up the vast majority of the victims),
all of them were totalitarians or dupes? Based on their living where
their ancestors had lived for millenia? So how do you define
totalitarian? Must be a very different meaning than any I am
familiar with; seems to me that you think it means "anyone we can
profit from the murder of."

I also have to point out that this "free enterprise by force"
conception of yours is a novel usage of the term "free" and also
happens to be exactly what totalitarians do; they profit by force,
by controlling the means of production with military might. What do
you call yourselves, Totalitarians Against Totalitarianism by Anyone
Else?

It seems to nme that there are quite a few parts of our economy that
the government controls, from food to steel to gasoline the prices
are manipulated and supply is limited or enhanced by our governmet.
And there are foriegn goods that are kept out or taxed heavily.
Those damn Communist Republicans! Why, just recently they made it
illegal to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada, an act
that will directly cost some elderly people their lives. So, are the
elderly all totalitarians or dupes too? Seems to me that by your own
logic we can now justify massacring Republicans, including women,
children and the unborn, because they are controlling the economy in
a way that kills people. Care to rethink that position before we get
started?

Again, the overthrow of a Democracy that was the one stable one in
Latin America, by the CIA,...was a blow against Communism? And it is
OK because it was a "war" and never mind that we started it? Does it
matter that this "war" was against an unarmed population that never
even revolted or went into the hills to fight? Does it matter that
this "war" meant that ten thousand people we had picked out were put
into a soccer stadium and massacred? There was no uprising in Chile
and yet somehow you claim there was a "war?" I have to assume that
you think it is somehow far worse to leave people unemployed than to
massacre them. So then Bush again must be seen by your own argument
as a Communist that must be overthrown (for confiscating people's
livelihoods by subsidizing the export of their jobs) and Republicans
must be rounded up into footbal stadiums and massacred. When do we
start?

Ah, back to the "he did it too" argument. Well, then it must be OK,
right? Would that argument still hold after we have all of the
Republicans rounded up?

An excellent description of America today and how our poorly
educated (at the very least in political realms) population has
allowed the Republicans and Democrats to loot and pillage at will.

So, by "good and right" you mean what exactly? The policy that any
attempt to stop the forced expropriation, "the economic rents that a
force-monopoly violently expropriates from its citizenry" when done
by us to a foreign population is evil? That any attempt by a foreign
population to stop us from ripping them off and controlling their
economy by force is justification for mass murder and genocide? How
then do you define good and right?

Hold on, so I can only conclude that you are saying LESS DEMOCRACY
is a win for us? How does the violent overthrow of TWO DEMOCRACIES
by the CIA and the USA mean more democracy and less tyranny? How
does the installing of a brutal military dictator equal more
Democracy? Perhaps I just have never seen the term "Democracy"
applied to an unelected military dictator with total unchallenged
power before, could you reference this usage for me?

Yes, how will we end the American force-monopoly in the third world?
That is indeed one of the keys.

If by "free" you mean "completly controlled for our own interests."

If by "freedom" you mean "the right to be massacred by us for

disagree should we ever allow you to be born alive."

Yes, it is indeed remarkably present in this post of yours where you
espouse how good it is that we commit unthinkable evil acts on
complete innocents so that they may be "free."

None of those you hold to be evil, Hitler, Stalin, etc, would have
said anything very much different from what you just did to justify
their own horrific acts. How does it feel to be evil?
