Better hurry! The criminals in Washington are about to make mere 
_possession_ of biologicals like this illegal. Heretofore, it was 
illegal to possess biologicals intended for weapons use, but soon it 
will be a felony to merely possess broad classes of biologicals.

(Of course, the lab I worked in had Hepatitus C being cultured. All it 
takes is a permission slip from Big Bro and your lab can militarize 
smallpox!)

get rid of them
