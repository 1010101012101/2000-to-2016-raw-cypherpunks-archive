        I'm not understanding the comments about wetness affecting mail
in a pressure cooker -- using it as an autoclave, that is. I would
assume anyone doing this would put the perishable objects in a
waterproof container, such as a canning jar. You can get them in 1/2
gallon size. And I'm sure there are any number of steel, aluminum, etc.
waterproof containers that would work as well.
