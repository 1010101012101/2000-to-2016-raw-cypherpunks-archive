when I read the whole sentence from 
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/31/technology/ebusiness/31TECH.9.html
I assume the author simply speaks from that "magic lantern" thingie

| A controversial system installed on a
| criminal suspect's computer by the government to capture
| the encryption passwords of a criminal suspect is nearing
| its second phase; the F.B.I. has acknowledged that it is
| developing a similar monitoring system, called Magic
| Lantern, that could be installed remotely.
