No, it isn't. I have lived in Texas for 34 of my 40 years and written
software for income the last 23 years. My current job title is 'Senior
Software Engineer' and I don't even have a degree. While it is true I can't 
use any term with 'Engineer' in it for personal business without a degree
(you used to not need this), 5 years of apprenticeship to a current PE,
and pass a test (though my employer can call me an 'engineer' or whatever
with no regulation), there are no legal requirements for same either. You
can get a 'Professional Engineer' certification but it is not specificaly
in programming. It includes a bunch of crap out of EE & ME as well.

There IS a lot of talk about it but there is NO requirement for licensing
as a 'Professional Engineer' in Tx. It probably won't pass since the vast
majority of programmers I work with are dead against it.

I'm afraid that if this is what the ACM is passing around, they got it
wrong.
