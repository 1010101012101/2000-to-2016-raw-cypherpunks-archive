It is? That isn't any strategy I've ever seen touted as optimal except in 
a 'single' shot market. Which doesn't happen to conform to a 'free' market
model.

I"ll leave it as an excersize on why the 'smallest possible share' price
will inflate and over a reasonably short period will equalize at a 'fair'
price in an interated or multi-vendor market.

I will give one hint:
