obviously, they weren't.  Some fraction of the 1000 were making 
"gloating phone calls".  How many of them?  My guess is three,
on the grounds that the FBI is too honest to unscrupulously use 
the plural if there were only one.

They can try to assert whatever they want, but you'll have to
spend some time looking for an American judge who won't agree
that making congratulatory phone calls right after the attacks
provides grounds for reasonable suspicion of involvement,
particularly if they were already under surveilance.
