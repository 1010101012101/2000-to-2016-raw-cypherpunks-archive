He's out.

You can't get near the place today. I tell people what happened and
they can't believe it. I would not have believed it either, except I
was there for 11 hours. Then another 15 hours downtown. Excellent first
hand account here:
http://nyc.indymedia.org/newswire/display/107675/index.php

If I had not been arrested, I would not have known anything like this
was going on. 1000- 2000 people, in barb-wire cages, at this very
moment on the Hudson River. No joke. Totally surrounded by police.

ACLU lawyers, Reporters, everyone being denied access. Just starting to
hit the media.
