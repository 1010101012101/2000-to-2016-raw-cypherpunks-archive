Well, the 5th protects one from having to testify against oneself. I'm 
not going trying to go Choatian on you (is he on vacation?) but the 
personal data I store on a machine which I own, have sole access 
to, and which I stored with no immediate intention to show 
to others, seems to have properties more similar to a personal 
memory than does a piece of paper in a file cabinet at my 
accountant's office. 

That being the case, being forced to divulge my personal data, to be
used against me, *feels* like the sort of thing the 5th was meant to
prevent. 

[Lets not get into particular legal arguments at this point - I'm talking 
about my gut reactions.]

They were also ardent burners of old personal papers. Part of Faustine's 
point is that with a keylogger, there is no private space outside the skull.
The simplest drafting out of an idea - including ideas that may be
immediatly 
discarded as wrong/immoral/illegal/unworkable - become known to the
eavesdropper.

The Economist recently (July 26) ran a special report (10-15 pages) on 
the diasaster that is US drug policy, with a set of strong arguments
in favor of legalisation. It'd be worth your time to read it:

and following articles, with an editorial at

[This is really a separate and off-topic issue] I object to all killing 
except in immediate and urgent defense of life and limb. I won't 
attempt to persuade you here. But even if I were a serial killer
like Dubya, I would stop shy of killing rapists and other 
non-murderers. If rape as well as murder carried the death penalty, 
rapists (the real rapists you refer to) would be strongly motivated 
to murder their victims - doing so eliminates the best (and usually 
only) witness against them, and even if they are convicted, carries 
no additional penalty - it's tough to make someone serve two 
death sentences consecutively.
