Funny, I assumed all along John was just rorschachblotting around to avoid
saying the unsayable, i.e. bringing up the idea of simultaneous detonation of
suitcase nukes in multiple metropolitan areas. 

But even that wouldn't pack the same punch as if had come before the 
WTC/Pentagon/Anthrax crisis. The psychological impact of an entire population
seeing the towers go down in flames over and over again is probably more
significant than we'll ever know. 

Also, I dont think there's really any reason to assume that Americans are so
soft and weak they'd roll over and die at the prospect of a real home war. For
every hundred (thousand?) people whining around begging for the government to
hand them safety on a silver platter, there's at least a couple arming
themselves and laying in supplies to take responsibility for their own
security. All the people who organized themselves for Y2K are already there:
the fact that so many more woke up post 9-11 and started integrating
survivalist ideas into their everyday experience has to be a positive thing. 

History shows that in any war or crisis, some people will pull it together and
pull through, others won't. America won't be any different. You never know
how people are going to act--what they're really made of--until they're
actually put through the fire. The only thing you know for certain is that
people will surprise you.

Besides, the much-ballyhooed "American sense of security" always was a middle
class myth. How easy it is for smug and comfy desk workers to forget that a
good number of their fellow Americans face hunger and a violent death on the
street every single day of the year. Abandoned, destitute, homeless, those
garbagey hordes of little inner city kids know a thing or two about how to stay 
alive. Wretched, but with the perserverance and cunning of sewer rats.


Would you have ever guessed that's my background unless I told you?
