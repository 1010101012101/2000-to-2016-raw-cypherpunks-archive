You know, it might be really funny if in fact all the IMF's SDRs
(special drawing rights - i.e. sanctioned right to print money, even
without any loan-promise-to-repay backing those fiats) were really
backed by birth certificates, and some portion closed off each month
with corresponding death certificates.

Could explain why demoncratic governments are so hell bent on
ever more intense cotton-wool-society statutes? (a few years back, we
had someone in Victoria, Australia, booked for speeding at 61km/hr in a
60km/hr zone - don't recall if they won their court case or not - it IS
an absolute offense after all).


Naaaaah! They would never arbitrage all human lives explicitly against
fiat dollar printing rights - that would be like, like, like a
conspiracy or something.
