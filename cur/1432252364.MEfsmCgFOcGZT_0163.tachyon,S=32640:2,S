        Dear Investor

        Over the last year, investors have often suffered through the
        daily roller coaster of the stock market, a roller coaster whose
        wheels rest soundly in the tech sector. Investors have been
        watching their positions dwindle as common sense returned to the
        market and words like “revenues” and “earnings” once again had
        meaning.

        Today, the market seems abuzz with the pursuit of a catchy
        phrase, “upside potential.” We assume that means future
        profitability and growth. In contrast to the carefree tech run of
        the recent past, upside potential must now be combined with a
        sturdy business plan tested over more than a quarter. You just
        can’t add “dot com” to a word and hand it to the public.

        So, while investors still welcome the sex appeal of a story that
        could be the next eBay, logical investor’s are also finding
        enthusiasm for companies with balance sheets that confirm their
        business plans. We believe we’ve found a company with just that
        sort of promise.

        The Neptune Society (OTC: BB: NTUN) is a company entrenched in an
        industry that many of us never realized was quite so profitable,
        though ultimately, all of us will eventually need.

        What does this company do? Well, more than likely you’ve seen the
        ads on television. The Neptune Society provides cremation
        services in the death care industry; an industry that locks in
        profits on “Pre-Need” revenues, an industry on the cusp of the
        aging Baby Boomer generation.

        The Neptune Society is a company with a record of predictable,
        positive income results based on a $40 million trust, 55,000
        active contracts, and nearly 1,500 appointments scheduled for
        goods and services every month.

        According to Neptune chief operating officer (COO) David
        Schroeder, The Neptune Society has come a very long way. “As a
        whole, we are very encouraged by our sales. Our revenues are up,
        our operating efficiency has improved, and we set a record in May
        for Pre-Need sales and cash collected. Another important factor
        in our success is in our market share. Across the industry, some
        companies have experienced up to a 12 percent drop in market
        share while our market share has increased two to five percent.
        Our unique management and marketing structure has been extremely
        effective in delivering results.”

        Lou Fischler, a top analyst at Banyan Capital Markets, has
        written an in-depth research report his firm has issued to
        initiate coverage on The Neptune Society. He took time to talk to
        us this week. “The company has a good story to tell. Management
        took a fragmented group of partnerships and unified them into one
        efficient, consolidated, public company. Taking over the
        operations and financially engineering them into one operating
        company is impressive. They can now start to focus on
        accelerating their marketing, producing growth, and implementing
        their business model.

        “The company’s true operating adjusted cash-flow for the first
        quarter was approximately $500,000. Now with its operating
        structure firmly in place, it is positioned to concentrate more
        of its resources to drive Pre-Need sales and generate more and
        more cash flow. Because of Neptune’s revenue recognition policy
        and significant non-cash expenses, its reported financial results
        tend to understate its real operating performance. As a result,
        cash flow is more relevant in determining value than net earnings
        for this company. The management at the Neptune Society has
        jumped some very high hurdles and landed on its feet. The company
        is a major player in its industry and its year-over-year numbers
        are outstanding.”

        Sound Interesting? Take a look at these bullet points:

        The Neptune Society offers new investors and current shareholders
        a fundamentally sound business model and four unique elements
        that are significant to growth.

        EXISTING ASSETS
        When the trust was established in 1988 its beginning marker was
        $0. In 1994 it had risen to $16 million and now, in 2001, the
        total pre-funded cremation arrangements exceed $40 million. With
        Neptune's continued expansion, estimates for the fund are $74
        million by 2004.

        SALES
        The trust supports a growing bottom line. Cremation costs 50-80%
        less than traditional burials and Pre-Need contracts at the
        Neptune Society have grown at an annual compound rate of 32.7%
        from 1998 to 2000 with a historical cancellation rate for
        Pre-Need services at less than one percent.

        REVENUES
        In addition to the company’s main channels of revenues, the
        Neptune Society also benefits from sales that include
        registration services like a travel rider that ranges from
        $50-300, and is immediately recognized as revenue and an 8%
        interest charge in California and Oregon on Pre-Need installment
        programs

        SOLID MANAGEMENT
        During the past two years, a talented group of four senior
        executives has been recruited to operate Neptune.  Collectively,
        these executives possess substantial functional expertise and
        over 100 years of combined experience in the cremation industry.

        Marco Markin became the first member of Neptune’ current
        management team when he became a member of Neptune’s Board of
        Directors in June 1999 and its President and Chief Executive
        Officer (CEO) in September 1999.

        David L. Schroeder was recruited to be Neptune’s Chief Operating
        Officer (COO) on June 1, 2000, and became a Director and its
        Secretary in November 2000.

        Rodney M. Bagley became a Director, the Chief Financial Officer
        and the Treasurer of Neptune in November 2000.

        Gary I. Harris became Neptune’s National Sales Manager and a
        Director in March 2000.
