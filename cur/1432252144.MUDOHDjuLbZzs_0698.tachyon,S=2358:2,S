   from the but-i-love-clicky-keyboards dept.
   [1]stinerman writes "Three students at UC-Berkley used a 10 minute
   [2]recording of a keyboard to recover 96% of the characters typed
   during the session. The article details that their methods did not
   require a 'training text' in order to calibrate the conversion
   algorithm as has been used previously. The [3]research paper [PDF]
   notes that '90% of 5-character random passwords using only letters can
   be generated in fewer than 20 attempts by an adversary; 80% of
   10-character passwords can be generated in fewer than 75 attempts.'"
