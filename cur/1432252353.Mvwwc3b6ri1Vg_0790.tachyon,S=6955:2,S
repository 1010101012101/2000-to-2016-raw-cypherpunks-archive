...............................................

Folks, John Berlau did it again with his expose of the 50,000 “research” audits 
planned by the IRS. It seems that a lot of you objected, and he created a 
"delicate situation" for them. Sorry about that. It’s still posted in case you 
missed it http://www.insightmag.com/news/257505.html. And find out why the big 
business associations are cozying up to the terrorists 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/257525.html. Read on for more doings in 
Washington. Until next time, I remain your newsman in the Bunker.

WHY IS BIG BUSINESS JUMPING IN BED WITH TERROR?

James Edwards asks in the war against terrorism, just whose side is big business 
on? Surprisingly, perhaps, big business' Washington mouthpieces — including the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and 
the National Restaurant Association — increasingly have become cozier with 
radical leftists.

THE PLEDGE FIASCO---HOW COULD IT COME TO THIS?

been made in the first place.

New evidence reveals why Benjamin Franklin was the key to America's       
independence 



Of the many roles Benjamin Franklin played in his storied life, he is perhaps 
most familiar as America's first genius experimenter and inventor.  Yet in this 
groundbreaking new biography, award-winning biographer James Srodes shows why 
Franklin's greatest invention may have been America herself.  Indeed, in 
FRANKLIN: THE ESSENTIAL FOUNDING FATHER, Srodes argues, "without Benjamin 
Franklin, there may not have been an independent United States."  Order your
