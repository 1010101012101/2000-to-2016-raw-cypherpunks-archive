Really? Provide a reference to such an algorithm? Determining if a
arbitrary message is encrypted using some arbitrary algorithm is identical
to language translation, a poorly understood operation at best.

The best I've seen so far is to take random space delimited samples of the
text and determine if they fit a particular language dictionary. If they
don't fit then it is more likely to be encrypted.

That's still a long way from your claim.
