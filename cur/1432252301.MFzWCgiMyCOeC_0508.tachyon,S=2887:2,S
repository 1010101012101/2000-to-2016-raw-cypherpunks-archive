You do not date it by the datestamp, you date it by the events 
to which Robert Fisk refers.

I do not think you have read the article.

Here is Fisk's article http://tinyurl.com/995f

Here is the mainstream article http://tinyurl.com/9966

They contradict each other.  Therefore one or both is lying.  
Since we now have good cause to believe the mainstream article 
true, it follows that Robert Fisk is lying.

Probably Fisk did not know where the American forces were, but 
he assured the reader, with great confidence, that he did know.

He claimed to have confirmed Baghdad Bob's account -- the 
account of the Iraqi minister of information, an account that 
events proved to be hilariously false.  In this article Fisk 
claims, claims with enormous confidence and certainty, to 
confirm a speech by Baghdad Bob that caused much hilarity among 
those less credulous.
