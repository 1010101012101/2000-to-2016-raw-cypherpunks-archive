 >>...He pled guilty, agreeing to a plea bargain

There are numerous examples of the plea bargain cosh being bought down 
heavily on an innocent person.
Its routinely abused as was seen at mike moores sisters home town story

By betraying such ignorance of oppression/repression in practise you've 
earned my consignment to cornhole corner.
Squeal like a pig!

"Theoretically, because violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 
1986 have been included in the terrorism crackdown, hackers and spammers 
could be sentenced to life in prison."
