You're still thinking like a nice middle-class person with a normal job. 
People who are serious about participating in black markets use human and 
technological cutouts to do their business, as well as good old-fashioned 
graft and corruption. In some criminal cultures, prison time is a badge of 
honor. In many criminal cultures, it's low-level disposable people who 
commit the actual crimes - it's the John Gottis and the Pablo Escobars and 
the Dick Nixons back sleeping in their beds who profit from it.

If it was easy to stop crime by passing laws, we'd have done it already.

Consider Jim Bell in light of your objections above - do you consider him 
"controlled"? If so, then the control you speak of is hardly sufficient to 
prevent forbidden activity. If not, then what makes you think that other, 
more clueful people can be controlled?
