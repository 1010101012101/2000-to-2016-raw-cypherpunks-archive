Zenaan, i am very sorry, that my English is not good enough for serious
discussions and i don't have time. But there you are!
Sometimes, you just write my thoughts (which are not on English :)). So
this time, at least, i must say thank you. I salute you. I often read such
sensible ideas on Russian, but rare, very rare on English.
I don't know who you are from, but if you are from the "west", -
congratulations! You are free from the "USA-WEST propaganda machine".

The truth must be spread (it's not high flown words). Although it's not a
guarantee of changes, but it might be a very important step toward it.
The hatred, the hypocrisy and the lawlessness of the US must be stopped.
Or, at least, minimized. With bold English speakers like you are, there is
hope.

Thank you very much again. On behalf of all people, that want peace,
cooperation and justice. Instead of money, lies, influence and a constant
search for enemies (like the US representatives and their watch dogs).

With respect,
Alexander.
