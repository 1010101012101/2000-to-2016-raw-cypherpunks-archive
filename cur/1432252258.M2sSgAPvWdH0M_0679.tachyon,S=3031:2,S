Hackers aren't quite ready to wage war on censors
A group of hackers has decided to pull the launch of its ambitious 
file-sharing project designed to trounce censorship. The project, named 
Peekabooty was announced last year by hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, 
apparently needs more work before it can be unleashed. Originally the group 
promised to unveil the P2P software at the Def Con conference for hackers.
