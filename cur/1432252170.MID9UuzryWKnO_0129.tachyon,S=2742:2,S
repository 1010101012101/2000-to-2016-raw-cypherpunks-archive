I just tried a can of compressed air (upside down so it sprays liquid), It
is really,
1,1,1,2 Tetrafluoroehtane, not air.  But anyway.  It doesn't make a
security envelope transparent but it does for plain old white envelopes.

You can pick the stuff up at Radio Shack if you want to try it out
yourself.  Just be careful not to freeze your hands when the liquid comes
streaming out of the nozzle.
