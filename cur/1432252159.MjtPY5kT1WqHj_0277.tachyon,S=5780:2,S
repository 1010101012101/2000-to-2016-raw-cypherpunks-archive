How do you get around the possibility that the Fed will simply look up the 
IP address of the APst
 AP website via DNS, find out who the ISP is, and make the ISP give up the 
name of the person being billed for the server's access?
The naming scheme used isn't DNS, it's a Fling based hierarchical-naming 
scheme that just looks very similar to DNS from a nontechnical users point 
of view. It looks up "route balls" (the technique used to untraceably set 
up a data stream) rather than IP addresses. it's also based on a 
"peer-to-peer root plane" rather than the single (coercible, corruptable, 
unsubtle) primary root that DNS uses.
Making the IP adress unfindable is a primary goal of Fling.
Speech without limits
Fling is a new suite of internet protocols that perform the function of 
DNS, TCP, and UDP in a manner that's both untraceable and untappable. Fling 
protects clients from servers, servers from clients, and both from an 
eavesdropper in-between. The result is that anyone can serve or retrieve 
any data, without fear of censure.
