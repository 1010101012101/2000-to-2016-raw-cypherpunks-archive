If I were the Fedz (and I'm not :-), I would *immediately* size the entire 
pot by declaring them to be "Proceeds from drug activity", and then let 
each donator go and try to prove otherwise.  This tactic is widely abused 
(despite the obviousness of it being patently unconstitutional, the SCOTUS 
has ruled otherwise on several cases: individual States, as well as the 
Fedz that came up with this idea of "Sieze first, "let the perps argue 
over it later - if they really want too".  Turns out that very few 
siezures are ever contested (imagine that!?!?!?), out of fear of being 
further persecution.  In fact, YT has a vast collection of examples in HD, 
where you can see the pigs in action: "I'm siezing that $200,000 as 
proceeds from a drug conspiracy. If you want to contest it, we'll arrest 
you for conspiracy to engage in the distribution of controlled substances, 
otherwise, you can just sign this handy little waiver form which says you 
are OK with this siezure, because the money isn't yours and you never saw 
it before, and if you sign it, we'll let you just walk away.".  Literal 
Highway Robbery.  Fed, SCOTUS, and usually, Population Approved. 
*Digusting*!

Both of these are great points which I hadn't thought of.
