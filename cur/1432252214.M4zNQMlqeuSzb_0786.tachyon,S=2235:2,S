That is it.  This is the ghost of cypherpunks.

Cypherpunks always was a self contradiction - a
political group pushing a fundamentally non political
attack upon the state, and thus upon the very existence
of politics.

This made some sense when the state was attempting to
ban and regulate encryption.  It no longer attempts to
do so, thus cypherpunks today has no real function.
Our former evil arch nemesis is now quietly doing
government do gooding to make sure that everyone has
strong cryptography.   Now the cypherpunks project is
advanced by more boring stuff: standards, software, and
business.  Excessive mention of the ideological
implications of certain standards and software would be
counterproductive.
