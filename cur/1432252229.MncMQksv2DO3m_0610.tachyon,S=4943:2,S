There is configuration info for some common sound devices.

Only people with a device for which a configuration file does
not already exist. If you have to do this, you can send your
file to the Turbid maintainer so others can use it without
having to do the measurements themselves.

Of course, then there is a trust issue. The maintainer may
not have the device in question, so he cannot verify. If
you want to verify, you are back to building a cable.
Without verification, it looks as though someone could
subvert Turbid for a device by submitting a suitably
bogus parameter file.

I'd also like to see a default parameter file, guaranteed
to give some entropy on a lowest common denominator
device. I'm not sure if that is possible.
