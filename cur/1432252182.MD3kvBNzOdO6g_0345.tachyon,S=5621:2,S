Here's an article off the Lightreading website. Probably nothing new for 
this list, but it does bring together a number of interesting ideas. Are we 
seeing the birth of blacknet here? And now imagining adding telephony to 
Blacknet...

Two of the hottest applications in networking -- peer-to-peer networks and 
instant messaging -- are being combined in the form of private P2P networks 
that are taking shape in the more secretive corners of the Internet, 
industry insiders say.

The most popular software for creating these private networks is WASTE, 
which enables anyone with a computer and a Net connection to set up a 
private peer-to-peer network over the Internet.

Between the FBI and the Justice Department and the Record Industry of 
America Association cracking down on file sharing, it was only a matter of 
time before users found a more secure, private way to swap software and 
music, says Brian Bruns, security administrator at SOSDG (Summit Open 
Source Development Group). The SOSDG hosts one of about 30 different sites 
where the WASTE software can be downloaded for free.

WASTE differs from P2P networks like Kazaa and Limewire as it creates a 
closed network for instant messaging and file-sharing with trusted users. 
The person running the network has to swap a key with potential users before 
they are allowed on the network. An encryption layer is then set up between 
two computers using private keys to authenticate the parties. Up to 50 
people can be on one network.

There are thousands of copies out there, but theres no way to tell exactly 
how many people are using it, as its designed to be secure, says Bruns.

WASTE was developed a year ago by developer Justin Frankel, founder of 
Nullsoft. AOL (NYSE: TWX - message board) acquired Nullsoft for its Winamp 
MP3 software, and while Frankel was with the company he wrote WASTE. However 
it was deemed to be an unauthorized project, according to Bruns, and AOL 
yanked it.

Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research Ltd., says anything 
believed to encourage illegal file sharing would have a major black mark 
against it, which is probably why AOL scrapped the project after posting it 
on a site for one day.

He says the crackdown by the RIAA on illegal file sharing has fueled the 
distribution of this software. The more consequences there are for actions, 
the more the activity is driven underground Criminals dont hold public 
meetings, Gartenberg says.

Its a way to chat without having someone watching you, says Bruns. His 
open source group took a copy of the entire WASTE site as it was posted on 
AOL, and stored it away for future use. It has since been distributed 
widely, including to SourceForge, which has worked on improving the original 
code.

Gartenberg notes that WASTE is unlikely to reach the lofty heights of fame 
achieved by Kazaa, which has been downloaded over 200 million times. With 
WASTE you have to know someone in the network, it closes down the number of 
people available, he says.

Still, the concept of private or personal P2P networks might still find its 
way into the mainstream, courtesy of Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT - message 
board). The software giant is trialing a program called www.threedegrees.com 
(nothing to do with the 70s pop divas, it seems), which allows users to 
create small private networks of up to 10 people to exchange instant 
messages, animations, pictures and music.

Right now the software is part of Microsofts NetGen division, which aims to 
develop products aimed at 13- to 24-year-olds, but there are broader 
implications for this product within the corporate world. Think of 
workgroups collaborating on documents or powerpoint presentations.

Microsoft had not returned calls for comment by press time.
