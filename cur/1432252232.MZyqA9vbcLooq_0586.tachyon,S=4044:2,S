Pretty interesting.  I wonder if he has an interesting new patent
unencumbered way to do ecash, and if he's going to make it patent
free.  Chaum, Brands and now Chaum II.  All speculation, of course,
but that'd be a real interesting shake-out of the ecash patent
minefield, and much kudos would be afford Dr Chaum who currently gets
perhaps more blame than fair for DigiCash burn out.  Perhaps a
protocol by him, with his patent background, might get more attention
than Wagner et al's pk MAC + ZKP of non-coin marking, if he could
organise some physical entity around it.

Did anyone who was there get a better idea of what Dr Chaum is up to?

Actually if (1) is really patent unencumbered, what it needs is some
organisation (a suggestion Bob) to provide demos, business
presentations and offer suit friendly support and legal
interpretations of the protocol's patent unemcumberedness, and it
could perhaps itself compete head on with Chaum I patents now held by
ECashTechnologies, and to some extent with Brands/Zero-Knowledge.
You've got to provide suits something to hold onto in the physical
world -- they really want to part with money, so you've got to
construct something to sell them a license to: a software library,
technical support from your collection of cryptographers or something,
anything that allows them to feel corporately assured.
