I found the article 'Five Myths about the Chinese Internet' a very useful read,
especially as regards savvy-factor of users. We in the West love to generalise
'the situation' in China but often have little or no idea as to the scale, scope
or dynamics at play. Another reason I find it particularly valuable to be
reading people on this list that are operating there.

The article was walled off at ForeignPolicy.com (ironically) but is available
here in its entirety:

    Five Myths about the Chinese Internet: 

    http://strategicstudyindia.blogspot.de/2012/11/five-myths-about-chinese-internet.html

    "Chinese Internet users are cosmopolitan, educated, and informed. Many use,
    or at least know they can use, circumvention technology like VPNs (Virtual
    Private Networks) to access blocked content."

Cheers,
