"...PRC recently teamed with Litton Data Systems Division and was awarded a 
cooperative research agreement with US Army CECOM Space and Terrestrial 
Communication Division to extend Security Kinetix to the Tactical Internet, 
the Army's hand-held computer-based radio network for the digitized 
battlefield. Under this effort, we will modify the Security Kinetix 
capability creating information protection agents that are capable of 
sustaining operations under a variety of communication constraints to 
protect critical information on deployed hardware. These specialized agents 
will be equipped with a configurable arsenal of countermeasures to deal 
with the particular security risks posed by the Tactical Internet."
