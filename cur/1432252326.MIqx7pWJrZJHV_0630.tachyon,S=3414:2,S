The assumption that "having cracked a cipher" leads to "can make lots
of money from the break" is one held mostly by those who have never
attacked real systems, which have evolved with lots of checks and
balances.

The very best way to make money from cracking ciphers seems to be to
patent the break, and the fixes, and then consult to those who use the
cipher, because they need your expertise to fix their systems.  P. may
have a patent on this method.
