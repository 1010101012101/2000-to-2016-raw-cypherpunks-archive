I have long believed that instead of raising the debt ceiling all at once (=
say, $500 billion), Congress should raise it $XYZ-million per day. =C2=A0 T=
hus government is not given a go-ahead to waste huge amounts of money at on=
e time. =C2=A0Further, I think that Congress could, and should, condition t=
he continuation of this $XYZ-million/day increase on, say, a weekly vote of=
 Congress, one in which only a 50% vote in both houses is necessary and suf=
ficient, cannot be filibustered and one which Obama doesn't get to veto. Co=
ngress could also interpose any sorts of new restrictions on what this mone=
y can be spent for, meaning that any prior directives by Congress (especial=
ly by a Democrat-controlled Congress) would be null and void. =C2=A0Effecti=
vely, Congress could completely re-write the budget without approval by eit=
her the Democrats or Obama.
The LACK of such a system is yet another reason I believe that John Boehner=
 is a loser: =C2=A0It is said that Congress has "the power of the purse", b=
ut since it doesn't use it, that is becoming a disaster.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
