I spoke to one of Paul's aides about the scorecard, and he said (I'm 
paraphrasing) that his boss voted against the bill in part because it was 
flawed, and not just on knee-jerk federalism grounds or whatnot.

I've also written about the law, and I agree it's flawed, but I still 
decided to count it as a net positive.
