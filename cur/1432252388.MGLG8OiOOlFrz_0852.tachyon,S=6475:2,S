You didn't say "need not die," you said they _don't_ die.

As for all people having healthcare, I personally know people who 
_don't_ have healthcare. This refutes your point by example.

Yes, it is my "right" to turn them away. Just as it is my "right" to 
not feed those on the verge of starvation, not house those sleeping 
in the snow and rain, and not pay for lifesaving operations.

Earth to Dave: people die every day because they cannot afford a 
transplant they need (and which medical science has figured out how 
to do). What is at all surprising about this?

What happens? Evolution procedes apace. Those who figure out how to 
work hard, save from their paychecks, and prepare for the future will 
do better than those who don't.

Sounds fair to me.

More than just fair, it's going to happen. It already is. I see a 
widening gap between the Prepared and the Unprepared. And this is a 
Good Thing.

Crypto anarchy will sharply accelerate this trend. And this is an 
Even Better Thing.
