Better still, this lovely little ceramic knife 
http://www.argussupply.com/images/boker-2040.gif is street legal

The only solution is to do what many other nations have
successfully done.  Arm the crew and tell them to stop any
hijacking by whatever means it takes.

Against a disarmed crew under orders to cooperate, any weapon
will be sufficient.  Against an armed crew under orders to die
fighting, no weapon will be sufficient.
