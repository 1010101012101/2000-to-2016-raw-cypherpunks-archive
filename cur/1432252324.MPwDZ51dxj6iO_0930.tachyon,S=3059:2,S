I'm not sure what the comment alludes to as it includes a ;-), but you
can find multiple collisions against the same email address on the
same day, viz:

0:030514:frantz@pwpconsult.com:49916794a98728f2
0:030514:frantz@pwpconsult.com:ffbead9be92472a3

etc.  In fact they are also this way because you want there to be a
relatively low probability of there being an accidental collision in
the tokens created by different users sending you mail.  

The example implementation chooses the random string from a 2^64
space, however on average only 2^44 of those will be valid tokens (if
you use 20 bit collisions), and so if you imagine someone receiving
256 mails in a day, they have a birthday probability of 2^-29 of
having a mail falsely deleted because of an accidental collision.

I guess that is a fairly low probability compared to email
reliability, but anyway the safety margin can be increased simply by
increasing the random string search space.
