But probably faster than factoring a 2048-bit modulus, no?  (of course, once you 
have the contents, you still might have to do that)

Not being familiar with NMR, I wonder if it would be equally effective on 
CD-ROM, CD-R and/or CD-RW.  CD-ROM has a solid physical geometry to it, but 
recordables would be less physically definite, I'd think.  Antidote to my 
ignoragce is welcome.
