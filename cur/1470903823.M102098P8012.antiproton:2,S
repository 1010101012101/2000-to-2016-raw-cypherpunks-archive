And now they call for killing Julian Assange.

So much killing. And war. War, war, and more killing.

That's the "democratic" way these days I guess, or at least, it appears
to be the way of the North American DNC/ Democratic National Committee...

The crazies from the basement have definitely overrun the house.

** Hillary Clinton strategist says “kill” Julian Assange, because “a
dead man can’t leak stuff” [Video]

NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 26: TV personality Alex Trebek (R) and hosts of
'The Five' (L-R) Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling attend FOX News' "The Five"

Democratic strategist, CNN Host, former Fox News Host, and Hillary
Clinton supporter Bob Beckel…

has figured out how to deal with the Julian Assange thorn, that is in
Clinton’s side…

Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel called for WikiLeaks editor Julian
Assange to be assassinated. #DNCLeak

Julian Assange’s latest revelation that has Bob Beckel calling for his
assassination…the DNC email hack (that the Clinton machine cleverly
diverted into a Putin-Trump imaginary bromance) was most likely leaked,
not by Russians, but by 27 year old Democratic staffer Seth Rich
(http://theduran.com/julian-assange-hints-murdered-democratic-staffer-seth-rich-source-dnc-email-leak-not-russia-video/)
, who was mysteriously (and conveniently) murdered right after the DNC
leak.

Here is what Bob Beckel said…

“The way to deal with this is pretty simple. We’ve got special-op
forces.

I mean — A dead man can’t leak stuff.

This guy’s a traitor, a treasonous — and — and he — he has broken every
law of the United States, The guy ought to be — and I am not for the
death penalty, so if I am not for the death penalty, their is only one
way to do it…

Illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”

What if a Trump surrogate or supporter had said this, or something
remotely like this?

Meanwhile, Clinton murdering Assange may not be too far fetch, as bodies
in and around the Hillary campaign are starting to pile up as Zerohedge
documents
(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-10/wikileaks-assange-hints-murdered-dnc-staffer-was-email-leaker-offers-20k-reward-info)
…”Five in just under six weeks – four convenient deaths plus one
suicide…”

1) Shawn Lucas
(http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/breaking-lead-attorney-dnc-fraud-case-found-dead-1-week-serving-dnc-papers/)
, Sanders supporter who served papers to DNC on the Fraud Case (DOD
August 2, 2016)

2) Victor Thorn, Clinton author
(http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-prominent-anti-hillary-clinton-researcher-found-dead-54/)
(and Holocaust denier, probably the least credible on this list) shot
himself in an apparent suicide. Conspiracy theorists at Mystery Writers
of America said some guys will do anything to sell books. (DOD August,
2016)

3) Seth Conrad Rich
(http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/breaking-lead-attorney-dnc-fraud-case-found-dead-1-week-serving-dnc-papers/)
, Democratic staffer, aged 27, apparently on his way to speak to the FBI
about a case possibly involving the Clintons. The D.C. murder was not a
robbery. (DOD July 8, 2016)

4) John Ashe, UN official who allegedly crushed his own throat while
lifting weights, because he watched too many James Bond films and wanted
to try the move where the bad guy tries to…oh, never mind. “He was
scheduled to testify against the Clintons and the Democrat Party
(http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/breaking-lead-attorney-dnc-fraud-case-found-dead-1-week-serving-dnc-papers/)
.” (DOD June 22, 2016)

5) Mike Flynn, the Big Government Editor for Breitbart News. Mike
Flynn’s final article was published the day he died, “Clinton Cash:
Bill, Hillary Created Their Own Chinese Foundation in 2014
(http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/23/clinton-created-chinese-foundation/)
.” (DOD June 23, 2016)
