Schools must give police blueprints

ALBANY - Schools will be required to submit copies of their building
plans to local police and fire departments under legislation recently
signed into law by Gov. George Pataki.

The legislation, proposed by Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, D-Cohoes,
was inspired by last year's shootings at Columbine High School.
Canestrari said police at the scene in Colorado did not have floor plans
for the school building, which slowed their response to the tragedy.

When he introduced the bill last year, Canestrari said a spot check of
school districts in the Capital Region showed that some already share
building plans with local public safety officials. But others did not,
and there was no such mandate in state law, he said.

Canestrari's "School Emergency Preparedness Act," sponsored in the
Senate by Vincent Leibell, R-Patterson, is to take effect in March 2001.
