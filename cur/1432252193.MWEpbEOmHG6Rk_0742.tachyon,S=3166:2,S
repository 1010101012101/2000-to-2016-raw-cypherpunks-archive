Oh - I'd misunderstood.  Yes, that sounds much harder to forge,
so it's actually useful for DOS reduction.

There are two reasons to use the CA.
One is if the parties don't know each other (not a problem here),
but the other is so the VPN receiver has some external validation
on the data it receives, making MITM attacks harder.
For applications like BGP, you don't care if the CA is
Dun & Bradstreet or if it's just Alice's own CA,
because it's really functioning as a shared secret
but the commodity VPN hardware wants an X.509 cert
for MITM protection.
