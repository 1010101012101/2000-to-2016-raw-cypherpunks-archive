Although the ruling only appears to apply to one's home it does raise 
questions whether citizens may have the right to prevent their observation 
while in public.  After all one is permitted tinted windows on 
autos.  Despite certain city/county ordinances why not masks or helmets 
with tinted faceplates.  What if exoskeletons become practical?  Shouldn't 
they be treated the same as an auto?
