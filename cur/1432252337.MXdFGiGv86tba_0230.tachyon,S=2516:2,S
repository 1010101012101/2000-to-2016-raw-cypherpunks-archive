"CJ" is "CJ Parker", who posted a few emails to this list back in
early 2003? I guess I haven't been around long enough to know all
famous cpunks who have been posting to the list. Maybe someone could
tell in short who those were, I guess there are one or two on the
list who weren't around and would appreciate the stories.

I think I remember having read about Bell, something about him having
threatened FBI agents or something?

Does Jim Bell post emails somewhere today?
