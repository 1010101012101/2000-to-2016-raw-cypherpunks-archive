Virtually everyone who visits the WTC site reports the same effect:
they are astonished by the scale of the devastation, utterly beyond
from what they have seen in photos and on TV.  Then they take pictures,
and guess what: they are no different from anyone else's pictures.
Pictures show a tiny window into the scene; but you have to be there in
360 degree reality to get the full impact.

John seems to have experienced the same thing.  His memories are overlayed
onto the photos, making them for him part of a larger reality.  But to
a viewer, they are no different from what we have seen from the other
news media.  They just show broken metal.  You can get the same thing
at the local junkyard.
