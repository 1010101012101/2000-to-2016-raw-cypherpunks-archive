 >Hi, Could you send it on, now that you've picqued my interest?

After receiving a number of offlist queries, I've decided to post the
url for the post I referred to.

For a slightly humorous, but thought-provoking address on how memory failure
may encroach when questions stray from the pertinent, see

<http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.98.11.30-98.12.06/msg00103.html>

Will the real Anonymous please stand up?

Reese
