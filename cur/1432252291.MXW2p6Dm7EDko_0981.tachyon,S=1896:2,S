There was a weapons charge -- Molotov cocktail -- in the first indictment 
which was dropped.

The second indictment was for the single charge of distribution of 
information, to wit:

  18:842(p)(2)(A) Distribution of Information Relating to Explosives,
  Destructive Devices and Weapons of Mass Destruction

  http://cryptome.org/usa-v-sma-dkt2.htm

Mac's right that this kind of information is idiot cousin of controlled
substances. Law is an prejudiced ass.

That is why Sherman, a minority youngster, took a hit in cracker 
Southern California while two old honkies on the Left Coast addicted 
to 1A who offer the same information get no re-education sentence 
at all -- well, as the Boston youngster wrote "yet."
