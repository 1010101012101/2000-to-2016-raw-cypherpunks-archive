To add;
It was surprising (to me) that Chaum should be the one to produce the first
of the modern 'solving the key escrow problem' algorithms. Academia has
been ignoring this particular problem for quite a while - I expect that
more proposed solutions will follow, solutions that will be more difficult
to prove insecure...

PT sounds like its rooted in threat models & crypto systems from 10-15
years ago - I'm not sure why anyone would migrate to this system - over
anything presently available (unless everything else is made illegal, of
course).

Check out cMix's 'beta' paper & make attacks as necessary.
http://www.scribd.com/doc/294737065/cMix-Anonymization-by-High-Performance-Scalable-Mixing

Some of Chaum's earlier work involved designing systems with arbiters where
3rd parties could prove evidence of misdeeds - this system, using threshold
secret sharing (right?), doesn't expose the same properties.

Which means that, of course, operators of routers are free to collude and
subject to TAO from various IA.
