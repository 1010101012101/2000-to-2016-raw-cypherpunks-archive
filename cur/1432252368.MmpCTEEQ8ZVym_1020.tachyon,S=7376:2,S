No, reading bits from platters or the bus is a partial analysis of
the whole firmware question. It's already been suggested in links
how firmware can hook the users unencrypted boot binaries through
to the users kernel. For that matter, a modified boot chain could
be stored in the service area.

A user would have to use SecureBoot, TPM, IOMMU, TXT, GELI and
perhaps other things, all of them properly, having no holes, together,
right now, at least three of which they are unlikely to have
ubiquitous access to until a couple hardware generations or personal
refresh cycles into the future. An ideal full solution for which
is yet to come. Not to mention needing to install it all cleanly
(from BTW, an install image which has no reproducible build and no
cryptographic chain back to the insecure unsigned source repo
anyways).

But yeah, let's talk circular instead of about possible actually
coding defense in depth such as maybe blocking the most common
easiest path a malicious opcode will likely take to irrepairably
infect clean hardware in the first place... through the drivers ...

It's already been talked how this tech will be integrated into
everyday run of the mill malware. And how users will be subject to
infected drives via second purchase, inheritance (both from other
people and from other operating systems), use of hosting services,
trading, booting CD's, etc. Persistant malware in users boot chains
is nasty, users don't have to be of interest or be targeted, the
code doesn't care, grandma's surfbox could get it.

Depends on the design. The hacking links or docs from the
drive/chip vendors would be more helpful there.
