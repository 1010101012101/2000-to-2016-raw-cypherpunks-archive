Okay, point well taken. But then again, you might want to look into forming an
aggregated estimate of the street value of the women you actually end up with
and...oh well, nevermind. LOL

Compare the sum total of misery in this world to the sum total of happiness and
get back to me. Read some Schopenhauer and early Nietzsche, you'd probably find 
a lot to agree with too.

No, not at all. If you prefer spending time with psychotics and alcoholics, go
right ahead, I have no interest in stopping anyone. Though misery, squalor, and
death are pretty good indicators of a destructive relationship. Of course,
YMMV. However, the upside is that some people are such disgustingly wretched
specimens they truly deserve each other. l'enfer, c'est les autres. 100% pure
Darwinian justice. Or something. 

>You are a bigot.

Care to broaden that out to "misanthrope"? 
You bet. ;)
