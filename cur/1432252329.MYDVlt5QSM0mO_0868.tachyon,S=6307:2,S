Kenya: Publisher jailed over magazine story. The publisher of "Finance" 
magazine, Njehu Gatabaki, has been sentenced to six months' imprisonment 
over an article entitled "Moi ordered the Molo Massacre". The main story, 
which appeared in the magazine's December 1997 issue, dealt with killings 
which occurred in Molo, Kenya, just prior to the 1997 general election.
A court in Nairobi found Gatabaki, who is also a member of Parliament in 
Kenya, guilty of "publishing an alarming publication," reported the Network 
for the Defence of Independent Media in Africa (NDIMA) as relayed by IFEX.
But Gatabaki told the magistrate that he had suffered for publishing the 
truth. "The truth will set this country free. The articles were true. I'm 
ready to bear that burden of bringing the message to Kenyans."
Gatabaki, who was unrepresented, was given 14 days to appeal against the 
sentence. Judge Ms Karanja said that she had considered the publisher's 
mitigation, which she described as little more than a political speech.
"I've taken cognisance [of] the fact that the accused is [a] lawmaker who 
should be making laws and not breaking them. This is why this conviction 
should be taken very seriously," she said.
