Lucre coins can _only_ be verified by the bank. However, only the payee
needs to be talking to the bank (the payer gives the payee an unblinded
coin), and can, at their own risk, defer that conversation (the risk
being a double-spend, of course). Double-blinding refers to a method
using two blinding factors, not any other weird combination you might
have thought of :-)

Cheers,

Ben.
