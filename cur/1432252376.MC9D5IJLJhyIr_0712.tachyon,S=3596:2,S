"The term anarchy comes from the Greek, and essentially means 'no ruler.' 
Anarchists are people who reject all forms of government or coercive 
authority, all forms of hierarchy and domination. They are therefore 
opposed to what the Mexican anarchist Flores Magon called the 'sombre 
trinity' -- state, capital and the church. Anarchists are thus opposed to 
both capitalism and to the state, as well as to all forms of religious 
authority. But anarchists also seek to establish or bring about by varying 
means, a condition of anarchy, that is, a decentralised society without 
coercive institutions, a society organised through a federation of 
voluntary associations. Contemporary 'right-wing' libertarians . . . who 
are often described as 'anarchocapitalists' and who fervently defend 
capitalism, are not in any real sense anarchists." [Op. Cit., p. 38]
Rather than call themselves by a name which reflects their origins in 
liberalism (and not anarchism), the "anarcho"-capitalists have instead seen 
fit to try and appropriate the name of anarchism and, in order to do so, 
ignore key aspects of anarchist theory in the process. Little wonder, then, 
they try and prove their anarchist credentials via dictionary definitions 
rather than from the anarchist movement itself
