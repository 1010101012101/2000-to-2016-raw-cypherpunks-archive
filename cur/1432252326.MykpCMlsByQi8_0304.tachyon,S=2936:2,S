Estonia plans to raise between 1e8 and 1.5e8 dollars
for a project to begin next year, to "compile DNA
profiles and health information on75%ofthe country's 
1.4 million citizens" ... "by contrast, [to Iceland's anonymity]
the data and DNA samples in the Estonian project will be
identifiable through a coded system."

The project will keep samples too; citizens can opt out
and samples will be destroyed.

_Science v 290 6 Oct 2000 p 31 "Estonia prepares for national DNA
database"

(And I realize this still doesn't make Estonia part of Scandanavia.. :-)
