Judges have never attempted such crap, and if they do, lawyers will irrelevant, and will have been irrelevant for a long time before the such anyone attempts such crap.

These guys (Black Unicorn and his cheer squad) are loons, and I cannot imagine why they post such nonsense.

The argument they seem to be making is that judges, legislators, and bureaucrats are becoming increasingly lawless, therefore we should treat lawyers with worshipful respect.  But that argument is completely back to front.  As governments become more lawless, laws and lawyers become less 
relevant, not more relevant.  As government becomes more lawless, first one hires fixers in place of lawyers, then whores in place of fixers, then gunmen in place of whores.   American business in general is moving towards fixers, biotech is already largely past fixers to whores, and in Russia it 
is gunmen.
