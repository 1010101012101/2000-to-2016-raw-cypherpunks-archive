 Commie bullshit.

They are not poor because western capitalists are hiring
them.  They are poor because western capitalists are
prevented from hiring them.

Closing down the "sweatshops" makes third world people
poorer, not richer.  The poorest asian countries are those
that tightly controlled their economies and excluded foreign
enterprises, notably India, Vietnam, Nepal, and Burma.

The richest are those places that a few decades ago were
supposedly being oppressed for sweatshop labor by the evil
capitalists -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan.

Today the "sweatshops" are primarily in markedly less
capitalist places, notably Vietnam.
