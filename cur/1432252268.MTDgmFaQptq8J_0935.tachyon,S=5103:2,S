The article is total nonsense.  For instance, Americium-242 has a half
life of 150 years, and decays through isomeric transition.  

It looks like disinformation trawled under the nose of
www.whatreallyhappened.com, so that if they ever publish anything which
pisses off "They Who Can Not Be Criticized," the article can be pointed to
as an example of idiocy which has appeared on the site.
