*Stanley Kubrick Confesses To Faking The Moon Landings*

A stunning new video has emerged 15 years after Stanley Kubrick=E2=80=99s d=
eath in
which Kubrick allegedly admits that the NASA moon landings were faked.

Filmmaker T. Patrick Murray says he interviewed Kubrick three days before
his death in March 1999. He was forced to sign an 88-page NDA to keep the
contents of the interview a secret for 15 years.

Below is a transcript from the interview with Stanley Kubrick, in which the
2001 Space Odyssey Director admits on camera that, =E2=80=9Cthe moon landin=
gs ALL
were faked , and that I was the person who filmed it.=E2=80=9D

We have included a leaked rough cut of the film below the transcript as
well as two unedited raw videos of the interview with Kubrick below that:










































































*K: I=E2=80=99m so preoccupied. With my work, innovation, risk-taking, regr=
ets=E2=80=A6T:
Why are you giving this interview?K: Because, it started to get to me after
awhile. Well, this is difficult, because it is the first time I=E2=80=99ve =
talked
about it. (sighs)T: Sure, take all the time you need.K: I=E2=80=99ve always=
 been
conflicted by it, but not consciously until years later. I was just blown
away by the chance, the opportunity, the challenge of making this, this
production, and I went into this like it was a regular film, like another
regular film of mine, not thinking too much about uh the long term effects
of what it would mean to society if it was ever discovered.T: What are you
talking about? I=E2=80=99m dying to know what you=E2=80=99re talking about.=
K: Well, a
confession of sorts. A movie I made, that nobody is aware of =E2=80=93 even=
 though
they=E2=80=99ve seen it.T: A movie you made, no one knows you made? Is that=
 what
you said?K: That=E2=80=99s right. Is that intriguing? Do I have you intrigu=
ed?K: I
perpetrated a huge fraud on the American public, which I am now about to
detail, involving the United States government and NASA, that the moon
landings were faked, that the moon landings ALL were faked , and that I was
the person who filmed it.T: Ok. (laughs) What are you talking=E2=80=A6You=
=E2=80=99re
serious. Ok.K: I=E2=80=99m serious. Dead serious.K: Yes, it was fake.T: Ok.=
 Wait.
Wait=E2=80=A6T: I don=E2=80=99t want this to be an R-rated film, but seriou=
sly, what the
blank, but seriously=E2=80=A6T: I, I, I worked almost eight months to secur=
e this
once in a lifetime interview that almost no else could ever get, and
instead of talking about his sixteen films that I=E2=80=99ve endured since =
I was a
child=E2=80=A6That we didn=E2=80=99t land on the moon, you=E2=80=99re sayin=
g?K: No, we didn=E2=80=99t.K: It
was not real.T: The moon landings were fake?K: A, a, a.. fictional moon
landing. A fantasy. It was not real.K: Don=E2=80=99t you think it=E2=80=99s=
 important for
people to know the truth?T: The moon landing in =E2=80=9969, which was two =
years
before my birth=E2=80=A6K: Is total fiction.T: Total fiction.T: Is that?=E2=
=80=A6So, that=E2=80=99s
the 15 year thing. So that=E2=80=99s makes sense now. That=E2=80=99s why I =
can=E2=80=99t release it
for 15 years now, that makes total sense now.T: Did we=E2=80=A6we didn=E2=
=80=99t land on
the moon you=E2=80=99re saying?K: No, we didn=E2=80=99t.T: Why are you tell=
ing me?K: A, a,
a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They
SHOULD know.K: Nixon want to uh, they were planning, yeah, he want to fake
this, this moon landing=E2=80=A6T: Are you contending that people DON=E2=80=
=99T want to
know the truth about the world, reality, the moon landings=E2=80=A6?K: The
government, knowing this, takes advantage of it by perpetrating fraud after
fraud after fraud.T: How did you end up giving in? Being complicit with
this fraud?K: I didn=E2=80=99t want to do it.T: This is NOT where I thought=
 this
interview was going!K: With my help, with my, with my aid, and it is, it is
bothering me.T: I only have this certain amount of time with you. And I=E2=
=80=99ll
talk about whatever you want, but=E2=80=A6T: You=E2=80=99re not=E2=80=A6Thi=
s isn=E2=80=99t some type of
joke, or=E2=80=A6K: No. No, it=E2=80=99s not.T: Or a film within a film thi=
ng=E2=80=A6K: Not
joking. NOPE.T: Okay.K: The conspiracy theorists were right, on this
occasion.T: I don=E2=80=99t know what to ask you first.K: I thought it was =
wrong, I
just=E2=80=A6I didn=E2=80=99t believe in perpetrating a fraud like that.T: =
But you did.K:
It also undermined my artistic integrity to do that.T: Ok, but you ended up
saying yes. Why?K: Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it
bluntly, that=E2=80=99s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.T: W=
hy are
you telling me?K:A, a, a, massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated
against them. They SHOULD know! Don=E2=80=99t you think it=E2=80=99s import=
ant for people
to know the truth?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why? Why would they ever
need to do something like that? Why would the government ever want or need
to do=E2=80=A6K: It=E2=80=99s no secret that NASA always wanted to fulfill =
this Kennedy
prophecy.T: Take it from the beginning=E2=80=A6T: I gotta be honest, this i=
s where
he (Kubrick) got me. I mean, when I actually put myself in his position,
when I actually imagine that he was telling the truth, and that he was
presented with this opportunity and if in the one in a billion chance that
I lived his life and I was presented with the same opportunity, what would
I do?T: Yeah, he wanted his approval points up and he thought nothing could
do it better than this.T: What a conflict. I mean, gosh, I can=E2=80=99t im=
agine
being presented with that opportunity. On one hand, I=E2=80=99d really woul=
d want
to do it, but then I=E2=80=99d probably say I=E2=80=99m committing a crime,=
 and lying=E2=80=A6T: It
depends, but my guess would be=E2=80=A6no, if you=E2=80=99re good, but you =
would do it.K:
Spielberg, (inaudible) Scorsese, even Woody Allen. There isn=E2=80=99t one =
of them
who wouldn=E2=80=99t do this.T: I gotta admit: I=E2=80=99d do it. I=E2=80=
=99d do it too.T: But they
dangled all this power and all this flattery on you, essentially?K: Yeah,
it got to me after awhile. You can listen to so much of that stuff before
you start to believe it.T: They just said you were the greatest and
stuff?K: Yeah, yeah =E2=80=93 and I agreed with them.K: Why are you telling=
 the
world? Why does the world need to know that the moon landings aren=E2=80=99=
t real
and you faked them?K: Which I consider to be my masterpiece.T: And you
can=E2=80=99t take credit, or even talk about=E2=80=A6K: Well, I am now..T:=
 Right, so
you=E2=80=99ll be dead. In ten years, or 15=E2=80=A6K: Right, ten or 15 som=
ething like
that.T: So, you can=E2=80=99t talk to Roger Ebert about it. Does that frust=
rate
you?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why would they have to do that?K:
Because it is impossible to get there.T: Ok, back up, back up, back up=E2=
=80=A6.*
