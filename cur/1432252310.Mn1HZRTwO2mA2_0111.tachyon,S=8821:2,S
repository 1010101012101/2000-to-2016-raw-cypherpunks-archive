I'd say one problem is cultural amongst the security cleared and ex-TLA
people with security people or current double agent security people on the
telco payroll.

Until they internalize that they are part of a dangerous to democracy and
civilization STASI 2.0 system, the problem will continue, because these kind
of gag order things are going to be handled by security cleared people only. 
In that way they can probably legally hide it from the CEO and the rest of
the company, by gagging the intercept request handling people.  And they can
surely require, if they do not already, that the intercept handling people
be security cleared.  And in that environment its got to be easy on
$250m/year black budget to stack the intercept handling departments in the
important (large) telco's with not just security cleared, but true-believer
ex-TLA types, or simply double agents.  They dont hve to pay the full salary
just an off the books loyalty bonus, as the telco is paying for its own
subversion.

So I think the main hope which is probably fairly slim, is that society
views shift to make even those ex-TLA people start to question whether they
are on the right side of history to the extent they have any ethics.


Another thought you've got to wonder if people dieing is a problem.  Whats
to stop an extremely conservative risk mentality security cleared person,
writing his memoirs spilling all in complete detail, parked with a lawyer
for release on death.  (Eg envelopes to be posted to NYT et al on his
eventual death).  Maybe that means old, and terminal people are going to
find it hard to be employed in security cleared roles.
