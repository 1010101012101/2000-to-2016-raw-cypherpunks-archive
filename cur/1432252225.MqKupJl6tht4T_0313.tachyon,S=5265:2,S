That traceroute looks suspiciously like it's going to
Philadelphia.  (Second prize, TWO nameservers in Philadelphia...)
The www site's there also, safely and reliably on dry land.

However, if you do a traceroute to Ryan's remailer.havenco.com,
you'll see a path that goes quickly to London, to "unknown.level3.net",
then quickly to "havenco-gw", then with much more delay to
213.169.220.162, then with similar delay to remailer.havenco.com.

Havenco's talked for a while about metastasizing,
putting servers in a bunch of places for reliable fast performance
for non-critical data and mainly keeping the critical database parts
and more paranoid material over in Sealand.
Certainly they'd want to have basic advertising material
and some of their DNS mirrors on dry land.

Also, it's interesting that the whois record for havenco.com
is registered from Cyprus.
