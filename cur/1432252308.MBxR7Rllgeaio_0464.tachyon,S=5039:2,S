"This problem has sparked consequences, in criminal acts and danger to 
national security. According to the reports, the problem of missing guns at 
the FBI, in particular, is a mess, and it's been that way for years. It 
stems from weak discipline, lax standards, tardy reporting and few, if any, 
consequences."
--Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47789-2002Aug5.html
The FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other parts of the 
Justice Department have lost track of hundreds of guns and laptop 
computers, according to a report indicating that recordkeeping problems at 
the agencies are even worse than previously disclosed.
