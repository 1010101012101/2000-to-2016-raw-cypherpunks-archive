This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems Spring Break Of Code,
a week-long expenses-paid retreat to Maui for folks who like software
development, security, and the beach. Webve rented a large beachfront
house on the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay
for your airfare. While there, you can split your time between island
living and working on an Open Whisper Systems related project that you
propose.

Spring Break Of Code will be March 23rd to March 31st, 2013. We will be
taking up to eight people, and will cover your costs for:

* Lodging in a large beachfront house.
* Your airfare from the US.
* A surfboard for the week.

Spring Break Of Code is an opportunity for hackers interested in
security and privacy to spend some time contributing to Open Whisper
Systems related projects in a retreat-like setting with other
co-conspirators. Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your
travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and
just generally being in Maui.
