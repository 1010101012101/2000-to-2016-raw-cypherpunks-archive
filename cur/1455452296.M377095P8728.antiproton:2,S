Me would prefer Snowden to release the whole cache too.

On the other hand, I partially understand him.

He applied for asylum in about 20 countries and all
but except lastly the russians ditched him.

If he released all the cache, he wouldn't have anything
to trade for asylum (this raises many other questions).

As an earth human, he wasn't bold and/or crazy enough
to get back to hamerica by releasing the cache.

AFAICT Cryptome doesn't criticize him for false docs,
right?

In addition, both of us might be wrong and a conspiracy
theory to explain things better.

Say, the oligarchs of the world to just make a show/psyop
for the sheeple ;)
