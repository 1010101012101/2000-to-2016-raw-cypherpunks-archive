I don't know but if I had to guess, it's because they have no reason to get
into more specific and lesser charges until/unless it looks like he might
be coming to trial.

Then again, it's not the first time a slide has been challenged:
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/11/us-germany-usa-spying-idUSKBN0JP1QG20141211?irpc=932

Germany's top public prosecutor said an investigation into suspected
> tapping of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone by U.S. spies had so far
> failed to find any concrete evidence.
> Revelations by former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden

> Harald Range launched an official investigation in June, believing there

>From the German prosecutor, not an NSA spokesperson.

*Plus*, as I said in the post - *Snowden didn't see all the materials he
leaked*. If the document was forged and not legitimate or a mockup produced
by GCHQ for proposal purposes, etc., it could have been modified or
fabricated *after* Snowden gave up his trove.

Did you read the entire post, or just decide that "If he's not a
Snowden-ite, he's probably a liar or a bad man"??
