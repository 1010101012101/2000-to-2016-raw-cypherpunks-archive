Y'know, it's dissapointing that Luis doesn't make use of the 
Internet, all of which is presumably sitting in front of him as 
he types, to get his citations right.

>From Matthew, KJV
[3] Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven.
[4] Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
[5] Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
[6] Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after 
righteousness: for they shall be filled.
[7] Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
[8] Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
[9] Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called 
the children of God.
[10] Blessed are they which are persecuted for 
righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

(BTW: These are generally known as the Beatitudes)

Nothing about the just plain not-having-money poor getting
anything special (at least here - there's plenty about the
spiritual problems of the rich elsewhere in the New 
Testament).

I've got a button somewhere I picked up at an SF convention:

"The Meek shall inherit the Earth.
 The rest of us will go to the stars!"
