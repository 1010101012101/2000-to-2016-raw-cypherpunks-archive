Subject: MD5 collisions in one minute

Hi all,

You might be interested in knowing that my MSc student
Marc Stevens has found a considerable speedup of MD5
collision generation. His improvements of Wang's method
enables one to make MD5 collisions typically in one
minute on a PC; sometimes it takes a few minutes, and
sometimes only a few seconds.
His paper (shortly to appear on the Cryptology ePrint
Archive) can be found on http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/,
where we've also made his software available (source code
and a Win32 executable).

Grtz,
Benne de Weger
