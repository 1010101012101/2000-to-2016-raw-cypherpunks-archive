Are you assuming that "concentration of wealth" ISN'T a PRODUCT of governme=
nt? =C2=A0I believe AP will shrink or most likely eliminate government, cer=
tainly as we know it. =C2=A0Do you know this wouldn't fix the "concentratio=
n of wealth" problem? =C2=A0And what's wrong with "concentration of wealth"=
 if it occurs as a product only of non-aggression? =C2=A0(Like some capital=

If they are truly "serious assholes" then they will piss off large numbers =
of people. =C2=A0That means many people will be donating to see them stop i=
t. =C2=A0More people donating means a smaller donation per person will be s=
ufficient.

In order for governments to kill their enemies, they first must know who th=
eir enemies are. =C2=A0Merely by remaining silent, for awhile, a person can=
 conceal himself as an "enemy" of governments. =C2=A0They can use AP to get=
 rid of those governments, silently.

ads_ about killing the assholes.
Never heard of it.
