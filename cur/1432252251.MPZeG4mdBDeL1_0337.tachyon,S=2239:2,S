After googling up some references, it seems the Major made a small 
misstatement.  Green appears to have proven that for any number N 
greater than 1, there are an infinite number of prime progressions where 
the primes are separated by N.  For example, 3,5,7 are all primes 
differing by 2.  The _Science_ article is behind their paid-subscription 
wall, so I can't look at the source, but 
http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040424/mathtrek.asp talks a bit 
about the general subject.
