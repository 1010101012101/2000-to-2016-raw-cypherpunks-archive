Seriously, I am none the wiser and cannot yet make sense of what they
are saying.

China apparently is putting this experiment in space - are they winning
a game on prediction of one particular bit with > 75% probability, and
if so, can they run that game numerous times to get that probability
close to 100%, and if so, can the random inputs to each side be made not
random so that the result of the game is transmission of information?

I cannot begin to answer any of these questions sorry...

That sounds much more interesting than the implications of 'dull'
said to be arising from qubits :)

The hope is that since some say the experiment is pretty dull to begin
with, then perhaps there is a soul alive who could answer the above
questions... we can only hope.
