Ratchet indeed. Declan posted elsewhere a blurb from
a law journal which links the recent wahoo of a federal
prosecutor in the Western District of Washington to Carl
Johnson and "Assassination Politics." The article
cited three sources on the DoJ web site, two of which
do indeed allege CJ's implementation of AP, if not
directly then by god by wahooing, as does the law
journal. WWA is a hothouse for homeland wahoo.

Jessica Stern, a Harvard wahoo expert, who has
extensively interviewed Jim Bell but was never called
as a witness in his recent trial, is now disclosing to
inquiring journalists the contents of her interviews 
with homeland wahoos. Expect Jim, AP, CJ and
a few others to get ratcheted right smartly to meet
fervent demand for wahoo incrimination.

If you haven't euthanized everything you've got on
wahoo, think about it.
