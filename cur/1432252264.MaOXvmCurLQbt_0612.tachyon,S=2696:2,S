The Yodel does not have a web site where yodels can be converted into 
some other form of money, and other forms of money converted into 
Yodels.

Instead it has an IIRC bot.   Use of this bot is described at 
http://yodel.deep-ice.com/bankbot.html

This means a command line interface, to do banking transactions.

This of course greatly reduced the work required to implement the 
Yodel, but will greatly limit the acceptability of the Yodel.
