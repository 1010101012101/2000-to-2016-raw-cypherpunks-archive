Ok, you can reword are reiterate your claims. How about backing them up
with documentation? (if it's been 'reinforced' every year, it surely is not
secret and you must have some links to back up your claims)

BTW of your new ones:

1) Would you NOT have them available to all persons regardless of age? Do
we really need more teenage pregnancies? (BTW in that year many states
restricted access to birth control, my brother's then 17 year old wife
could not purchase it it Cal.)

2) why should people be prohibited from participation in child care because
they are gay, bisexual or lesbian? Perhaps heterosexuals should be
prohibited from child care for the same reasons.

3) Document (not rephrase) this, Jodi

4) Well this country is kind of short on enemies right now since the
disappearance of the evil empire... maybe it's time to attack a real enemy.


This is, of course similar to the last times, wild claims (probably from
some fundie tract) and lots of bluster and no content when challenged to
support the claims.

Jay

Aside to Lizard: I'll be gone for a few days but watching my mail when I
get back, try to follow up and make sure we get some documentation. thx
