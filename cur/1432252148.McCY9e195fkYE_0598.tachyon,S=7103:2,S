the "security industry" as oriented toward the consumer public is
focused on broad threats and general risks. the specialized
particulars of targeted exploitation for whatever reason are the realm
of nation state espionage, law enforcement technical surveillance, and
high power corporate conflicts.

individuals facing advanced attackers are left with nearly no avenues
of reputable relief.

the vagaries of how anyone might encounter "advanced attackers" are as
myriad and expansive as the history of human kind itself.  jilted
lover, bruised ego, psychotic obsession, voyueristic thrills, the list
goes well beyond the common corporate investigations and government
espionage hijinx...

i find it amusing that the largest repository of black hats and
malicious tech is employed by the United States Government itself.

at least those tax dollars are some of the most effective put to use?  ;)

it is slow going digging into your gear; will report in a few weeks.
as mentioned before, due to interdiction of shipment i don't expect
much of interest. but never say never...
