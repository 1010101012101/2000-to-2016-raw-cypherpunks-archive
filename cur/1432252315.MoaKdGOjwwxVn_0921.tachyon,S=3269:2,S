Unfortunately I've been getting reports from around the US of 
American Muslims being attacked and harassed.  If you want to stay on 
top of the latest news I recommend that you subscribe to The Muslim 
Student Association News mailing list (MSANEWS).  The list is fairly 
high volume, but does contain most of the news and perspectives from 
the Muslim and Islamic communities worldwide.

To subscribe, send e-mail to:
<listserver@lists.acs.ohio-state.edu> with the message
body "subscribe MSANEWS Firstname Lastname".
