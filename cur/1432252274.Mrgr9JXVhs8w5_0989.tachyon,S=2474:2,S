All of those problems derive from the fact that you are using your 
employers computing resources.  Spend the $500 for your on laptop and 
connect to the Net via 
<http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/mobileoptions/broadband/index.jsp>E<http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/mobileoptions/broadband/index.jsp>VDO 
or one of the competing services.  Then the only issue is your personal 
productivity which is completely under your own control.

Obviously, if you are fighting the Great Enemy more advanced solutions are 
required.
