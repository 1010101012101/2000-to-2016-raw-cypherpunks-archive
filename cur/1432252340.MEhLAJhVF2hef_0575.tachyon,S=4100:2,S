Thanks Alan but,

This slippery slope concerning the ability of only approved researchers 
able to engage in science has gone too far and has got to stop.  I don't 
accept that the "right of society" to protect itself from a few madmen 
abusers of technology means we all must carry scientist ID cards.  Most of 
the significant discoveries, until this century, were made by 
amateurs.  Almost all the R&D I did in the 60s and 70s as an amateur are 
now regulated.  If I do any research, using whatever chemicals I choose, I 
won't be filing no "stinking forms.
