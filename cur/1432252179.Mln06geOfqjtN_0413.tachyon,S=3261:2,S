Here's a disturbing little footnote in the evolving story of complicity 
between news organizations and the government.  It seems that not only 
will the news media provide AmeriKKKans with fluffy PG-rated coverage of 
the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq, and the slaughter of thousands 
of people only trying to defend their homeland.  

The news media, will, in fact, print fake news supplied by the government, 
with full knowlege that it is false, to further an ongoing investigation.

Case in point.

This would be a good article to keep in mind when you hear media reports 
that Saddam's "Weapons of Mass Destruction" have finally been found.

NEWSPAPERS HAVE really only one obligation: to truthfully inform readers.
Yet last week the King County Journal, a Bellevue-based daily serving the
east and south suburbs, admitted failure to do even that in March 2002
when it printed a phony story about a suspicious fire that was actually
staged by police to appear to be an arson.

This story starts in January 2002, when Steven Sherer was convicted of
killing his wife; her body was never found. The conviction didn't sit well
with Sherer. From behind prison walls, prosecutors assert, he plotted to
kill his former mother-in-law, his son, the prosecutor, and the
prosecutor's four children. For starters, he contracted with his cellmate
to torch the Bellevue home where his former mother-in-law and his son
lived, preferably with them inside, according to court documents. Law
enforcement officials found out and decided to stage an arson at Sherer's
former mother-in-law's in order to dig up more information about Sherer's
conspiracy.

One problem: The cops needed to somehow prove to Sherer that the arson
happened. So they contacted the King County Journal. Would the paper be
willing to report the staged arson as if it were a real event so that they
could have a clipping to pass along to Sherer?
