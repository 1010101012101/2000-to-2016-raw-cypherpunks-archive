You forget this, in some senses, IS a 1984 regime. These shows can still be
made after someone dies, retaining most of the value without the
devestating effects it has on the subject. It's a means to preserve a new
shape of privacy. A form of security through obscurity, the only form of
security I usually find exists in real life situations.

A twofold of laws will make this happen as much as it can.
1) Never may the recording of an event be illegal in and of itself.
This is a "self governance" law. Limiting the governement and police's own
power. It mustn't be too powerfull as to prevent people claiming access
2) Any person, legal or otherwise, must make available it's survailance
records, freely, in accordance with common conventions.
Meaning that if I do record something I must make it publicly available on,
say, a distributed open file network. Usenet would be the inadequate
present day example. In whatever format and form is common at the time.
Freely effectively bans propriatary formats and prevents copyright-ish laws
from securing it. Untarget recordings mean survailance style always-on
recording. This law would allow one to keep his/her home video's private
but requires sharing of the always-on webcam in front of the house. An
underlying assumption is that we'll have widespectrum radio-camera's that
see everything the birds do now, and a lot that they don't, even through
the walls of buildings.

Never, I repeat, NEVER, will board rooms of the importants Anu wishes to be
public become public. Worst case scenario Space-One will offer "private
conversation" trips that pass by the dark side of the moon for the rough
talks. Worst because that gives an unfair advantage to those most motivated
to have privacy, privacy isn't worth as much to the Green Energy Consurtum
as it'll be to Mean Oil Corp. But it's likely nearly as usefull.
