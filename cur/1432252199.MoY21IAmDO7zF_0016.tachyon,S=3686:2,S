I've not seen, nor played with any of these, *BUT*, heed this warning
which applies to all devices (and software?) that are 1) closed source and 
2) offer some useful service which you'd be tempted to place inside your 
network, 3) are allowed to communicate with the outside world.


I would highly suggest that if you chose to use one of these that you do so 
from a DMZ in your firewall to be safe.  You don't know what OS/firmware 
lives there and whether it can be used via the VOIP network to spy on your 
internal network.

You might need to add another NIC to your firewall, and depending on what 
else this needs, you might also need to provide a DHCP server for it.  Set 
the firewall rules to make sure no packets from this device can go into 
your internal network.  EVER.

Don't just say, "Well this thing is its own router, it does VPN, it has a 
firewall (does it?) I can trust it."

There will likely be features which it provides (perhaps a voice 
mail->email gateway?) which will tempt you to place it on the inside 
network instead of a DMZ.  Don't!  Find a way to secure your network and 
still provide for such features.

[Or, if you use these boxes inside a corporate environment and actually 
care about this level of security and want several of these to talk to each 
other, build another network just for them.  Depending on your needs, I'd 
also say, don't let them talk to the outside world, but if you do that, 
only nodes inside your VPN's will be able to communicate over VOIP.]

If you trust this thing to do VOIP, enjoy, (Accepting possible spying on 
your phone calls by LEO/intel agencies, etc.) but don't trust it enough to 
put the ethernet end of it on your internal network.  You never know when 
some bright kid takes one of these apart, disassembles the firmware and 
finds a backdoor to use against you.

Why the tin-foil sounding rant?  See yesterday's slashdot regarding the 
recent "hardwired" backdoor account in a Cisco Wifi router which has been 
exposed resulting in a call for a firmware update.  You can bet that Cisco 
simply changed the backdoor password/hash instead of eliminating it.  If 
they're not too scummy, they only made it harder to find:
