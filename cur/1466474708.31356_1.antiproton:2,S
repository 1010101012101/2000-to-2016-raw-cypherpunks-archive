Juan, I like the cut of your jib, even when I don't agree with you.

But what's with all this speculation that cpunks will become moderated?
And how do you propose that a bunch of people who have no connection to

To be clear: I have no intention of moderating this list, ever. I'm too
lazy, for one :)
