My biggest complaint is being re-implemented, rather than "repaired": WL 
fell over when they used a person, rather than an organization account 
with no human corrolary, to act as the 
acceptor/releaser/ObjPublicRelationsFlac (Julian in WL case).  

Much of the WL debacle has been caused by having Julian associated with WL 
in the first place.  Anyone who comes after him has the same problem: by 
acting as the releaser's mouthpiece, they become the face of the 
organization, and in turn they become the object being sold by the MSM, as 
opposed to the leaks themselves.  

Any public interfacing should be from a role account, which acts as both 
an anonymizer and a composite "face" for the press.  Not having a real 
person to attach their interests to will help force their interest to 
concentrate upon the leaks themselves.
