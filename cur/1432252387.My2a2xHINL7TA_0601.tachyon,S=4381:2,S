According to this link,
http://www.infoanarchy.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2002/11/11/4183/2039,
a new form of digital cash called "yodels" is being offered anonymously:

Supposedly, then, this is cash which can be transferred anonymously via
IIP or Freenet.  Leaving aside the question of trusting an anonymous bank
(trust takes time), the sticking point for ecash is how to transfer
between yodels and other currencies.  Without transferability, what
gives yodels their value?

So Mr. Yodel purchased his domain name (what domain name?) and his hosting
by using yodels.  If someone is selling these services for yodels, that
could provide a limited basis for giving the currency value.

An additional comment suggests that more information can be found at
the Freenet address SSK@Mt3s3k7PCEUzbNW6zeI2oyRT0jgPAgM/yodel//.
This is a "Freesite" and you need the Freenet software installed to
access it.
