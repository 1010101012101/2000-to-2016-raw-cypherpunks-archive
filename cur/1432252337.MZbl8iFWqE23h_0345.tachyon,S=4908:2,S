[ Re: Code-255RandomCharacters. ]

Ok, Time to fix this correctly.

Someone already upgraded the old one, at least 2 others have been released
recently... 

I personally do NOT tolerate M$ products to do anything relevant in my
environment, so if anyone can help us out by answering a few questions, we
will have to fix M$ the hard way... 

First, does the IIS server have any auto-update mechanism, if so, is this
dictated by a moronic registry value, variable setting, etc?

If not, what is the quickest and most effective method to update (by hand
and manual access) an IIS server installation?

Are there any alternate methods than [this] to update the IIS server software?

Other Suggestions?

[ Yes, creation of exe on disk or in process, get of file from m$, and
running of it with /autobullshit would work too. ]

...

Now, for any competant individual on this planet, you would already realize
that the intent now, if i feel like wasting time fixing the rest of the
world's incompetance, is to generate a forceful update and force all of
these foolish IIS servers to reinstall the newer version (with only a few
less problems)... 

At the rate of ideal propogation, this security breach and hastle can be
remedied in full in less than a week. I would strongly suggest an open
petition of inquiry as to why msoft is so incapable of basic software design.

In this regard, I see at least 8 totally independant mechanisms of
completing this process, however, because I personally do not tolerate
moronics, I will not personally create additional code until someone gives
me a good reason to do so.

Unless, of course, everyone continues to fail, I may waste the time, in
which case i will need an individual in a politicly and logisticly neutral
environment who has a simple modem, to instantiate the fix.

Inversely, if everything fails, we eliminate the servers from operation. A
far better solution.

All I shall do is provide operational code, if so desired. Im not up for
the bullshit that will result from other antics.

So, anyone care to fix the world, or shall we all play incompetant sheep as
always and give no heed to the potential benefits of doing something
relevant or competant for once in our lives?

I leave you with this...
