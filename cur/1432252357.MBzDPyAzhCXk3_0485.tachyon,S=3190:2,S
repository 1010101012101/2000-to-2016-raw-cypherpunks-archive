"Frankly, millions of these fascists need a simple solution: a tree, a 
horse, and a rope."

Damn. If it gets to the point where I'm a terrorist because some local 
warlord doesn't like me (or thinks I disrespect his authority), then "might 
makes right" is all that will be left.

In a way, the potential and impending truth of Tim May's statement is for a 
me a motivator to continue to promote strong crypto, ubiquitous Wi-Fi, 
"BlackNet", and so on. Hopefully it won't come down to the above.
