The eMoney directive (1994) was originally written at the desire of the 
banks to clobber Digicash and the like.  The Bundesbank led the charge 
by more or less writing it so that "emoney is reserved for banks (or 
approximations)."  There was stiff opposition from Britain, Netherlands 
and one other (Denmark?), and the compromise that Bundesbank agreed to 
was that an institution could be "not a bank" in name but the barriers 
were preserved.  IOW, an elephant, with huge inputs in capital, huge 
outputs in pollution and no value to the ecosystem.

This was all justified on "monetary policy" which I showed to be just 
marketing blather in an old paper here:
http://iang.org/papers/monpol.html
In which I more or less predicted it would fail and issuance would be 
done in USA.

Then, in late 1990s, the reality was reaching even the EU in that the 
original concept was a failure so the committee proceeded to rewrite it. 
  That's all it needs, right?  Of course, they had no actual experience 
in eMoney, they were a bunch of bureaucrats learning by watching what 
was happening in the press.  Still with the banks behind them, and the 
impending euro to make them nervous, they essentially enjoyed a 
market-learning process in a committee, and predictably came out with 
the camel of 2000.

This camel of course failed, and as the Paypal, webmoney and e-gold 
models showed themselves, they slowly came to the realisation that their 
camel had to be downsized.  Now they have a shetland pony.  It's nice 
and tight, definately cute, and probably doesn't eat more than is 
needed.  There is probably a niche for them in the shetlands.

It's actually almost doable, on paper, but would you want to take that 
risk?  Why would you want to?  The total equation is still impractical, 
and you are better off issuing eMoney (both inside and outside their 
definition) somewhere else.
