If they make false statements in a public forum that causes a mass
panic, *and* fail to defend their actions in court - why not? I am not
arguing for prior restraint here (telling them "you must not do these
things") but I think they should be required to face the consequences of
their actions.

True enough - and the world is full of people with wild beliefs (like
the Holocaust deniers) who are willing to go to jail as "martyrs" for
their beliefs... I suppose my problem is I believe that a act (even
speech) that damages the community as a whole or influences those
legally not yet equipped to make their own decisions (children) should
be subject to challenge in court - not precensure, but legal challenge
after the fact.  If he is unable to convince (in court) a jury mutually
chosen by his lawyers and the prosecution that he acted reasonably, then
perhaps he didn't?
