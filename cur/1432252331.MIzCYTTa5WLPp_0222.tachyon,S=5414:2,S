 "Properly finance" means that speech will be defined as
paid for, even if no actual money changes hands.   The 
proposed rule brings what was formerly speech into the 
definition of expenditure, even if assigning a money 
value is arbitrary.

There is no real distinction between individual speech 
and campaign expenditure so broadly defined.  Any 
distinction between the campaign and individual citizens 
is merely some arbitary cutoff.  Perhaps comments in "A" 
list blogs might be defined as campaign expenditure, and 
comments in other blogs might be defined as individual.

The obvious rule is "If the campaign does not pay money 
for it, it is not a campaign expenditure", but this rule 
is declared to be a loophole, a loophole that must be 
corrected - and of course it is a loophole.  But it is a 
loophole that cannot be fixed without massive violation 
of free speech.  Fixing this "loophole" is what is meant 
by "properly finance".

To fix this "loophole", speech must be deemed to be 
campaign speech, at least if it is sufficiently 
prominent, and if it is not in fact paid for directed 
and planned by the campaign, this will be an offense, a 
form of fraud, cheating the campaign laws.

This rule (speech is money, and unpaid for, unsupervised 
electoral speech is fraud) already applies in the 
offline world - thus the NRA is forbidden to inform 
voters about the way a particular politician votes on 
guns - at least forbidden to do so shortly before 
election time, because that would supposedly be a 
campaign expenditure.  To get around this rule, the NRA 
has purchased some radio stations, thus availing itself 
of the press exemption, which allows the press, but not 
ordinary mortals, to comment on political races.

The question then, is how will this prohibition against 
political speech on specific politicians and campaigns 
be applied to the internet.  "A" list blogs claim to be 
the press, so the argument is that "A" list blogs should 
be exempt from this rule because they are the press, "B" 
list blogs exempt because they are individuals, so no 
regulation of internet speech. Evidently some people
reject this argument.
