See Greg Broiles' summary for a more accurate summary than I could do.

But not all is lost. I still believe the First is a bright line: the 
First does not provide for government regulation of those who are not 
using "the public airwaves" (cough cough). Newspapers don't need to seek 
licenses of any kind, for example. (A so-called "business license," not 
that I'm supporting such things, is basically just a fee to operate a 
money-making business in some location. There is no discretion for 
allowing some newspaper and disallowing others, nor for "regulating" 
newspapers.)

Any proposal to license those who use the Net will face a lot of First 
Amendment challenges.

I don't think the high court would ultimately find any such regulations 
constitutional.
