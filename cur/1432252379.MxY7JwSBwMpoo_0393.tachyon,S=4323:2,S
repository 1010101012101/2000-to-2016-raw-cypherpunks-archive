Dear Internet Domain Registrant

The impending launch of the new .BIZ, .INFO, .PRO, and .NAME domain extensions starting October 01, 2001 is one of the most anticipated developments on the Internet of all time.  As awareness and demand for these exciting new extensions increases, it will become incresingly difficult to reserve a good domain name. You need to confirm the availability of your domain name as soon as possible. Simply visit: http://www.NewExtensionCentral.com and you can find out in
30 seconds if someone has pre-registered your name.

"While .com names hold the most prestige, the next frontier is the new suffixes -.info, .biz, and .pro  likely to become available later this year..." -BUSINESSWEEK MAGAZINE, April 16, 2001. 

It is expected that over 3 million of these new domain names will be registered in the first few minutes when registration officially opens later this year. As the general public becomes aware of these new extensions later this year, registration volumes and values of these names will skyrocket. If your domain names are important to you, be prepared and pre-register them now. Protect your domain name from cybersquatters, speculators, and fraudulent trademark holders. NewExtensionCentral.com has the premier pre-registration engine to help you to secure the domain you want. Over 300,000 names have already been queued in the system and good names are going fast. Do not wait until the last minute. Go to http://www.NewExtensionCentral.com now to pre-register.
