Don't use BitPay, Coinbase, Circle.

You may, however, wish to try https://www.bitwage.co/
(or you might not)

Note: This is not me providing any endorsement for bitwage, but there
is an article about someone's experience with it here:

https://open.bufferapp.com/getting-paid-in-bitcoin/

Re. your "untraceable" remarks, bitcoin is not untraceable. It's
basically transparent.  There are a few things that have been added
recently to enhance privacy, but sorry, not untraceable or anonymous
or anything like that.

The things that _you_ can do to enhance the privacy on your side are:

Don't use web wallets (with the possible exception of Coinkite, if you
are comfortable using it...)

Do use hardware wallet (e.g. Trezor) or something you can install and
manage from your laptop (e.g. Electrum) (Note that these don't require
you to sign up for a service with anyone.)

If you have accounts with Coinbase, BitPay, or other firms with
web-based wallet servic(es) that are bound by AML/KYC, TISA, FATCA, a
growing body of FINCEN and state-by-state requirements, you are better
off just transferring your coins away from those firms and closing
your accounts.

Don't use Coinbase or BitPay as a payment processor if you are a
business, instead consider Mycelium Gear -- gear.mycelium.com -- or
Coinsimple - discussed at
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35evi0/eli5_difference_between
_mycelium_gear_and/
