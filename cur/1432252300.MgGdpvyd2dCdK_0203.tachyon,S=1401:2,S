Hi, Kurt

I don't want to get up into darkness of long, empty and lonely cool days. 
I can't be happy to something if I don't have my soul mate, who will 
understand me...I want to change my life and let love to come into it. I 
looked here at search of a good man, my destiny...And I found you! Give me a 
chance to come into your life and to bring into your heart true love  We are 
masters of our destiny and we create it. I will wait for your letter with 
hopes and dreams http://russianbridesonline.info/?idAff=182


Sincerely yourth
Julia P.
