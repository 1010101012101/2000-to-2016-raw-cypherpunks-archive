No. If I start a bakery that competes with yours and takes customers
from yours, I have "harmed" you. Yet this is something that society
encourages.

If I successfully woo your girlfriend/boyfriend, I have "harmed" you.
Yet this is seen as acceptable, or at least not illegal, behavior.

What is "harmful" is not necessarily illegal or tortuous.
