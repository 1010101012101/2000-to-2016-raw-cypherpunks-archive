No, it allows security geeks to talk about proof.  My mom stil won't
get it.

Pd doesn't allow you to prove that there's no sniffer doing other
things with the data, that nothing is logged at the wrong time, etc

If you really want to randomize the data, do it close to me.  Or
better yet, run some software from Credentica and accept a proof of
whatever data is in question.

But the reality is that people hand over most of their data now.

So why would I invest in this expensive technology?  (Mike Freedman,
Joan Feigenbaum, Tomas Sander and I did a paper which touches on the
power imbalance between the companies that offer DRM technology and
their customers...same analysis applies
here... http://www.homeport.org/~adam/privacyeng-wspdrm01.pdf )
