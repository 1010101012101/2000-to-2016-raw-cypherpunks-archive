What's pleasurable about reading the fiction of ideologues like
Tim is the smack-down tone of their prejudices. Fake, fake,
fake.

Nowhere in Tim's spew is the recognition that the largest
beneficiaries of government favoritism are corporations and
wealthy individuals like himself, especially those associated with
the greeders of the defense industry, rather the national
security state. No US institution has been uncontaminated
by the wealth generated by the illusion of US enemies and the
raping of the economy to simulate battle with such fictional
threats, at home and abroad.

Welfare is puny by comparison, and Tim's castigation of
it is like the master of the house bitching about health needs
of his servants while requiring them to wipe his ass. Standard
nouveau riche conceit which reveals a fear of again being
a poor asswipe himself, the stench of self-loathing inescapable.

The favorite mindlessness of the ideologue, is to rehash endlessly
comfortable old prejudices, chanting repetitively the same
accusations, avoiding self-criticism in the manner of the
self-righteous, professing of certainty to conceal doubt,
working hard to present an image of confidence, most often
by blaming and attacking easy targets.

The rich fear the poor, and rightly so, for they know who pays
for their perks. And the answer to this fear is always threats
of violence, the dominant paradigm of those who reap the
most benefits from house rules of the United States.

Cloaked, as ever, in blind faith in the "Constitution," or another
rigged fat cat document used to fleece the peasants at home 
and abroad, based as they always are on justification of the 
supremacy of the over-privileged.

Eveready to shoot those who disagree, send them up the
chimneys, the teenie-bopper ideologue struts mightily
against imaginary demons.

Wasn't it a leftist who coined Goldwater's most memorable
phrase? Extremists are all alike, full of shit and hatred, their
own worst enemy. Suicide prone, but afraid to go alone.
