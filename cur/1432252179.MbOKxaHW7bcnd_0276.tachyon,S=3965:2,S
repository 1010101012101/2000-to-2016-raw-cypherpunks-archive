Many things are felonies. I commit between 3 and 5 felonies a month, 
at least that I know of.

In this case, "improperly handling secrets" is a felony. Same kind of 
mishandling that former DOD Secretary William Perry may be charged 
with.

As to why the deal included this single remaining count, the news 
stories are filled with much verbosity on this. Stuff about fig 
leaves, sending messages to other secret holders, etc.

You claim to be a librarian...look it up.

Now, did this particular felony justify 9 months of solitary 
confinement, loss of employment and retirement benefits, and so on? 
And will William Perry and others now face comparable treatments?
