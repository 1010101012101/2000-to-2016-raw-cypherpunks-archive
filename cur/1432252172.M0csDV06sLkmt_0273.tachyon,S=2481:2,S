Yes, the stock Cisco/Linksys firmware is plain horrible (especially
stability on high P2P load), and has a nasty remote admin security hole
(prime candidate for a firmware worm, given that the hole is trivial to
exploit, Linux firmware build environments are aplenty, megaunits have been
sold,
and most users aren't security-literate).

The first thing to do before even putting it on the network is
to reflash it, with Sveasoft's firmware, or one of
the 2-3 alternatives.
