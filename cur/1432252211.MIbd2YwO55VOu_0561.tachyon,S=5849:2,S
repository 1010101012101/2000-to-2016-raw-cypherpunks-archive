"It=92s unbearably difficult to confess but I was an awful food addict. 

I greedily swallowed up all this rubbish

This ruinous passion stopped when I started taking Anatrim! 

Holy God,

 my appetite decreased, 

mood increased and I=92m the happiest person in the world 26 pounds in=20=
2.3 months. 

I can tell you now I turned to the happiest person in the world!"

"I had problems with over-weight since a boy. 

It=92s difficult to imagine how I hated being derided at school. 

I abhorred my plumpness and I detested myself. 

After trying this and that I learned about Anatrim. 

It literally pulled me out of this awful nightmare! Many thanks and a=20=
great respect to you, fellows."

 
Charley Mock, Bellevue WA

 
"Do you know what? My marriage was saved thanks to Anatrim! I went into=20=
this circle, depression =96 more eating =96 more depression. My wife was=20=
about to leave me as I was turning in overweight psycho. 

My best friend pointed to your site and I ordered up Anatrim at the=20=
same time. 

The final result was great, my appetite came to normal level, I was=20=
often in a good mood, and, of course, I tightened my belt with no=20=
regrets. And you know, the bed became cool also!"

 
Karl
