You have used that comparison numerous time. Check the archives. In fact
it is the fundamental cornerstone of your 'implied contract' argument.
Once we differentiate the two your assertion has nothing to stand on.

The CDR is not a public service nor is it a 'universal' service like
USENET. It IS(!!!) a mailign list operated by private individuals which is
participated in by private individuals who must individual subscribe
(which is a big distinction itself with the way USENET operates).
