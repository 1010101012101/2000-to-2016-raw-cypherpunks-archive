That could happen.

Thankfully, a significant percentage of everyone involved is  
demanding a strong digital signature framework to be de facto  
mandatory, something which I personally strongly support.  It is  
optional, but there are enough people lucid enough to not want to re- 
invent SMTP poorly who are willing to argue that case that it will  
probably minimize spam opportunities in implementation.  What that  
looks like in practice is hard to say, but I think digital signatures  
will be standard fare for mandatory feeds.  However, that does not  
prevent upstream digital signature folks like the telcos from whoring  
their certs and channel to anyone with cash.  It is very desirable  
advertising real estate.

This is being implemented in most countries by regulatory fiat.  To  
the extent that I have influence on the process, I have been a strong  
advocate of a useful digital signature framework for ascertaining  
source authority (and filterinig on that basis) at a minimum, and  
potentially much stricter profiles.  We'll see what it really looks  
like in five or ten years.  The people that want no cryptographic  
controls at all ("because it is simple") are in the minority.

Cheers,
