hmmn i see it as a hack and his other work was similar

he was breaking the user agreement as worded by lawyer types > isnt that a hack?

plus they were all scuuurrred he was going to leak the docs he
downloaded so.... thats kind of a hack

it was presumed becasue of past predictors of behavior that he would
negotiate with JSTOR to change there ways which is umn
super-neoliberal-capitalistic

is stealing a hack? - i think in general that the term hacking has
expanded - i think he was hacking the system >>> maybe we disagree on
the words expansion ???

heres some wordy words mayb u wld like to read re aarons work with others
