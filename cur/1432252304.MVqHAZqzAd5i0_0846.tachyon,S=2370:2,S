Onion Routing Averts Prying Eyes

Computer programmers are modifying a communications system, originally
developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, to help Internet users surf the
Web anonymously and shield their online activities from corporate or
government eyes.

The Navy is financing the development of a second-generation onion-routing
system called Tor, which addresses many of the flaws in the original
design and makes it easier to use. The Tor client behaves like a SOCKS
proxy (a common protocol for developing secure communication services),
allowing applications like Mozilla, SSH and FTP clients to talk directly
to Tor and route data streams through a network of onion routers, without
long delays.
