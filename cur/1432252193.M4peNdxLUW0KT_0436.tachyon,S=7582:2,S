As always I dont think the answer we see to the problem we saw is the 
true vision. From the postings I see here I think most of us see through 
the decit anyway.

At the end of the day there are to many greedy, fat fingers wanting to 
get into the consumer pie, to make guarranteed money and a guarranteed 
stream of it.

I would like to wash my hands of it, however it effects me directly 
whether I want it to or not. What does knowing where the original copy 
came from matter? It just disappeared into "china" and out comes a 
million + copies. All I can see is that there will clearly be 2 streams 
of movies/music, a highly restricted and expensive official solution, 
and an extreamly open, cheap, pirated version. All that will happen is 
people will be forced into one camp or another, and Im willing to bet 
once ppl move into the pirated camp they wont be able to get back, and 
wont want too. The RIAA's business model is shot, its just a question of 
how long it takes to die. In 3rd world countries I suspect its already 
dead, they cant afford to buy official stuff.

regards

Thing
