NSW Senior Deputy Police Commissioner Ken Moroney yesterday confirmed that 
homemade bombs had been found.
One of the devices is suspected of starting a fierce bushfire that raged 
near houses at West Pennant Hills, northwest of Sydney yesterday.
A second device was found intact in the Galston area, also in the city's 
northwest, but it did not spark a fire there.
Mr Moroney would not describe the devices in detail because of fears of 
copycat firebugs.
as arsonists use home-made bombs to keep NSW under siege.
Two devices have been found in devastated areas.
One of them might have lit a fire that threatened hundreds of homes in 
Sydney's suburbs.
Police fear there may be a number of serial arsonists at work and are 
hunting a motorcyclist suspected of setting fires in the Blue Mountains.
