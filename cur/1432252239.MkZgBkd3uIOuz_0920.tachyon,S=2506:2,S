"There is a room full of frustrated males that don't get enough sex from 
their ugly wives and expensive mistresses "

And I bet a few miss the old boss in drag...but seriously,the above 
sentence reminds me of my 2600 list here,
where Im a well known 'white hat'hacker.I hear some of my friends are 
scarfing up the names of all known FBIers
(like special agent lynne hunt in the register today)
This is to protect them from the baddies like the lasker jihad.Keep those 
names coming.The C/list goes on forever.
