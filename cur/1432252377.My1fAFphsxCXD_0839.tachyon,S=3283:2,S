Biodiesel and bioethanol are horribly inefficient as far as conversion of
solar energy and agricultural area is concerned. Large scale agriculture
is not exactly environmentally neutral. They're extreme niche or gimmick
fuels at best.

Synfuel and synthetic methanol as well as hydrogen via fuel reforming from
fossils and biomass/renewables is another thing entirely, and entirely
worthwhile. Both synthetic methanol and fuel reforming allows slow
migration to fuel cells, without pissing off the fossil fuel people.
