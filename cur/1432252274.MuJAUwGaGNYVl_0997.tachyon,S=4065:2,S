	There are only 3 things in my home worth killing to protect:
	(1) My wife.
	(2) My self.
	(3) My guns.

	A thief can have the TV (take my TV...Please), the stereo (Don't 
touch the CDs or albums tho'), the computers etc. but I cannot let a 
thief take the guns out of the house while I'm alive to prevent it. 
Stolen guns rarely get used for "good".

	As to the other two, well, that's almost axiomatic.

	What kind?

	I don't know, Fire extinguishers can be lethal, just ask that kid 
in Italy...
