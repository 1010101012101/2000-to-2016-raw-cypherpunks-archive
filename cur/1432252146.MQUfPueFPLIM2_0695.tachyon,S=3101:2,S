What a laugh.  The only reason this info is available is because the Feds
mandated "Right to Know".  If corporate privacy had been protected,
there'd be no problem.

Note some of the other implications.  Thanks to Megan's Law, terrorists
know where to get child molestors to recruit for attacks on America's
children.  Thanks to the existence of the Social Security System
terrorists have the SS Death Index to steal the identities of the dead
with.  Thanks to the SEC, terrorists can use Bill Gate's SS# (539-60-5125)
to take over Microsoft.  Thanks to Medical Licensure, anti-abortion
zealots can find abortionists to kill.  All this mandated record keeping
and disclosure is very dangerous.
