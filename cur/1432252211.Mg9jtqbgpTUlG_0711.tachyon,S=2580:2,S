If you think those are anarchist ideas, you've missed the
main ideas about anarchy and anarcho-capitalism and such.
Anarchism isn't about getting rid of the _current_ people in charge,
it's about getting rid of _having_ people be in charge.

On a cypherpunks-history track, Tim or Eric once proposed that
the way to deal with slander in an uncensorable anonymous
communication environment was to make sure that there was
_always_ a wide current of anonymous slander against you going on,
so you can dismiss any _real_ slander by saying it's just more
of the same crap that some anonymous people always say about you,
and that there may even be a market for it.
(And Tim didn't even pay me to say that he's Detweiler's father...)
