Indeed.

> I have the right because I can.

Sure.

I have the right to intimately engage your skull with a hammer,
because I can. That would be a predatorial right, sociopathic, mad,
evil etc (not to mention illegal in our Western democratic system),
-and- there's nothing in such an experience, i.e. exercise of said
predatorial right, which I would want; so, you can confidently trust
this would never happen :)

But not everyone thinks like me. You see, some people think like you.


> Powers *are* rights.

Sort of: power suggests capacity, and capacity or ability implies a
natural right. A natural right, is that right which exists by your
natural capacity, or as you said "because I can".

I have natural rights to move, to communicate, to associate, to
breathe, to survive, to predate.

Some people really struggle with the reality of that last one. Yes, it
can be confronting. As a good friend of mine Malcolm says, the lion
has a predatorial right over the gazelle.

Now that's one fucked up statement. You are possibly referring to
"statutory" rights, or simply to domination "you pay me for
protection, and I shall let you continue to sell hot dogs."  The mafia
exercises many variations on the predatorial right to dominate others.

Our demoncratic governments school us to believe that government
exercise of power over us, i.e. dominating us, is in our "best
interest" - it is in your best interest to pay protection tax, to pay
mafia highway robbery road tolls (which go to banks, most often for
roads already paid for), to lose your "license" priviledge to drive/
travel/ survive (go to work) within your society.

Time to start typing less, with more thought put into each part of
each sentence, to produce a greater quality result. Perhaps brief up
on axiomatic logic.

Your heart is heard. Stay true to that which inspires you. Yes there
is much that is grave and wrong in the world today. Let's do the best
we can to understand our programming and so take a step towards
understanding and the possibility of exercising a worthy authority
arising within our hearts.

Peace,
