I put a ballot in front of him, consisting of three open cans of cat food:

Gore:  O

             O : Buchanan

Bush: O

He spoiled his ballot by eating out of more than one can, though, so 
he has now brought in Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Tawana Brawley, and 
Morris the Cat to argue that he was confused and should be given a 
"do over."
