	I am very vague about US ATM protocols (not my field of expertise
at all), but of course there was a very recent disclosure of a hole
in the protocol for accessing the IBM tamperproof crypto processor
used for generating and storing ATM keys that could be exploited if one
could get access to a machine with one in it.   Potentially this flaw
allows readout of the entire set of keys protected by the processor.

	This could be the explanation of the problem, as the protocol
problem has been known in at least some form for a year or so.
