Indeed, the order to produce "and all copies" looks to be an obvious 
effort to quash the material. Thoughtcrime.

Some here are arguing that such publication constitutes "spoliation." 
I have seen no cites that support this novel interpretation. 
Publishing something, whether on Freenet or in Time, may trigger 
later damage claims (as with violating copyrights), but it can hardly 
be considered a kissing cousin to "destruction of evidence."

And for someone not an actual party to a court case, not subject to a 
court's order, not even "contempt of court" could apply.

Well said.
