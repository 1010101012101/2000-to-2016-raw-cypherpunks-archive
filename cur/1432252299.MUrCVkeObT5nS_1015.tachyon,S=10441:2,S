Rea||y Moving Lately.

Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a leading supp|ier of VoIP technology including the fo||owing 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2OO4, Yap International revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Personal Gateway from any cellu|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 20O,O00 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|obal sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
