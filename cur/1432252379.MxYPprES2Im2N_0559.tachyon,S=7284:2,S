Western U.S.

For sixty years, ancestral lands of indigenous peoples have been used for 
testing nuclear weapons, experimenting with biological and chemical warfare 
agents, incinerating and burying hazardous wastes, and mining uranium. The 
Nevada (Nuclear) Test Site (NTS) is part of a continued illegal corporate 
and military occupation of the Western Shoshone Nation, Newe Sogobia. The 
Department of Energy has exploded plutonium, called a subcritical test, at 
NTS 17 times since 1997, leaving radioactive substances in the ground that 
filters into the largest aquifer in Southern Nevada.
Yucca Mountain and Skull Valley are currently targeted as the only national 
nuclear waste dumps for nuclear power plants. Plans are in place to begin 
the shipment of over 77,000 tons of deadly spent nuclear fuel rods and 
weapons waste to Newe Sogobia. If the recently approved Yucca Mountain dump 
isn't stopped, nuclear waste will travel through 43 states, increasing 
risks of radiation exposure to millions.
October marks the tenth anniversary of the U.S. moratorium on full-scale 
nuclear weapons tests. In honor of the anniversary and in resistance, the 
Shundahai Network is organizing the Action for Nuclear Abolition in Nevada. 
The campaign will kick off with the Family Spirit Walk for Mother Earth and 
conclude with ongoing nonviolent occupations, blockades and other actions.
