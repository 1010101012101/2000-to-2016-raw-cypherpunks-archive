	Does it? Your servers are compromised and so are your 'SSL'
	connections...your tor routers are obviously compromised...any
	system used to defend against mass surveillance that you run on
	compromised hardware is...compromised.

	Backdoored hardware affects everybody except the gov't.

	Not to mention, why would it be OK to stop mass surveilance but
	not 'targeted' surveillance...of some big number 
	of people?

	Aren't they 'innocent'? If they are 'innocent' they 'have
	nothing to hide'.

	I don't think processor design is especially hard. I admit I'm
	guessing, but I can't imagine what could be so hard about
	designing some kind of not-fancy, risc system. 

	Not to mention....

	Actually, it seems exactly like the kind of project that
	could/should be 'crowfunded'. 

	What's the 'minimum order' when dealing with something like
	TSMC ?

	I don't know. I wouldn't blame Snowden and co.(or maybe I
	would?) but since 2013 things just kept and keep getting worse. 

	Your NSA friends didn't back off an inch.

	'good enough' requires working hardware, not hardware remotely
	controlled from washington.
