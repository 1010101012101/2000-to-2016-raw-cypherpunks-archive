Sorry, as an anarchist I have to say it's an anarchist's responsibility
to take responsibility for the well-being of all members of the
collective, which for me includes ALL humankind.

That is the antithesis of collectivism.

Feudal or industrial capitalist society perhaps.

More like "We fucked it up. Let's go somewhere else and fuck it up now"

(visualizes moon-based fast-food chain trash fired from a rocket hitting
alien on head starting an intergalactic war humans are unprepared for
leading to their annihilation)

You like "Role-Playing" games Sean? I've watched people create
alternative personas just as fucked up as their pre-existing one. That
IS the lesson from role-playing. If you can't get your 'first life'
right, good luck with any other you might conceive.

I've had thoughts about letting all the people who think escape from the
planet is an option do it, and kill each other off elsewhere so the rest
of us who remain can live in peace repairing the damage ...
collectively. Almost every enthusiast of the relocation-to-space idea
I've ever met is a closeted feudalist. Good luck.. Bon voyage!

No known resource is infinite.
