And, of course, the very act of putting in the check could cause a compiler
to not optimize out the zeroize code.  (Writing a proper test program for
such behavior is very difficult).

Like most programming language discussions, it's hard to tell whether the
arguments support writing critical code languages that abstract at a
higher level or a lower level.
