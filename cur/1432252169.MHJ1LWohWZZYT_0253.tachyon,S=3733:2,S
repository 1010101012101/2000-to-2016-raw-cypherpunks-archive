	It's (apparently) England where there is wide spread DNA 
collection for use in finding certain types of criminals.

	In England both the Police and the Health Care System are run 
by the government, so in a sense the "Insurance Company" already has 
it.

	They also can't do anything about it since they have to cover everyone.

	Note: I am not claiming that the Police share the DNA with 
the Health Care Providers, but once the database is there...

Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
