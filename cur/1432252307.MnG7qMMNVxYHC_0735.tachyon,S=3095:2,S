	For brute force key search, the initial permution can effectively be
	factored out, and neither speeds nor impedes the search. This was
	done by all of the keysearch apps used in the RSA Symmetric DES
	Challenges.

	I (this was before I worked for RSA) also described an extremely
fast
	method to generate and iterate key schedules which was also widely
	used, reducing key schedule management from 90% of cpu to less
	than 10%.
