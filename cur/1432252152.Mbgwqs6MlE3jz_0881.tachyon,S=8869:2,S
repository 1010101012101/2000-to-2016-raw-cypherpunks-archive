I think the closest you could come would be a publicised mail intercept to catch posted demands and prevent you from stopping yourself revealing the letter, but that would not stop personally issued orders unless you went full-on-offshore-backup glasshole and streamed your entire conscious experience..in which case they'll just NSL another dev or invent a new charge of "preemptive obstruction" to put you in prison.

When discussing fascism, stop imagining that you can game the letter of the law. It's already constitutional that freedom of speech cannot be prevented except to prevent immediate, tangible harm to others. NSLs are already blatantly illegal, stop looking for loopholes and workarounds. If you want to challenge them, publish one on your blog and say "sue me, let's see what the supreme court says". Or, don't. Middle measures are doomed to fail or backfire in undefined ways.
