This kind of thinking is similar to the difference between and engineer's 
persepective and that of a mathematician or "pure" scientist. Basically, it 
might not be bad to consider all crypto systems 'insecure' to some extent. 
However, for well-designed cryptosystems the cost of breaking can be made to 
scale with the level of security needed.
