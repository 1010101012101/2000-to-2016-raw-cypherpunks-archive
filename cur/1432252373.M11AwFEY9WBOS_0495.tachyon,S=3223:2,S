That wasn't Bitcoin itself, just mtgox, the biggest exchange. Somebody
hacked an account and sold a heap of bitcoins at a negligble price, so
the exchange froze itself before the USD were actually cashed out and is
resetting to the state before the exploit...

There's been a few bitcoin heists, down to the usual computer security
issues; bitcoin itself has, interestingly, remained unbroken, which
bodes well for its underlying security. The mtgox heist could have
happened just as well with any online banking system; it's just that the
bitcoin economy rather new, so there's lots of little bit players
suddenly finding themselves transferring hundreds of thousands of
dollars without having the expertise or capital to build the kinds of
security that banks do...
