I'm going to be working at the Share-in, and I'd additionally like to
invite everybody to celebrate a billion seconds of Unix with me
immediately following the event.

The 1,000,000,000th second after the Unix epoch is

Sat Sep  8 18:46:40 PDT 2001

which closely follows this weekend's concert.  I intend to have a
celebratory dinner in honor of Unix history as soon as the concert
clean-up is finished.
