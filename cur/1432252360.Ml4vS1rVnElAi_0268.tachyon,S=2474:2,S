Fish and I would disagree politically if we ever met in person, I'd
wager, and I have no brief to defend his political views. But from the
perspective of a fellow journalist, well, we sometimes make honest
mistakes at the best of times, and probably even more so in
wartime. You're accusing him of intentionally telling a lie, and to
agree I'd have to at the very least look at the wording of his report.

Disagreeing with a reporter's political views does not mean that all
their claims of fact are wrong and maliciously so.
