Thus spake R. A. Hettinga (rah@shipwright.com) [13/03/06 17:55]:
: We all have our reasons.

I've known for years (it was on the website holding the subscription form)
that cypherpunks write code.  But I've never seen discussion behind the
phrase, only of the phrase itself.

I suppose in one sense, the statement, "Cypherpunks write code," answers the
question itself.  But aside from the obvious, I'm curious to know what
individual reasons people have.

If you (yes, you, the person reading this right now) write code, why do you
do it?

If you do /not/, but wish you did, why?
