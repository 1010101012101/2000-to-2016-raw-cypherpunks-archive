Just to be clear, that's what I'd expect the current wave of j-school
grads to be asking, not what I'd be asking.

(Not that I'm particularly fond of the Prez, but I'm not one of the
LLLs who say he's worse than Hitler, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, and Ronald
Regan combined.) (Stalin doesn't go into that equation because he was,
you know, a good guy whose actions have been misinterpreted.)
