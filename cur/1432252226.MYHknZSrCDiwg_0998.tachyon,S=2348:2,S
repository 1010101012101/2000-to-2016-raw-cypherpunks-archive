It's about time: So what upcoming product launch are geeks most excited about? Not the new version of Microsoft Office. It's probably fine. But techdom is really champing at the bit for the Sept. 23 release of "Quicksilver," the latest book from Seattle author Neal Stephenson, who has been described as the hacker Hemingway. 

"Quicksilver" is the long-awaited follow-up to Stephenson's 1999 bestseller "Cryptonomicon," which ranged through the genesis of computers, World War II cryptography and modern Web privacy and security issues. 

Among Quicksilver's characters is a brilliant scientist and contemporary of Isaac Newton.
