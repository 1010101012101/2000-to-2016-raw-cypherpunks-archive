Aye, that's the rub. Even if you're acting as a relay, even if you're just
serving out a sliver of the content, even if it's sitting there encrypted
on your hard drive, even if it's ephemeral -- if you serve a packet (while
not spoofing your IP), and legislation makes that prosecutable, yer goose
is cooked ("Your Honour, he's a part of a global terrorist network!").

I'm not sure how you can prevent that, apart from the spoofing or
legislation changing business. Oh, and only making links into legal
compartments guaranteeing maximum persecution friction. So, if your
traffic is unfilterable (it looks like a SSL session), and it comes from
Cuba, the guilty party seems to be more or less immune.
