Excellent question.  The gestap^H^H^H^H Feds think you are --membership
in a group, some of the members of which perform violence, can get
you RICOd etc.  A rather clever form of intimidation on their part,

Of course, the reverse might also be applied.  Your ordinary govt clerk

liable for the actions of her employer.

Is "just following orders" a legit defense?
