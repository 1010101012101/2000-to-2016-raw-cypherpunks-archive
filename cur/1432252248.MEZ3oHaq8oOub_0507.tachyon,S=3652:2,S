Andrei Tartovsky directed Solaris. He's one of my favorite directors - twice
I've
accidentally flipped to TV onto subtitled Russian movies partway through,
gotten 
fascinated by the film, only to later find that it was by Tartovsky (Andrei
Rublyov,
Ivan's Childhood). I also strongly reccomend Solaris and especially Stalker.

Tartovsky's not for everyone though. Things happen slowly. Tartovsky's films
make '2001' seem like 'Raders of the lost ark'.
