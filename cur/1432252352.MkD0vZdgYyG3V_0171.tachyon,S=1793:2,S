Well, I'm still wondering...

Could a TLA or other group, wanting to know who was lurking or otherwise 
subscribed to a list (such as cypherpunks) deliberately craft a virus that 
was easy to detect, for the purposes of having the automated email reply 
systems "out" that subscriber?

And then, is it possible to create some kind of filter that stops these 
replies?

Of course, it could be very difficult to determine the difference between an 
automated reply and a real posting.

ANyone have any thoughts?
