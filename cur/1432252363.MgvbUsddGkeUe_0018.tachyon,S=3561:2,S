I submit that the majority have consistent bad luck precisely 
because they are relying on luck instead of doing the basic 
value analysis to figure out what a company is actually worth.

I've been making consistent returns in the market.  I never needed 
to "decrypt" anything.  All that is required is the resolve to ignore 
fear and greed, do your own homework, and restrict your buying to 
companies you are confident that you will still want to own ten 
years from now.

A lot of people have been losing money in the market lately, but it 
is not because there was any conspiracy; it is because they were 
investing in companies with silly business plans and no revenues.
A few minutes doing basic homework could have saved them.
