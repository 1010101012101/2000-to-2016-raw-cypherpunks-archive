Some are scared, some are angry, some are manipulators. Instead of
valuing and protecting our freedoms, talking heads spewing fear blamed
the terrorist attacks on those freedoms and proceeded, 99 out of 100,
357 out of 423, to attack what they pledged to defend when they took
office. The weakness shown by our legislators over the past weeks is
more than fertile enough ground for fascism to take root and bloom.

There is no middle. The Bill of Rights is not an arcane document no
matter what guild members would have us believe. It was written for
everyone to read. I see no differentiation between citizens and
residents.

Those who wrote the Bill of Rights attempted to provide the tools for
succeeding generations to deal with exactly those problems.  Only the
abandoning of the rule of law on the part of each of the three branches
of government can explain what I see. Those who have no respect for what
were and still are good basic principles of government and justice are a
threat to everyone's safety.

In all fairness the third branch has yet to be tested on the USA PATRIOT
CRAP but I don't expect much considering their past behavior.

Somehow or other it seems that "intent of the law" is used to justify it
and the letter of the law is used to prosecute. The temporal separation
of cause and effect, like that of copulation and birth for animals,
seems to evade our collective ability to learn. Case in point : the war
on drugs. You're not critical enough of who determines what is worthy of
suspicion.

Bet on it. The ropers are not all good actors. I haven't watch or
listened to a single one of them that I would share a dinner table or a
camp fire with. And I'm not sure I agree that WE are providing the rope
to the ropers. It seems rather that the ropers are taking the rope while
everyone else stands by without objection, blinded by tears, anger and
fear.

You sound very sure that you have them to give up.

That sounds overly trusting of the motivations and loyalties of those
who you entrust with the power of life and death.

Assigning attributes of right and wrong is a personal matter. Fear comes
from the knowledge of risk. That is unless you are running one of those
old-time Christian plug-ins that has a default

While I agree with operating from a position of strength, after that
you've lost it.

Demonizing the enemy is a standard phase in conflict. I guess that's
what it takes to convince oneself that it is OK to rip people into
little pieces and avoid the emotions that invariably go along with that.
A simple self-administered psychoanalgesic as it were.

In the footage of Afghanistan that I've seen everyone appears to be
pretty much human.

hmmm. Yes, the US does have more than a faint touch of megalomania.

Rambling crap. Somebody's been watching too much television. My vote is
for Ginger at night, Maryann in the morning and Jeannie for a nooner.
