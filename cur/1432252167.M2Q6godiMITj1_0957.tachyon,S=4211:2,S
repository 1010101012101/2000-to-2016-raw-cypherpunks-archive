I just read an interesting email that you sent concerning cracking .pwl =
files.  I have a need to crack a .pwl file, but I don't know how to make =
that program work.  I'm really not computer literate (if you can't =
tell).  I am a concerned parent that has stumbled upon information that =
is not good regarding my teen and the Internet.  Could you help me find =
out what these passwords are or how to work that program?  I downloaded =
some sort of password pwl program and it showed 17 passwords, but they =
are encrypted.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mrs. Banks
