"If it is true that Stakeknife was the head of [IRA] internal security,
then it is a major coup for the British,"

Yep, just like counter intel chiefs Aldrich Ames and Bob Hanssen.  Funny
how CI/"internal security" attracts
double agents...

Stakeknife was only an eighth-of-million US$ a year, much cheaper than
the CIA & FBI's moles
were to the CCCP, but living expenses are probably cheaper in N. Ireland
than in D.C.
