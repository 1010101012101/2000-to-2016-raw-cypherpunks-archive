It's already being done.

It seems, however, that the formatting of some messages is getting
screwed up.  I haven't found the problem yet, but your other recent
mail is an example of this.  Do you have a copy of the original
message so I can look into what's going wrong?  If so, please send it
to me personally.

Thanks.
