It has in the uk - no protected cd in the uk uses the cd logo. Doesn't make it any easier
though, as that is on the back of the case, and the cases are stacked with all the real-cd
cases in the display racks; if you decide you don't want a not-cd, having discovered it is
one on examination of the case, its not as if you have a legal alternative; you can't even
buy it, download the tracks on [insert p2p here] and claim fair use, as that doesn't exist
in the UK.
