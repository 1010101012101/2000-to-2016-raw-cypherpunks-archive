Gait advances in emerging biometrics

"Great Juno comes; I know her by her gait."
William Shakespeare, The Tempest

Retinal scans, finger printing or facial recognition get most of the 
publicity but researchers across the world are quietly labouring away at 
alternative types of biometrics.

Recognition by the way someone walk (their gait), the shape of their ears, 
the rhythm they make when they tap and the involuntary response of ears to 
sounds all have the potential to raise the stock of biometric techniques. 
According to Professor Mark Nixon, of the Image Speech and Recognition 
Research Group at the University of Southampton, each has unique 
advantages which makes them worth exploring.
