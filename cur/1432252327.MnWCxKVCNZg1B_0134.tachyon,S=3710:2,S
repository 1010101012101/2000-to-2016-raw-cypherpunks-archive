Unfortunately anything that uses X.509 (like SSL) will require it.
It's possible to write small X.509/ASN.1 decoding packages.  One that I
wrote for a small-device SSL package takes about 11k code (gcc on Intel
PIII) and it's not very optimized- there's lots of room to squeeze it
down farther than the original application required.

Encoding ASN.1 really eats space though, because of the nested nature
of complex ASN.1... unless you do some tricks like I did in US patent
6,111,660.   Using this trick, we were able to encode SET messages
(really ugly ASN.1) using only 4 bytes more than the size of the final
message.  So we could comfortably run client-side SET in less than 24k
of RAM.
