Sure.  Just noting that the capability is there, since it's easy to
overlook.  It works reliably in my experience.

This I don't understand.

Can you describe a scenario under which an encrypted fs is valuable enough
to justify typing one command, but not two?  OpenBSD's target audience is
not exactly clueless newbies.

Or is speed so important that you'd sacrifice security?  Any encrypted fs
will take a performance hit; I think you'll find loopback overhead is
insignificant next to the crypto.

Is booting from an encrypted fs ever useful?  Use read-only media if
tampering is a concern.  Configure and mount other encrypted filesystems
from /etc/rc.  If you can install and maintain OpenBSD, you can manage
that.

It's worth noting their primary goal is network security, not crypto.
Rubber hoses don't factor significantly in their threat model.
