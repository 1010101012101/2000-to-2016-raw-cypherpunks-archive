This is a really subtle issue. Much has been written about how to =
optimize mixing pools.=20
6-12 hours is a really long delay for many purposes. If not everyone is =
doing so, long delay messages might turn out to be of particular =
interest.

It also seems like a bad idea to put the message holding function at the =
sender's end. That makes it easier to try to identify who might have =
been storing messages for later delivery.
This might be a very simple and interesting service to provide at the =
end of remailer chains. Exit remailers might have an additional command =
which would instruct them to hold the message for a given period or =
until a given time before final delivery.

With Mixmaster I spent a lot of time thinking about message size. If you =
can recognize a message from its size as it enters and leaves a node, =
then all the delay and mixing is effectively thwarted.
