The whole idea of NDTM's arises from parallelism - having the correct answer
and validating it is equivalent to having all the answers and validating
them in parallel, producing one or more correct ones.

Remember that we are not quantifying over the set of boolean expressions but
over the set of possible inputs to a given, finite one.
