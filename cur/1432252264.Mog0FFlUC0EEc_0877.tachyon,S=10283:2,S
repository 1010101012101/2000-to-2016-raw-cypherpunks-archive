Matt Gaylor has forwarded this article. My profound thanks to him. This

political situation in the U.S., the "red" vs. "blue" separation.

Truly ironic that it takes a "red" to understand the "reds" in the U.S.

(For those outside the U.S., a word of explanation. For some reason, 
political mappers showed votes for Al Gore in _blue_ and votes for Bush 
in _red_. I have no idea how this came to be...I had never noticed it 
until this past election. In fact, it was only in this past election 
that most of the commentators glommed on this "look at the red parts of 
the map versus the blue parts of the map" meme, so apparently a lot of 
us got exposed to this red vs. blue mapping only recently.)

While there's still a little bit of "propaganda" language in the 
article, it is generally a more incisive analysis of the developing 
trends in American politics than nearly all of what passes for analysis 
by American journalists.

I urge people to read the full article carefully. I'll only comment on a 
handful of paragraphs.

Amazing that a Russian publication (is it really Russian, or just 
reprinted by them?) gets this so right. Nearly all American journalists 
just babble about skinheads and survivalists when they talk about the 
militia movement.

Indeed.

Wow. It takes a Russian to call a spade a spade.

The SPLC is the most anti-liberty organization in the U.S. Words fail me 
in describing them.

This move to a police state took a big move forward this morning, 
October 26th.

No particular comment on this excerpt, but I include it to give a flavor 
of this guy's detailed understanding (he knows a lot more than I do 
about militia movements, that's for sure!).

Wow.

Agreed. Too bad Bush is pushing the New World Order agenda, though I 
suppose it was thrust upon him by events. Al Gore certainly would have 
been even more internationalist.
