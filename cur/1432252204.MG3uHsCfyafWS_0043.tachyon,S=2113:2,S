In automotive power systems, the bigger concern is load dump.  When
there's a step change in alternator load from high to low, the commutating
inductances resulting from the field windings of the alternator can't
react quickly enough, and you tend to get big spikes on the power lines.

Perhaps this could be used to advantage---if you want to convince
someone that your electronics blew up on their own, blow up the
rectifier at the output of your alternator, too.
