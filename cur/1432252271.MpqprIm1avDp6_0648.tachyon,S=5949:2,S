You miss the point. All that is needed is for someone, somewhere, to
find these things desirable. It doesn't have to be you or me. We might
think they are immoral but that changes nothing in practice. Or do you
think that Muslims or Socialists or Greens or Zionists or the IRA or the
CIA or the ETA or Presbyterians or Monsanto or whoever *you* dislike
this week are incapable of choosing technology appropriate to their own
perception of their needs?

All true, they are shits. And violent, well-armed, cruel, frightened,
shits at that. But, in this context,  so what?

Said who? Actually he is a bit of a bogeyman & 90% of what he is accused
of is just US propaganda looking for a new enemy to justify the
continuation of cold-war military budgets - but there are other guys,
like the Taliban, who really are that  nasty - one of the endearingly
cute things about US politics is that you get collectively confused when
people don't like you so you assume they are being duped by evil
criminal masterminds, so you find it much easier to deal with the
concept of a Dark Lord in the East than you do with the idea that
millions of people actually hate and fear the USA for good reason. And
it was the US government that funded the Taliban to start with (with a
little help from their friends in Pakistan).

You aren't seeing the picture at all if you think anyone much here was
suggesting that you should support him.  All that is being proposed is
that people in that position really want the kind of technology we've
been talking about, some of them are able to pay for it, so the chances
are they are going to get it, and someone might make money out of it,
and that will fund further developments. You don't have to think that is
a *good* thing, you might think it is a very bad thing indeed, but you
do have to deal with it.
