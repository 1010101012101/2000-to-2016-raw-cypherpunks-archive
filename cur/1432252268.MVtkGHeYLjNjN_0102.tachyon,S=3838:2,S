OK piece. I usually write off Buckley as a pompous ass. I wish we would
hear more skepticism about GWB and Ashcroft and their domestic
treasonous idiocy.

As far as his assertion about the popularity of UBL in the Philippines :
sounds like a stretcher to me - Muslims are only strong in the extreme
south e.g. Mindanao. Most of the population is pretty strict Catholic.
There may be some resentment of the US but I think overall there is a
hunger for all things US : education, media, goods, travel and trade.

The older folks definitely still remember the Japanese.
