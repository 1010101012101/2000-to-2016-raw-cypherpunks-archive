FYI it works fine from over here & has for a while. 

nslookup www.cryptome.org
Name:    cryptome.org
Address:  161.58.201.197
Aliases:  www.cryptome.org

nslookup jya.org
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    jya.org
Address:  216.248.201.38

Do you mean that there really is only one nameserver? If so that would
be a large-scale dereliction of duty for a respectable ISP. Or that
there are two (or more) servers, but both your entries are on the same
