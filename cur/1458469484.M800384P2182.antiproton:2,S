*By John Markoff, from* Machines of Loving Grace, *out this month from Ecco
Books. Markoff has been a technology and business reporter for the* New
York Times *since 1988.*

B

ill Duvall grew up on the peninsula south of San Francisco. The son of a
physicist who was involved in classified research at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), a military-oriented think tank, Duvall attended UC
Berkeley in the mid-1960s; he took all the university=E2=80=99s
computer-programming courses and dropped out after two years. When he
joined the think tank where his father worked, a few miles from the
Stanford campus, he was assigned to the team of artificial-intelligence
researchers who were building Shakey.

Although *Life* magazine would later dub Shakey the first =E2=80=9Celectron=
ic
person,=E2=80=9D it was basically a six-foot stack of gear, sensors, and mo=
torized
wheels that was tethered =E2=80=94 and later wirelessly connected =E2=80=94=
 to a nearby
mainframe. Shakey wasn=E2=80=99t the world=E2=80=99s first mobile robot, bu=
t it was the
first that was intended to be truly autonomous. It was designed to reason
about the world around it, to plan its own actions, and to perform tasks.
It could find and push objects and move in a planned way in its highly
structured world.

At both SRI and the nearby Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(SAIL), which was founded by John McCarthy in 1962, a tightly knit group of
researchers was attempting to build machines that mimicked human
capabilities. To this group, Shakey was a striking portent of the future;
they believed that the scientific breakthrough that would enable machines
to act like humans was coming in just a few short years. Indeed, among the
small community of AI researchers who were working on both coasts during
the mid-Sixties, there was virtually boundless optimism.

But the reality disappointed Duvall. Shakey lived in a large open room with
linoleum floors and a couple of racks of electronics. Box-like objects were
scattered around for the robot to =E2=80=9Cplay=E2=80=9D with. Shakey=E2=80=
=99s sensors would
capture its environment and then it would =E2=80=9Cthink=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94=
 standing motionless for
minutes on end =E2=80=94 before moving. Even in its closed and controlled w=
orld,
the robot frequently broke down or drained its batteries after just minutes
of operation.

Down the hall from the Shakey laboratory, another research group, led by
computer scientist Doug Engelbart, was building a computer to run a program
called NLS =E2=80=94 the oN-Line System. Most people who know of Engelbart =
today
know him as the inventor of the mouse. But the mouse, to Engelbart, was
simply a gadget to improve our ability to interact with computers. His more
encompassing idea was to use computer technologies to make it possible for
small groups of scientists, engineers, and educators to =E2=80=9Cbootstrap=
=E2=80=9D their
projects by employing an array of ever more powerful software tools to
organize their activities and create a =E2=80=9Ccollective I.Q.=E2=80=9D th=
at outstripped
the capabilities of any single individual. During World War II, Engelbart
had stumbled across an article by Vannevar Bush that proposed a
microfilm-based information-retrieval system called Memex to manage all of
the world=E2=80=99s knowledge. He realized that such a system could be asse=
mbled
with computers.

The cultural gulf between McCarthy=E2=80=99s artificial intelligence and
Engelbart=E2=80=99s contrarian NLS was already apparent to those on either =
side.
When Engelbart visited MIT to demonstrate his project, prominent AI
researcher Marvin Minsky complained that he was wasting research dollars on
a glorified word processor. But the idea captivated Bill Duvall. Before
long he switched his allegiance and moved down the hall to work in
Engelbart=E2=80=99s lab.

Late on the evening of October 29, 1969, Duvall connected the NLS system in
Menlo Park, via a data line leased from the phone company, to a computer
controlled by another young hacker in Los Angeles. It was the first time
that two computers connected over the network that would become the
Internet. Duvall=E2=80=99s leap from the Shakey laboratory to Engelbart=E2=
=80=99s NLS made
him one of the earliest people to stand on both sides of a line that even
today distinguishes two rival engineering communities. One of these
communities has relentlessly pursued the automation of the human
experience =E2=80=94 artificial intelligence. The other, human-computer
interaction =E2=80=94 what Engelbart called intelligence augmentation =E2=
=80=94 has
concerned itself with =E2=80=9Cman-machine symbiosis.=E2=80=9D What separat=
es AI and IA is
partly their technical approaches, but the distinction also implies
differing ethical stances toward the relationship of man to machine.

D

uring the 1970s and 1980s the field of artificial intelligence drew a
generation of brilliant engineers, but it often disappointed them in much
the way that it had disappointed Duvall. Like him, many of these engineers
turned to the contrasting ideal of intelligence augmentation. But today, AI
is beginning to meet some of the promises made for it by SAIL and SRI
researchers half a century ago, and artificial intelligence is poised to
have an impact on society that may be greater than the effect of personal
computing and the Internet.

Although their project has now largely been forgotten, the designers of
Shakey pioneered computing technologies that are now used by more than a
billion people. The mapping software in our cars and our smartphones is
based on techniques the team first developed. Their A* algorithm is the
best-known way to find the shortest path between two locations. Toward the
end of the Shakey project, speech control was added as a research task;
Apple=E2=80=99s Siri, whose name is a nod to SRI, is a distant descendent o=
f the
machine that began life as a stack of rolling sensors and actuators.

While Engelbart=E2=80=99s original research led directly to the PC and the
Internet, McCarthy=E2=80=99s lab did not provide a single dramatic breakthr=
ough.
Rather, the falling costs of sensors, computer processing, and information
storage, along with the gradual shift away from symbolic logic and toward
more pragmatic statistical and machine-learning algorithms, have made it
possible for engineers and programmers to create computerized systems that
see, speak, listen, and move around in the world.

As a result, AI has been transformed from an academic curiosity into a
force that is altering countless aspects of the modern world. This has
created an increasingly clear choice for designers =E2=80=94 a choice that =
has
become philosophical and ethical, rather than simply technical: will we
design humans into or out of the systems that transport us, that grow our
food, manufacture our goods, and provide our entertainment?

A

s computing and robotics systems have grown from laboratory curiosities
into the fabric that weaves together modern life, the AI and IA communities
have continued to speak past each other. The field of human-computer
interface has largely operated within the philosophical framework
originally set down by Engelbart =E2=80=94 that computers should be used to=
 assist
humans. In contrast, the artificial-intelligence community has for the most
part remained unconcerned with preserving a role for individual humans in
the systems it creates.

Terry Winograd was one of the first to see the two extremes clearly and to
consider their consequences. As a graduate student at MIT in the 1960s,
Winograd studied human language in order to build a software robot that was
capable of interacting with humans in conversation. During the 1980s, he
was part of a small group of AI researchers who engaged in seminars at
Berkeley with the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle. The
philosophers persuaded Winograd that there were real limits to the
capabilities of intelligent machines. In part because of his changing
views, he left the field of artificial intelligence.

A decade later, as the faculty adviser for Google cofounder Larry Page,
Winograd counseled the young graduate student to focus on Web search rather
than more far-fetched technologies. Page=E2=80=99s original PageRank algori=
thm, the
heart of Google=E2=80=99s search engine, can perhaps be seen as the most po=
werful
example of human augmentation in history. The algorithm systematically
collected human decisions about the value of information and pooled those
decisions to prioritize search results. Although some criticized the
process for siphoning intellectual labor from vast numbers of unwitting
humans, the algorithm established an unstated social contract: Google mined
the wealth of human knowledge and returned it in searchable form to
society, while reserving for itself the right to monetize the results.

Since it established its search box as the world=E2=80=99s most powerful
information monopoly, Google has yo-yoed between IA and AI applications and
services. The ill-fated Google Glass was intended as a
=E2=80=9Creality-augmentation system,=E2=80=9D while the company=E2=80=99s =
driverless-car project
represents a pure AI =E2=80=94 replacing human agency and intelligence with=
 a
machine. Recently, Google has undertaken what it loosely identifies as
=E2=80=9Cbrain=E2=80=9D projects, which suggests a new wave of AI.

In 2012, Google researchers presented a paper on a machine-vision system.
After training itself on 10 million digital images taken from YouTube
videos, the system dramatically outperformed previous efforts at an
automated-vision network, roughly doubling their accuracy in recognizing
objects from a list of 20,000 distinct items. Among other things, the
system taught itself to recognize cats =E2=80=94 perhaps not surprising, gi=
ven the
overabundance of cat videos on YouTube =E2=80=94 with a mechanism that the
scientists described as a cybernetic cousin to what takes place in the
brain=E2=80=99s visual cortex. The experiment was made possible by Google=
=E2=80=99s immense
computing resources, which allowed researchers to turn loose a cluster of
16,000 processors on the problem =E2=80=94 though that number still, of cou=
rse,
represented a tiny fraction of the billions of neurons in a human brain, a
huge portion of which are devoted to vision.

S

peculation about whether Google is on the trail of a genuine artificial
brain has become increasingly rampant. There is certainly no question that
a growing group of Silicon Valley engineers and scientists believe
themselves to be closing in on =E2=80=9Cstrong=E2=80=9D AI =E2=80=94 the cr=
eation of a self-aware
machine with human or greater intelligence.

Whether or not this goal is ever achieved, it is becoming increasingly
possible =E2=80=94 and =E2=80=9Crational=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 to design human=
s out of systems for both
performance and cost reasons. In manufacturing, where robots can directly
replace human labor, the impact of artificial intelligence will be easily
visible. In other cases the direct effects will be more difficult to
discern. Winston Churchill said, =E2=80=9CWe shape our buildings, and after=
wards
our buildings shape us.=E2=80=9D Today our computational systems have becom=
e
immense edifices that define the way we interact with our society.

In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to celebrate this development, a trend
that is most clearly visible in organizations like the Singularity
Institute and in books like Kevin Kelly=E2=80=99s *What Technology Wants* (=
2010).
In an earlier book, *Out of Control* (1994), Kelly came down firmly on the
side of the machines:

The problem with our robots today is that we don=E2=80=99t respect them. Th=
ey are
stuck in factories without windows, doing jobs that humans don=E2=80=99t wa=
nt to
do. We take machines as slaves, but they are not that. That=E2=80=99s what =
Marvin
Minsky, the mathematician who pioneered artificial intelligence, tells
anyone who will listen. Minsky goes all the way as an advocate for
downloading human intelligence into a computer. Doug Engelbart, on the
other hand, is the legendary guy who invented word processing, the mouse,
and hypermedia, and who is an advocate for computers-for-the-people. When
the two gurus met at MIT in the 1950s, they are reputed to have had the
following conversation:

minsky: We=E2=80=99re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to m=
ake them
conscious!

engelbart: You=E2=80=99re going to do all that for the machines? What are y=
ou going
to do for the people?

This story is usually told by engineers working to make computers more
friendly, more humane, more people centered. But I=E2=80=99m squarely on Mi=
nsky=E2=80=99s
side =E2=80=94 on the side of the made. People will survive. We=E2=80=99ll =
train our
machines to serve us. But what are we going to do for the machines?

But to say that people will =E2=80=9Csurvive=E2=80=9D understates the possi=
ble
consequences: Minsky is said to have responded to a question about the
significance of the arrival of artificial intelligence by saying, =E2=80=9C=
If we=E2=80=99re
lucky, they=E2=80=99ll keep us as pets.=E2=80=9D

Until recently, the artificial-intelligence community has largely chosen to
ignore the ethics of systems that they consider merely powerful tools. When
I asked one engineer who is building next-generation robots about the
impact of automation on people, he told me, =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t thin=
k about that;
you just have to decide that you are going to do the best you can to
improve the world for humanity as a whole.=E2=80=9D

AI and machine-learning algorithms have already led to transformative
applications in areas as diverse as science, manufacturing, and
entertainment. Machine vision and pattern recognition have been essential
to improving quality in semiconductor design. Drug-discovery algorithms
have systematized the creation of new pharmaceuticals. The same
breakthroughs have also brought us increased government surveillance and
social-media companies whose business model depends on invading privacy for
profit.

Optimists hope that the potential abuses of our computer systems will be
minimized if the application of artificial intelligence, genetic
engineering, and robotics remains focused on humans rather than algorithms.
But the tech industry has not had a track record that speaks to moral
enlightenment. It would be truly remarkable if a Silicon Valley company
rejected a profitable technology for ethical reasons. Today, decisions
about implementing technology are made largely on the basis of
profitability and efficiency. What is needed is a new moral calculus.

know of Engelbart today know him as the inventor of the mouse. But the mous=
e, to Engelbart, was simply a gadget to improve our ability to interact wit=
h computers. His more encompassing idea was to use computer technologies to=
 make it possible for small groups of scientists, engineers, and educators =
to =E2=80=9Cbootstrap=E2=80=9D their projects by employing an array of ever=
 more powerful software tools to organize their activities and create a =E2=
=80=9Ccollective I.Q.=E2=80=9D that outstripped the capabilities of any sin=
gle individual. During World War II, Engelbart had stumbled across an artic=
le by Vannevar Bush that proposed a microfilm-based information-retrieval s=
ystem called Memex to manage all of the world=E2=80=99s knowledge. He reali=
zed that such a system could be assembled with computers.</p>
<p class=3D"">The cultural gulf between McCarthy=E2=80=99s artificial intel=
ligence and Engelbart=E2=80=99s contrarian NLS was already apparent to thos=
e on either side. When Engelbart visited MIT to demonstrate his project, pr=
ominent AI researcher Marvin Minsky complained that he was wasting research=
 dollars on a glorified word processor. But the idea captivated Bill Duvall=
. Before long he switched his allegiance and moved down the hall to work in=
 Engelbart=E2=80=99s lab.</p>
<p class=3D"">Late on the evening of October=C2=A029, 1969, Duvall connecte=
d the NLS system in Menlo Park, via a data line leased from the phone compa=
ny, to a computer controlled by another young hacker in Los Angeles. It was=
 the first time that two computers connected over the network that would be=
come the Internet. Duvall=E2=80=99s leap from the Shakey laboratory to Enge=
lbart=E2=80=99s NLS made him one of the earliest people to stand on both si=
des of a line that even today distinguishes two rival engineering communiti=
es. One of these communities has relentlessly pursued the automation of the=
 human experience=C2=A0=E2=80=94 artificial intelligence. The other, human-=
computer interaction=C2=A0=E2=80=94 what Engelbart called intelligence augm=
entation=C2=A0=E2=80=94 has concerned itself with =E2=80=9Cman-machine symb=
iosis.=E2=80=9D What separates AI and IA is partly their technical approach=
es, but the distinction also implies differing ethical stances toward the r=
elationship of man to machine.</p>
<p class=3D"">D</p>
<p class=3D"">uring the 1970s and 1980s the field of artificial intelligenc=
e drew a generation of brilliant engineers, but it often disappointed them =
in much the way that it had disappointed Duvall. Like him, many of these en=
gineers turned to the contrasting ideal of intelligence augmentation. But t=
oday, AI is beginning to meet some of the promises made for it by SAIL and =
SRI researchers half a century ago, and artificial intelligence is poised t=
o have an impact on society that may be greater than the effect of personal=
 computing and the Internet.</p>
<p class=3D"">Although their project has now largely been forgotten, the de=
signers of Shakey pioneered computing technologies that are now used by mor=
e than a billion people. The mapping software in our cars and our smartphon=
es is based on techniques the team first developed. Their A* algorithm is t=
he best-known way to find the shortest path between two locations. Toward t=
he end of the Shakey project, speech control was added as a research task; =
Apple=E2=80=99s Siri, whose name is a nod to SRI, is a distant descendent o=
f the machine that began life as a stack of rolling sensors and actuators.<=
/p>
<p class=3D"">While Engelbart=E2=80=99s original research led directly to t=
he PC and the Internet, McCarthy=E2=80=99s lab did not provide a single dra=
matic breakthrough. Rather, the falling costs of sensors, computer processi=
ng, and information storage, along with the gradual shift away from symboli=
c logic and toward more pragmatic statistical and machine-learning algorith=
ms, have made it possible for engineers and programmers to create computeri=
zed systems that see, speak, listen, and move around in the world.</p>
<p class=3D"">As a result, AI has been transformed from an academic curiosi=
ty into a force that is altering countless aspects of the modern world. Thi=
s has created an increasingly clear choice for designers=C2=A0=E2=80=94 a c=
hoice that has become philosophical and ethical, rather than simply technic=
al: will we design humans into or out of the systems that transport us, tha=
t grow our food, manufacture our goods, and provide our entertainment?</p>
<p class=3D"">A</p>
<p class=3D"">s computing and robotics systems have grown from laboratory c=
uriosities into the fabric that weaves together modern life, the AI and IA =
communities have continued to speak past each other. The field of human-com=
puter interface has largely operated within the philosophical framework ori=
ginally set down by Engelbart=C2=A0=E2=80=94 that computers should be used =
to assist humans. In contrast, the artificial-intelligence community has fo=
r the most part remained unconcerned with preserving a role for individual =
humans in the systems it creates.</p>
<p class=3D"">Terry Winograd was one of the first to see the two extremes c=
learly and to consider their consequences. As a graduate student at MIT in =
the 1960s, Winograd studied human language in order to build a software rob=
ot that was capable of interacting with humans in conversation. During the =
1980s, he was part of a small group of AI researchers who engaged in semina=
rs at Berkeley with the philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle. The ph=
ilosophers persuaded Winograd that there were real limits to the capabiliti=
es of intelligent machines. In part because of his changing views, he left =
the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class=3D"">A decade later, as the faculty adviser for Google cofounder L=
arry Page, Winograd counseled the young graduate student to focus on Web se=
arch rather than more far-fetched technologies. Page=E2=80=99s original Pag=
eRank algorithm, the heart of Google=E2=80=99s search engine, can perhaps b=
e seen as the most powerful example of human augmentation in history. The a=
lgorithm systematically collected human decisions about the value of inform=
ation and pooled those decisions to prioritize search results. Although som=
e criticized the process for siphoning intellectual labor from vast numbers=
 of unwitting humans, the algorithm established an unstated social contract=
: Google mined the wealth of human knowledge and returned it in searchable =
form to society, while reserving for itself the right to monetize the resul=
ts.</p>
<p class=3D"">Since it established its search box as the world=E2=80=99s mo=
st powerful information monopoly, Google has yo-yoed between IA and AI appl=
ications and services. The ill-fated Google Glass was intended as a =E2=80=
=9Creality-augmentation system,=E2=80=9D while the company=E2=80=99s driver=
less-car project represents a pure AI=C2=A0=E2=80=94 replacing human agency=
 and intelligence with a machine. Recently, Google has undertaken what it l=
oosely identifies as =E2=80=9Cbrain=E2=80=9D projects, which suggests a new=
 wave of AI.</p>
<p class=3D"">In 2012, Google researchers presented a paper on a machine-vi=
sion system. After training itself on 10 million digital images taken from =
YouTube videos, the system dramatically outperformed previous efforts at an=
 automated-vision network, roughly doubling their accuracy in recognizing o=
bjects from a list of 20,000 distinct items. Among other things, the system=
 taught itself to recognize cats=C2=A0=E2=80=94 perhaps not surprising, giv=
en the overabundance of cat videos on YouTube=C2=A0=E2=80=94 with a mechani=
sm that the scientists described as a cybernetic cousin to what takes place=
 in the brain=E2=80=99s visual cortex. The experiment was made possible by =
Google=E2=80=99s immense computing resources, which allowed researchers to =
turn loose a cluster of 16,000 processors on the problem=C2=A0=E2=80=94 tho=
ugh that number still, of course, represented a tiny fraction of the billio=
ns of neurons in a human brain, a huge portion of which are devoted to visi=
on.</p>
<p class=3D"">S</p>
<p class=3D"">peculation about whether Google is on the trail of a genuine =
artificial brain has become increasingly rampant. There is certainly no que=
stion that a growing group of Silicon Valley engineers and scientists belie=
ve themselves to be closing in on =E2=80=9Cstrong=E2=80=9D AI=C2=A0=E2=80=
=94 the creation of a self-aware machine with human or greater intelligence=
.</p>
<p class=3D"">Whether or not this goal is ever achieved, it is becoming inc=
reasingly possible=C2=A0=E2=80=94 and =E2=80=9Crational=E2=80=9D=C2=A0=E2=
=80=94 to design humans out of systems for both performance and cost reason=
s. In manufacturing, where robots can directly replace human labor, the imp=
act of artificial intelligence will be easily visible. In other cases the d=
irect effects will be more difficult to discern. Winston Churchill said, =
=E2=80=9CWe shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.=E2=
=80=9D Today our computational systems have become immense edifices that de=
fine the way we interact with our society.</p>
<p class=3D"">In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to celebrate this develop=
ment, a trend that is most clearly visible in organizations like the Singul=
arity Institute and in books like Kevin Kelly=E2=80=99s <i>What Technology =
Wants</i> (2010). In an earlier book, <i>Out of Control</i> (1994), Kelly c=
ame down firmly on the side of the machines:</p>
<p class=3D"">The problem with our robots today is that we don=E2=80=99t re=
spect them. They are stuck in factories without windows, doing jobs that hu=
mans don=E2=80=99t want to do. We take machines as slaves, but they are not=
 that. That=E2=80=99s what Marvin Minsky, the mathematician who pioneered a=
rtificial intelligence, tells anyone who will listen. Minsky goes all the w=
ay as an advocate for downloading human intelligence into a computer. Doug =
Engelbart, on the other hand, is the legendary guy who invented word proces=
sing, the mouse, and hypermedia, and who is an advocate for computers-for-t=
he-people. When the two gurus met at MIT in the 1950s, they are reputed to =
have had the following conversation:</p>
<p class=3D""><span class=3D"">minsky</span>: We=E2=80=99re going to make m=
achines intelligent. We are going to make them conscious!</p>
<p class=3D""><span class=3D"">engelbart</span>: You=E2=80=99re going to do=
 all that for the machines? What are you going to do for the people?</p>
<p class=3D"">This story is usually told by engineers working to make compu=
ters more friendly, more humane, more people centered. But I=E2=80=99m squa=
rely on Minsky=E2=80=99s side=C2=A0=E2=80=94 on the side of the made. Peopl=
e will survive. We=E2=80=99ll train our machines to serve us. But what are =
we going to do for the machines?</p>
<p class=3D"">But to say that people will =E2=80=9Csurvive=E2=80=9D underst=
ates the possible consequences: Minsky is said to have responded to a quest=
ion about the significance of the arrival of artificial intelligence by say=
ing, =E2=80=9CIf we=E2=80=99re lucky, they=E2=80=99ll keep us as pets.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
<p class=3D"">Until recently, the artificial-intelligence community has lar=
gely chosen to ignore the ethics of systems that they consider merely power=
ful tools. When I asked one engineer who is building next-generation robots=
 about the impact of automation on people, he told me, =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=
=80=99t think about that; you just have to decide that you are going to do =
the best you can to improve the world for humanity as a whole.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p class=3D"">AI and machine-learning algorithms have already led to transf=
ormative applications in areas as diverse as science, manufacturing, and en=
tertainment. Machine vision and pattern recognition have been essential to =
improving quality in semiconductor design. Drug-discovery algorithms have s=
ystematized the creation of new pharmaceuticals. The same breakthroughs hav=
e also brought us increased government surveillance and social-media compan=
ies whose business model depends on invading privacy for profit.</p>
<p class=3D"">Optimists hope that the potential abuses of our computer syst=
ems will be minimized if the application of artificial intelligence, geneti=
c engineering, and robotics remains focused on humans rather than algorithm=
s. But the tech industry has not had a track record that speaks to moral en=
lightenment. It would be truly remarkable if a Silicon Valley company rejec=
ted a profitable technology for ethical reasons. Today, decisions about imp=
lementing technology are made largely on the basis of profitability and eff=
iciency. What is needed is a new moral calculus.</p><div><br></div>-- <br><=
