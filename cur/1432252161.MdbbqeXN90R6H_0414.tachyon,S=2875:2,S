By forcing Americans to turn in
their gold before devaluation, the Feds got more gold for less money.

But:  the individual common folk couldn't be forced to turn in their gold if
the govmt didn't know they had any, right, since gold wasn't/isn't
trackable.  So it would only have been highly visible commercial entities
who couldn't refuse?
