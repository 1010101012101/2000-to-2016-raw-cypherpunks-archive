Note my information may be out of date.  I believe that MacOS native 
encrypted disk images (and thus FileVault) uses AES in CBC mode without 
any integrity protection, the Wikipedia article seems to confirm that is 
 (or at least was) the case http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault

There is also a sleep mode issue identified by the NSA:

TrueCrypt on the other hand uses AES in XTS mode so you get 
confidentiality and integrity.
