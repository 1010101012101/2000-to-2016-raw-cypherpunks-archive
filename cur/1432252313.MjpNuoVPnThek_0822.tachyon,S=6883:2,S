Where did this bullshit come from? Did someone take a ravioli recipe and
do some search and replace?

Is Dr. Joe Baptista really Jim Choate in disguise?

My favorite short quote : 

"The trick is to bring the U-235 masses together at the same time."

I'm slow, I know, so I'm still trying to figure out how to do it any
other way when you have only two pieces. Could someone help me
understand this part of the design?

I would have to say, though, that my absolute favorite part is where one
starts with a supercritical mass and subsequently divides it into two
equal parts in order to prepare the device. ROTFL.

Anyone gonna post fast neutron cross-section data for Pu and U isotopes?
