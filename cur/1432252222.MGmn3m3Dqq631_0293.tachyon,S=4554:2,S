Dear visitor,may I offer my intro without risk of intruding? I fear you may 
not be able to
make yourself understood by the worthy ape who presides over this 
website.In fact he speaks
nothing so much as double dutch,so unless you authorize me to intercede for 
you he wont guess
what you want to talk about.
There,I dare hope he understood me,that nod must mean he yields to my 
arguments.He is making
haste with prudent deliberation.You are lucky he didn't grunt.When he 
refuses to someone,he
merely grunts.No one insists.Being master of ones moods is the privilege of 
the larger animals.
Now I shall withdraw,fellow surfer,happy to have been of any help.Ill stay 
a while with you if
you like,we're all the same here.Yes? Well then lets share a cleansing ale 
together,Salud!
What's that? His silence is deafening,you say,your absolutely right,its 
deafening like a primeval
forest,heavy with threats.His business, such as it is,is entertaining 
surfers of all nations
who come here,who knows why.With such duties you'd think there might be 
some fear that his
ignorance could be awkward.Like a cro-magnon man top the tower of babel he 
should be out of his
element.Yet this one's unconscious of all that.He goes his own sweet way 
and nothing touches him.
One of the rare sentences I've heard from his mouth proclaimed that you 
could take it or leave it.
Take or leave what? No doubt our friend.
I am drawn to such creatures that are all of one piece.Everyone I know 
that's studied humanity is irresistibly led to nostalgia for the 
primates,at least they have no ulterior motives.Our  host does have some 
though they
are well hidden.As a result of not understanding what's said in his 
presence,he's adopted that
distrustful disposition.See that look of touchy dignity as if he at least 
suspected that all
is not perfect among us.That disposition makes it difficult to discuss much 
with him that doesn't
affect capitalism.I also blame society as you can see from perusing the 
archives a little.
Societies police spoilt the simple frankness of his nature.Mind you I'm not 
judging him,I consider
his mistrust perfectly justified and would share it wholeheartedly if I 
were not talkative by
nature,In fact I should end this conversation now before we talk all 
night.See you soon?
OK. Later.
