I think there was an article last year showing that by monitoring a lot of
exit nodes, it was possible in many cases to determine who had sent the
traffic. Meanwhile, a lot of users weren't encrypting, under the assumption
that TOR was encrypting the last hop. As a result someone (I forget who) was
able to see Embassy and other quite sensitive communications.

Actually, since https is readily available, forcing TOR to encrypt that last
hop would actually slow things down, possibly noticeably.
