Helps if you're actually plugged into and loading value from, say,
the ATM network, or, more fun, something like CREST, or even DTC,
getting us what Schear and I called unsponsored network depository
receipts, back in the day.

Relying on those networks for debit/credit authentication for the
loading problem looks sucky on a first approximation, nothing can be
farther from anonymous, obviously, but once a fungible, and more
important, exchangeable, asset like cash or securities in a custodial
account is subsequently reserved in the account of an underwriter and
represented in bearer form on the net, it can go anywhere it wants --
until,  anyway, it has to go off the net to be put into an identified
account again. Someday, of course, the money stays on forever, and
that's when things get interesting, and that might happen sooner than
we think. Certainly lots of people as has been noted, have figured
out ways to mix the money around once it's there, if that's necessary
for one thing or another.


When IBUC did some work with CRESTCo earlier this year, we figured it
would cost about a million pounds to demo, including the work on
CREST itself, about 2 million pounds for the lawyers, :-), and a few
more mil to go from there into production, not including marketing,
if any.  Since the white-label ATM hardware/software/account service
is out there already, and FSTC's done lots of net-side work already,
a plain-old retail cash product might even be faster to do, once the
banking community -- and, oddly enough, the regulators who weren't
*that* negative on the idea once it was explained to them -- crawl
out from their desks someday.

Not to un-swash his buckle, and all that, because he really deserves
massive kudos for what he's done with HavenCo., but Ryan's already
tried that, once before, on Anguilla, if we all remember, and it
wasn't at all pretty (cf. Declan's articles earlier this year about
the E-Gold/Systemics pissing contest).

I figure this is going to have to be a front-door operation, actually
resident in a financial-center city like London or New York (Boston
would do, I suppose :-)), and not something with servers parked on an
artillery platform, however cool that might be to think about at a
distance. Fortunately, the economic/technology front door keeps
getting opened wider, which, I suppose, was the point of my post to
begin with. It's going to happen, sooner or later, and it doesn't
really matter who does it first.


Even more fun, doing a bearer-form depository receipt instrument
collateralized by any security in CREST, including the S&P 500, is
completely doable right now, up to and including an ATM patch from
CREST to the Link network in the UK. We had proposals flying around
as early as March/April last year from people you've heard of and
they were completely serious. They just got dot-bombed. Transaction
volumes at London depositories, custodians and underwriters, of
course, went in the shitter, and nobody wanted to talk about tomorrow
anymore while they were dodging bullets today.

Pretty spooky, having actual appreciable assets on the net in bearer
form, but it really is that close. Or, at least it was that close
until September 11. And, like I said before, people shouldn't even
afraid of even that anymore.

Cheers,
RAH
