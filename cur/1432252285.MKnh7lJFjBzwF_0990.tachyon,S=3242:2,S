	The main difference being that the Church Goers *think* that 
what they are doing is legal, while the pot smokers (for the most 
part) know that what they are doing is either illegal, or legally 
questionable.

	No, smoking pot *shouldn't* be illegal, but it is. If you get 
caught buying, selling, or smoking, it's you're own damn fault.

	I am not aware of any law against joining or attending a church.
