You were gibbering about how "digicash" includes PayPal, ATMs, Visa, 
and other forms of transfers which are only "digital" in that computers 
are used.

You need to think carefully about what blinding is all about. Calling 
Visa and PayPal "digicash" shows fundamental ignorance.


Nitwit. But very typical of the "new generation of rilly, rilly dumb 
cypherpunks."
