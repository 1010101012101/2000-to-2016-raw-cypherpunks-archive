Location is only available in point-to-point connections, of course
you're free to run remixing layers on top of that infrastructure.

If you want to do cut-through at relativistic speed there are not
many options left. If you want to obscure origins, use anonymization
implemented in higher layers.

That's one of the side effects: it cuts out the middlemen like IANA,
RIRs and LIRs. Anyone can compute one's geographical positions either
from global or local references, and you're free to refuse peering
from position fakers. Faking disturbances takes ownership of the local
loop, and is easily checked by referencing global beakons.
