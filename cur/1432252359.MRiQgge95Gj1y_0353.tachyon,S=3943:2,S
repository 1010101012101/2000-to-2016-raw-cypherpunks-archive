at least we still have a couple more rights than you do, especially when
it comes to copyright. isn't that weird? most europe legislative history
sees copyright as a "natural right", while the US does not. yet you have
more and worse restrictions on it.

examples: where I live, making a copy for a friend is LEGAL. also,
pseudo-copies, such as installing a software to your harddisk or
"copying" it to the memory in order to execute it do not require any
specific allowance, i.e. you don't have to sign away your rights and
your firstborn son on some stupid "license agreement". decss is
unchallenged over here, and is considered perfectly legal by every legal
expert who's opinion was published somewhere where I've seen it.

there's good and bad points everywhere. uninformed comments like yours
above just reveal a prejudice.
