Subject: Are Terrorists Using Crypto?

Once again I've had to defend the domestic use of encryption technology. My
latest "opinion" is at
http://www.cryptonomicon.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=645 . I
don't know if it's of any value to either of you guys, but I thought I would
pass it along anyway.
