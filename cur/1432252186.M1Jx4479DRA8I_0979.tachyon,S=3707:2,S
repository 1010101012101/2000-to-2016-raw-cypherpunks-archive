If you can't trust the hardware vendor there are worse things they can do to 
you. But in essence you either trust them or you don't.

This changes the rules some, but generally speaking with modern encryption, 
if the key is not available you're screwed.

You missed the part where it can only be done with the administrator 
password.

There is no reason to hide the boot block, but too many uneducated users 
would go "But they can find the boot block" and complain about how the 
security MUST be weak, based on a gross misunderstanding of the situation.

I don't know.

Without the introduction of another key it is impoosible to improve on the 
security proof of CBC, so what they've done is introduce a method of 
obfuscation that they hope will not be broken, but breaking it will not 
affect the security of CBC mode in any way, simply because if it did break 
AES-CB, an attacker could apply it themself quite cheaply. The proof 
basically boils down to: it's CBC, attacker loses.
