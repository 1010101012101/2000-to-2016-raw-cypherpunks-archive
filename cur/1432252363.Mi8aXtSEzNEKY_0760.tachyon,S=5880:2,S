Does that mean they have to show that a lot of people want to kill judges?

Or that Jim Bell is very likely to act to directly or indirectly cause
harm to any of the specific (or probably a general target randomly
selected should receive protection also, don't you think?) persons
involved? Don't you have to first prove he had ANY intent to harm first?
Near as I can tell the way to prove intent is to demonstrate through a
chain of acts, or demonstrably intended acts (say a video tape or a
diary) to harm somebody in a general sense.
