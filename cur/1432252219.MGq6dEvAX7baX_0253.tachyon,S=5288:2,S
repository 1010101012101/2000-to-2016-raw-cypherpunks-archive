So after a quick bit of research;
- HSMM is a custom radio protocol that exposes a standard IP network interface
- olsr is being used to mesh these devices together
- other devices may use the network through the LAN interface
So you would have a second access point that the serval phone can
connect to for internet and mesh traffic?
This doesn't sound like a network that serval can transparently
co-exist on. Yet.

Though we have done some initial work to support serval nodes
discovering each other over an olsr network, we haven't built any
protocol to exchange reach-ability information for other locally
connected serval phones. This is a reasonably large piece of work that
we don't have the time to build right now.

You could build servald for the mesh routers and run it on every
device in the network. Though our routing protocol is not as mature as
olsr.

So this router is operating as a simple ethernet bridge?
