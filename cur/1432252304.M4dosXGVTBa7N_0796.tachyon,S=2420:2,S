Basically half the posts to this list are incoherent, idiotic rambling
from mattd@useoz.com and ravage@...  The few bits of wonderfully
interesting news on this list aren't quite wonderful enough to
motivate me to figure out how to use mail filters.  If someone knows
of a filtered version of this list, please let me know.
