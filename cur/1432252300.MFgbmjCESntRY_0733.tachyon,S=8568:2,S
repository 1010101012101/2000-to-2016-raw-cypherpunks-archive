I have proposed that we strip out ALL outside certificate authorities from an
open source browser, and distribute such... and to practice what I preach, I
just went into FF and nuked the bunch - and whee, I can connect, verify the cert
and login :). The USER - a la monkey sphere - has to decide if she trusts the
Certificate Authority - who the hell are they anyway? And to answer my own
rhetorical question - those that issue the highest TRUST certificates to
licensed scammers a.k.a. the banks. I do not trust a single one of the
recommendations of official CAs. If I am forced, like one has to in this world -
to visit a bank website, I can figure out how much I distrust them all by
myself. All I want to know is "am I visiting the same site again"... and a "self
signed" cert is all I need, "ssh style". And yes, I love the monkeysphere
approach which would add meaningful levels of trust to that choice. And no -
there is no difference in my trust level if the cert says "self signed" or
"fairysign super duper" perhaps the former is better! - at least fairysign
cannot go off and bless the MITM - especially of any sites I run!

The basic error of all these cryptographers is to confound security/encryption
with identity. It is a very costly error to make, especially for the people who
blindly use such technology, and one that history shall record as the thing that
facilitated pervasive surveillance and the thought police [warning you are about
to connect to a secure site!] and rampant electronic fraud - the fraud of
misrepresentation by sleight of hand that bank liabilities are
non-distinguishable from legal tender by the official scammers of this planet -
the second layer of circular fraud piled upon the primary circular fraud of
legal tender.

It is quite a spectacle really.
