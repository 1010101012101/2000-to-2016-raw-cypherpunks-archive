They are ignoring the criticism they should be warning users about 
constant issues in endpoint security: Subrosa, Ricochet, TextSecure, 
Cryptocat and Threema have all included a threat model/warning, Tox 
should do so too. Notifying users about risks is what keeps them safe, 
not moving to slightly more secure products they assume are 
impenetrable. Conscious ignoring of this on the developers part equals 
selling "bullshit".

Lets assume they put the warning on the web page. Now every user who 
reads the security warning begins to think "Ok, so given my contacts, 
reputation and opsec, my private key is compromised with probability P. 
Am I still going to write this or do I upgrade my tools? Am I under 
constant monitoring? Do I need to regenerate my keys?". In the beginning 
of Citizenfour, Snowden gives a warning to Poitras about private keys: 
even though PGP encrypts private key at rest. After that, Laura bought 
an airgapped machine and created new PGP keypair.

Again, security is a process, not a product: unless the implementation 
of crypto is secure and users know how to use it, properly written 
Salsa20 implementation isn't going to do much good. Writing a good 
manual is the responsibility of the developer.

Here's a Metasploit payload Meterpreter. How hard do you think it's for 
me to automate the two Armitage GUI functionalities of browsing files 
and logging keystrokes once I buy a 0-day from Vupen with tax money?

Now think about Fox Acid, Metasploit, with a budget. Then think of 
things like Quantuminsert that automate this process on mass scale. Your 
seat belt is a bad analogy. There are no bulletproof solutions but there 
are better ones.

No, the point here is, don't put TCB on a computer that does networking. 
Why are you putting emphasis on the word 'might' when Snowden says NSA 
bypasses encryption *every day*:

No, let's not assume. I've a small desk but it's still able to handle 
the three laptops in a configuration that does not have the issue.

The community has already accepted the host security as part of snake 
oil check. What on earth is the check doing here if we should accept OS 
vulnerabilities as a "baseline"? If the product isn't going to address 
it, it better not neglect it at least, Tox doesn't do even that.

I'm not trying to hijack this Tox discussion to say TFC is the solution. 
I'm trying to say it's pointless to create anything secure on a setup 
the features of which are limited(/rigged) to begin with. That's why 
smartphone is part of the snake oil checklist. The very first step says 
the product has to be FOSS, without free OS, no encryption software 
stands a chance. Without endpoint security, it's the same. The community 
is already praising $1,300 Novena laptops - I'm saying we can achieve 
higher security with set of three $200 COTS laptops and a few extra 
components.
