It is the outcome of the trial which condemns Germany.  THe length of the
trial is an unimportant data point.

THe law clearly defines "hate speech" as the communication of any information which might 
tend to cause people to be displeased with a particular religious or ethnic group, whether 
or not the information is true.

People in Germany have been jailed under the "hate speech" laws for simply suggesting in
written editorials that the Jewish people might act collectively in their own enlightened
self-interest.

As long as truth is no defense against "hate speech," and "hate speech" includes things
which clearly don't involve anyone hating anyone else, "hnate speech" is simply a code
phrase for suppressing free expression.

Yes, the Allies have done an excellent job of redirecting German jackbooted obnoxiousness
back at the German people.  Do you have a point here?

The US isn't free at all.  However, most US citizens support freedom to have opinions and 
to express them.  Germans have to ask their government for permission to think.  Most 
Germans think this is a good thing, by the way.
