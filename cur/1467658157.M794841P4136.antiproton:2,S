Similar, set to a monty python skit:

A man and woman enter.  The man is played by Eric Idle, the woman is
played by Graham Chapman (in drag), and the Secretary of State is played
by Terry Jones, also in drag.

Man:   You sit here, dear.

Woman:          All right.

Man:   Morning!

Secretary of State:     Morning!

Man:   Well, what=92ve you got?

Secretary of State:     Well, there=92s sanctions and prosecutions;
sanctions drone strikes and prosecutions; sanctions and war; sanctions

and war; war drone strikes war war prosecutions war cyber war and war;

Secretary of State:     =85or a United Nations resolution combined with
infiltration, a USAID fake Twitter application, a CIA overthrow, trained

Woman:          Have you got anything without war?

Secretary of State:     Well, there=92s war sanctions drone strikes and
war, that=92s not got much war in it.

Woman:          I don=92t want ANY war!

Man:   Why can=92t she have sanctions prosecutions war and drone strikes?=


Woman:          THAT=92S got war in it!

Man:   Hasn=92t got as much war in it as war sanctions drone strikes and
war, has it?

Vikings:           War war war war=85 (Crescendo through next few lines=85=

Woman:          Could you do the sanctions prosecutions war and drone
strikes without the war then?

Secretary of State:     Urgghh!

Woman:          What do you mean =91Urgghh=92? I don=92t like war!

Vikings:           Lovely war! Wonderful war!

Secretary of State:     Shut up!

then?

Secretary of State:     You mean war war war war war war=85 (but it is to=
