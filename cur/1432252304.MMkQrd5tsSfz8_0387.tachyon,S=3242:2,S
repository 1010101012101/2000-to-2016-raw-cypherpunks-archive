Nothing really surprising here.  This spec, as I understand it, applies 
only to VoIP connections established through the service provider's Call 
Management System (their equivalent of a PBX).  If users employ their own 
SW to do call placement it doesn't come under the spec.  (Of course, that 
means you also don't get the improved latency characteristics offered by 
the ISP for their VoIP terminated calls).
