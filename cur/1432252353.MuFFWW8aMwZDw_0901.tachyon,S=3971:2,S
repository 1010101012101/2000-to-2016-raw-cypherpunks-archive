Works fine for remailers.  If you need to use a remailer, run
one.  You know that at least one remailer in the network is
OK, guaranteeing that your messages will be really
untraceable.

Closing down remailers right now would involve going off
message.  They might however go off message if the war is
nearly won, or nearly lost.

If the war is nearly lost, we can expect a claim that "we
were stabbed in the back", followed by a focus on the
internal enemy.
