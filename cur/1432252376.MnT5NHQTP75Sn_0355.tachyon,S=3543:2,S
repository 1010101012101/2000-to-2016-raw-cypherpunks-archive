However, if you use a low-power board, you have less current to filter the 
ripples from, so you need smaller caps, which offers you more options. You 
can also replace the caps in the power supply for vacuum-resistant types, 
for the price of some soldering.

Do you know some worth of being refered to, if possible low-cost? The 
situation on the market is changing so fast it's difficult to keep track.

Maybe it's agent of Microsoft looking for expanding the market to space!

Also, a lot of cargo can be susceptible to lower pressures. Eg, the 
mentioned capacitors could be popping. So some overpressure during the 
flight has to be maintained there.

In that case, I'd suggest to build it as a wearable computer, integrated 
into the space suit.

Wise. :)

Sealing the boards in resin, under lowered pressure, could possibly help; 
the pressure of the atmosphere would be replaced by the pressure of the 
resin. Another option could be mounting the device into a hermetically 
sealed case, filled with eg. silicone oil for easier heat transfer.
