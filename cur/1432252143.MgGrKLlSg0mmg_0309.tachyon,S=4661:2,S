It's a moot point anyway, but for the record, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 
states that no nation may claim jurisdiction or territory beyond the limits 
of Earth's atmosphere, which is spelled out in a separate treaty as being 
100km altitude above mean sea level.

So even if airlines do pay fees for overflying nations - which seems 
rediculous but no more so than thousands of other laws - it wouldn't apply to 
satellites.
