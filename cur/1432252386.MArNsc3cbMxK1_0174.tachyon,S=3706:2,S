Didn't know Cogent had gone that low yet, thx. HE is more a
provider of mixed services (colo/host/transit) than traditional
pipe though.

Sure. I guess my mention of being an ISP should have said it was
for purposes of going naturally alongside direct allocation.
In a former life, I did send notices to upstream pipe as needed.
ie: If there was an issue requiring it... traceroute, lookup and mail.
So even an independant ISP, in their own room, buying circuit from
L3/etc, could have a ticket lodged at L3. That was also the point about
structuring. Companies layer and silo things as suits them.

>  I've been ignoring DMCA notices for 10 years

As would many rightly do, laws of other countries don't apply. Business
seeks to minimize cost, ignoring saves cost with minimal risk.

Yep, I left that part out of my prior note. That's a big problem as far as
opening up shop as a new ISP. For this or any other purpose. Especially
if you want to keep it private [held and funded] with organic growth... no
time left for that. Save for givebacks and if IANA/etc brokers private swaps,
direct v4 allocation simply won't exist, everything will be SWIP.

The v6 net, current OS's, DNS are all ready. A fair number of popular apps,
certainly opensource ones, do v6. So yes, Tor needs to become v6 capable.

The v4 game may be played out. But given that true global v6 adoption vs
NAT everywhere has what maybe a 50/50 chance?... early v6 ISP's could
make a killing. Maybe we'll be among them :)

Oh well, kindof off topic. Cheers.
