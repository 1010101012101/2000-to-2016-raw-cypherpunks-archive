The "no cameras" signs were very popular in east block countries. It
was forbidden to take pictures of bridges, government buildings,
airports, railway stations, industrial installations, water dams etc.
The signs were prominently displayed and the consensus on their
purpose was essentially to scare and comfort the sheeple. There was an
interview somewhere in early 90-ties when ex-government employee
attested to that. The counter-intelligence purpose was irrelevant even
then - it was just too easy to hide cameras. But harassment of
tourists and hobbyists was great PR, proof that 'authorities' are
doing the job and disarming the imminent evil.

In a depressingly predictable manner US of A is sliding into the same
mode of operation. And, depressingly, it works. Expect more
manufactured everyday threats, more citizen-informants, the works.
Contracting or subcontracting airborne demolition artists is not
practical on ongoing basis ... we need a terrorist threat everywhere, every day.

Make sure your children do not overhear your non-compliant
conversations.
