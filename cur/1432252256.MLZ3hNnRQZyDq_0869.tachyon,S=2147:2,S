Bob, stick with obfuscated economics and playing with boats.

Many gases are explosive in certain ratios to air.
Gasoline vapor, acetylene, in a wide range of ratios to air.
Others have narrower ranges.  But within these ranges
you don't need enclosures.  Except maybe for shrapnel.

You don't need enclosures for explosive gas mixtures any more than you
need an enclosure to get a boom from nitro.
(This is the diff between a brisant, like nitro, RDX, PETN, TNT, even
NI3, etc
and something that merely burns fast like black powder or
smokeless, which indeed must be enclosed to explode.)

PS: if a diesel vehicle is tailgating, acetylene will nicely stop
its engine in a rather expensive way.   Can you say predetonation?
A pound of calcium carbide and some water makes a nice vehicle stopper
BTW,
the .mil has looked into it.

The non-exploding fireball from a refinery or storage facility will be
sufficient to destroy
the facility, and make nice video, which is sufficient.  If Allah
smiles, maybe you
get a big bang too.  The trick is to do more than one place in the same
day, so it
can't be written off as an industrial accident.
