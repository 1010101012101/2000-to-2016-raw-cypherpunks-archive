Hello.

Would you like to see your bank account stuffed with $5 bills every day?
Well there is a way and we will show you exactly how to do it! 

I think you already know that Classified ads, Opt-in Lists, FFAs, 
Search Engines, Link Exchanges, Start-page programs, Lead-clubs, 
and Surf4hits programs don't work at all! 

So, isn't it time you found out the hush-hush secrets of the one thing 
- bulk mail - that does? 

Get your FREE copy of "The Untold Secrets to Wealth on the Web" today! 
Just send an email to:

 toolbox@batuta.net 

with "Secrets" in the subject line. 

Best regards,
David Barnard.
