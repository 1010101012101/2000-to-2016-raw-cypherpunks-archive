His inbox, his rules.

Tor Project's mailing list, Tor Project's rules.

That said, I am inclined to be nice and warn first. However, I feel no
obligation to do so, particularly if a disruptive participant knows
he/she is being disruptive and/or posting off-topic on purpose.

The US, its states and cities, and for that matter most of the civilized
world, is run by laws. Yes, sometimes the people that make those laws
get it wrong, but I believe at least with the laws regarding harassment
and unauthorized computer system access, they got it right.

That said, one should not need to read a law book or a holy book to know
how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a
mailing list one has just been booted from, is not how decent people
behave.
