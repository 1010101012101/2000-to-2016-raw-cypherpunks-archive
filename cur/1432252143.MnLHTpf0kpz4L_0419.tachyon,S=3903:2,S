Interesting counterpoint.  Those busts were predicated on the violation 
of existing laws, where of course the feds get to break those laws with 
a good story and a judge's rubber sta.. er, I mean permission.  So the 
question becomes "how does the fed keep their ability to intercept 
legally unprotected commo and at the same time, keep Joe Beets from 
doing the same thing".

The Tempest argument is a stretch, only because you're not actually 
recovering the information from the phosphor itself.  But the Pandora 
argument is well taken.

Not that they won't try, though.  Or that they wouldn't opt toward 
unprotecting everything if the opportunity presented itself.
