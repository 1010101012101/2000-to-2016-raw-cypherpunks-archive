Replace "Government" with "Society" and you're getting somewhere. Where

The business though benefits extremly from the infrastructure that is 
build with taxes. Plus a lot of companies can exempt even more money, 
so in essence a lot of companies don't pay a dime in taxes.

Yes, the poorer are working and contributing to the Riches. Always

And how much money does she get back by services? Say:

Well, why don't you just take him out and shoot him then?

And how many Bobs are out there?

Also, you forgot Fred. Fred is the guy who works for Alice, supposly 
only 40 hours a week, but they are short staffed as Alice needs to make 
sure that her investors get a "good bang for the buck" so Fred has been 
in reality working more to 70 hours a week and hasn't really seen his 
kids anymore. He is only paid for 40 hours though as Alice explained to 
Fred that she just doesn't have the money to pay for overtime.

Then Fred gets sick, but Alice didn't provide any benefits (after all 
she needs to make a profit for the shareholders), thus Fred has to get 
by what he has saved up while hoping that the government would give him 
some money.

blah blah blah. The world is so unfair to you. You just can't get a 
good slave anymore these days for nothing.

Fred is doing the real work, and gets a kick in the butt by Alice the 
moment he is not "worth" enough anymore.

You, of course, still carry the idea that everybody has the right to be 
rich. That the World doesn't have infinite resources nor that the money 
is an infinite resources is ignored by the likes of you. After all you 
have made it on the backs of all the Freds out there.
