>"Why Freedom Matters More Than Ever" -- An Independent Policy Forum, 
>December 4, 2001
>http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/011204ipf.html
>
>Is a republic justified during national emergencies in expanding 
>government powers that result in permanent losses of civil and economic 
>liberties? Is the U.S. government currently passing laws that we will live 
>to regret? What are the best strategies for pursuing both security and freedom?
>
>To overcome the new threat of terrorism and a recession, must freedom be 
>restricted? Americans hold that freedom makes economic progress and the 
>good society possible -- yet many support curtailing freedom during 
>national emergencies. Economist DAVID HENDERSON, however, holds that 
>freedom is as important during wartime and recession as it is during 
>peacetime and prosperity.
>
>Based on his insightful new book, THE JOY OF FREEDOM: An Economist's 
>Odyssey, Professor Henderson will examine the imperative of individual 
>liberty to the workings and institutions of a free and just society and to 
>such issues as safety, employment, economic welfare, education, health 
>care, the environment, community, culture, and much more. In so doing, he 
>will examine how freedom is crucial for ensuring lasting peace, security 
>and harmony.
>
>SPEAKER*:
>
>-- DAVID R. HENDERSON (Professor of Economics, Naval Postgraduate School; 
>Research Fellow, Hoover Institution) is author of THE JOY OF FREEDOM: An 
>Economist's Odyssey

>Praise for David R. Henderson's THE JOY OF FREEDOM: An Economist's Odyssey:
>
>"THE JOY OF FREEDOM is passionate and eloquent, yet at the same time, 
>thoughtful, informed, and profound. A splendid statement of the moral case 
>for a free society, at the same time it is an informed and comprehensive 
>survey of its practical virtues and of the harm done by widespread 
>government intervention."
>   -- MILTON FRIEDMAN, Nobel Laureate in Economic Science
>
>" THE JOY OF FREEDOM is an engaging tale of Henderson's odyssey to the 
>wonders of freedom."
>   -- JOHN STOSSEL, correspondent, ABC News
>
>"THE JOY OF FREEDOM is a dazzling intellectual memoir, a high-level lesson 
>in market economics, a terrific read."
>   -- DANIEL SELIGMAN, columnist, FORBES Magazine
>
>" THE JOY OF FREEDOM is a superb lesson from one of the masterly economics 
>teachers."
>   -- AMITY SHLAES, columnist, FINANCIAL TIMES
