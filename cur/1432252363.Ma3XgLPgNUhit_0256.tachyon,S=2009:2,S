How about there's no way in hell they'd bother.  Al Qaida is already
more sophisticated than anything Saddam has figured out.

Very much an optimist, it's not gonna happen.  Even Robert Fisk describes
the left over fighters as "hopeless and pathetic".  At the same time he
admires their courage, sort of as a level of insanity.

The US is going to steal the oil, and the peasants living there will get
nothing.  And because they have nothing, they can't fight back.  Slavery
works.  And it's coming to the US soon I bet (as soon as Hatch finishes
Patriot 2 in permentent form).  Who's going to fire the first shot of
revolution in the US?  Oh I forgot, OK City was the first shot.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
