I don't think anyone will be demanding government ID.  Short of a ski
mask though attendees might get to see what you look like.

John did have some things in the organisation stuff about pseudonymous
participation.  If it's still in there you might find it here:

http://nymip.sourceforge.net/

Yes it's still there:

| Pseudonymity
| 
| Members, whether core members or at-large members, may participate
| under pseudonyms. Pseudonymous members need not disclose their "real"
| names or other identifying information to RG officers or to any other
| party.  Pseudonymous members must, however, disclose their
| organizational affiliations and potential commercial interests, in
| sufficient detail to permit other members to reasonably assess the
| potential for collusion or conflicts of interest.  The level of detail
| required in such disclosures shall be determined by the Chair, and
| need not necessarily include the names of specific organizations in
| all cases. No single person may hold multiple core memberships under
| different identities.

Although I'm not sure the restrictions are possible except for people
who physically attend meetings, but I'd guess the intention is clear
enough: allow pseudonymity, encourage pseudonymous people to disclose
conflicts of interest.

Well you could always use freedom on the web archive :-)
