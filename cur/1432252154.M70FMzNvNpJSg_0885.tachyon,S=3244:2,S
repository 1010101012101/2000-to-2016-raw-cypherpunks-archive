Subject: FBI is at it again

Per the following article: 
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,37203,00.html it appears as if the 
FBI
now wants to route ALL Internet traffic through it's central servers!!!!

What gall!! What nerve!!!!

Now, for all of you who said, "Hey, I'm not doing anything wrong, let the 
FBI monitor what it wants to." can go shove hot spikes up your nose.

I don't think the FBI really wants to control the Internet, they want to 
destabilize it.  As tyranny approaches the only thing more dangerous than
an armed populace is an informed one.  If they can monitor all the
traffic, they can certainly control it.

The ISP's (whatever those are) need to collectively tell the FBI to go 
jump off a bridge.  Information campaigns need to be sent to the 
customers
to alert them of the potential loss of civil liberties.

I'm gonna stop before I say something that will get me arrested.

Regards,

Larry Diffey
