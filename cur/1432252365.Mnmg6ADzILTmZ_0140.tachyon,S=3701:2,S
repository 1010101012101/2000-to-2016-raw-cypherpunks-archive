Inchoate simpered:

> These people aren't afraid to die.

Nonsense.  Just because they are willing to die for their cause in no way
speaks to their inner state.  Also, while they seem willing to die for
something that advances their cause (e.g., a SUCCESSFUL mission), this does
not mean that they are willing to throw their lives away attempting a
mission with an extremely low probability of success.  Cost/benefit
analysis, look into it.

IF they knew...
IF they could count on there being "trigger happy cowboys" on board (what
nonsense)...
IF they could rely on the "trigger happy cowboys" panicking AND being good
shots (what utter nonsense)...
