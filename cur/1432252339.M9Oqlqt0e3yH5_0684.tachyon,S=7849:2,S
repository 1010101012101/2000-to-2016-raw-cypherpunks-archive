Alfie,

The NSA director mentioned other personnel security measures that he
wasn't prepared to elaborate on, and I suspect that one of these is
indeed the electronic monitoring of personnel.

Last year, I heard from a U.S. Navy SIGINTer that when he reported for
a recent polygraph, he was presented with a printout of logs detailing
his web browsing the night before, on his personal computer using his
personal ISP. The polygraph operator confronted him about having
visited AntiPolygraph.org and then set about trying to discredit the
information we provide.

This person said they'd provide further details later in the day, but
never wrote back and did not respond to repeated follow-up inquiries:
