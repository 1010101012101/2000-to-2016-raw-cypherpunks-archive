 >> cash is not a solution, since it is observable. Anything observable 
is >> not a solution. > >Therefore murder, if not witnessed, never 
happened. If a body falls in the >forest...? You have a problem with simple 
sentences. Also, when you want to switch the arguments you must do it in 
more intelligent and coherent way. Payments should happen. The solution is 
to make them invisible. But let me do it in simpler terms: I owe Mr. Melon 
100 credits, which is well-established and provable (to me and him) in our 
private currency. Mr. Melon owns Mr. Nomen 50 credits. It is very easy to 
transfer my debt and then I can perform some task for Mr. Nomen worth 50 
credits. This happens often in real life. It's called barter and it is 
taxable, if it can be proved. Never converting anything to paper/book 
dollars makes it extremely hard to prove. People do favours to each other 
essentially on the same bases, sans bookkeeping or crypto. Once I did some 
programming for the guy and instead of paying me he gave his $2000 WW1 
rifle to the mutual friend who wanted it and he took it towards commission 
on a real-estate transaction he did for me. This is a rare. Software could 
make it more convenient. Just peg a credit to a dollar for the start. >The 
fact that party X commits a crime without being witnessed does 
not >eliminate the crime. It merely makes prosecution a bit harder. That is 
the whole point of crypto. Once I declare your breathing to be a crime (and 
I have a bigger gun than you do) you better conceal it. >to. Remember that 
multiple-issuer currencies have been tried before in just I am talking 
about single-issuer currency. >> whose reputation you can't instrument. But 
someone can start a business >> for reputation building. Again, hardly 
new. > >Not new? Name 5 prominent reputation brokers. Reputation 
services? >Reputation clearing agents? What manner of reputation do they 
measure? High-interest credit cards or store credit-cards (same as 
high-interest since they limit you to a single source) that young people or 
people with no credit can get, for instance ? Mortgage insurance for those 
with low down-payment ? Maybe Mr. Anonymous who frequents South Africa will 
mediate transactions between canadians and south africans, since he knows 
both sides, for a fee ? High-priced shysters introducing their clients to 
each other ? >> some fine Afghan pot is a small price to pay for getting

"Illusory Delusions." "Ilusional" isn't a word. It's You are just plain 
stupid, aren't you ? It takes some intelligence to do ad hominems, you 
know. I sometimes make this mistake, taking plain idiocy for misinformed 
insight worth arguing. Go to a bookstore, there is a shelve labeled 
"Reference", take a book called "Dictionary" and look up Illusion (two
