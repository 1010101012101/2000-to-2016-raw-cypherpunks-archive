"98.73% of all facts reported on the Net are simply made up."

Many people have survived gunshots to the eyes. They may be blind in 
the eye hit, but they survived. That Petro would repeat some bizarre 
claim he's heard that only person has ever survived a gunshot wound 
to the eye--"and she's been on life support since she was hit by a 
.22"--reminds me of why I tend to ignore most of what Petro posts.

Maybe it's just summer vacation. I have suddenly seen a burst of 
posts from Reese and Petro. At least they're not Choate.
