(Top posted, so sue me, my text explains itself without the history).

Thats a big cc list.  I think you could create a beacon with bitcoin hash
chain by having miners reveal a preimage for 6 old, consecutive blocks where
the newest of the 6 old blocks is itself 6-blocks confirmed.  (ie reveal
preimage on blocks 7-12.  The xor of those preimages defines a rolling
beacon (new output every block, just with reference to blocks 7-12 relative
to the current block depth).

The security against insider foreknowledge is not fantastic, as its relating
to the trustworthiness of the 6 random miners (which have probabilty of
winning relating to hashpower, which doesnt always relate to
trustworthiness).
