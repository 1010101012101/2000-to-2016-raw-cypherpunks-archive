Transactions are in a global ledger. You might not be able
to link warm bodies to a specific account directly, but 
indirectly (especially, if they engage in transactions,
or want to convert their currency). This is more difficult 
with banknotes, even if you have the serial numbers on record. 
Banknotes do not globally broadcast their current location.

This is the tradeoff of having a practical system. I personally
think that anonymous cash is orthogonal to the digital cash issue.
It can be done in a different system, or use an anonymization layer
like Tor, I2P or cjdns operates on top of TCP/IP.
