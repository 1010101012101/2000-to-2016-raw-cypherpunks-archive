Portnoys Complaint
Its been known that the Israeli criminal snipers use dum dums and aimed to 
disable permanently so if they decided to harvest some organs it would be 
no huge extension.It might be preferable to be killed outright rather than 
live as para/quadraplegic in a police state thats looking more like the old 
Apartheid horrorshow everyday.Targeted action against 'wide target' sharon 
is clearly urgently needed.(my 0.02c) I wonder when the base will discover 
APster? The least hierachic should inherit the earth.Do we have any arabic 
translators in the house?
This story reminds me of China recently where the organ donor,a convicted 
criminal shot in the back of the head,was still moving as the incision to 
remove his kidney was made.That monty python skit in the meaning of life 
looks more like a documentary these days.Did you sign this organ donor 
release form?We're here for your liver.
