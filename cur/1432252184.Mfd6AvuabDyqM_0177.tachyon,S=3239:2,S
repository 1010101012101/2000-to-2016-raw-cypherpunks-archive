I don't have a strong view on antibiotics, but to expand on my 
quarantine point, I think the Founders would consider it ludicrous that 
"civil rights" arguments might be used to allow someone with typhoid or 
smallpox or (perhaps) SARS to walk around in public spreading the 
diseases.

This is why I support very limited government, so that true threats and 
true criminals can be stopped.

Let anyone drink themselves to death, smoke themselves to death (or 
even let their own property be used for smoking), shoot up drugs, have 
damaging anal sex the way the fags do, and so on.

But communicable diseases is/are one of the very few areas where 
"provide for the common defense" is eminently  applicable.

Again, provided there is no punishment aspect, no vengeance by the 
authorities aspect.

I support this, even though I am presumably far from being in danger of 
being infected, for the "Rawlesian" reason that I would want these 
kinds of measures without knowing in advance my risk of getting the 
diseases.
