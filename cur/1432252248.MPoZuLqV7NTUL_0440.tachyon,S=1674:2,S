More chance of a leak there; Mossad is highly recommended.

But a terminal interrogation might bury some secrets.  Whereas
a mindfuck approach --fake newspapers, fabricated environments,
informers, nonlethal psychotropics-- can keep your resource going,
and make him leak.

Why do you think the captured al Q dudes are not allowed to speak

"Torture done correctly is a terminal process" is so old-school...
