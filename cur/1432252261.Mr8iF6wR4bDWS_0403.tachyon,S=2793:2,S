Anything to support that?

They /do/ claim that there are no back doors within the code.  And the quote
I was thinking of is:

    "Skype 'cooperates fully with all lawful requests from relevant
    authorities.'"

    <http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/13889705.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp>

What we infer from that is meaningless: so long as they continue to make
vague comments about their call security and what they'll comply with, and
so long as their crypto remains closed, I'm not exactly filled with warm
fuzzies over their product.

However, no matter what your approach (the trusting or the paranoid), it's
all speculation.  So long as their crypto /does/ remain closed -- and
they've given nobody any reason to believe it will be anything but -- we'll
have a hard time telling just how good it actually is.

Like I said, I'm waiting for Zfone and ZRTP.
