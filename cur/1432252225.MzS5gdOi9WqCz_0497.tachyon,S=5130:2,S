Hey, thanks for the credit!  You raise an interesting
claim.  I think it is fair to say that a lot of people
have looked at governance of digital cash but almost
all of their efforts have proceeded from a technical
crypto pov, and have thus not got very far.  If you wade
thru the early FC proceedings you'll see a steady stream of
papers trying to make blinded tokens slightly less blind
with various mixed objectives that could be interpreted
as governance (often presented as control for various
other purposes).

My approach has not been technical but has been what we
could call 'institutional' - looking at how the people and
organisations could protect it, which has the advantage
of being familiar to those who would be charged with the
job anyway.  From memory the others who've looked at
the subject from an institutional perspective would be
people like Mark Miller, Nick Szabo and the late Gary
Howland, but they were more focused on overall ramifications
than specific governance issues.

If this is the case, it would be an exciting development!
I guess we have to wait for the paper to see ... it isn't
obvious to me how the above would work.

I have 1.5 papers for an FC++ issue, this would
probably tip the balance.
