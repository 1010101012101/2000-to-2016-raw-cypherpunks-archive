I'm misattributed below, at least as far as the quoted content goes,
anyway.:-). A victim of misplaced forward references, and certainly not
deliberate, I'm sure.

There are a host of issues that prevented the widespread use of
eCash(tm), or perhaps better phrased didn't properly incent the
widespread use of eCash in the mid-1990's.  Certainly a number of the
decisions I made contributed, but I don't believe that the merchant
criteria was even a blip despite the firestorm the action created
within a narrow community - see
http://www.shipwright.com/rants/rant_12.html for a contemporaneous
and at the time much appreciated commentary from you-know-who.

Ultimately any "value transfer system" must be broadly accepted
across personal, business and institutional entities (yes I think the
latter two are different) - today all of these can interchangeably
use cash, checks, ach or wires for example.  The combination of
credit quality, trust, and lowest transaction costs must all be
present for something to replace our current mediums.

When value is involved wealth-owners tend to focus first on the trust
and credit issues - if your wealth disappears then it just doesn't
matter what the transaction costs are.  Some recent discussions on or
near this list of perceived issues with PayPal and e-gold point out
that the trust factor includes all participants agreeing on the rules
of engagement.

To achieve the primary trust and credit goals of wealth owners and
within the constructs that are available to us today this seems to
mean that regulated financial institutions may need to be involved,
but the form and content are yet to be determined.
