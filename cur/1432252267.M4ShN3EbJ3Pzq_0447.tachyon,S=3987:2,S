District attorneyship of Zurich, Switzerland, decided for suspension of 
legal charges by Aktion Kinder des Holocaust against Independent Media 
Center for publishing "We are all Palestinians" cartoon series, where a 
Warsaw Ghetto-era boy is depicted saying "I am Palestinian". According 
AKdH's spokesman, Samuel Althoff, cartoon is "anti-Semitic" and "stands for 
the extermination of the Jewish people and the State of Israel."
Author, Brazilian cartoonist Latuff, published on IMC Switerland and around 
the Web a cartoon series in order to promote International Campaign for 
Justice for the Victims of Sabra & Shatila, comparing the suffering of 
Palestinians to various oppressed people in history.
