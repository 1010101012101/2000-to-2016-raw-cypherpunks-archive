   Isn't your local assessor's database online? Here in WI, at least for most of
it, I can just look up someones name and find *all* the property they own. Or
conversely, look up an address and find out who owns it, also what they paid for
it, tax assessment, etc. Some properties, of course, are owned by corporations
or LLC or partnerships so you have to also go to the state databases to find out
who the people are behind the LLC or whatever.
