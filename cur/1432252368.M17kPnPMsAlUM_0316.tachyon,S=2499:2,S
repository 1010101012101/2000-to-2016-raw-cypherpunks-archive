Just out of curiosity, if the man doesn't need a warrent to place a 
surveilance device, shouldn't it be within your rights to tamper with, 
disable or remove such a device if you discover one?  By extension, is 
there a business opportunity for bug-sweeping?  Either a storefront or a 
properly equipped pickup truck with bright signage.  (oh, yeah... I'm 
sure *that* would go over well with the Powers That Be)
