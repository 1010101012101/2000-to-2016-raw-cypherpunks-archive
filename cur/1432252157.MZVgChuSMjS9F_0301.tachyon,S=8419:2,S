This list is seriously full of FUD lately..  but then again, when has it
not been?

On the other hand. people should be aware of the limitations and problems
inherent to any tool they use.  For example, you can't put your hand under
the place where you are slamming the hammer down.  As Odinn, I have been
compelled to remind Odinson of this from time to time.

Here are some tidbits which may be relevant to the Tor-as-tool discussion
and what to be aware of:

(Note: This clear warning about some issues with certain aspects of use of
Tor is from the Tor Project itself. They are right to provide cautionary
information so that users of the project do not inadvertently harm
themselves with the tools provided.)
https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#WarningsAboutSOCKSandDNSInformationLeaks

(The following is a guide which may be helpful on issues both related to
Tor as well as to other tools, which suggests use of SOCKS4A)
https://lilithlela.cyberguerrilla.org/?p=5794

Have fun out there.  And be careful with the hammer.
