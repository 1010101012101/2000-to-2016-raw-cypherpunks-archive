"The guns" tend to backfire:  Common or garden variety capital
murders by police officers in the U.S. has re-ignited the Civil
Rights movement, for example.  Putting that big black genii back
in the bottle is a job for covert political warfare via
propaganda, deception and PsyOps.

The outcome of every revolution I have studied was determined
before the first shot was fired.  The real damage enabled by mass
surveillance in State and Corporate hands includes:

Fine tuning and targeting of propaganda in near realtime to
achieve maximum influence.

Early detection and proactive response to disrupt and co-opt
"trending" populist and radical factions.

Automated social network mapping and behavior analysis in support
of political warfare.

Not so much Joe Six Pack as Jane Citizen Journalist.  Up to a
point of diminishing returns, every time "the guns" are used
against her, a dozen more of her appear.  As the point of
diminishing returns for that function approaches, civil uprisings
in response to State violence become likely.

The most important single item of State propaganda against
populist and radical politics:  Power over others depends on guns.

Any challenge to State power that depends primarily on armed
conflict has a single, certain outcome:  Victory for the State.
Again, the outcome of a revolution is determined before the first
shot is fired.  Building a large base of popular support and a
network of ideologically committed cadres is the key to success,
and the principal objective of State political warfare is to
prevent this from happening.

Naive wannabe anarchists who want to "go directly to guns, do not
pass the hat, do not collect 200 supporters" only provide the
State with a handy means of discrediting its more /effective/
opponents.

Evidence means nothing without context; information that is not
actionable is not intelligence.  Step one, know your adversary.
Who and what IS the State, and why is it so toxic?  Some clues
