Having in mind there have been ice period, certainly long ago it have
been much colder.

Is there easy to plot statistics say about for a century?

To my knowledge global warming is scientifically accepted fact.

It is debated to what extent humans caused it. AFAICT there is
regulation against GW.

IMHO it is the extrema that matter, not the average. This February here
a day was absolute temperature record of over 25 degrees celcius and in
the same month there were quite cold days.
