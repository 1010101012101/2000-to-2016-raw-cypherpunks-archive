""They Owe Us": Slavery Reparations Sought
by Indypendent Staff 11:51pm Mon Aug 5 '02 (Modified on 11:41am Tue Aug 6 '02)
 From the August Issue of the Indypendent
If a capitol is meant to reflect the rest of the nation, Washington D.C. 
reflects more then just pools. The construction of the White House and the 
Capitol building contained not only Roman designs and impressive rotundas; 
it was partly built by slave labor. Out of the 650 workers who built the 
U.S. Capitol, 450 were slaves. These slaves, of course, received nothing 
for their labor. Their descendents and others are coming to Washington on 
Aug. 17 to change that."
