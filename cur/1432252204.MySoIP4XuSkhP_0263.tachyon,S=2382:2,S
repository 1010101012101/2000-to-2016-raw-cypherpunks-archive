Spanish TV station on.  They're still playing the Taliban (tsk tsk) and
translating into Spanish.  I don't speak spanish so I am not incited
by the subliminal messages to go jihad a bunch of people.

But then they show what I take to be americans visiting mexico to 
buy "ciproxolina".  Haven't seen that on gringo tube.
