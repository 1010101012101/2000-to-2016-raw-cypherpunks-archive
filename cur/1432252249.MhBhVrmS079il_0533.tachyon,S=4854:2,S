It's all in the timing.
If the censors are the last to judge,
they self proclaim the right to punish
or take corrective action.

So justice is held in a pyramid scheme
where those not fortunate or not able to be
on top are by definition the only liable to
be judged by terrestrial powers.

The odd thing about this is judgments
are punitive in nature, so those at the bottom
slip further down; distancing the judging party
from the judged. Kind of a reinforcing cycle.

Can you think of mechanisms to trigger this cycle Jim?
