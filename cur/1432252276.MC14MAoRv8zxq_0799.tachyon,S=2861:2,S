clearly you haven't seen the n3td3v threads in full-disclosure.  keep
those lip^H^H^Hkeyboards flapping over flippant falafel, a resource
consumption attack.  pwned! lolz...

on a more serious note i am sure there is tor tampering where
possible.  the reason i had to kill the original peertech node (was
this this first non-roger public node or is my dementia/schizophrenia
progressing?) is related to this subject, though i'll let dead dogs
decompose where they lay(lie?) and avoid another tangent into
"apparent paranoia".

physical security is a necessary element of trust, along with all the
other realms of cypherpunk voodoo (infosec, emsec, trannysecx, etc).
i know good security when i see it (hah); the truth shall set you free
[or make you crazy]. opportunistic may be popular but active eve waits
for the unprepared.
