Gold has many industrial uses, but its value has historically
commanded a higher price not primarily because of its demand for
fillings or filters but for its demand as a currency, for which it
is naturally suited, being easily identifyable, measurable, divisible,
liquidifyable, transportable and of predictable supply.

If you trade gold for goats someone else is trading goats for gold.
They're almost certainly not buying fillings, but something that's
useful to them as a medium of exchange.
