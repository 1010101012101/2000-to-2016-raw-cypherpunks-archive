  NSA Data Mining Is Legal, Necessary, Sec. Chertoff Says
  By Mort Kondracke

  "I think it's important to point out," Homeland Security Secretary Michael
  Chertoff told me in an interview, "that there's no evidence that this is a
  program designed to achieve political ends or do something nefarious."

  He was talking about the National Security Agency's warrantless "domestic
  spying" program, and I couldn't agree with him more. Despite the alarms
  sounded by the American Civil Liberties Union, former Vice President Al
  Gore and various Members of Congress, "there hasn't even been a hint" that
  the program is targeted at domestic dissidents or innocent bystanders,
  Chertoff said. It's designed to find and stop terrorists.

  "If you go back to the post-Sept. 11 analyses and the 9/11 commission, the
  whole message was that we were inadequately sensitive to the need to
  identify the dots and connect them," he said.

  "Now, what we're trying to do is gather as many dots as we can, figure out
  which are the ones that have to be connected and we're getting them
  connected," he said.

  While refusing to discuss how the highly classified program works, Chertoff
  made it pretty clear that it involves "data mining" -collecting vast
  amounts of international communications data, running it through computers
  to spot key words and honing in on potential terrorists.

  A former prosecutor, federal judge and head of the Justice Department's
  criminal division, he convincingly defended the program's legal basis and
  intelligence value.

  I asked him why the Bush administration can't comply with the 1978 Foreign
  Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to conduct
  "emergency" wiretaps for 72 hours.

  "It's hard to talk about classified stuff," he said, "but suffice it to say
  that if you have a large volume of data, a large number of [phone] numbers
  you're intercepting, the typical model for any kind of warrant requires you
  to establish probable cause [that one party is a foreign agent] on an
  individual number."

  FISA warrant applications are inches thick, he said, and "if you're trying
  to sift through an enormous amount of data very quickly, I think it would
  be impractical." He said that getting an ordinary FISA warrant is "a
  voluminous, time-consuming process" and "if you're culling through
  literally thousands of phone numbers ... you could wind up with a huge
  problem managing the amount of paper you'd have to generate."

  What I understood Chertoff to be saying is that when data mining produces
  evidence of a terrorist contact, the government will then seek a FISA
  warrant to actually tap the person's phones or "undertake other kinds of
  activity in order to disrupt something."

  As legal authority for the program, Chertoff cited a 2002 decision of the
  FISA Court of Review, which is one level down from the U.S. Supreme Court,
  holding that a president has "inherent [constitutional] authority to
  conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information."

  "We take it for granted that the president does have that authority," the
  court said, "and, assuming it is so, FISA could not encroach on the
  president's constitutional powers."

  Chertoff also said that the courts have given wide latitude to the
  government in controlling and monitoring activity across international
  borders. All reports on the NSA activity assert that it's limited to
  international communications.

  What about the assertion in The New York Times on Tuesday that virtually
  all of the thousands of NSA leads sent to the FBI in the months after the
  Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks led to dead ends or innocent persons?

  Chertoff said, "You're going to bat well below .100 any time you do
  intelligence gathering. That's true even in conventional law enforcement.
  If you get even a small percentage of things to pan out, you've succeeded
  to a significant degree.

  "What I can tell you is this," Chertoff said. "The technique of electronic
  surveillance, which is gathering information about who calls whom or
  intercepting actual conversation, is the most significant tool in the war
  against terrorism.

  "If we didn't have it, I'm quite sure we'd have disrupted fewer attacks and
  identified fewer [terrorists]."

  Buried at the bottom of the Times story were a number of cases where actual
  terrorist operations had been disrupted, apparently as a result of NSA
  eavesdropping, including efforts to smuggle a missile launcher into the
  United States, to cut Brooklyn Bridge cables with a blowtorch and an
  attempt to blow up a fertilizer bomb in London.

  "I would rather move quickly and remove somebody when we've got a legal
  basis to do so, charge them with a lesser offense [than terrorism] or
  deport them, than wait till I have a big case with a big press conference.
  If we wait until people get operational, it's a failure. Somebody could get
  killed."

  The idea that someone could bring down the Brooklyn Bridge with a blowtorch
  has been ridiculed, but Chertoff said, "People kid about the shoe bomber,
  but had the bomb gone off and 150 people were killed, I don't think a lot
  of families would be laughing about it."

  Civil libertarians seem to fear that the government is collecting huge
  quantities of data that it can later use politically, but Chertoff said, "I
  don't think anybody has an interest in accumulating a lot of information.
  We can barely manage the stuff we care about for avoiding terrorism.

  "I can actually make the case that the more intelligence we've got, the
  more we actually protect civil liberties. In a world without intelligence,
  where we don't have a good idea where the threats are, it means searching
  people, screening names, barriers and checkpoints, questioning people when
  they get on an airplane."

  To me, the bottom line of the NSA spying case is this: Congress should
  investigate whether President Bush has authority to conduct anti-terrorist
  data mining. And, if he doesn't, Congress should give it to him - with
  legislative oversight.

  As Chertoff told me, "the name of the game here is trying to figure out,
  with all the billions of pieces of data that float around the world, what
  data do you need to focus on? What is the stuff you need to worry about?

  "If you don't use all the tools of gathering these kinds of leads, then
  you're leaving very valuable tools on the table." And, if and when another
  9/11 occurs, the first question that will be asked is: Why?

  Mort Kondracke is the Executive Editor of Roll Call.
