 About AOL® PassCode

After purchasing and receiving your AOL® PassCode, go to AOL Keyword:
PassCode and this screen appears, allowing you to secure your screen name
to your AOL PassCode. On this screen you can also release your screen name
from AOL PassCode, change service plans and order additional AOL PassCodes.

Account Status

This area lists your current AOL PassCode service plan, including the
secured and unsecured screen names within the plan. If the maximum number
of screen names in your service plan are secured to your AOL PassCode, the
Manage Service Plan button will appear.

View PassCode Account Activity

Displays a screen listing a summary of your AOL PassCode account activity,
such as the date you purchased your subscription, ordered AOL PassCode
devices and details such as the price plan ordered and the quantity of AOL
PassCodes ordered.

Secure Screen Name

To help protect your screen name with AOL PassCode, you need to secure your
screen name to your specific AOL PassCode device. Each AOL PassCode has a
unique serial number engraved on its back. By associating your screen name
with a specific AOL PassCode serial number, the AOL service will know which
six-digit number needs to be entered at each sign-on, helping to protect
your screen name from unauthorized access.

To secure a screen name to your AOL PassCode
	1.  	Sign on to the AOL® service with the screen name you want to
secure to your AOL PassCode.
	2.  	Go to AOL Keyword: PassCode.
	3.  	Click Secure Screen Name.
	4.  	Type the eight-digit serial number engraved on the back of your
AOL PassCode.
	5.  	Type the six-digit number displayed on the front of your AOL
PassCode.
	6.  	Click Save. A confirmation screen appears. This change takes
effect immediately and will be enforced the next time you sign on to the
AOL service. Whenever you sign on to the AOL service using the screen name
that you secured to AOL PassCode, you will be required to enter the
six-digit number on the front of your AOL PassCode.

Release Screen Name

When the screen name you signed on to the AOL service with has already been
secured to your AOL PassCode, the Secure Screen Name button changes to
Release Screen Name.

If you no longer want to use AOL PassCode, you must release your screen
name from your AOL PassCode so that you will no longer need to enter a
six-digit code when you sign on to any AOL service.

To release your screen name from your AOL PassCode
	1.  	Sign on to the AOL service with the screen name you want to
release from your AOL PassCode.
	2.  	Go to AOL Keyword: PassCode.
	3.  	Click Release Screen Name. The Secure Screen Name button changes
to Release Screen Name when that particular screen name is secured to AOL
PassCode.
	4.  	Enter the answer to your account security question. For more
information, see What is an Account Security Question.
	5.  	Type the eight-digit serial number engraved on the back of your
AOL PassCode.
	6.  	Type the six-digit number displayed on the front of your AOL
PassCode.
	7.  	Click Save. This change takes effect immediately, and removes the
AOL PassCode protection for subsequent sign-ons.

Manage Service Plan

Displays a screen with AOL PassCode service plan options, allowing you to
change your current service plan.

Order more PassCodes

Displays a screen allowing you to order additional AOL PassCodes.
