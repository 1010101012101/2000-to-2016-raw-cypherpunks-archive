I've been talking about this for the last decade, and never found a
reference on the web whenever I was thinking about it. Thanks to
Google, it was well within my prodigiously diminished attention span
this morning.

Given the events on the net over the past few years, I figure we
might as well have fun with the idea. Humor is good leverage, and
these days we need *lots* of leverage.

In arbitrary order (in other words, *I* chose it. :-)), and with
apologies to Toru Iwatani, by way of Michael Thomasson at
<http://www.gooddealgames.com/articles/Pac-Man%20Ghosts.html>, here
it is:


A Proposed Nomenclature for the Four Horseman of The Infocalypse

   Horseman             Color      Character   Nickname

1  Terrorism            Red        Shadow      "Blinky"
2  Narcotics            Pink       Speedy      "Pinky"
3  Money Laundering     Aqua       Bashful     "Inky"
4  Paedophilia          Yellow     Pokey       "Clyde"

It is acceptable to refer to a horseman by any of the above, i.e.,
"Horseman No. 1", "The Red Horseman", "Shadow", or "Blinky".

Apparently there was a, um, pre-deceased, dark-blue ghost, used in
Japanese tournament play, named "Kinky", I leave that particular
horseman for quibblers.


Cheers,
RAH
