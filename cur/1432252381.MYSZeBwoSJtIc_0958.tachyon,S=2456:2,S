Well, there have been several attacks of this kind against Russia's WebMoney
system. One of the founders and first arbiters, Nikita Sechenko, wrote up
the following text on his advocacy webpage owebmoney.ru (my translation):
https://www.financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000492.html

It also contains somre relevant bits about governing an payment system based
on pseudonymous accounts. I think, theirs is the most sophisticated
account-based payment system in active use, complete with arbitration,
messaging, billing, key certification, credit operations and credit history,
and a lot more.
