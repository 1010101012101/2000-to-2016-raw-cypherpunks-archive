                            CALL FOR PAPERS

            WORKSHOP ON PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES 2003

                            Mar 26-28 2003
                           Dresden, Germany
                       Hotel Elbflorenz Dresden

                     http://www.petworkshop.org/

Privacy and anonymity are increasingly important in the online world.
Corporations and governments are starting to realize their power to
track users and their behavior, and restrict the ability to publish
or retrieve documents. Approaches to protecting individuals, groups,
and even companies and governments from such profiling and censorship
have included decentralization, encryption, and distributed trust.

Building on the success of the first anonymity and unobservability
workshop (held in Berkeley in July 2000) and the second workshop
(held in San Francisco in April 2002), this third workshop addresses
the design and realization of such privacy and anti-censorship services
for the Internet and other communication networks. These workshops bring
together anonymity and privacy experts from around the world to discuss
recent advances and new perspectives.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of privacy
technologies, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems.
We encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business
that present their perspectives on technological issues. As in past years,
we will publish proceedings after the workshop.

Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:

* Efficient (technically or economically) realization of privacy services
* Techniques for censorship resistance
* Anonymous communication systems (theory or practice)
* Anonymous publishing systems (theory or practice)
* Attacks on anonymity systems (eg traffic analysis)
* New concepts in anonymity systems
* Protocols that preserve anonymity/privacy
* Models for anonymity and unobservability
* Models for threats to privacy
* Novel relations of payment mechanisms and anonymity
* Privacy-preserving/protecting access control
* Privacy-enhanced data authentication/certification 
* Profiling, data mining, and data protection technologies
* Reliability, robustness, and attack resistance in privacy systems
* Providing/funding privacy infrastructures (eg volunteer vs business)
* Pseudonyms, identity, linkability, and trust
* Privacy, anonymity, and peer-to-peer
* Usability issues and user interfaces for PETs
* Policy, law, and human rights -- anonymous systems in practice
* Incentive-compatible solutions to privacy protection
* Economics of privacy systems
* Fielded systems and techniques for enhancing privacy in existing systems

                           IMPORTANT DATES

                          PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal
or a conference with proceedings.  Papers should be at most 15
pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using
11-point font and reasonable margins), and at most 20 pages total.
Committee members are not required to read the appendices and the paper
should be intelligible without them.  The paper should start with the
title, names of authors and an abstract.  The introduction should give
some background and summarize the contributions of the paper at a
level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.  During the workshop
preproceedings will be made available.  Final versions are not due until
after the workshop, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their
papers based on discussions during the meeting.

Submissions can be made in Postscript or PDF format.  To submit a paper,
send a plain ASCII text email to <arma@mit.edu> containing the title and
abstract of the paper, the authors' names, email and postal addresses,
phone and fax numbers, and identification of the contact author.  To the
same message, attach your submission (as a MIME attachment). Papers
must be received by December 2, 2002.  Notification of acceptance
or rejection will be sent to authors no later than February 7, 2003,
and authors will have the opportunity to revise for the preproceedings
version by March 7, 2003.  Submission implies that, if accepted, the
author(s) agree to publish in the proceedings and to sign a standard
copyright release, and also that an author of the paper will present it
at the workshop.
