According to articles in Nature and Science, the thing that tipped the 
scales in favor of publication was the discovery of natural flu variants 
that were halfway towards the full complement of mutations necessary for 
increased transmission. That supported the argument that such research 
could help predict what variants should be carefully monitored.
