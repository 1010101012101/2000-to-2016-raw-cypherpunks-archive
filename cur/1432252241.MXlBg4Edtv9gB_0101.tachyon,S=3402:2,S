Further thoughts on this matter...

I think that we should escalate the level of liability a potential
attacker has to face when attempting to compromise a security system.

We should have laptops equipped with high explosives, such that the laptop
detonates after a certain number of failed logins. Let's see how popular
laptop theft is then.

Booby-traps as a standard part of facility security. Let an intruder
bypass the retina scanner if he wants, but have him face a nail gun as
soon as he opens the door.

Cyanide gas enabled car alarms. (I'm flexible on whether it is actually
cyanide, or something better). Currently some cars won't start without a
specific ignition key with an embedded chip. I say, let the car start if
hot-wired... then a few minutes later, automatically roll the windows,
force the locks, and gas the fucker who stole the car. No damage to the
upholstery.

As for computer systems, we should have IDS systems that retaliate to
attacks. It seems to me to be perfectly rational to design a firewall/IDS
that determines the source of the attack, and then neutralizes it. And I
think this last suggestion would be the least likely to land people in
jail.

Though I still to see someone do a C4-enabled laptop with
corresponding Win2K GINA. :)
