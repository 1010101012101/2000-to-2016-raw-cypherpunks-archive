from R. H Frank's "Passion within reason"

to gain trust we show our commitment by doing hard work.

In web's of trust, one way to add to new reputation would be to require 
each new node to perform an asymmetrically difficult task for more than 
one pre-existing node, on top of existing anti-faking provisions.

hash-cash buys a chance to earn trust, it functions as a hard to fake 
gesture of sincerity
