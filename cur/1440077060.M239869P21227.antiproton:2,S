EBL immensely simplifies the foundry and offers the possibility for OS distributed design and manufacture, affordable for "maker" groups, without involving a commercial entity. The number of trusted parties shrinks significantly.

The solution to this chicken and egg rathole is a legislative trojan.

First, we identify a consortium (cartel?) of open-source hardware folks
who desire to make a lot of money making hardware that anyone can verify
correct operation of said hardware.

Then, we draft model legislation to fund basic R&D of 'trusted' hardware
by basic science research agencies in the US, Germany, Japan, and China.
(Now if you really want to tweak the beast, add Iran or North Korea to
the list, that would be amusing)

Now is the important part: Raising sufficient lobbying money to get the
previously developed model legislation passed in a sufficient subset of
countries. In the US this is pretty straighforward, we go to Silicon Valley
with a pitch deck and find some investors that already play the game of
financing legislation. We can start with people who've invested in Google,
Microsoft, Apple, and media companies (the ones that brought us the DMCA)

Once the legislation is passed, the previously mentioned cartel can now
leverage (probably by at least 100x) the original funds invested in 
lobbying, because they are the only ones that can succeed in getting the
grant funding for said basic research.

A completely different approach would be to find the owners of some 
smaller independent fabs who'd like to stay independent. If you want to
add the lobbying bit go to the local government and ask for economic
development funds for local industry.
