Again I am a few Moore's generations behind.  (Does that make me a
semi-Amish atheist?
Or a reformed Luddite?) Where I vacation sometimes, I would
need a metallized umbrella (or better) and tripod to find a cell
basestation.
And that rules out valleys leaving ridges, although a few hundred feet
of
RF cable isn't so expensive.

I am aware of the need for non-fixed antennae for 802.11blah fun; I did
not
realize that modern cells don't have RF connectors.  I have also heard
of folks war-flying with a simple (tilted) dipole thus pointing part of
the donut-shaped receptive region (orthogonal to the dipole) at the
ground.

huh?  Wet kevlar is still strong, no?

The fundamental problem is the head is more agile than the C.G.  However
if you
don't hit a seam, or aren't using something better than a handgun,
only a rapid bit of ballistic neurosurgery will disable the target.

Best to have enabled the claymores when your cameras notice a change.

And as Mr. Burns says, to let the hounds loose.

A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they
should
have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence

from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own
government.
