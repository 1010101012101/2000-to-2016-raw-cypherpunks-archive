Yup.  I got the fuck out of NYC as fast as I could.  Walked for about 3
hrs incl. over a bridge. :)  Made sure I got there before dark.  I
outwalked the busses!  That's how bad traffic was for cars.  

The bars were already happy places at 5pm with lots of crowds in front of
them extending out into the streets... this is probably one of the major
reasons it was so civil.  The other was that the outage did not occur
while it was already dark, and the third likely due to the previous "Get
the fuck out of NYC" when the WTC turned to dust.

At work we are still experiencing outages as our ISP is down because their
ISP is down.  Even more fun, our phone system goes through the ISP, so 
that's down too.  This is what you get when you pay the lowest price you
can.  I expect this is the same reason this outtage occured in the first
place.  Everyone cutting corners, etc.  (See my previous rant.)  My fault
for working for a small .com rather than a big company, but no one is
hiring sysadmins these days unless they're wet behind the ears and are
willing to take $40K, or they're outsourcing to the likes of EDS.

I've got lots of fun exposure to EDS outsourcing quality of service -
those guys are total morons.  Asked them to reboot one machine, and got
back 30 emails saying "not my dept."  Took about 4-5 hours to get a
machine rebooted when it should have taken less than 5 mins.  On another
occasion they couldn't figure out how to get their internal and external
DNS to point to the same host...  and they actually have an entire DNS
dept! To quote Homer, D'Oh!

Hopefully IBM's outsourcing gig is better.  To anyone thinking they can
outsource IT and/or systems admins,  I wish you the best.  You'll need
it.  In the end, you get what you pay for.  Every fucking time.  No
exceptions.  Sure, Raj is cheaper than me.  But that's the level of
service you should expect too, 'cause you'll get it!

I won't comment on the previous NYC outage/riots as I wasn't in NYC at the
time.
