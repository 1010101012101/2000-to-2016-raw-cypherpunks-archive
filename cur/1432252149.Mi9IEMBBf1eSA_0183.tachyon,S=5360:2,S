         Let us put the pieces together for YOU
The Wanna Bee Foundation is NOT a Multi-Level Company. 
It has NO matrix or payout.
 We are not putting hundreds of thousands of people into MLM programs, not even 
hundreds, only a few will get this opportunity to have a chance to become a member of 
the "Wanna Bee Foundation". Your entry is voted on by the members. You are then 
placed into 3 MLM companies (FREE). Only after you are in profit in at least 2 of them, are 
you required to pay your monthly dues to each of the companies. 
The annual fee is $29.95. Each individual company will 
send you a recruiting kit after you become a member.
GUARANTEE -- We guarantee you to be in profit before you are asked to complete the 
applications FOR THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES.
 We will mail out, at no extra cost to you, from one to three million offers a month. All
