Well, I'm dubious. Right now I'm thinking their strategy has been to pull 
encryption down off of the social radar, and that's worked better than any 
frontol assault. Also watch carefully for hole-pokers...I'd bet their's also 
been disinfo campaigns to get the public to think that no crypto is secure 
(every ask anyone if they believed there was such a thing as effectively 
'unbreakable' encryption? Reglar folks always believe SOMEBODY'S got the 
technology to break what scheme you use, so "why bother").

Let's also remember that 'terrorists' are only terrorists when their guns 
are small. Once they start winning a few battles they're no longer 
"terrorists" (eg: Mao and that whole gang).

So let's beat them to the punch: "Use strong crypto in order to keep America 
free from the terrorists."
