One more bit of debunking.  According to the EIA the US uses on average over 8 million barrels of gasoline a day.  The petroleum industry defines a barrel as 42 gallons.  That's 336 million gallons a day or 123 billion gallons a year.  If each gallon is subsidized by $10+ per barrel, the annual sudsidy from the government to the oil industry would be, at a minimum, $1.23 trillion a year.  Total GDP in 2000 was only $9.2 trillion.  This is non-sense.  Or is this subsidy desquised as the defense budget, social security payments and service on the national debt?
