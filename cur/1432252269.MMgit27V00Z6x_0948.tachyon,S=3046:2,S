<<BOCA RATON, Florida (CNN) -- Florida health officials on Sunday said a
second man has tested positive for anthrax bacteria.

The Associated Press reported that it was unclear when final tests would
tell whether or not the second man has full-blown anthrax. The bacterium
normally has an incubation period of up to seven days, but could take up
to 60 days to develop, the AP reported, citing local health officials.

State and local health officials closed a building where a 63-year-old
Florida man who died of anthrax worked, after a sample from the building
and from another employee showed the presence of the bacterium that
causes anthrax.

Authorities closed the American Media Inc. building and the company
voluntarily evacuated employees who were there working Sunday evening,
said a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Emergency Management
Office. >>
