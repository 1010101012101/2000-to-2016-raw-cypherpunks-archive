"Ridge reportedly telephoned the ILWU's Spinosa and suggested that any job 
slow-down or strike would be viewed as a threat to national security."
Bush threatens to use troops against West Coast dockworkers
http://www.infoshop.org/inews/stories.php?story=02/09/01/6989033
The LA Times further reported that soon after negotiations began on the new 
West Coast longshore contract, "the White House convened a working group to 
monitor them, with representatives from the departments of Commerce, Labor 
and Transportation and the Office of Homeland Security."
The use of national security and the "war on terrorism" as a pretext for 
stripping workers of their democratic and collective bargaining rights is 
already the policy adopted by the Bush administration in relation to the 
new Department of Homeland Security. Bush is demanding that the 170,000 
federal employees being transferred into the new department lose both their 
civil service protection and union representation.
International solidarity may be needed to nip this forth Reich in the 
bud,at least arbusto is no demagogue!
