have the NSA not been complaining that the technology is underfunded
recently and they could not keep up with other countries/groups. Maybe this
is proof of this. 

Also it seems a big conincidence to me that information that casts further
doubt on the lockerbie bombing trial (for which syrian terrorists were
originally blamed) comes to light on the same day as this attack. Maybe it
was a demonstration that we got the wrong guys?

Despite billions spent on stealth technology, expensive spy satellites
and planes, secret listening post throughout the world , Echelon and
Carnivore. It seem inconceivable  that an terrorist operation of this
magnitude could be planned, setup over the course of 1 year and executed
with  precision without the intelligence community having a clue.

Now that the country's defense and intelligence spending has been
exaggerated in the wrong direction for so long. Maybe good old fashion
human intelligence is more secure than once thought.??  This
swiss-cheese National defense system lacks imagination, is based solely
upon pasted events and will ultimately prompt future attacks.


Chance favors the prepared mind.
