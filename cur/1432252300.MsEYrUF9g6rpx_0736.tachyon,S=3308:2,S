[Note: I have an interest, since QuizID use nCipher hardware]

Their device has a neat way of synchronizing the sequence number to the 
server which both avoids the clock drift problems that trouble RSA 
SecurID and mean that you'd have to get the user to pass you a large 
number of codes before you got them out of sync with the server.  It 
also helps them avoid some of RSA's later patents which deal with their 
troublesome clock sync problems.
