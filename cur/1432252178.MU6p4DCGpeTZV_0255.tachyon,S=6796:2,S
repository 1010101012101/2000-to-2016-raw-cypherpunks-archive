Possibly, I will defer to the more technically learnt.

I'm not a nym server expert but from my laymen perspective the Pynchon Gate
design looks good. It might be totally redundant and unnecessary but if
metadata analysis is the concern, wouldn't such a setup be even more secure
by coding something so that the time between sending a message and
receiving a reply which in theory could leak information about the nym
holder, be sent at a random date in a given time-frame (unbeknownst to the
metadata leeches) . i.e. In 6-12 hours from the moment I click "send" or
say in 12-20 days etc.

The email message could be coded to send at random like an online roulette
table ball, within a given time window: verses say reloading every 24hours.
This would in theory give out incorrect message 'sent' time-stamps, or
would this be unnecessary because traf=EF=AC=81c from the user to the email
distributors is already being controlled by the user, which queries into
intervals anyway? Is that not metadata that can be tracked?
