This story didn't get passed around much yesterday (I hear there was some sport event on? ;)) but I thought some of you may find it interesting - http://news.sky.com/story/1047004/mini-drones-army-deploys-tiny-helicopters


"British troops are using a nano drone just 10cm long and weighing 16 grams on the front line in Afghanistan to provide vital information on the ground.
They are the first to use the state-of-the-art handheld tiny surveillance helicopters, which relay reliable full motion video and still images back to the devices' handlers in the battlefield.

The Black Hornet Nano Unmanned Air Vehicle is the size of a child's toy, measuring just 10cm (4 ins) by 2.5cm (1 inch), and is equipped with a tiny camera."
