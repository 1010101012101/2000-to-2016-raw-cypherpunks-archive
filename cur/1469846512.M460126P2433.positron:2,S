The Road to Armageddon
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/road-armageddon/ri15914

A few quotes:

"
The roots of America’s current belligerence lie in the private ownership
of its currency, privatised by Woodrow Wilson in 1919, the now U.S.
Federal Reserve. Like any privatised business, the Federal Reserve
relies on a customer base, but as its customers dwindled, the future
consequences forced America into protection racketeering, and
manipulation to save its usury power. Today, this intervention
translates to regime change and removing those who won’t agree. In other
words, the U.S. produces dollars and the world peripheries produce to
sell for those dollars, consequently, this means the U.S. has been
living free by printing pieces of private profit-making paper for
decades.
"

"In 1973 (
http://www.businessinsider.com/the-media-wont-touch-this-story-about-the-end-of-the-us-dollar-2012-4
) President Nixon asked King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to accept only US
dollars as payment for oil and to invest any excess profits in US
Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. In return, Nixon offered military
protection for Saudi oilfields. The same offer was extended to each of
the world's key oil producing countries, and by 1975 every member of
OPEC had agreed to only sell oil in U.S. dollars."

    In a world-wide economic recession, the world is finally beginning
    to realise the previous power of the U.S. lies not in
    exceptionalism, but in its parasitic nature. All this remains a
    conspiracy theory to many Americans, but well known to the rest of
    the world – Ron Paul explains (
