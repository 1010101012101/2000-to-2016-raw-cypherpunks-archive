perhaps the scale larger than the highest layer nodes is no longer
recognisable as being part of the fractal.
Likewise the nodes at each ppp have some organization as to how they handle
data internaly.

The shape of a shoreline is often used to illustrate fractal self
similarity, but you quickly reach a point where it is hard to call it a
shoreline anymore, it becomes grains of sand, pebbles, or boulders.

So say you -could- estimate a fractal dimension for the internet. What would
the number be good for?
