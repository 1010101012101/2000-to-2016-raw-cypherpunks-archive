It would, unless enough fear of these people can be spread among the 
general population.  If you can make the people scared enough of 
X (whether X is anarchists or anybody else), the people won't protest 
when you start killing X.  The US government, and various police 
forces, have used this principle extensively in the last decade or 
so; whenever they want license to kill X, they first demonize X in 
the press hoping to get lots of people scared of X.

The problem with this approach is that when a lot of people, or people 
whom the scared people know, have gotten killed,  people start to get 
scared of X where X is the police and their bosses....
