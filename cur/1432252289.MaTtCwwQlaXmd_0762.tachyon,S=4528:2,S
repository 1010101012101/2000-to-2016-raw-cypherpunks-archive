A relative of mine works in midtown Manhattan and lives in the
city. He has a 20 minute subway commute each morning, which is what I
had when I worked at Time and other jobs in downtown DC. Perfectly
reasonable, by city standards.

A friend emailed me this yesterday:

I spoke with a cpunk today on the phone, who told me that one of the
two tunnels (Lincoln or Hudson, don't remember which) connecting
Manhattan with the rest of the world to the west was still closed to
all but emergency vehicles. That leaves one tunnel and the GW bridge
to the west, with the Brooklyn bridge closed to the east. Couple that
with serious car searches and the resulting delays, and you've got a
very good reason to move far away.

In DC, things aren't that bad. Road closings near the Pentagon (I-395)
have snarled traffic in the area and led to Metro opening at 4:30 am
to get people to work on time. But coming in and out of the city
through other routes outside of rush hour, which I've done twice this
week, is same as usual.
