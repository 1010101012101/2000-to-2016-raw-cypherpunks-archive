Well, now we are into dueling Supreme Court cases; see

http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/533/27.html

   Kyllo v. United States (2001)

   Despite the Court's attempt to draw a line that is "not only
   firm but also bright," ante, at 12, the contours of its new rule
   are uncertain because its protection apparently dissipates as
   soon as the relevant technology is "in general public use," ante,
   at 6-7. Yet how much use is general public use is not even hinted
   at by the Court's opinion, which makes the somewhat doubtful
   assumption that the thermal imager used in this case does not
   satisfy that criterion. In any event, putting aside its lack
   of clarity, this criterion is somewhat perverse because it seems
   likely that the threat to privacy will grow, rather than recede,
   as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.

That reads, to me, that what the public adopts limits what I can
do or expect.
