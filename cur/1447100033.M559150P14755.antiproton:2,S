I feel sorry for your dad, having a child that thinks so little of his
mental capacity.
If your dad can operate Windows and an email client then he has what is
needed to learn enough to sign and encrypt emails with GnuPG.
He doesn't need to know how crypto works or every minute detail, he just
needs to be able to make sense of a Wizard and to be able to click a few
buttons.
He'll be at a disadvantage for not learning more about crypto and PGP
but he'll be able to maintain a small amount of privacy in his use of ema=
il.
When he gets stuck he might be able to ask his son or daughter for help
- assuming he hasn't given up asking because you hold his mental
capacity in such low regard.

You think if crypto is invisible to people then they'll be able to deal
with when things go wrong any better than your dad would be if you
equipped him with minimal knowledge of how to get by with PGP using e.g
Enigmail on Thunderbird?

The more you hide details from people, the less they are able to help
themselves.

I'll take that as a compliment, thank you :)
