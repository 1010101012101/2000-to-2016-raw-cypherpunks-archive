This weekend I wandered along the National Mall; here are some photos of 
the preparations for the George W. Bush inauguration on Saturday:

Note the high security in response to reports of protests planned:

A cop got out of his car to tell me not to take photos of police, when I 
was on a public sidewalk next to the Capitol building:

Washington Post article on protests, preparations:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57682-2001Jan13.html

Excerpt: "16 federal and local law enforcement agencies led by the Secret 
Service are taking unprecedented security steps. More officers than ever 
will be on duty -- at least 6,800 -- and it will be the first inaugural 
parade in American history for which those attending must pass through 
police checkpoints."
