People talk a lot about refitting and auditing existing setups.
There's a lot of inbred friction there so the cost to successfully
do that vs. a complete ground up trusted rebuild may be roughly
equivalent. Therefore if so why not just choose the latter?

Still sounds like untrusted base, chicken and egg.

And how do you propose to count the votes when your
ballots are measured in square nanometers and your
counting machines are all made by one secretive company
and composed of anywhere between 1B and 6B untrusted
logic gates?

Did you ever hear Intel say "our own designs and fabs have no backdoors
and we're not subject to backdooring"?
Did you ever hear GlobalF say "we don't inject backdoors in customer
silicon and we're not subject to backdooring"?
Would it mean anything to you if they did?
Would it make any difference if they offered you a field trip?
Do independants actually think their oneoff decap validation project
proves or gives odds on the entire line and distribution chain?
And when was any Intel / AMD CPU last publicly decapped
and fully audited? 8088? Never?

You watch while... I collect wood and ore and smelt into axe, you
trust axe. I split tree and assemble hut, you trust hut. I put
wheel in water and make mill, you trust flour. I give you magical
computer before I make abacus, you throw in river and order me
make abacus first. Eventually trusted CPU is made.

I'd have more trust in some kid to not destroy my lawn with
the mower for $10 than some company for $50.

Govt contracts seem to deliver more debt than trust and
are prime example that trust and cost are separate. If not,
then the HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS governments spend
a year would have resulted in 5 9's of trust decades ago.
But no, they can't even keep OPM secure from crackers,
let alone backdoored cpu's they import from Malay fabs.

Put well under 1/100 of that pie a year for a few years into
a trusted open fab project and I'd bet you can get "Beyond A1"
consumer gear out the other end at tolerable prices.

Don't forget to charge 10+ times more for government jobs :)
