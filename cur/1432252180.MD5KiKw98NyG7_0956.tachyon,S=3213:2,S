Subscribing, though, only takes place on the readers side. That is,
it's just as if you were visiting it anyway. So, just don't subscribe,
and view it every so often. What you need, though, is some strategy
that means if the attacker visits the same rss feed, then they don't
get the same information. Or, the information they get is not useful
to them. So, you need some sort of encoding yahoo pipe as well. But
that's probably possible.
