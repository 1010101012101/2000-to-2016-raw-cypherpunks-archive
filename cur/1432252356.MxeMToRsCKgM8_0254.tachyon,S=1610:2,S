Proposals?  You can *drive* on them now.   Some are privately-owned
lanes parallel to public lanes (91 in SoCal), some are entirely
privately-owned
novel tollways (241, 243, parts of 74, 133).  You can drive most without
a tracking/transponder
(ie use currency) though they can photograph your plates on any lane.
Financially they're not doing wonderfully, but the roads are there!
