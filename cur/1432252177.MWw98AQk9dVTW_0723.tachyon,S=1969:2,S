Although I agree in theory, if I were a black man in Alabama in the 1950s 
(for instance), I might certainly be willing to try to declare blacks as 
worthy of "special consideration" if that would keep me from getting 
lynched. I would not, in general, expect to be held liable by others for the 
reaction of Tyrants, and I'd be willing to allow other lynchables to take 
care of themselves.

Is Miller in this situation? Doubtful, but then again were you -suprised-?
