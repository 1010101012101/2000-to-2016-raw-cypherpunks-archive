More details, please. Mainly the kind of material to be hosted. Holding
2GB of kiddie porn (horseman alert!) might be objectionable on moral
grounds as well as legal grounds.

What kind of traffic is expected, in terms of connections per hours and
bytes per hour?

Why does it need to be a *NIX machine? Ease of remote access, security,
active content, or the requirements of the mirroring software?

The mirror would presumably need a fixed IP address. Are there any other
requirements?
