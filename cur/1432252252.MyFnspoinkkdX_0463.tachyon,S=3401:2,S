Yeaaaaahhhh, I know. Think of it as me clearing the pipes for more
stuff, or something. I haven't written much lately, and I'm starting
to do that again.


They just pissed me off, is all, and the thing wrote itself.

So, now I feel better for my own bit of spontaneous combustion, which
I probably shouldn't have sent here, since, of course, it wasn't
topical. ;-).


It's like two things I saw every day for several years apiece
collided in meme-space, and I didn't even know I was even pissed off
until I saw just the barest hint of those idiots being re-deified in
the Globe Sunday morning. Whole decades of their sanctimony just
became too much to abide anymore.

Like nuclear power (or nuclear weapons), genetically modified foods,
air travel, and lots of other progress, LNG is safe enough even in
the worst-case scenario, and FUD-mongers like the Bulletin of the
Atomic "Scientists" are the worst kind of Luddite charlatans.

But I bet you figured that out, right? :-).

Like I said, you would need a full-on military operation to do the
job, a battalion for the main tank, or a smart bomb and
air-superiority for one tank on a ship, which would be kind of
obvious.

And, of course, if that's what happened, you'd have more problems
than a whole bunch of flaming fart-gas lighting up the Tobin
Bridge...

Anyway, to paraphrase John Astin's character in "Night Court", I feel
*muuch* better now, though I can't promise there won't be more later.
:-).

Cheers,
RAH
