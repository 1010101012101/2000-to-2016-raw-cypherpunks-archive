My suggestion is be very(!) careful (or skip it entirely, the crypto
search not Russia). I don't know of any crypto museums in Moscow (can't 
say for St Petersburg). Those folks are pretty scarry when it comes to
security and such. You are aware that private possession/use of crypto in
Russia is illegal? Also, you can't just get up and wander around the
countryside either.

I'd ask a favor, in your wandering around if you run across any russki 
WWII tactical (board) wargames please consider bringing a copy back for
me. I'd go as high as $100 US.

Da svidanya moi droog.
