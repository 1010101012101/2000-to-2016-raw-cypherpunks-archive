That's the way things were about 25 or so years ago. =C2=A0Wafers with phot=
oresist were exposed with machines using UV, which over the years used ever=
-decreasing =C2=A0wavelengths of UV, in equipment:436. 365nm, and 248nm, ev=
entually reaching 193 nanometer UV. =C2=A0In the 1970's, entire wafer-masks=
 (which covered the entire wafer) were used. =C2=A0This became impractical =
as feature-sizes were reduced. =C2=A0Step-and-repeat devices ("wafer-steppe=
rs) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper=C2=A0 =C2=A0then allowed exposure=
 of a much smaller portion of a wafer. =C2=A0(these eventually used mirrors=
, rather than lenses, because it is hard to process UV in a solid lens.) =
=C2=A0=C2=A0
However, because the wavelength of light eventually became a large portion =
of the size of a chip feature (a line or a space) it was increasingly diffi=
cult to 'draw' the picture necessary to expose the resist on the wafer. =C2=
=A0Due to many ever-more-heroic technologies, it eventually became possible=
 to use 293 nanometer wavelength to expose features far smaller than the wa=
velength itself, which would have been considered phenomenal in the 1970's.=
 =C2=A0These days, EUV ("extreme ultraviolet") has been used for ever more =
small features. =C2=A0=C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviol=

None that I'm aware of. =C2=A0But EUV will take over from electron-beam: =
=C2=A0The latter is quite slow, and typically has been used mostly for maki=
ng masks.
