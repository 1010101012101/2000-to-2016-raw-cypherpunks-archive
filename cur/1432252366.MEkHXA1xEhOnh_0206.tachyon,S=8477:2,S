</strong><p><i>ApolloMedia Corporation Wins Right to Reveal Information Regarding Internet Privacy in the Case of United States v. ApolloMedia
 </i></center></P>
</B></I>
<p>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sept. 7, 2000 -- In the latest round of litigation that
surrounds the battle over Internet privacy, a Texas court has lifted a
year-long gag order from ApolloMedia Corporation, a San Francisco-based
multimedia company. Following an opinion to reconsider by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the District Court lifted the gag order,
an action that enables ApolloMedia, the publisher of the annoy.com Web
site, to finally discuss its role in the controversial case.
<p>
    In June 1999, the U.S. government ordered ApolloMedia to disclose the
identity of a user of annoy.com's e-greeting card service, a service that
facilitates anonymous communications. The information they were seeking
followed a similar attempt in April 1999 by the University of Houston, who
tried unsuccessfully to obtain ApolloMedia records. Paragraph 7 of the
Magistrate's June 16, 1999 Order prohibited ApolloMedia from discussing
not only the details of the government's investigation and the content of
the order with anyone until authorized by the court, but also the very
existence of the order and its application.
<p>
    "Though we may have been silenced for over a year, what continues to
be of utmost importance to us is that we are able to extend the dialog
regarding Internet privacy and the freedom to publish information
regarding the case," said ApolloMedia's president, Clinton Fein.
<p>
    The United States v. ApolloMedia case continues to challenge existing
notions of on-line privacy and to raise First Amendment issues of free
speech on the Internet. All relevant documents and background information
regarding United States v. ApolloMedia can be found on the Internet at
<a href="http://www.ejournalism.com">www.ejournalism.com</a>.
<p>
    ApolloMedia has been involved in litigation since the inception of
their controversial Web site, annoy.com, including a high profile U.S.
Supreme Court lawsuit against Attorney General Janet Reno. Although that
case challenged a provision of the Communications Decency Act that
criminalizes "indecent" Web content, Apollo's latest legal battle has
centered more specifically on the issue of individual privacy and freedom
of the press.
<p>
"The gag order violated the First Amendment ban on prior restraints and
the statutory requirement that it have a definite duration. It was not
issued upon affidavits establishing probable cause. It did not arise
during an investigation of a bomb threat or kidnapping or comparably
serious crime," stated Cooley Godward's Michael Traynor, one of the
attorneys who represented ApolloMedia in the case. "ApolloMedia's
successful challenge in the courts is an important step toward limiting
unjustifiably secret investigations of communications over the Internet."
<p>
