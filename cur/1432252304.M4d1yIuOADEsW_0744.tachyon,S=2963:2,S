I actually found the mechanics' article quite interesting. I think it's what 
anarchy starts to look like in the real world...ie, there are still laws 
'somewhere', but they end up functioning like a 'value add' or quality 
control. I've argued on numerous occasions that NYC already has some very 
anarchic elements.

I also found it useful from a very practical persepctive...I've got good 
names to ask for in case I need some cheap (or discrete!) work done.
