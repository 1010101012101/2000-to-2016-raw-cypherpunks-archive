No, I don't do this. I do put a tag in the title for traffic analysis and
easy visual identification. Despite your bitching about it, about 70% of
the mailing lists I'm aware of do the same thing. The only distinction is
they put []'s around it. I could put []'s if that'll make you happy. The
'CDR' itself stays. Very handy for quick visual scanning.
