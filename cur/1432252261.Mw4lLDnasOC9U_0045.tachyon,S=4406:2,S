The other reason it's appealing is that it lets academics consider their
work finished when they've constructed a logical argument or proof,
without considering implementation details, because the "maximally 
powerful adversary model" in practice seems to include a maximally
competent implementer of the design under consideration.

Which is great for academics, but in the real world, software and 
hardware systems have defects - frequently, defects with security
implications.

Yes, for attacks against the strong part of the system - but that's not
what sensible attackers go after. The "maximal adversary" imagined
is apparently a very gentle and polite one, who can only operate on
network wires, but won't consider physical penetration or torture,
and in some models won't even subvert the security of the machines
hosting the system.

But - several, if not many times - the security we've achieved has been
broken, because of implementation errors on the part of creators, 
installers, or users. 

Consider the computing power assembled for the DES or RC5 cracks,
instead applied to dictionary attacks versus a PGP keyring, or SSH
keyfile. How long until the average user's passphrase is recovered?
