Ghandi. Womens Sufferage (US). Jim Crow Laws (US). Vietnam. Civil Rights
in the 60's.

The point being, there are plenty of historical precidence where this sort
of behaviour has led directly to the change desired by the protestors
against a much better armed and entrenched foe.

Highly heirarchial defence mechanisms, such as you tout as invincible,
work just fine when faced with that sort of competition. When faced with a
more distributed and idealistic confrontation they eventualy fail.

The question is not one of tactics, but of spirits.

Sun-Tzu should be added to your summer reading list.
