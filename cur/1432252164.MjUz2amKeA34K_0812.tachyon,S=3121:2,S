According to a rebutal posted to Declan's list, McAfee.com (not the same
as McAfee) is claiming that neither it nor Network Associates is assisting
the FBI.

Regardless, the tips Tim mentions are certainly ones to practice. (Just
because an anti-virus company isn't cooperating with the FBI on this
doesn't mean its software will detect Magic Lantern. McAfee's position on
this should be irrelevant.)
