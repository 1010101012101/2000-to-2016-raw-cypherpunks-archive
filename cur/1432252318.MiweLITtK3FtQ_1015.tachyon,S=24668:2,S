This deserves further explanation. I do think game theory is extremely
present in all of our society. We'd be more happy to have other pay tax and
not us, than to also pay taxes ourselves.

Arguing against "taxes" in the broad sense of the word (contribution to
society as a whole, government is less often the right word) is very
challenging indeed if you ask me. Some things only work when everyone
pitches in. Reducing climate destruction will not be possible without
universally agreed upon rules or very aggressive resistance by ... pretty
much all buying power. The latter hasn't happened ever, not without a
governing organ explicitly "boycotting" something. We're entering a very
murky discussion here which I think shouldn't be required.

Let's say "do something for the good of all of *cared-for-group-name* that
will cost the individual more than the individual will profit from it".
Becoming vegetarian is an example. It doesn't work if just that one person
does it, but it does cost that person something.

You're right in that 10% is pretty darn high. Only Israel gets to that
number. About 5% of gov' taxes goes to defense though. With developed
countries' tax pressure at ~35% (US only ~25%) that makes 0.35 * 0.05 =3D
0.0175 or about 2% of your money. Only a fifth of what I asked you for.
Then you say you did *additional* things to secure yourself. Let's say 2%
is about right for a personal defense budget.

Knowing that committing a murder is cheaper than preventing one, by a
factor I'm not aware of, and that murder can sometimes have an economic
advantage you will find that murder will exist. (see also estimated victims
and cost of prevention of terrorism. Now see the costs of hitmen (find a
cheap one).)

Having a public market for hitmen will make it cheaper. Having a
crowdfunding posibility will enable a new *class* of people, those with
lesser profit from it, to still contribute to a kill. This model doesn't
show failures and thus misguides hitmen into thinking it is easy money,
distorting the market in the unpreferred direction. Observe how "no
retribution" significantly reduces the estimated cost of a murdering
someone.

I simply think you wouldn't get the type of civilization where you could
focus on development of the race as a whole. A way to live more than just
for your own little life, but for that of your family and "comrades".

If you don't do that you choose the most painful way to die; to live.

For real, right? Frikkin' goody two shoeses. Can't understand their

People in your neighborhood have a (perhaps unspoken) currency of
reputation. Their warning to others would be reciprocated. That idea makes
them do it. You don't have to consider this rational or good for the
individual, evolution made sure that it increases the size of the
population. This is not personally advantageous, it's popularly
advantageous. Evolution made you a less rational being to cause your
existence. Very philosophical standpoint. "Humans aren't rational,
therefore they can exist". Anyway.

There might very well be examples of true mutually beneficial cases. For
example if a wallet's finder may keep a percentage of the wallet's
contents. The finder has this dilemma:

Max( wallet.content * captureRiskFactor, wallet.content * rewardFactor +
emotionalBonus)
If the wallet's finder is found out (the owner found him) he will lose the
reward. The risk factor is 0 to 1. 10% chance of getting caught makes
content * 0.1. This is the expected profit. Everyone on this list really
should know about expected returns and all. Only when the rewardFactor is
bigger than his riskfactor will he give the wallet back. You'll find that
even this is not actually mutually beneficial, lets the wallet has
different values for both people. This is generally true, maybe a family
picture, ID's that have to be rerequested at a cost, etc. While the cash is
all that's good to the finder.

The emotional bonus is the thing that causes people to be vegetarian and is
also the typical reason people obey the law. It's part of the unlikely
risk-adverseness common in people nowadays. I guess safely living worse is
better than maybe living better in terms of survival.

Anyway again. Given such proper gametheory you'll find it hard to find
situations where one would be interested in protecting another unrelated
human being.

At some point crime will stabilize at a certain level. That level is where
people are so generally scared of a crime against them, yet not scared of
retribution for their protests against crime, that they'll put efforts (in
financial or other form) into reducing the level of criminality.

You'll find their first move is closing assassination markets to increase
the effective cost and risk of finding a murderer to do one's bidding. It's
by far the cheapest way to reduce murder.

Once there's a string of crimes you'd rather barricade your home than
collectively hire a detective. Maybe you'll have a guard on your street.
But you wouldn't donate to a crime lab doing experimental research. That's
just too little directly visible return. Ad-hoc patchwork solutions.
(Paying safety money for example)

An assassination pool however has very direct and clear payoffs if it ever
happens. Easy to put money towards out of a simple grudge.



Excuses for the subpar use of language. My End Of Day has been reached.

Could you try to summarize the arguments we've been throwing at each other?
I'd like to reach some sort of satisfying answer.

I think you estimate the cost of protection to be comparable to the cost of
attacks. I think protection is far more expensive and although likely a
more popular expense (let's say people are generally good, witchhunts and
discrimination would suggest otherwise but w/e) also more frequently a
smaller expense, as the profit derived from it is very hard to determine
and the profit would hardly alter by a personal contribution. Therewith
creating a game theory scenario (a simple one!) where general safety will
dwindle as to alter our society significantly and make crime an auctioned
commodity. Subverting any way of life not strictly egoistical. (What was
the last time you donated to your police station?)

As you see my summary turned into another piece of argument. Excuses
excuses.

Eeyorish is a nice word btw. And after a string of crimes is a tad late.
And who'd notice it's a string of crimes?
