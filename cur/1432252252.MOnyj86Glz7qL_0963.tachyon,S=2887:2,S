WASHINGTON--Sen. Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who fought to
      bolster Americans' privacy rights and limit government
surveillance of the
      Internet, was killed in a plane crash on Friday afternoon.

      Wellstone, 58, was an unapologetic liberal who was elected in 1990
and opposed the Gulf
      War, sought to increase the minimum wage, and envisioned a
tax-funded health care
      system. He was enmeshed in a tight re-election bid this year.
