Most of those are "mixed economies" of course.  A fully developed fascist 
state requires that nominal versions of a market economy, wages, prices, 
profit, ownership etc. be maintained but that a full-blown command economy 
is maintained by wage and price controls and tight regulation of private 
commercial activity.

So the US is not a fascist economy (it usually scores in 5th place among 
the nations on the two Economic Freedom of lists produced by the WSJ and CATO).
