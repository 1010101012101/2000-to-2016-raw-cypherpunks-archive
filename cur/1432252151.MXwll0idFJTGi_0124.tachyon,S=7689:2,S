  The recent anthrax scares have led to a handful of companies being
discovered that have products 
  available that test and disinfect antimicrobial agents. Vital Living
Products (OTC BB: VLPI) recently 
  announced it had developed home testing kits for Anthrax and the stock
soared to a 52-week high on 
  Monday with shares climbing from $0.06 to $2.00. Another company,
Veridien (OTC BB: VRDE) 
  announced that its sanitizing and disinfecting products are designed
to stop or slow and control 
  environmental challenges and the stock jumped from $0.05 to $0.13.
Other companies like 
  eSAFETYWORLD, Cepheid, Vital Living, and Ozolutions, and InVision
Technologies have emerged and 
  shareholders have been rewarded in this era of fears for personal
safety. Some are calling it the "Anthrax 
  Bubble."

     WHAT COMPANY WILL BE NEXT IN CONFRONTING BIOLOGICAL THREATS ?

  Who will be the next leader in eradicating bacteria and preventing
biological risks? There is a great deal of investment speculation.

  TRSG Corp. is a leader in selling neutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
and health and dietary supplements in 
  the U.S. and Japan.  The following is an excerpt from a BusinessWire
news release issued today:

        ------  Handheld Anthrax Detection Device -- $50-$100 Price Tag



  *** TRSG ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT LINE ***

  LAS VEGAS--Oct. 25, 2001--TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO), a majority-owned
subsidiary of 
  Gateway Distributors Ltd., Thursday announced it has entered into a
preliminary agreement to acquire 
  certain assets of Mobility Solutions Inc.  These assets include the
Rest Assured Product Line of hand-held, 
  low-cost devices used to detect the presence of biological agents such
as Bacillus Anthraci (commonly 
  referred to as Anthrax) as well as many other biological agents.

  The Rest Assured Biological Agent Detection Product line utilizes UV-A
waves or waves in the 320 to 
  380 nm range, commonly referred to as black light or wood's light,
that have been determined to not cause 
  sunburn to human skin though the use of eye protection is recommended
during use. These products are 
  for detection purposes only and are not intended as a treatment or
cure for any specific disease.

  Ongoing research is being conducted at this time to verify the
product's effectiveness in the use of 
  identifying the presence of a wide range of biological agents such as
Becillus Anthraci, which is currently 
  making headlines throughout the world. Independent research
laboratories are conducting this research.
