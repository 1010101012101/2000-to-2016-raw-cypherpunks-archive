Its like steganalysis.  Its an arms race between measuring your own
signatures vs. what the Adversary can measure.  If sentence length
is a metric known to you, you can write filters that warn you.
Similarly for the Adversary.   You end up in an arms race
over metrics ---who has the more sensitive ones that the other
does not control for?
