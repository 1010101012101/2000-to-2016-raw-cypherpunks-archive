If you're using an anonet, a new address for every transaction, a
good mix that at least guarantees lack of per session taint, and
are willing to accept a random variance in your input and output BTC
amount and timing to prevent lining up the net totals, I don't think
anyone could. Part of it probably hinges on the overall coin flux
rate through commerce at scale too. I'm sure the answer is on
bitcointalk somewhere.
