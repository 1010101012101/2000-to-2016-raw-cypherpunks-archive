Blue pill or the red? Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, enjoy the 
ride.
I'm a speed king you go to hear me sing I'm a speed king see me fly
Sweet child in time you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between the good and the bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord I bet you have
And you've been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes and bow your head
And wait for the ricochet.
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Oooh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big fat tyres
and everything

I love it and I need it
I bleed it yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Oooh she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth body control
and everything

I love her I need her
I seed her
Yeah She turns me on
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody gonna steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Oooh I'm in heaven again I've got everything
Like a moving ground an open road
and everything

I love it and I need it
I seed it
Eight cylinders all mine
Alright hold on tight
I'm a highway star
Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on 
the water, fire in the sky We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty cold 
and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Making our 
music there With a few red lights and a few old beds We made a place to 
sweat No matter what we get out of this I know we'll never forget Smoke on 
the water, fire in the sky
Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.
I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.
Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.
Long way from the wife.life.Dont come back...ever.
