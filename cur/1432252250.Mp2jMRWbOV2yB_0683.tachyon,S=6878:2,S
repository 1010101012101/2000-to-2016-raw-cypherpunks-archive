Thanks for that perspective; from without, it looked like he was adding 
it voluntarily to tie his funding to Mozilla.

I still stand by the right of employees to protest an employer who votes 
against their rights, but my opinion of Eich is marginally higher, 
knowing that he wasn't deliberately tarnishing Mozilla for his own agenda.

I strongly disagree with his views, but I respect that he has a right to 
have them. If his views conflict with his suitability for a role or 
employment though, that's entirely on him and I don't see that it 
deserves a white-wash. We're soon to have a referendum on marriage 
equality here in Ireland, and if my employer were campaigning actively 
against it (they are not!), I'd be quick to raise my voice.
