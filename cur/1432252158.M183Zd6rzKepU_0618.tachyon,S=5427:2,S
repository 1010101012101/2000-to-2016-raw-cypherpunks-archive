  Nigeria: New Sharia case Unmarried mother sentenced to death


A Nigerian court's decision to uphold the verdict of death by stoning of 
Amina Lawal for adultery is a cruel and inhuman application of Sharia law, 
says Human Rights Watch, and an abuse of the law to punish women for 
consensual sex. "The death penalty is never an appropriate punishment for a 
crime, and, in this instance, the very nature of the crime is in doubt."
  Make your own protest.

Express your concern for the plight of Amina Lawal, sentenced to death from 
stoning by a Sharia court in the state of Katsina in northern Nigeria for 
having engaged in sex outside marriage. The government used her pregnancy 
as evidence of her having committed adultery. Ms. Lawal now has an 
eight-month old child.

Human Rights Watch argues that:

  In this case the legal system is being abused to punish adult women for 
consensual sex.
  The death penalty is never an appropriate punishment for a crime, 
especially where, as in this instance, the very nature of the crime is in 
doubt.
  The Nigerian government should commute the death sentence of Amina Lawal 
and drop the criminal charges against her.

Appeals protesting the sentencing should be sent to the following:
