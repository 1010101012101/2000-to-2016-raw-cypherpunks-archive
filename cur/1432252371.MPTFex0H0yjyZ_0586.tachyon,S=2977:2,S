Maybe in a year or so.  Right now I'm working on a reference book on 
cryptographic protocols, and it's looking like it's gonna take a pretty 
major chunk of work. 

Meanwhile, if you read "The Codebreakers" by David Kahn, you will
find a few gems of pencil-and-paper cryptanalytic technique in there 
sandwiched by lots and lots of history.  The history is interesting 
though, so it won't be a boring or frustrating hunt.
