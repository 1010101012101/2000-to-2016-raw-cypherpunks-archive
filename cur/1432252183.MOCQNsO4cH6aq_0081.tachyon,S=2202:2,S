Rather than a terrorist bomb, could it have been a damage control
function by the good guys?  The objective in such a case being a
controlled collapse.  I imagine it could take far longer than an hour to
place such charges.  My ignorance is probably obvious from the question,
but I've heard this idea bandied about before.  I'd imagine that if this
were the case, expert engineers studying the collapse would recognize it
instantly, so it doesn't seem too probable.  Just throwing it out there.
