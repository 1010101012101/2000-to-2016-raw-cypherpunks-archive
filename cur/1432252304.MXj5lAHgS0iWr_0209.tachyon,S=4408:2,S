The plan, as envisaged by our enemies, is that first almost  
everyone will voluntarily run a "trusted" operating system in 
order to view copyrighted entertainment.   The major capability of 
the new hardware will be to advertise to servers that trusted 
software is in control.  Then new hardware that is willing to run 
an "untrusted" operating system will be banned. After all, only 
pirates, drug trafficers, money launderers, and child 
pornographers are running untrusted software. Then only properly 
degreed people will be authorized to work on untrusted operating 
systems and hardware campable of running them.  The qualifications 
for being properly degreed, like the qualifications for medicine, 
will become increasing related to control and less related to 
competence.  Unauthorized possession of untrusted hardware will 
become subject to increasingly severe sanctions, and net access 
will only be possible through a gateway and proxies running 
trusted sofware.

Of course the flaw in this is step one -- almost everyone runs a  
"trusted" operating system.   When step one does not seem to be  
happening, it will be announced to be largely complete, and then  
step two will be launched prematurely, and so will encounter  
considerable hostility..
