The high point of support for socialism among the masses in the US 
was the 1870s, give or take a couple of decades.

By 1900 socialists around the world had given up all hope of 
genuinely revolutionary seizure of power, and were pursuing 
conspiratorial paths.

The 1930s was the high point of support for socialism among the 
intellectuals, the privileged, and the elite.  Their efforts to 
foist their preferences on the American masses met with resounding 
hostility and reluctance.  Not only was there no danger of a 
socialist revolution, in the US or anywhere else, but in the US 
the leadership's attempts to force socialism down peoples throats 
met stubborn resistance.

There was more mass support for socialism in other countries, but 
no socialist revolutions in those countries, nor any danger of 
such revolt.  There were socialist coups, and conspiratorial 
seizures of power by socialists in other countries.
