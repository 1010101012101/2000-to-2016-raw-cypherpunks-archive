LOL! I suppose I could figure out a way to meet you sometime so you don't know

Apemantus' Prayer:

Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
I pray for no man but myself:
Grant I may never prove so fond;
To trust man on his oath or bond;
Or a harlot, for her weeping;
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
Or a keeper with my freedom;
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
Amen.
