	Your source is unreliable. These are testable assertions, and
every single one of them is false.

1) Jim Bell was arrested November 17 2000
http://cryptome.org/jdb032801.htm
2) He was charged under U.S.C. Title 18, Section 2261A "Interstate stalking"
http://cryptome.org/jdb111700.htm
4) That became law Sept. 23, 1996.
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2261A.html
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2261A.notes.html
5) Nor is this trial the first application of the law
http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.med.uscourts.gov/opinions/carter/1999/gc_2-99cr034_usa_v_brown_doc034_nov.pdf+Title+18,+United+States+Code,+Section+2261A&hl=en

	Granted, you can't be expected to check up on this stuff right
now. But your source is feeding you paranoia and cypherbibble. Please
take that into account when evaluating anything further from said source.
