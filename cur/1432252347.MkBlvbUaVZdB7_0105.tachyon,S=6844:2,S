See, the standard defense for all this is to lock down the cert fingerprints of
your real destination to prevent cert games. Then add in DNSSEC [1] and even
IPSEC [1] to make sure things all match up. That does make things much harder.
Problem still lies where your adversary has stolen or co-op'd the PK
of your dest
cert, and rigged the routing path to route-map your applicable src/dest/port IP
tuples to residing off their private port in the local (to you or your
dest) DC. Right???
>From which they proceed to bugger you through their transparent proxy
to the real
dest. It's not a bulk tool as that might tip off some non-moled-out-cert-group
network groupie at the dest site that a lot of users come from some IP. And it's
definitely for 'high value only' given the work/risk. But still...
PKI-WOT bidirectional
security between you and your dest of global bgp advert/nexthop routing
infrastructure anyone? Everyone seems to trust the network to route... and
even then [1].
[1] Similarly stolen/co-op'd as need be.
