DI water (deionized water) is used at various stages to rinse boards, 
wafers, plated devices, etc.

Soap and water is often used for cleaning bare PCBs, but this is long 
before the chips go in.

After wave soldering (PCBs fed on conveyer belt above hot solder bath, 
soldering the devices to the board in one continuous process) the flux 
and dross and gunk is washed off with special soaps (e.g., high acid 
content soaps) and water. But the water is certainly not left on the 
boards, not left to dry and cause spotting, etc.

Alcohol and other rinses are used.

We used to use vapor degreasers a lot, and TCE, before it got 
restricted.

As for the effects of water on packaged chips, they vary. Moisture 
intrusion usually comes when a "driving force" exists for some long 
amount of time, e.g., '85/85" (85 per cent relative humidity, 85 C, for 
some number of hours or days). External corrosion is also possible.

(One of the first things I devised for Intel was dubbed the "water drop 
test." Still in use, 28 years later.)

My point about not wanting to immerse my flash drive is related to why 
I would no immerse any other piece of electronics unless I had a 
compelling reason to do so.
