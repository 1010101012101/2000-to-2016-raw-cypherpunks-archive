The Mexican Mafia
 From its humble beginnings as a prison gang in Texas, the Mexican Mafia 
has taken its bloody business far beyond the prison walls.
In the first RICO prosecution of a prison gang, prosecutors brought a 
two-count RICO case against the top tier of La Eme, including Huerta, who 
was in prison in Colorado at the time of the French Place slayings. The 
fact that he was still directing his gang from several hundred miles away 
allowed prosecutors to charge Huerta as a conspirator.
After a high-profile trial, Perez, Herrera and the eight other defendants 
who went to trial (the others plea bargained) were convicted on federal 
racketeering charges and given life terms with no chance of parole.
Despite the decimation of the highest ranking Mexikaneme, the Mexican Mafia 
remains to this day a formidable organized crime operation with branches 
throughout the American Southwest on both sides of prison walls.

Did You Know? Judges at the state and federal level issued a total of 1,491 
wiretap authorizations -- the lion's share came from state judges, 
according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts's 2001 
Wiretap Report, issued at the end of May. Tap in here...
