Yup... but that's kind of standard around here.  Pull up a reasonable 
quote from some super hated person and make people think.  Nothing new.  I 
think there was something about gun control and making people safe 
attributed to Hitler, etc. a while back.

Right on que too, though it doesn't mention Cypherpunks...

The Internet is the home of Terror

Servers of Mass destruction

By Nick Farrell: Thursday 08 July 2004, 07:50
THE INTERNET has become the place for terrorist training, recruitment, and 
fundraising, according to a leading Israeli academic.

Speaking to the Medill News Service, Gabriel Weimann, chair of the 
University of Haifa communications department claims that Terrorist groups 
are exploiting the accessibility, vast audience, and anonymity of the 
Internet to raise money and recruit new members.
