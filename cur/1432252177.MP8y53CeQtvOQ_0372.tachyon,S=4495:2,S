They talk big.  Talk is free.

If they actually become violent in deed ---smash the individuals
who acted.  But words are just noise.

When you say 'accused of fascism' you mean accused of nationalist-rascism,
no?  Fascism really means state-control of everything, and its only 
because of National Socialism of the 30-40s' quirks that they are linked in
many minds.

The US, has been in the 20th century quite fascist in its control of all
property and too sensitive (infringing on rights with social engineering)
to race.

In the US, those rules include tolerance for ideas (that if carried
out would be infringements of others rights to be left alone).  

Of course there are social rules.  Within the boundaries of 
no-nonconsensual-harm (ie, others' right to be left alone), you're free to
do whatever, no matter how distasteful to others.

Let's face it: Society

Acknowledges your right to exist meaning what?  That they not
run you over at a crosswalk, sure.  That they must invite you 
to give a speech at their private club?  No.  

And why would you care if some scum acknowledges you or not?  As
long as they leave you alone, they can rant all they like.

We explicitly cannot outlaw political parties here, although in the 50s
that was lost in our own form of hysteria at the time.  (Communist Party
(tm) was
officially Bad and Threatening)

As far as realpsychology goes, active harassment of fringe groups
is only going to make them more attractive.
