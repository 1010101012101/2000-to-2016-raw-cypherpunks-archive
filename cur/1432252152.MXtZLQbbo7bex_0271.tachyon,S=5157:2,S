Journalists may as well be saying the above, saying that shuttle debris 
has evil spirits which can come out if the debris is touched.

Part of the dumbing down of America, and of journalism. (I just heard 
one Fox News anchorbimbo referring to the Russian rocket launched today 
as "bringing supplies to the space station.)

The journalists are spouting the NASA line that shuttle debris may be 
"hot" and may have dangerous substances. Right. As if the heat and 
spinning and 12000 mph turbulence hasn't scrubbed every surface of its 
volatiles.

What they want is for people not to collect the pieces and hang on to 
them on their fireplace mantles. Or to try to sell them at flea markets 
and EBay.

But the only way they think they can frighten people off is to utter 
obvious gibberish about how the pieces are "hot" and "may be toxic."

"DALLAS (AP) - From corrosive fuels to ammonia-like liquids, insulation 
and plastics, space shuttle Columbia carried a witch's brew of toxic 
and caustic materials designed to work in the hostile environment of 
space.

"Authorities warned the public to stay away from shuttle debris because 
it could be harmful.

"Perry said either liquid oxygen from the shuttle's fuel system or 
liquid nitrogen used to inflate the tires could be dangerous. "

Right. Those charred and warped pieces of metal are going to have 
liquid oxygen and/or liquid nitrogen on them...after the fall and after 
sitting on the ground (not to mentioned being so "hot," other NASA 
droids and reporters report).

(Needless to say, any look at the images of the designated officials 
picking up the bits of debris shows no HAZMAT suits, no welding gloves 
to deal with the "hot" debris. The pickup crews are just wearing 
ordinary coveralls and uniforms.)

Last laugh: CNN is carrying (10:06 a.m. PST) an "information" slug at 
the bottom of a Wolf Blitzer interview: "Columbia was traveling 18 
times faster than the speed of light."

Yes, "speed of light."

Speaking of journalists, why does Wolf Blitzer repeat this obvious lie 
about the metal bits and pieces being tainted by evil spirits? Because 
these so-called journalists are stooges for the state.

A real journalist would just roll his eyes and say "Look, folks, NASA 
wants these pieces to be aid in reconstructing the accident. There are 
no traces of liquid propellants and deadly chemicals on these pieces. 
And they certainly didn't stay hot for long. NASA is trying to get us 
to feed you jive so you'll be properly frightened and won't touch 
them.?"
