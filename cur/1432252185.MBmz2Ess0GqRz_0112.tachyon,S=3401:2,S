Declan suggests Procmail, if you want a powerful, flexible tool.
Alternatively, many mail reader programs include filtering capabilities.
/bin/mail didn't :-), but Eudora does, and probably most browser-based
mail readers also do.  So you're covered with Procmail on Unix,
and client programs on Windows and Macs.
