I disagree, politely, with nearly every point you make.

DVDs are taking off faster than I have ever seen a product take off, and 
I've seen quite a few.

They are vastly  better than VHS, in picture quality, and are 
mechanically superior to VHS in nearly every way. (No broken/stretched 
tapes, no complicated read heads and capstans to get knocked out of 
whack, scratched, etc.)

(I also have Hi-8, but would never think of archiving _anything_ to it. 
Flimsy heads/capstans in spades. Ditto for DV, which I also have. It's 
resolution is the best of all, but it's convenience and robustness are 
dubious.)

I started looking at laser disks in 1979, but never bought one. The 
disks were too large and unwieldy to be a competitive format.

VHS will of course be around, in the same way that LPs are still around, 
and even in the way that 78s can still be played with the right 
equipment. But the morphism from LP --> CD is being outpaced by the 
VHS --> DVD morphism.

There's a good reason why DVDs are doing so well.
