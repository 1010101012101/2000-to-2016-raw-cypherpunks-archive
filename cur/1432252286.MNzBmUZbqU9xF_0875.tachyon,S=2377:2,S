You're on a roll, Mr. Bob Hettinga:

> Of course, the very concept of tax-free *anything* is anathema to me,

To summarize:

- Opposing any war is treason.
- Every human activity should be taxed.
- Failure to tax is equivalent to subsidy.

> Nation-states are a bitch, y'all...

And from the above I conclude that you like it that way.

> Cheers,
> RAH

Three cheers for the state, rah rah rah!

Digital bearer settlement is treason.


-- Patrick

"Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be 
dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War 
is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes. And 
armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the 
many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary 
power of the Executive is extended. ... No nation could preserve its 
freedom in the midst of continual warfare."

James Madison, April 20, 1795
