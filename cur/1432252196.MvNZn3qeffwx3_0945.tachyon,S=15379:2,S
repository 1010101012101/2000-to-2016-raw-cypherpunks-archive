Catalina Abused? "This Thug's A Real Menace!" sez Max Girl

Gene sez: We've contacted Steve Sweet to get his side of this story.

Catalina writes: Hi Gene, I’m in the middle of a long expedition with Max 
Hardcore and his crew  to Washington State , and Vancouver , British 
Columbia .  We were ALL on our way up to Vancouver , but the border guards 
were being total jerks, and wouldn’t let Max into Canada .  I know the 
guards rifled through my bags, and I’m sure one of them guys tried on my 
high heels because they were all stretched out the next time I wore 
them!  I’m putting that into up on my site at 
http://www.catalina-pornstar.com/, and exposing these perverts!  I also 
have their pictures too!

None the less, the trip so far was great in one way for us, because Max we 
shot a pretty great scene with a new girl named Mia Sweet from Vancouver 
.  She’s a real hell-cat, so Max told me to shove my foot in her mouth AND 
in pussy while Max fucks her in the ass!  That’s what Max calls a Canadian 
Foot Warmer!

But - and I don’t want to seem like I’m whining here - I also HAVE to tell 
you and the world about an unbelievable experience I had with a Mia’s 
manager-pimp who’s a real asshole!  Even before the sex scenes I agreed to 
do for him up in Vancouver , this ass-wipe manhandled me so bad on the road 
up there that he left bruises you can see! This apes’ name is Steve Sweet, 
and he’s known for his nonfunctional cock, and pathetic internet site.  Max 
thought he knew this guy, (He doesn’t really), so I figure he’s okay.  Max 
lets Steve take me up to Vancouver to do a couple of scenes for him while 
Max shoots back in Washington .

After my three-way scene in Washington , Steve, Mia, and I drive in Steve’s 
car up to Vancouver .  My phone isn’t working, yet this fuck-wad won’t even 
let me use his phone to make any calls, so I’m nervous already.  Maybe he’s 
mad at me because I did such a good job fucking his whore Mia as you can 
see from the attached picture.  You can also see the whole scene on 
http://www.maxhardcore.com/.

While riding up to Vancouver , I’m in the backseat while Mia is driving and 
Steve is in the passenger seat.  I’m ignoring them both, simply occupying 
myself with a crossword puzzle, and for no better reason than not paying 
enough attention to him, he grabs my puzzle book from me and slams it on 
the floor.  He starts yelling at me, saying he isn’t obligated to let me 
use his phone.  He keeps telling me to shut the fuck up or else.  I wish I 
had some mace and a blackjack at this point.  Mia’s phone is in the back 
seat connected to her bag, so I call Max, telling him I’m pretty worried 
here, but the whole ugly situation isn’t evident yet, as Steve turns into a 
sweet guy while talking with Max, so I continue for the time being.

When I get off the phone with Max, Steve starts yelling all over again, 
calling me a bitch, and that he’s going to drop me off in the middle of the 
forest!  I start to call Max again, and he jumps right on top of me, tears 
the phone out of my hands, and screams that I ain’t calling anyone! I yell 
at him to get off me, but he won’t. He’s hurting my hands, arms and chest 
because his whole 200 pounds of blubber is on top of me!  I’m crying and 
all he does is yell some more and start choking me.

I tell him I’m calling the cops, and this nightmare continues when I he 
drops off at a hotel where all rooms were booked!  I’m all alone there for 
a long time, until he comes back again, and tells me not to worry.  He 
wants me to work for him, and tells me things will be okay.  I didn’t have 
many options at this point, and in spite of my better judgment, I agree to 
do some PROFESSIONAL work for him, IF he behaves himself and I have a 
secure place to stay.

Right!  He takes me to his house on the water where he shoots.  But he 
immediately does the wrong thing, ordering me to take off my pants and play 
with myself.  Then, and I have no better way of putting this, he forces me 
to give him a blow job!  He’s lucky I don’t want to hang around long enough 
to press charges!

He wants me to work with him for two days and fuck two guys and work scenes 
with fisting for $500.  I’m so violated, I get my bags ready to go in the 
morning and hitchhike back to America !

This guy is such an asshole!  He orders me to say that I love him, and his 
big cock, (which, I can assure you, is not that big OR hard), and makes me 
say that I liked doing everything he tells me.  I’m so exhausted and fed up 
with his crap, I tell him I just want to go to bed.  His response is to 
tell him that he wants me to do a scene now – and it’s like two o’clock the 
morning!  No fucking way, I tell him! He finally gives up, and I’m allowed 
to go to my room. I lock the door, but I’m terrified that he’ll come in at 
any time, but fortunately he never does.  Needless to say, I didn’t get 
much rest this night!  In the morning, I tell him I’m not going to tolerate 
anymore of his crap.  So he surrenders and takes me to the bus station so I 
can get down to Seattle where Max is shooting.  This thug Steve Sweet is a 
real menace, and needs to have some one put him into his place.  He’ll take 
care of himself soon enough, and I have no intention of ever going back 
there to finish his career.  I know he’ll take care of that all by himself 
soon enough.

And yes, I know some people say things like this about Max, but I have yet 
to see Max pull the kind of pushy crap this guy from Vancouver thinks he 
can get away with.  Max spells it out to the girls he and I work with 
before hand, and never ever does anything off camera.  On camera, Max is 
good to go, so if you don’t want to do something you better be ready to say 
no, and not just go along with it and whine later.  I have never really 
complained about someone in the business before in public.  But this guy 
Steve Sweet is really out of line and I want everybody to know what kind of 
a low life fuck this guy really is. ...Catalina

Gene sez: We also had the opportunity to chat with Max Hardcore 
[www.maxhardcore.com] who had this to say about the situation:

Max: This was pretty surprising to me. I figured I knew the guy. It's one 
thing to push the fuckin' broads on the set- as long as they know what's 
going on and are down with the program. But off camera it's a different 
thing. Tackling someone is a little weird. I told her that I knew the guy 
and did some business with him but if you want to tell the story it's your 
call. She got manhandled pretty well and I told her if you want to say 
something go ahead. There's so much crap being said on the Internet that 
you don't know what to believe any more but she felt that it was a story 
that needed to be told.

Gene: From what it sounds like she could be well within her rights to press 
charges.

Max: Absolutely. But it's problematic being across the border. But if 
nothing else this story needed to be told. Steve Sweet started out a few 
years ago doing this thing called Sweet Loads. It was a video series that 
came out of Xplor Media. The guy was in the footsteps of Stagliano and 
other people who had done the POV camera blowjob-thing. People are still 
doing that stuff. But he got fed up with the whole deal of video 
distribution so he started putting all his energy into websites and he's 
got a pretty good grip on it now. He's out of Vancouver with Sweet Loads 
and Sweet Entertainment. They make content for other webmasters to use for 
their webmasters. And he's also got a few other websites up there. He's 
pretty well dialed into the upper echelon of guys that know how to work the 
'Net, like Cybererotica- big players, guys who have thousands of sites up. 
He's doing pretty good with that and shoots a lot up there. He gets girls 
no one else has seen. I got to meet him by way of working on my sites and 
he wants to do some content trades and shit like that. I met him a couple 
of times and he's a real hard charger but, frankly, this surprised me. I 
didn't get his side of the story. I thought it was only fair that I talk to 
him and instead of the phone I'll see him in Florida in a few days.

Sherman Survey results:

Gene: Hello, I recently sent out a survey trying to find out what people 
thought about the newest craze in the Adult Industry, that being the 
creation of "Action Figures" of Porn Stars....

Here's just a couple of the responses I got......

  I think they are designed for men who like to play with little girls. 
lol  No really,I think they are a gimmick to promote the star and get lots 
of mainstream publicity. I also think they will become a collectable that 
will go up in value.

Cindi Loftus

I don't see any true reasons why the action figures shouldn't be made.  I 
don't exactly think that you'll be finding any of them at your local 
toystore.  More like your adult bookstores and in special areas of some 
comic book and action figure stores.  What you will find at toy's r us are 
plenty of action figures and statues of many characters from horror films 
that are rated R.  Any child may purchase one of these without a parent's 
permission.  Basically, pornography is under so much government control 
that it usually only falls into a childs hands because of their own parents 
nonability to put things away.  My opinion...

Alana Evans

Well Sherman, obviously you are a little out of touch in the action figure 
market.  Now a days people buys those things and never open the packages 
because it would lower the resale value.  Never understood the logic of 
buying something you will never open but hey that is just me.

Now as far as Jenna's action figure goes I can't say I like the way it 
looks, but what the hey.  Sure why not.  They made trading cards for a 
while didn't they?

Lee Carver

It's trippers like you whom make it difficult for the adult industry to 
thrive in our Conservative Right Wing Republican government with retarded 
questions like: What are Children supposed to do with Action Figures of 
Porn stars?
Were you sexually abused as a child that you had access to erotica of *any* 
nature as a child and/or minor?  These action figures are intended for 
*adult* porn aficianados and *adult* collectors of all things porn.  As 
*adults*, they're capable of making *legal* consumer decisions.  Children 
should do *nothing* with *adult* action figures that they are not taught to 
do by their parents.  If they tell them to throw away *adult* action 
figures that they find *magically* lying around somewhere, then that's what 
they should do.  If they tell them to go out and steal *adult* action 
figures, because as *minors* they would not *legally* be able to purchase 
them, then they would probably be *your* parents.  Either way, you're just 
a small fish.
It's antagonists like you who no doubt talks like an advocate of Freedom of 
Speech, while never going to bat for the adult industry during voting 
time.  *Then* you capitalize off of an industry to whom you are just a 
leech; a symbiotic parasite that feeds off of the misery of others.  Misery 
that lame hypocrites like you help cause. I happen to know one of the 
creators of this product.  I talk to him almost every day, and he's a man 
of integrity.  He never made those action figures to be marketed to minors, 
they're collector's items.  And what are *adults* supposed to do with 
them?: Let 'em collect dust up on a shelf or stick 'em up their asses if 
they really want to. 'Cuz that's what makes America great.  Any 
antagonistic, ignorant, dreg-of-society like yourself can post their 
ignorant queries and insinuations via mass e-mail! God(s) Bless America, 
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!
P.S. ~ Only closet-pedophiles like yourself call adult films 'porno', but 
how successful would the adult industry be without end users like you 
buying their stuff?  Answer:  We don't know.  We don't do case studies of 
'porno' people like you whose tendency is to immediately imagine children 
getting their hands on adult product.
