Public property was paid for by looting private individuals' 
pockets or appropriating it directly.  The concept of regulating 
public activities is pure socialist bullshit.  Ordinances 
prohibiting or regulating any activity on private property is part 
of our creeping nanny state totalitarianism.  

Any individual who enforces, or any politician who votes for a law 
that uses force to regulate behavior is guilty of initiating force 
against anyone affected by the law, and is a deserving target of 
retaliation. Any individual who votes for one of these political 
scumbags or urges them to enact such a law is also a deserving 
target of retaliation.
