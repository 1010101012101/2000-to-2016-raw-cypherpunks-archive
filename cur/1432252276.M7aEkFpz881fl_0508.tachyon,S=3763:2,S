Stalin and Hitler were especially firm believers in the principle that evil 
is merely a question of perspective, and thus any nation that got in the 
way of mass murder, notably the US, was, by their theory, especially 
evil.  Indeed Stalin made "objectivism" a thought crime, punishable by 
death.  By "objectivism" he meant the belief that truth was a matter of 
fact, rather than authority.
