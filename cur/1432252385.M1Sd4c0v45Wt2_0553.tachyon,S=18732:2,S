SJD Editorial Note: Although Mr. Clark refrained from calling Mr. D'ull an 
asshole, it is plainly evident that had he done so, he most likely would 
NOT have labeled Mr. D'ull a "run-of-the-mill asshole." Mr. Clark most 
likely would have referred to Mr. D'ull as a "quintessential piece of 
thieving porn shit asshole," or possibly a "shameless bottom-feeding 
rip-off artist asshole."

It is the opinion of this website that the two, specific types of assholes 
that Mr. Clark most likely would have described Mr. D'ull as being would be 
preferable than the non-specific "run-of-the-mill asshole" the Chief 
Reporter of this news site has recently been labeled.

If you'd like more information on assholes, please read the editorial that 
immediately precedes this story.
jimmyd _writes "I received an email from David Aaron Clark today. He felt 
he needed to comment on the "Dave Hardman Goes Berserk" story.
David Aaron Clark alleges, "There are obviously huge gaps in this story. 
Mark D'ull, the owner of Best Parts Video, is a shameless bottom-feeding 
rip-off artist who doubtless was not paying Cathy her money. He's John T. 
Bone's former salesman, and he has ripped me off on two titles -- one of 
which he simply didn't pay me for, the other of which I never sold him -- 
my original "Asianatrix," which was released through Bowen's Cream (but 
never paid for -- he bounced the checks and made off with the master)."
As if that weren't enough, David continues to describe his dealings with 
D'ull.
"D'ull, since then, has counterfeited the release; he was selling it behind 
my back during the short time I was associated with Best Parts, doing Some 
graphics and a bondage tape for them. Would that Dave had really caused 
some damage, because D'ull is the quintessential piece of thieving porn 
shit who preys on the industry. Cathy West, on the other hand, has always 
been straight up -- and so, despite his personal travails, has Dave."
When I wrote yesterday's story, I believe I mentioned there might be more 
to it then what I was told. Readers should note there is no evidence that 
D'ull somehow mitigated Hardman's behavior. David Aaron Clark's alleged 
dealings with D'ull have--to my knowledge--nothing to do with David 
Hardman's alleged dealings with D'ull. David Aaron Clark's point-of-view in 
this matter, however, is newsworthy, and therefore we decided to publish it 
for our reader's interest.
The staff of this website would look forward to Mr. D'ull's rebuttal in 
these matters

jimmyd _writes "The other day I was called a 'run-of-the-mill asshole.' 
Normally, I have a sticks-and-stones attitude towards name-calling. But I 
must admit this really bothered me. It wasn't the 'asshole' part, but the 
other, the 'run-of-the-mill' part, that stung like a bee.
If you're going to be an asshole, or rather, be considered an asshole by 
others, your level of 'asshole-ness' should count for something. It should 
be asshole-specific. It should be the type and kind of asshole that would 
allow description, e.g., 'What a low-life, trailer park, white trash, 
degenerate lying asshole he is,' or 'What a backstabbing, 
fuck-his-own-Mother, prick of an asshole he is!'
I don't know about the rest of you, but if I'm going to be an asshole, I'd 
rather be a backstabbing, prick of an asshole, than a generic, vanilla, 
run-of-the-mill asshole. At least being a backstabbing prick of an asshole 
has some bite to it. And it partially explains (at least in simplistic, 
broad terms) what kind of an asshole the asshole is. It may not be very 
complimentary, but it is to-the-point. And when people hear it, they at 
least have some idea of what kind of an asshole they're dealing with, or 
what kind of an asshole they're being called. But the run-of-the-mill 
asshole? Everyone's clueless. They will simply think this person should be 
lumped in with a million others like him, you know, just your average 
asshole, which I guess is what this person was saying about me, and like I 
said, that hurt.
Not to mention the fact that in the porn biz, a business so jam-packed, so 
intensely populated with every kind of stinking asshole known to man and 
woman that it's busting at the seams with them, to be called a 
'run-of-the-mill asshole' truly fucking sucks! It's bad enough I have to 
endure those three-and-a-half star reviews from AVN, but now I'm just a 
three-an-a-half star asshole? That sucks beyond belief!
Personally, in all my endeavors (asshole or otherwise), I've always tried 
to be something other than a Brand-X, plain-paper-wrapped, generic kind of 
guy. Most of the things I've pursued in my life have, at the very least, 
had the potential to stand out--to be remembered, to shine. I'm not saying 
I've always succeeded at these things, and if truth be known, I mostly have 
not. But at least in the design stages these endeavors included even more 
detailed plans to make the overall plan's outcome a memorable one.
In the case of being an asshole, and there have been more than a few times 
when I've diligently worked at being one, I've always, always, always tried 
to be both a complete asshole, and quite intentionally, a very specific 
kind of asshole: An asshole that stands for something, no matter how bad of 
an asshole that something might make me.
And now, I get this email--from someone I've known for more than a few 
years--and granted this someone is pissed at me for something I'm not going 
to get into, and in his anger, calls me a 'run-of-the-mill asshole.' More 
specifically, saying I've become a 'run-of-the-mill asshole,' which means 
that it's been an evolutionary kind of thing. And by doing so, he does not 
even give me credit for being any kind of special asshole. Well, like I 
said, that hurt.
But I promise this, not just to you, the guy who's labeled me a 
'run-of-the-mill asshole,' but I promise everyone from now on whenever I'm 
intent on being an asshole, I'm going to be a complete, total, and very 
specific kind of asshole!
My eyes are wide open now. I have seen the light of the great asshole 
spirit, and I vow to be the kind of asshole that other assholes will aspire 
to be.
I will be a premium, Grade-A, asshole!
And who knows? Maybe someday I'll be fortunate enough to become an uber 
asshole!
