Yeah, but only theoretically.

Consider the persecutions of Mormons in the 1870, ostensibly over religion 
when the real problem was their ballot and officeholder dominance of the 
Utah Territory thwarting the goals of D.C. politicians and wealthy 
non-Mormons (many outside the state) who wanted statehood and more Federal 
control.

Prohibitions over the use of psychotropics by Native Americans is another.
