Anyone's use of encryption for any purpose is beyond the means of any
state to control, this should have been obvious in 1992, but it seems
various states "missed the memo" and are now waking up (though they'll
always be asleep at the wheel)

http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html

I honestly think everyone will be better off as the people begin to
reclaim more of their ability to work together using new and
technological capabilities that are growing well beyond the capacity
of governmental systems that were popularized around the world in
systems that grew in popularity and "revolution-arity" approximately
226 years ago.  In other words, governments will be needed less and
less and we'll understand we need each other more and more.  It may
not be clear when governments will diminish (or disappear) and to what
extent that will happen, but I don't think obedience to them is
helpful at all.

Even so, with trustless systems, I still consider that for many
circumstances, "the relationship is the ultimate technology,"  though
one system or another we create may fail, we work together mindful of
the necessity to create new communities and systems that look forward.
