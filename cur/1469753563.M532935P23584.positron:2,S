>American foreign policy “just by running for president.” She said
>defeating Trump would represent a defeat for Putin and the Russians.
>
>  “Putin is eager to see Trump win, and that should worry every

>Secretary of Hate
>
>The damage inflicted by Albright when she was “Secretary of Hate,” as
>Bob Djurdjevic ( http://www.srpska-mreza.com/library/facts/Mad.html )
>characterized her time at the State Department, is almost incalculable.
>
>In 1998, as Bill Clinton unleashed cruise missiles on Iraq, murdering
>dozens of civilians in response to Saddam Hussein thumbing his nose at
>the United Nations, Albright declared: “If we have to use force, it is
>because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall.
>We see farther into the future.”
>
>In 2013, she admitted the bombing of Yugoslavia by her boss was
>illegal,
>but decided it was fair. Clinton teamed up with NATO in 1999 and
>conducted 38,400 sorties, including 10,484 strike sorties, in a terror
>bombing campaign that lasted 78 days and destroyed infrastructure,
>commercial buildings, schools, health institutions, media houses and
>cultural monuments.
>
>In addition to convincing Clinton to bomb Yugoslavia with depleted
>uranium and cluster munitions to force Slobodan Milošević to sign the
>Rambouillet peace accord, she pushed to send US troops to Bosnia,
>according to the recollection of then Chairman of Joint Chiefs of
>Staff,
>Colin Powell.
>
>Hillary Clinton celebrated the illegal attack. In October 2000, The New
>York Times (
>http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/03/hillarys_war.html )
>reported Clinton “cited American involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo as
>examples of foreign engagements she favored on moral and strategic
>grounds.” Clinton urged her husband to bomb Yugoslavia without
>congressional approval and said what “do we have NATO for if not to
>defend our way of life?”
>
>NATO also defended the way of life of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
>terrorist gang of ethnic Albanian separatists. The KLA effort for an
>independent Kosovo supported by Albright and the United States
>encouraged similar terrorist groups in the Balkans, the Middle East,
>and
>Russia. The Kosovo precedent was responsible for inspiring Chechen
>terrorists in Russia and the murder of scores of Russian citizens.
>
>
>Career Achievement: 500,000 Dead Children
>
>Albright’s crowning achievement, however, was the murder of half a
>million Iraqi children under a brutal and medieval sanctions regime
>imposed on the country by the United States and the United Nations.
>
>  “We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean,
>  that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the
>  price worth it?” asked Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes asked Albright in
>  1996.
>  
>  “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the
>  price is worth it,” Albright responded.
>
>On Tuesday, the war criminal Albright warmed up the crowd for Bill
>Clinton, described at the time of the Yugoslavia bombing raid by Edward
>Herman as the world’s “leading active war criminal.”
>
>The crowd was clueless about the magnitude of the crimes committed—and
>those to be committed if Hillary Clinton wins. The corporate media once
>again failed to note the complicity of Albright and Clinton in mass
>murder and crimes against humanity, preferring instead to dwell on the
>alleged DNC hacking by Vladimir Putin, an accusation without definitive
>evidence that is now passed off as a fait accompli.
