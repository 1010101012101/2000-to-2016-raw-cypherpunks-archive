Around a year ago a small private jet lost contact over the US.  A jet
was
dispatched, saw iced windows, no response to signals.  The plane was on
autopilot, eventually crashed
in the middle of nowhere.  The passengers/pilot are believed to have
passed out
from anoxia.  (The autopilot kept them at high altitude too!)

When that trucker kamakazi'd into the state capital in Sacramento last
year, they decided to put Jersey barriers
up.  Hard to do that in the air (Blimps with nets?)
