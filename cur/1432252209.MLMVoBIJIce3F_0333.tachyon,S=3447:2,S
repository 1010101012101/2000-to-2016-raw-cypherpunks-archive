Note too that many of the detained may not have lawyers.  Most of them are 
not being held on criminal charges.  They are held as material witnesses or 
on immigration holds.  I don't know if a material witness has a right to an 
attorney but immigration offenses are civil not criminal matters (in most 
cases) and thus the prisoners have to pay for their own lawyers which means 
that those who have no money have to find lawyers and convince them to work 
for free and to spend their own money chasing their clients around the 
country as they are moved.
