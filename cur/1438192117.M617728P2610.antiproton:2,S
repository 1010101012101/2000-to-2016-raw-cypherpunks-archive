That's the way things were about 25 or so years ago.  Wafers with photoresist =
were exposed with machines using UV, which over the years used ever-decreasing =
 wavelengths of UV, in equipment:436. 365nm, and 248nm, eventually reaching =
193 nanometer UV.  In the 1970's, entire wafer-masks (which covered the entire =
wafer) were used.  This became impractical as feature-sizes were reduced.  =
Step-and-repeat devices ("wafer-steppers) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper =
  then allowed exposure of a much smaller portion of a wafer.  (these eventually =
used mirrors, rather than lenses, because it is hard to process UV in a solid =
lens.)   
 
However, because the wavelength of light eventually became a large portion =
of the size of a chip feature (a line or a space) it was increasingly difficult =
to 'draw' the picture necessary to expose the resist on the wafer.  Due to =
many ever-more-heroic technologies, it eventually became possible to use 293 =
nanometer wavelength to expose features far smaller than the wavelength itself, =
which would have been considered phenomenal in the 1970's.  
These days, EUV ("extreme ultraviolet") has been used for ever more small features. =
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography   EUV is strongly =
absorbed by air, so such exposure is typically done in a vacuum.

None that I'm aware of.  But EUV will take over from electron-beam:  The latter =
is quite slow, and typically has been used mostly for making masks.
