Teamwork is essential here.

Maybe attract a lightning with a rocket on a wire[1], the induced current 
will do the job with the sensors around. Optionally annoy the sensors with 
spurious alarms until they get written off as unreliable[2]. Keep 
disabling the technicians that come to check/repair them[3], until the 
base staff either runs out of technicians or writes off the sensors. 
Technology can be a strength, but overreliance on it is a weakness.

[1] I believe lightning researchers do this, in addition to having labs on 
tops of skyscrapers. See eg. <http://bat.nmt.edu/galeski/>.

[2] US agents did it with sugar pellets shot at the windows of the 
Russian embassy in Washington, DC, during the thunderstorms that are 
frequent there. The vibration sensors were causing false alarms, so they 
were disconnected. Then one night the agents successfully penetrated the 
object. Same with rebels in Afghanistan attacking Russian bases. (Bruce 
Schneier, Beyond Fear, page 56:
<http://www.granneman.com/personal/commonplacebook/security/bruceschneiersbeyondfear.htm>)

[3] I think it was used during WW2. The comm wires were cut, then the 
soldier dispatched to check the failure was ambushed. Used frequently by 
guerrillas fighting Germans in the mountains.

> one to handle the landmines,

Optionally just add couple more mines and then wait.[4]

[4] As a classic joke says. A farmer had a pumpkin field. Neighbourhood 
boys were stealing them. One day, he put up a sign: "One of the pumpkin is 
laced with cyanide." In the evening, he found scribbled there: "Now they 
are two".

History books are full of prior art.

Or just drive a remotely controlled tank in.

Or modify the strategy. As Sun Tzu says, the best battles are the ones won 
without fighting.

It would be closer to a LARP.

The best fun often has the highest price.

Don't worry. Look at the Iraq Desert Adventure planning stage. Who needs a 
post-victory plan?
