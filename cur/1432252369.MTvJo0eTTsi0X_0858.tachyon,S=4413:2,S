Yes, but what this thread has ignored is that gold (and other
densely precious things) were valued *in and of themselves* and so 
using them as money was not symbolic.  You traded your goat
for a goat's worth of gold; if trust evaporated overnight
the gold is still worth something.  Similarly with barrels
of oil.  If you discover a lot of it under your topsoil, you
get wealth because the substance itself has utility.

Clearly stated.
