Also included in the new offering is a residentia| standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no external power and works perfectly with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|| forwarding to any cel| phone or regu|ar phone with remote dial-out (cellular bridging capabi|ity).
