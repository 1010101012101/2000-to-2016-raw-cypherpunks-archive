Well, like I said, (and to be completely pedantic about it :-)), it
seems to me that logically there's no such thing as an "anonym" even
though you could do pseudonymous things that are, prima facie, and
probably functionally, anonymous.

The closest thing might be a string of single-use keys, pseudonyms,
as we've said, or, in the "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" of motel register fame
(or user "cypherpunks", password "writecode"), everyone using the
same key, to using a key, or name as we (and now a dictionary
somewhere, though my spell-check dictionary flags it :-)), have also
said, is to create an *alternate* name or key for yourself, which is,
by definition, a pseudonym, even if it is used once, and unlinked to
any other event somehow.


And, to throw a curve into the whole discussion, there's also the
"fist" everyone uses on the net, like the fist that people had when
keying Morse Code. Or, more recently, the words, syntax, semantics,
"concordance", whatever, that they use when writing or talking. That
stuff has has been used in literature -- to apparent lesser effect
more recently with Shakespeare, and to greater effect with Joel
Klien, for instance. Or the way we buy or things in an electronic
market, or by mousing around the web. That kind of stuff, as Carl
Ellison has noted, is probably as good a biometric as there might
ever be, given enough data, so certainly a persistent pseudonym can't
be anonymous in the sense of unlinked behavior to itself. Frankly,
since we still live in a world of physical IP addresses, and
apparently, given the ZKS experience, a still uneconomical way of
mixing those addresses, traffic analysis, as usual, is still quite a
bitch.

Only when we can change the economics of pseudonymity will we have
anything approaching anonymity, in other words. If it's cheaper to do
things anonymously -- especially financial things, which are at the
core of most traceable, most linkable, literally "accountable",
"transparent" activity, right now -- then we'll get closer and closer
to anonymity.


So, maybe there isn't such a "thing" as an anonym, even though we
know what anonymity is. We can make generalizations about anonymity
all the time. The ultimate generalization being that anonymity, like
security and cryptography themselves, is more of an economic
asymptote than anything else. Something like perfection; as Anselm
said in trying to prove the existence of God before the concept of
calculus and limits would have shown him the error of his ways :-),
something that we can conceive in our mind, if not actually see in
reality. We can probably get close enough to be free, however, even
in a world of ubiquitous optical supervision of private property.
Dramatically freer than we are now, certainly, which is all that
matters.

Cheers,
RAH
