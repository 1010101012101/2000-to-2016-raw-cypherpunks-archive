That would be this article by Declan McCullagh:

iPhones are so user friendly that they include pre-installed
forensic tools for their users in the LEA and DoD community:

OSX is also very friendly to users who might want to know about
every file ever downloaded by a Mac they have access to:

iTunes included a "defect" that LEAs used as a back door into user
systems for three years, per the UK Telegraph:

Apple owes it to their shareholders to market to the U.S.
Department of Defense, including participation in bidding on the
most powerful end user identification, tracking, surveillance,
manipulation and targeting platform that has ever been publicly
disclosed:

Apple markets its products as fashion accessories for Liberal Arts
majors; keeping the Apple brand's public image intact via a cost
effective Big Lie propaganda program is the least it can do for
its shareholders.
