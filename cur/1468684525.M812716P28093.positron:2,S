The purpose of cpunks is to host aggressive messages others
with thin skins, reputations, profits, ideologies and egos to protect
delete.

Which may explain why deleters appear absent here (many are ghosts)
but do lurk or have lurkers and protection agents watching for slightest
challenge, keeping lists for covert anonymized retribution -- for worst
offenses, extermination -- following the lead of nations and religions.

Moderated fora, Wikipedia the prime example, Tor a slight one, cannot
abide misbehavior or funding will be squeezed or shut down. Govs, NGOs.
coms, are moderated to assure survival of banality as cover for brutality.

Celebrity is moderation, and might be better called tampering.
