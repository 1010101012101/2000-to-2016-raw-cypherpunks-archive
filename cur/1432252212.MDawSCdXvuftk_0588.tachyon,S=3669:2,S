The operator of Plum Island Animal Disease Center,
LB&B Associates, is a facilities manager firm which has
contracts with the USG for numerous operations around
the nation. In addition to the Plumb Island facility, it operates 
an unidentified federal facility in Trenton, NJ, the reported 
origin of several of the anthrax letters.

It holds government contracts for "hot" facilities for viral 
research, claiming extensive experience with up to Level 3 
facilities and is under consideration as operator of Plum Island's
upgrade to Level 4 for research on human-animal viruses.

A Plum Island job ad says "many employees live in 
Connecticut and take the ferry from New London to 
Orient Point, NY" from which a Center boat goes to 
the island. The most recent anthrax death occurred a 
few miles from New London, CT.

The firm as had several labor relations problems such as
employee suits and unionization squabbles. It is fiercely
anti-union according to one report. Another report claims
it has continuing labor problems which has led to being
downgraded in government bids.

The firm also produces virtual military training programs
in urban warfare and aircraft operation. It received a lot of
press coverage for adopting and adapting Tom Clancy's 
Rainbow Six Rogue Spear game engine for military training 
programs.

The firm also operates military helicopter facilities and
services the aircraft.

LB&B stands for Lily Brandon and Brandon, the founder and
a relative.
