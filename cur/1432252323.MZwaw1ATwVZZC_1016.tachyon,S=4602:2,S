I have given you the exact source with quote a dozen times, and each time 
you simply lie about my words.

Here it is, yet again:

Distortions at Fourth Hand
Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman
The Nation, June 25, 1977

: : 	such journals as the Far Eastern Economic Review , the
: : 	London Economist , the Melbourne Journal of Politics , and
: : 	others elsewhere, have provided analyses by highly
: : 	qualified specialists who have studied the full range of
: : 	evidence available, and who concluded that executions have
: : 	numbered at most in the thousands; that these were
: : 	localized in areas of limited Khmer Rouge influence and
: : 	unusual peasant discontent, where brutal revenge killings
: : 	were aggravated by the threat of starvation resulting from
: : 	the American destruction and killing. These reports also
: : 	emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides
: : 	during the civil war (provoked by the American attack) and
: : 	repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false

So tell us, where were these discoveries that the massacre reports were 
false?  Who discovered them to be false, and how?

Nothing that Chomsky and Herman claim in the above is true, but the most 
important claim, and the most straightforward lie, is "repeated discoveries 
that the massacre reports were false."
