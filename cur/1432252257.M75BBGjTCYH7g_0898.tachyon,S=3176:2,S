True enough. In a free society, this is my choice.

Any "special consideration" mandated by Men with Guns is, of course, 
wrong. Those pushing such laws have, of course, earned killing.

A "public event" at a _publically-owned_ venue, no.

A "public event" at a _privately-owned_ venue, yes. See above.

The confusion you show derives from your careless use of "public 
event." At all privately-owned venues, there is no meaning to the 
term "public event."

Millions who have argued otherwise, and used guns to support their 
views, need to be liquidated.
