https://www.justsecurity.org/28343/fbi-stop-undermining-norms-root/

Reports surfaced last month suggesting that Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has been helping
<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/11/did_carnegie-me.html>
the FBI crack Tor, the secure browsing application used by
privacy-conscious Internet users for both legal and illegal activities.
Normally, an academic institution assisting law enforcement in fighting
crime wouldn=E2=80=99t raise any eyebrows, particularly if that assistanc=
e came
in the form of responding to subpoenas. But this isn=E2=80=99t your avera=
ge
case. Beyond the complicated (and unclear) set of facts involved, CMU
houses the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC), one of the world=E2=80=99s most important hubs for coordinatin=
g
information about various cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.

More than a month after the news first broke, the details are murky at
best. Tor has alleged
<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/did-fbi-pay-university-attack-tor-users=
>
that the FBI paid CMU to crack the system=E2=80=99s anonymity feature in
exchange for payment. CMU=E2=80=99s own statement
<https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/november/media-statement.=
html>
about the incident says that many of the media reports have been
inaccurate, but acknowledges that the university =E2=80=94 and by extensi=
on
CERT/CC =E2=80=94 complies with valid subpoenas that it receives (as it m=
ust).
It also said that it receives =E2=80=9Cno funding for compliance.=E2=80=9D=
 The FBI has
said
<http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/11/18/fbi-cmu-tor-millio=
n-dollar-payment-innacurate/>
that reports on the payment are inaccurate, but stopped short of saying
no payment was made. And Tor has responded
<http://www.wired.com/2015/11/carnegie-mellon-denies-fbi-paid-for-tor-bre=
aking-research/>
by saying that these vague responses raise a whole host of questions on
their own.

The public saga leading up to the recent accusations began in July 2014,
when Ed Felten, the then-director of Princeton=E2=80=99s Center for Infor=
mation
Technology Policy, noted
<https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/why-were-cert-researchers-atta=
cking-tor/>
that CERT/CC researchers at CMU had submitted a presentation abstract to
organizers of the Black Hat security conference discussing a new
vulnerability they had found in Tor. The timing of CERT/CC=E2=80=99s pitc=
h to
Black Hat aligned with a large-scale attack on Tor that lasted from
January to July 2014, during which CERT/CC researchers shared only
=E2=80=9Chints=E2=80=9D about the vulnerability they had discovered. As f=
or the
abstract, it was abruptly withdrawn in July when CMU failed to approve
the content of the talk for public release.

Eyebrows were again raised in January 2015, after the arrest
<http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/did-feds-mount-a-sustained-at=
tack-on-tor-to-decloak-crime-suspects/>
of a man who allegedly helped run Silk Road 2.0, a large online trading
post on the dark web whose visitors often use Tor to access the site. At
the time, some speculated that his arrest was tied to the attack against
Tor in the first half of 2014.

Most recently, in mid-November, Tor accused CMU of accepting payment and
assisting the FBI =E2=80=94 in ways that indicate a warrant was not invol=
ved =E2=80=94
to =E2=80=9Cattack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift =
through
their data to find people.=E2=80=9D These allegations are hugely problema=
tic for
CERT/CC. As an entity that espouses <http://www.cert.org/about/> to be
=E2=80=9Ca trusted, authoritative organization dedicated to improving the=

security of computer systems and networks,=E2=80=9D finding and not discl=
osing
vulnerabilities is a good way to undermine that trust. Exploiting those
vulnerabilities is even worse.

But let=E2=80=99s take a step back for a moment. Why, beyond the obvious =
privacy
concerns raised by Tor, is this such a big deal?

CERT/CC, and indeed the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
community as a whole
<https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/csirt-basics-for-pol=
icy-makers/>,
is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is another term often used
to describe the type of organization CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are
responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer
security incident reports from a set of clients, which can include
government agencies, private companies, security researchers, and
ordinary Internet users.

Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a major
coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as result, it has
access to a wide array of incident information and vulnerabilities,
which could, hypothetically, be used to help crack Tor=E2=80=99s anonymit=
y
feature. In addition, the organization =E2=80=94 initially funded as a DA=
RPA
project and still funded <http://www.cert.org/faq/> with federal money =E2=
=80=94
is largely transnational in nature and serves as the secretariat for
national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are distributed across the globe.=


CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions as a key
component in efforts to build global capacity to combat cybersecurity
threats and develop norms of behavior among nations in the cyber realm.
For example, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
cybersecurity suggested
<http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=3DA/70/174> this summer
that special teams authorized to respond to cybersecurity incidents,
such as CSIRTs, should not be used to =E2=80=9Cengage in malicious intern=
ational
activity=E2=80=9D and should not be the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are =
to be
held out as off limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, the Red
Cross <http://time.com/3713226/red-cross-cyberspace/>) and cannot be
political actors, lest they become legitimate targets.

CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect information
that can be very useful for both identifying and capturing criminals.
They rely heavily
<https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/csirt-basics-for-pol=
icy-makers/>
on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability researchers have in
the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after developing close ties with the
constituencies they serve. When a CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored,
to be acting in a way that is negligent or undermines network security
of perfectly legal services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust
means less information for CSIRTs.

To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest story
undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out its own duties
and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is often not explicit in
documentation, a relationship between CSIRTs and law enforcement
agencies is often assumed. Indeed, such cooperation can be helpful for
both law enforcement and CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important
technical information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps
law enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the flipside,
some industries (particularly in the US) have close relationships with
law enforcement that result in law enforcement becoming an important
reporter of incidents to the CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are
to have close working relationships, they should follow explicit and
transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the FBI is
engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of Internet security
en masse, it is making its own life more difficult down the line by
removing the legitimacy of a key ally in cyber criminal investigations.

To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with law
enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues Isabel Skierka,
Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in our recent report
<https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/11916-national-csirts-and-thei=
r-role-in-computer-security-incident-response/CSIRTs-incident-response_11=
-2015.d66cfc29c2d642258110859b27a649b1.pdf>,
cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement is not necessarily a bad
thing. A comprehensive approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally
meld the technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in agencies
like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs actually sit within
law enforcement, intelligence, or national security organizations or
have formal liaisons with those agencies.

Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that CSIRTs
have reached a point in their maturity where a formal, transparent
relationship with law enforcement is practicable. This is because the
quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has pervaded the American
intelligence community for decades: Some activities simply do not pass
the front-page test; meaning that some actions, when they come to light,
will hurt the reputation of the organization. As New America
Cybersecurity Fellow and Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire wrote
earlier this year
<https://www.newamerica.org/new-america/the-declining-half-life-of-secret=
s/>,
the half-life of secrets is diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC=E2=
=80=99s
with the FBI are likely to become known much sooner than they would in
the past. For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government secret
will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their reputations
once they come to light.

The news of CMU=E2=80=99s possible assistance in compromising Tor=E2=80=99=
s most
critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for many to attack
the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at the Software Engineering
Institute. Bruce Schneier
<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/11/did_carnegie-me.html>
and others
<http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/11/why-tor-attack-matters.h=
tml>
have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or at least
greatly diminished) CERT/CC=E2=80=99s hard-earned reputation as an honest=

broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs around the world
that they should transparently define their relationships with law
enforcement agencies.

Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this particular
instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in the CSIRT
community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical teams are
undergoing a process of politicization. National level CSIRTs, many of
which once resided outside of government in academic institutions and
non-governmental organizations, are being pulled into government
structures. At the same time, their relationships with law enforcement
agencies are becoming closer and (to those outside of the agencies) more
opaque.

What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of these
important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The recommendations
we outline in our report provide a roadmap:

  * The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse the
    recent trend and /not/ place them under the control of law
    enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such agencies are
    incentivized to use the tools at their disposal to investigate
    crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat groups, and thus will
    often disregard the apolitical information coordination role CSIRTs
    play.

  * Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently define
    the terms of their cooperation, including how and under what
    circumstances they interact. They should also clearly define what
    kinds of information and expertise are exchanged and what
    direction(s) shared information flows.

  * Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must clarify their
    mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT has placed remediating
    damage from incidents and returning systems to operation as top
    priorities. Is this still the case, or is CSIRT expertise being
    poured into combating cybercrime and assisting law enforcement
    agencies in developing tools and methods to discover criminals?

Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the report, to
recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC=E2=80=99s mission and rol=
e needs
to be clearly defined by the organization itself, its funders, its
partners, and its constituency. Is it essentially a second US national
CSIRT alongside the Department of Homeland Security=E2=80=99s US-CERT
<https://www.us-cert.gov/>, or is it something closer to a private CSIRT
that plays a role in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a
global, non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors =E2=80=94 =
both
inside and outside the US =E2=80=94 is all the more important.

In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals at
CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat understandable. Their
overarching goal is to secure computer systems. The traditional CSIRT
approach focuses on technical identification and remediation of
incidents, in addition to promoting technical measures to protect
systems from attacks in the first place. The goal of law enforcement
bodies in cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
from taking place by rounding up the likely and past perpetrators. That
aligns with the CSIRT community=E2=80=99s goal. But the allegations of th=
e
researchers=E2=80=99 work (the cybersecurity applicability of which is du=
bious
at best) to crack Tor demonstrate the damage that can be done when when
a CSIRT=E2=80=99s interaction with law enforcement is not openly and stri=
ctly
governed.

The controversy surrounding this story represents something much larger
than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be apolitical actors
concentrating on computer and network security. The ramifications of
politicization and muddied mandates could permeate up to states=E2=80=99 =
efforts
to develop international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those
outlined
<https://ccdcoe.org/2015-un-gge-report-major-players-recommending-norms-b=
ehaviour-highlighting-aspects-international-l-0.html>
by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the integrity and
independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining these norms before they
take root, the FBI, and by extension the US government, undermine their
own efforts to promote an open and secure cyberspace through norms for
responsible state behavior.

          as a whole</a>, is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is
        another term often used to describe the type of organization
        CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are responsible for receiving,
        reviewing, and responding to computer security incident reports
        from a set of clients, which can include government agencies,
        private companies, security researchers, and ordinary Internet
        users.</p>
      <p>Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a
        major coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as
        result, it has access to a wide array of incident information
        and vulnerabilities, which could, hypothetically, be used to
        help crack Tor=E2=80=99s anonymity feature. In addition, the
        organization =E2=80=94 initially funded as a DARPA project and <a=

          href=3D"http://www.cert.org/faq/">still funded</a> with federal=

        money =E2=80=94 is largely transnational in nature and serves as =
the
        secretariat for national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are
        distributed across the globe.</p>
      <p>CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions
        as a key component in efforts to build global capacity to combat
        cybersecurity threats and develop norms of behavior among
        nations in the cyber realm. For example, the United Nations
        Group of Governmental Experts on cybersecurity <a
          href=3D"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=3DA/70/=
174">suggested</a>
        this summer that special teams authorized to respond to
        cybersecurity incidents, such as CSIRTs, should not be used to
        =E2=80=9Cengage in malicious international activity=E2=80=9D and =
should not be
        the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are to be held out as off
        limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, <a
          href=3D"http://time.com/3713226/red-cross-cyberspace/">the Red
          Cross</a>) and cannot be political actors, lest they become
        legitimate targets.</p>
      <p>CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect
        information that can be very useful for both identifying and
        capturing criminals. They <a
href=3D"https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/csirt-basics-=
for-policy-makers/">rely
          heavily</a> on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability
        researchers have in the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after
        developing close ties with the constituencies they serve. When a
        CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored, to be acting in a way that
        is negligent or undermines network security of perfectly legal
        services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust means less
        information for CSIRTs.</p>
      <p>To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest
        story undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out
        its own duties and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is
        often not explicit in documentation, a relationship between
        CSIRTs and law enforcement agencies is often assumed. Indeed,
        such cooperation can be helpful for both law enforcement and
        CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important technical
        information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps law
        enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the
        flipside, some industries (particularly in the US) have close
        relationships with law enforcement that result in law
        enforcement becoming an important reporter of incidents to the
        CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are to have close
        working relationships, they should follow explicit and
        transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the
        FBI is engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of
        Internet security en masse, it is making its own life more
        difficult down the line by removing the legitimacy of a key ally
        in cyber criminal investigations.</p>
      <p>To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with
        law enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues
        Isabel Skierka, Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in <a
href=3D"https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/11916-national-csirts-a=
nd-their-role-in-computer-security-incident-response/CSIRTs-incident-resp=
onse_11-2015.d66cfc29c2d642258110859b27a649b1.pdf">our
          recent report</a>, cooperation between CSIRTs and law
        enforcement is not necessarily a bad thing. A comprehensive
        approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally meld the
        technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
        developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in
        agencies like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs
        actually sit within law enforcement, intelligence, or national
        security organizations or have formal liaisons with those
        agencies.</p>
      <p>Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that
        CSIRTs have reached a point in their maturity where a formal,
        transparent relationship with law enforcement is practicable.
        This is because the quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has
        pervaded the American intelligence community for decades: Some
        activities simply do not pass the front-page test; meaning that
        some actions, when they come to light, will hurt the reputation
        of the organization. As New America Cybersecurity Fellow and
        Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire <a
href=3D"https://www.newamerica.org/new-america/the-declining-half-life-of=
-secrets/">wrote
          earlier this year</a>, the half-life of secrets is
        diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC=E2=80=99s with the FBI=
 are
        likely to become known much sooner than they would in the past.
        For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
        effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government
        secret will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their
        reputations once they come to light.</p>
      <p>The news of CMU=E2=80=99s possible assistance in compromising To=
r=E2=80=99s
        most critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for
        many to attack the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at
        the Software Engineering Institute. <a
href=3D"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/11/did_carnegie-me.ht=
ml">Bruce
          Schneier</a> and <a
href=3D"http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/11/why-tor-attack-ma=
tters.html">others</a>
        have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or
        at least greatly diminished) CERT/CC=E2=80=99s hard-earned reputa=
tion as
        an honest broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs
        around the world that they should transparently define their
        relationships with law enforcement agencies.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this
        particular instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in
        the CSIRT community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical
        teams are undergoing a process of politicization. National level
        CSIRTs, many of which once resided outside of government in
        academic institutions and non-governmental organizations, are
        being pulled into government structures. At the same time, their
        relationships with law enforcement agencies are becoming closer
        and (to those outside of the agencies) more opaque.</p>
      <p>What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of
        these important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The
        recommendations we outline in our report provide a roadmap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse
          the recent trend and <em>not</em> place them under the
          control of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such
          agencies are incentivized to use the tools at their disposal
          to investigate crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat
          groups, and thus will often disregard the apolitical
          information coordination role CSIRTs play.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently
          define the terms of their cooperation, including how and under
          what circumstances they interact. They should also clearly
          define what kinds of information and expertise are exchanged
          and what direction(s) shared information flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must
          clarify their mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT
          has placed remediating damage from incidents and returning
          systems to operation as top priorities. Is this still the
          case, or is CSIRT expertise being poured into combating
          cybercrime and assisting law enforcement agencies in
          developing tools and methods to discover criminals?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the
        report, to recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC=E2=80=99=
s
        mission and role needs to be clearly defined by the organization
        itself, its funders, its partners, and its constituency. Is it
        essentially a second US national CSIRT alongside the Department
        of Homeland Security=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"https://www.us-cert.gov=
/">US-CERT</a>,
        or is it something closer to a private CSIRT that plays a role
        in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a global,
        non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
        with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors =E2=
=80=94
        both inside and outside the US =E2=80=94 is all the more importan=
t.</p>
      <p>In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals
        at CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat
        understandable. Their overarching goal is to secure computer
        systems. The traditional CSIRT approach focuses on technical
        identification and remediation of incidents, in addition to
        promoting technical measures to protect systems from attacks in
        the first place. The goal of law enforcement bodies in
        cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
        from taking place by rounding up the likely and past
        perpetrators. That aligns with the CSIRT community=E2=80=99s goal=
=2E But
        the allegations of the researchers=E2=80=99 work (the cybersecuri=
ty
        applicability of which is dubious at best) to crack Tor
        demonstrate the damage that can be done when when a CSIRT=E2=80=99=
s
        interaction with law enforcement is not openly and strictly
        governed.</p>
      <p>The controversy surrounding this story represents something
        much larger than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be
        apolitical actors concentrating on computer and network
        security. The ramifications of politicization and muddied
        mandates could permeate up to states=E2=80=99 efforts to develop
        international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those <a
href=3D"https://ccdcoe.org/2015-un-gge-report-major-players-recommending-=
norms-behaviour-highlighting-aspects-international-l-0.html">outlined</a>=

        by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the
        integrity and independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining
        these norms before they take root, the FBI, and by extension the
        US government, undermine their own efforts to promote an open
        and secure cyberspace through norms for responsible state
        behavior.</p>
