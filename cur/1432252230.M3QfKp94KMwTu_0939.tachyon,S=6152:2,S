1) Insurance is a very profitable business.  I don't feel sorry for a
CEO of an insurance company making millions each year.  They can
afford to insure people that MAY develop certain conditions later in
life.

2) Notice the "MAY" above.  Insurance companies consider even the
slightest risk grounds for denying coverage.

3) Your food analogy above is flawed for several reasons.
   a) If Bob has as much money as everyone else, he will be sold the
   food.
   b) If Bob, on the other hand, has a genetic abnormality that could
   later lead to heart disease, he can be denied health coverage
   regardless of his ability to pay the premium.
   c) In the food example, charities, etc. can help Bob out.  In the
   insurance area, he has no such help to fall back on.

You haven't answered a single one of my emails without including a
personal attack of some sort.  You're being an asshole, and that's not
necessary.
