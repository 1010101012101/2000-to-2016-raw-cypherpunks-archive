Hum.  Zen pointed out that the language in question was not actually
in the article he posted, and I went and looked at it.

It's not exactly a stellar analysis, but the article does raise a very
real issue I have been keeping an eye on myself - to the point of
in-depth fact checking certain "debunking" assertions and finding them
to be bunk themselves:  Clinton did not "slip on ice" going up those
steps as shown in the Reuters photo, according to local weather
records for the day in question.  Why did her people find it necessary
to lie about that?

Is something seriously wrong with Hillary's brain, other than the
obvious psychosis?  I am about 90% confident that she is presenting
with intermittent symptoms of a serious neurological disorder,
possibly secondary to circulatory system problems.

That, or somebody has a voodoo doll that really works.
