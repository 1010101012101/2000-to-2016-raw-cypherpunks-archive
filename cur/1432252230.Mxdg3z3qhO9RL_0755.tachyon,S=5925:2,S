That idea had occurred to me--something solid state that could be rolled 
up, twisted around (somewhat), and stuck into some nook or cranny.

Remember that we're dealing with the testimony of techno-naive people.  
On the other hand, maybe all that the IRS gets is leftovers.

I was wondering that myself.

No doubt such a device could broadcast continuously for some time; however 
it would be difficult to hide from a determined, even if amateur, searcher.

It would make sense for the device to have a motion sensor built in.  The 
power it would require at rest to maintain a "sleep mode" would barely register 
on a VOM.

Kind of tough.  I've been thinking in terms of embedding various silent 
tamper sensors.

Considering that he'd just taken CJ's computer, I wonder if he didn't deserve 
it.

The one thing that has struck me about this case is how many of Jim Bell's 
computers have been seized over the years and not returned.  Even computers 
which federal agents testified in court were not used by Bell.

Bell's parents use email themselves, so the seizure of all the computers 
not only targets Jim, it deprives his innocent parents of access.

Collateral damage, I suppose.
