Goddamnit, Jim can't stop poking sticks into his own fucking cage.

And, having dodged the first shell he fires at his own head..

He promptly checks the barrel to see if it's obstructed, and seeing
it glimmering with clean, oils waiting to gently guide that last lead
pellet down the metal ravine, he repositions his weapon, and...

Fires again:

This time, he connects, and the Court, sitting in it's ever present 
omniscience, helps guide Jim to the floor as he implodes:

And, of course, since he will be relased in two years without further 
supervision, the State needs to be absolutely CERTAIN he won't be causing 
any further troubles over issues that "don't need airing":

The fake facade of "support" is withdrawn as an artifice no longer 
necessary, and;

> Judgment Signed Defendant remanded to custody. (JAB) 

I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but still, this is fucked. Jeff is no 
doubt laughing his merry little federally subsidized ass off in his little 
rathole cubicle of illusory "power".
