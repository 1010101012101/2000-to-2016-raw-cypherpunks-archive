In Code: a Mathematical Journey, Sarah Flannery
with David Flannery, Workman Publishing, New York, 2001

  http://www.workman.com/

"Sarah Flannery is a fun, sports-loving teenager from County 
Cork, Ireland. She also happens to be an award-winning 
mathematician whose discoveries in Internet cryptography 
have garnered international acclaim. Both the story of 
Sarah's mathematical development and her own self-discovery, 
In Code is a warm, inspiring look at how she, equipped with 
a burning curiosity and the active support of her family, 
became a leading mathematician at the age of 16."
