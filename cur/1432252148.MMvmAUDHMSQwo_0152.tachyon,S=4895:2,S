A different issue. I have no idea if the current premiums are too low, 
too high, or about right. My point was to cite the ready availability of 
St. Gaudens (and also the less artistic Liberty) gold pieces in the 
1960s, and presumably earlier, as strong evidence that such coins did 
not have to be smuggled away to Europe or hidden. They were, all 
indications point out, exempted by the numismatic exemption.

Yeah, so? That's precisely why owning such coins is a numismatic issue.

Sounds like you shouldn't do it, then. Which would be wise on your part, 
in my opinion.
