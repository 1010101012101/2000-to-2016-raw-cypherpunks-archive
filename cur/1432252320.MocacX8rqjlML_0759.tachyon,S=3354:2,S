Having been on the Underground this morning, I think I agree with you!

Are we talking about the trains, the stations or the tunnels? Or the
upholstery in the trains? Or what turns up in the vacuum cleaners of the
overnight crew who fix them up after someone else has already removed
all the dead McCrap?

Maybe the Chinese Whispers have blown up a boring statistic into
something silly.

OTOH  I know people who have sampled the air in underground stations for
spores and bacteria so on.  There are a lot of odd organisms down there
:-)
