I suggest that you're fooling yourself, or at least giving yourself a
false sense of security. Software today is so complex and large that
there is no way that you can be familiar with the vast bulk of what
you are running (and it's only going to get worse in the future). It
is an illusion that you have transparency into it. Water is
transparent but an ocean of it is opaque and holds many secrets.
