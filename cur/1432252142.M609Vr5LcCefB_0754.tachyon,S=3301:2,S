Hi everyone

I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686, x86_64 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced by
hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing
logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has
access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in
ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP or SCP.

Changelog:

This release addresses a heap overflow in tor which allows arbitrary
remote code execution. Tor was bumped to version 0.2.1.29 to address
CVE-2011-0427. Busybox was bumped to... 1.18.2 and the kernel to
2.6.32.28 plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-2.6.32-37.extras.
