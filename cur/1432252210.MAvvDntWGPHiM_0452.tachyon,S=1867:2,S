NYC Woman Dies in Botched Police Raid

NEW YORK -- A 57-year-old woman died of an
apparent heart attack Friday after police detonated a
flash grenade and handcuffed her during a raid on the
wrong apartment.

[ Note that a Judge issued a warrant based solely
on an informer ]

An informant said that Spruill's sixth-floor Harlem
apartment was being used by an armed drug dealer to
stash cocaine and heroin, police officials said.

After obtaining a search warrant, officers forced open
the woman's door and tossed in a flash grenade, which
creates a distraction by producing a loud noise and a
blinding flash of light. Kelly said the grenade was used
because it was believed there may have been guns and
a dog in the apartment.
