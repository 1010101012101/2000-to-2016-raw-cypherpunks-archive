The obvious starting market for good ecash is perverse 
pornography.  Another good starting market is interactive sexual 
performance over the internet.

There have been many attempts at ecash, but I am not aware of any products 
involving useful, spendable, convenient, anonymous ecash targeted at that 
or similar markets.  The only really usable anonymous ecash was that of the 
Mark Twain bank, which crippled its cash to prevent it from being used by 
that market.
