The US government, US media, and the American populace seemed to have 
created a bizarre little symbiosis for themselves. It now goes like this:

An incident occurs, real or "could be real, really soon", manufactured by 
the media.
Two people on 34th and 8th indicate on newscamera that they are scared and 
don't feel secure.
Media reports on how people are not secure.
Government leaders see media report on how "people are scared" and perform 
security-enhancing activites, including overseas.
Overeseas, or at home, "an incident occurs"...

And so on. Soon I'll install a security camera in th' crapper to make sure 
no terrorists get me while I'm on the can.
