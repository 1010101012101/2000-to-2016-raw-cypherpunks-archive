Perhaps not less tolerant, but certainly more dangerous: by having
government as its enforcer.  This is why folks are disturbed by the
lawsuits against NAMBLA and the like.  Not that most of us have any
use for them or their philosophy, but that the folks suing them are
in effect using the power of government to "beat them up".
