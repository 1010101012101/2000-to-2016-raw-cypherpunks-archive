Unarmed man killed by New York police during counterfeiting raid

New York-AP -- In New York, police are looking into the shooting of an 
unarmed African immigrant by a plainclothes police officer.
The immigrant, Ousmane Zango (ooz-mahn ZHAHN'-goh), was shot four times 
after a winding chase through the hallways of a storage unit in Chelsea.

The plainclothes police officer had been guarding counterfeit merchandise 
down the hall from Zango's unit.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly says two storage rooms had recently been 
raided by Staten Island officers investigating a compact disc 
counterfeiting operation. But Zango had no connection to that operation and 
no criminal record.
