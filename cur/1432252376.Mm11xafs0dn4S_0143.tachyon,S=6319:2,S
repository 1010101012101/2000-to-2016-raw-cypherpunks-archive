Don't Let the RIAA Put the Net at Risk!

Tell the FTC that the Internet is Peer to Peer, It is Ours, and
We Intend to Keep It!


Please forward this notice to any other concerned parties you may
know.


Please tell the FTC not to allow a few rich cartels and
monopolies such as the RIAA, MPAA and Microsoft to put the
Internet at risk:
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/filesharing/comments.htm


What's Going On:

The FTC has issued a call for participation announcing a workshop
on "P2P Filesharing" technology to take place in Washington, DC
this December 15th and 16th.

An RIAA-sponsored CapAnalysis paper submitted to the FTC, calls
for an investigation of "P2P Filesharing" applications for
deceptive practices that affect the privacy and security of
users, subjecting them to such risks as adware, viruses, exposure
to undesirable material, impairments of computer function, and
last but not least, liability to charges of copyright
infringement. Congress is also calling the FTC to investigate
these products.

We call all those who know the Internet is a common good, who
make productive use of it and who develop applications for it as
a regular part of their daily lives, to join us in telling the
FTC what the real sources of these risks are.

Please tell the FTC not to allow a few rich cartels and
monopolies such as the RIAA, MPAA and Microsoft to put the
Internet at risk:
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/filesharing/comments.htm


Get On the Bus!

We are organizing a caravan of concerned citizens to travel to
the nation's capital and defend our rights and powers against the
RIAA, the MPAA and Microsoft.

When we arrive:

    * We will call the FTC to protect Internet users by acting
against a few rich cartels and monopolies that impede innovation
and access to robust solutions, choice, transparency and control.

    * We will call the FTC to focus their attention on the real
sources of the risks in question, and to respond to them
appropriately.

    * We will pose the question to the FTC of how they can
distinguish the applications they have selected for consideration
at this workshop from the multitude of applications of the
Internet and the ordinary functions of operating systems now in
use on millions of interconnected desktops across the planet.

    * We will press the FTC to explain what risks are actually
unique to the applications they have singled out.

    * We will call the FTC to separate copyright matters from
consideration of the private interests of computer owners.

    * We will call the FTC to refer copyright policy to the
appropriate body, the United States Congress.


Please submit comments to the FTC here:

Please contact us to let us know you will join us in this action
and to offer your assistance with travel, lodging and sustenance:
