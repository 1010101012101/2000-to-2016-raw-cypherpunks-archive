"Neither is the United States, of course, where US citizens are free to join 
the
Israeli army, and commit atrocities in the illegally occupied territories, 
but
face prison for "terrorism" if they support the oppressed Palestinians and 
play
paintball with their friends on weekends."

No real argument here.

Moreover, if I "support" (even if only verbally) Palestinian control over 
Israel, I'm "Anti Semitic" even though the Palestinians are semites, and the 
Ashkenazi only marginally semitic (they LOOK awfully European to me).*

However, I doubt I'll go to jail...now. If Bush gets re-elected, then who 
knows.

As for Germany, for me at least the same government that's forbidding 
swastikas today in an effort to eliminate "hate" may one day utilize that 
same power to warp & weave official history (like in Japan and their antics 
in China from 37 to 45), and all of a sudden everyone is seeing terrorists 
everywhere who are trying to "steal our freedoms", rather than understanding 
that if 10 men with families gave their lives to kill 3000 of us, it's at 
least fair to say that they're rather upset about SOMETHING...

At the same time, remember that the Holocaust happened in Germany. And if 
you were German and realized that your own father was at least partially 
responsible for baking hundreds of Jews, well...let's just say that would 
probably weird you out a bit.

* I'd note that some of the most outspoken "Anti semites" in this category 
happen to be Jewish: Bobby Fisher, Noam Chomsky, Michael Albert and others.
