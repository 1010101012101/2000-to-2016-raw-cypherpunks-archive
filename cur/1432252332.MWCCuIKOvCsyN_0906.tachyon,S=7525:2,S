Dear Snap Member,

We're excited to let you know that Snap.com is being enhanced and 
renamed

and
we'll continue to improve and fine-tune our services in the coming weeks
and months.

Check out http://orders.nbci.com/nbcis0913h
To create NBCi.com, we have taken the best features from Snap.com,
combined them with the best features from our sister site XOOM.com and
added hot information & entertainment content from NBC.

How does this affect you?


If you have personalized services under MySnap  (stock portfolio,
horoscope, weather, etc), all of your information is still available via
the same member name and password.  This area is now called MyNBCi.

the weeks and months ahead.  However, we'll still offer our best-known
services and continue to improve upon them.

What you will find on NBCi:

     you most:  News, Personal Finance, Travel, Shopping, Health,
     Technology, Entertainment and more!
