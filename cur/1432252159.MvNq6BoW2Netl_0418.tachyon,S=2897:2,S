Well, the cats out of the bag as far as the math goes.  If you want to 
communicate "securely" you can.  The problem is you have to go all the way 
over to full black ops mode to do it if key escrow (or whatever) is 
finally (re)instated.  No more of this "well my shell connection is over 
SSL and I access my dev wiki with HTTPS blah blah ..." - it's all or 
nothing now.

And further, there's the whole "structuring" issue.  To be honest, the 
"structuring" movement in the prosecutorial world is scarier than key 
escrow ... the idea that your "transactions" can incriminate you not based 
on their actual content, but on your thoughts or motives at the time 
(highly subjective, of course) is very troublesome.

So don't worry about the math - we all know you can securely send it - 
it's the structuring (or equivalent) charge after the fact that should be 
worrisome.
