<CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><B>ELAST Technologies Secures Beta Site Installations of Bio-Potential Instrument</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>LAS VEGAS---April 2, 2001--ELAST Technologies, Inc., (OTCBB: ELTI) (<A HREF="http://www.elast.com">www.elast.com</A>) announced today that the Company has arranged several beta site installations of its Bio-Potential Instrument in prominent chiropractic offices. These installations will constitute the first significant ``real life'' use of ELAST's Bio-Potential Instrument and are planned to coincide with delivery of the initial units this Spring.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>The Bio-Potential Instrument is ELAST Technologies' chiropractic outcome-measuring instrument and is designed to objectively measure vertebral subluxations and the normalizing effect of chiropractic spinal adjustments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>``The installation of the Bio-Potential Instrument in the offices of practicing chiropractors is very exciting for ELAST,'' says Thomas F. Krucker, President and CEO of ELAST Technologies, Inc. ``Although our demonstrations generated great interest and enthusiasm in the chiropractic community these planned installations represent the first formal application of our technologies' measurement capabilities to actual treatment.'' According to Mr. Krucker the beta sites were selected for their interest in the product's overall success as well as their demonstrated commitment to their patients. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>ELAST Technologies also continues its work to perfect its allergy testing device, the Electronic Allergo Sensitivity Test or the ELAST Device(TM). The ELAST Device(TM) is a patented, non-invasive diagnostic tool that is being designed to accurately diagnose allergies, as well as food and chemical sensitivities, immediately without any of the pain or expense associated with currently employed allergy testing methods. </FONT></P>
