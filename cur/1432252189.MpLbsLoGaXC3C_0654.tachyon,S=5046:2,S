How much of that is PR is perhaps open to debate, but there are certainly
enough cases where their sadistic tendencies, as you say, have resulted in
significant damage to peoples lives without reason.

I can't comment on the suitability of Norton Ghost for the purpose of making
an image copy of a hard-disk, but the argument is specious at best.  If they
haven't got the procedures in place to assure the proper evidence handling in
that case and therefore need the hardware, then evidence gathered by covert
means (i.e., the copying of a `suspect's' data via either a black-bag job or
by way of tempest surveillance) is just as suspect.

And incidentally, it's obviously quite easy to install arbitrary files on
someone's computer in the same way that a crooked cop might `find' a bag of
cocaine in someone's bathroom.

The long and short of it is that they're obviously full of shit.

Which is probably a trivial task.  But these sorts of incidences are probably
simply harassment and intimidation.  Amusing, isn't it, that the people
nominally responsible for maintaining order and the safety of a country's
civilians are the ones who would cause just as much (or more) harm to their
citizenry than would a putative criminal.

Some would no doubt argue that such measures are the price of liberty.

Eh?
