Wow. Didn't even know that. But I'm not sure the cable-cutters have yet mapped
out the fiber rings and how they are interconnected, in order to make
appropriate cuts that will bring the traffic down (if that's actually their
goal). Sure, repairing cable cuts is expensive, but the cuts don't really have
any long-term impact.
