no, this setup is a kludge just to get me there. Proof of concept, and
next comes the transition to all Plan9-based hardware. Also, I am trying
to keep it to two physical pieces: the clump of geodes and a laptop, as I
plan to bring this to Usenix if anybody wants to see it (I hope there is a
Plan9 BOF ...)

The auth and terminal are on my IBM Thinkpad X24, and are the same vmware
image running under linux (i.e. my terminal is the auth/kfs server). The
CPU server is a Geode (Geode rhymes with: slow) board (Advantech PCM-5823)
running LinuxBIOS out of FLASH rom with 9load loaded onto a compact flash.

LinuxBIOS loads 9load from the compact flash. This has proven to be very
handy for debugging, as I can pop the CF out of the geode and put it in my
X24 if I need to fix 9load for anything.

The plan9 host is using host-only networking on vmnet1. The Geodes are on
eth0 (ether0 in Plan9 parlance). 9load DHCP requests don't make it across
the eth0->vmnet1 gap, so I have to run linux dhcpd.

Two other things I have to do: enable ipforwarding on the linux side so
that the geode packets get to the vmware image; and hard-wire the Linux
ARP tables for the Geode (more on that later).

9load comes up on the geode and sends dhcp requests. Linux responds with a
host name and IP address. 9load then loads the 9pccpu kernel from Linux,
and connects to the auth server running in vmware.

Here is an interesting problem. 9load gets its IP address but won't
respond to ARP requests, so the tftp load of 9pccpu can't happen as Linux
doesn't have an ARP entry for the geode. I assume on plan9 this is not an
issue, but I have to hardwire the ARP cache for the CPU server or nobody
can talk to it.

Also, there is no plan9.ini for the 9load to read, and for some reason I
still can't get environment variables from 9load to 9pccpu, so I have also
had to hard-wire environment variables in the 9pccpu kernel. So the 9pccpu
that 9load downloads from Linux has one or two mods to it :-)

Once the 9pccpu is loaded, it contacts the auth server in vmware, and from
there things are pretty straightforward, and up it comes.

There are mods to both 9load and 9pccpu.

9load cyrix interrupt routing code is completely busted (no shock there,
it's almost impossible to test this stuff unless you're using linuxbios)
and I have made some quick fixes to it to get it working. I just run the
many Geode devices (all 2 of them) at IRQ 9. There are a few other things
9load does that have proven to be dangerous in a non-bios environment and
I am trying to put together a patch set for possible acceptance by the
Plan 9 kernel folks.

The kernel itself doesn't have a huge number of changes, although again
there are IRQ routing issues and a few other things.

So, short story is, it all works, it's held together with gum and wire
right now, and the effort for the next month is to get it working more
smoothly and slowly rip out as many of my changes as I can. I may just put
9pccpu into the CF and dispense with 9load altogether, since 9load takes a
long time to get going and boot something.  But we'll see -- 9load is very
handy in many ways.

I plan to update the wiki with all this info next week.
