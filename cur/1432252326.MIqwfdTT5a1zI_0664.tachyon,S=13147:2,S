Good post.

I'm wondering if some of those lod satellite links or other technologies 
might not actually be used precisely for dumping a "dragnet" over to HQ for 
sifting. In face, didn't the government buy the old Iridium network?

What probably happens is that the government sends some commands into the 
PSTN (via that "emergency" channel) that drop-and-continue a TINY, 
carefully-selected fraction of a cities' traffic (probably pre-sifted using 
super-duper SAS analysis and whotnot), and then wirelessly transmits those 
calls to a series of sifters, the first several of which are probably 
computer-based, the last batch of which are human (probably a lot like a 
credit card operation).

However, it IS interesting to think about just what might fit into an AWAC 
or whatever these days, given 0.13 micron (or better...who knows?) ASICs. A 
single shelf of Cisco 15454 gear can pretty much do whatever you want to an 
OC-48, though you need more shelves in order to provide the COAX terminals 
for the DS1s encased therein.

Then again, in an AWAC they would have to send that OC-48 directly to some 
dedicated hardware to begin the winnowing process: looking for un 
provisioned lines, determining which lines have data, which voice, 
determinig which data is to/from ISPs,...etc...and then some SAS analysis to 
whittle it down to a small huntable set. Possibly an AWAC could handle 
several OC-48s provided there was some useful "hunting" criteria.

Hum. I think I'm convincing myself that an AWAC might actually be able to 
perform some interesting telecom reconaissance, depending on the 
application, but I'm fairly certain one of the functions is NOT to try to 
surreptitiously scan for radiation. Interesting traffic is almost certainly 
sent over to an uplink from somewhere in the ground.
