DAILY BRIEFING

NSA director could be in line for CIA deputy director post

By George Cahlink
gcahlink@govexec.com

The Central Intelligence Agency has been rocked in recent weeks by
changes brought by new director Porter Goss, and the shake-up could
continue with the appointment of a tough deputy director.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Goss was considering naming National
Security Agency Director Lt. Gen Michael Hayden to the agency's No. 2
slot. John McLaughlin, who served as acting CIA director this summer,
recently announced his retirement from the deputy director post.

Hayden has been one of NSA's most visible, powerful and, in some
quarters, controversial directors, as he has fought to reorganize the
signals intelligence agency. If he were tapped for the CIA slot, he'd
likely bring the same aggressive management style to the beleaguered
agency.

Goss served as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence before being nominated for the CIA job in August. In that
position, he conducted oversight of the NSA and worked closely with
Hayden to increase the agency's budget.

Hayden, who is NSA's longest-serving director, has been relentless in
pushing change at the intelligence agency since taking over in March
1999. He's asked longtime agency workers to retire to make way for new
hires, outsourced information technology work, expanded the pool of
contractors, raised the agency's profile, and consolidated leadership
ranks.

Few would argue that changes were not needed at an agency with a
veteran workforce trained and computer systems designed for the Cold
War. James Bamford, author of two best-selling books on the NSA,
credits Hayden with continuing to let veteran workers go even after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

"The people they had were people they did not need," said Bamford, who
noted that the agency had a surplus of Soviet analysts and linguists
but too few Middle East experts.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Boyd, now head of Business
Executives for National Security, who served with Hayden, said, "He
sold needed reforms to those with oversight and resources. He's
presided over a transition there from an institution geared toward the
Cold War into one for a new world with different technology."

Some NSA veterans however, have protested Hayden's moves.

"Coming to a place and telling a large group of well-qualified
professionals they need be cleaned out is not the way to change an
agency," said Michael Lavin, who worked at the agency from 1947 to
1993, first as an analyst and later as a policymaker and spokesman.
NSA veterans with obsolete skills should be retrained to prevent the
loss of corporate memory, Lavin argued.

Hayden earned praise for his efforts to expand the NSA's contracting
base and upgrade the agency's aging computer systems. In 2001, the
agency inked a $2 billion outsourcing deal with an industry team, led
by Computer Sciences Corp., to upgrade and run the agency's computer
operations over the next 10 years.

Congress, however, has not been happy with how the agency tracked its
spending. In 2004, the NSA lost its independent spending authority,
and its budget is now managed by Defense undersecretaries.

Steven Aftergood, an intelligence expert with the Federation of
American Scientists, noted that Hayden is one of the few intelligence
managers to escape blame for Sept. 11. "Everyone has been down on the
CIA," he said, "but NSA came through almost completely unscathed."
