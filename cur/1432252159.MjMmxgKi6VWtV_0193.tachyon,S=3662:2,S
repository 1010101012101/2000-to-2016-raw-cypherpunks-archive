               Alternative Physics - Tom Bearden's site

My fellow Cypherpunks,

   I've found a really interesting site based on alternative
physics.
http://www.cheniere.org - Tom Bearden's site.

   The site also deals with free energy, zero point energy, scalars,
health physics, alternate physics weapons, and mind control physics.

   Some of Bearden's interesting pages:

THE FINAL SECRET OF FREE ENERGY
http://www.cheniere.org/techpapers/final%secret%209%20feb%201993/index.html
- It may or may not be necessary to replace "%" with blanks.

ANNOTATED GLOSSARY BY TOM BEARDEN (of physics)
http://www.intalek.com/warpdrive/glossary1.pdf

Some teasing bait for physicists:

34 FLAWS IN CLASSICAL EM THEORY
http://www.cheniere.org/misc/34flaws.htm

A VISUAL TOUR OF WHAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTRICAL
CIRCUITS
http://www.cheniere.org/briefings/circuitcurrents/index.html

   If this site is true then "EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG!" The
quote is from FireSign Theater - a comedy group.

Yours Truly,
Gary Jeffers

Beat State!
