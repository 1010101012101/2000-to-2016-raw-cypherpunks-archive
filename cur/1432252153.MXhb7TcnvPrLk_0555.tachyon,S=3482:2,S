Absolutely. Furthermore, encourage your customers to encrypt their data:
Some European ISPs, fed up with the costs of complying with interception
warrants and subpoenas, have begun to offer discounts to customers that
exclusively utilize encrypting protocols. The logic being that it is
cheaper to notify law enforcement that the ISP is unable to tap the
information due to the link being encrypted than it is to tap a link.
