  Issue 7                                                 June 6, 2001

   Editor's Note                                              [Image]

   Today, in our continued effort to bring you breaking after market
   news we have chosen to feature a company whose business model
   revolves around corporate risk management. Secretary of Labor
   Elaine L. Chao recently stated "Every day 16 workers still lose
   their lives in this country. And every hour 650 workers experience
   an injury or illness on the job. While these numbers are steadily
   coming down, they are still far too high." OSHA compliance and
   workplace safety is just one of the areas of Risk Management in
   which LearnCom engages. Read on!

   Breaking News                                              [Image]

   LearnCom, Inc.'s (otcbb: LRCM) four Business Units provide
   single-source learning resources and consulting services to
   businesses, government agencies and other non-profit
   organizations. The Company focuses on human resources, management
   and safety training - specializing in diversity and critical
   compliance areas including harassment prevention, employment law
   and OSHA-required training. LearnCom's resources are provided in a
   variety of formats including Internet and Intranet delivery, video
   and CD-ROM. For additional information, visit www.learncom.com,
   www.videolrn.com and www.trainseek.com.

   Today at approximately 38 minutes after the market's close,
   LearnCom (otcbb: LRCM) issued a press release. Obviously, due to
   the late release the market as yet has not been able to react. The
   release has been excerpted below. Click here for the entire
   relase: LRCM BREAKING NEWS

                LearnCom Recaps its Strategy and Results
              CEO Provides Recap of Strategy and Progress.

   LearnCom CEO Lloyd Singer stated, ``Our goal is to become the
   major supplier of soft skills training resources and related
   services in the highly fractionated $60 billion training
   industry.

   The (company's) first acquisition in January, 1999 included the
   high quality video assets (several hundred titles) of WingsNet,
   Inc. and provided the foundation to get the business started. By
   midyear, '99 we were cash neutral on just $750,000 in sales and
   provided our backers with the confidence to fund further growth.

   In August, 1999, we acquired the stock of BNA Communications, a 50
   year producer/distributor of high quality video courseware
   specializing in harassment prevention, diversity and employment
   law. The company had been a subsidiary of The Bureau of National
   Affairs, the large Washington, D.C. publisher and information
   provider to the legal and HR professions.

   In January, 2001, we acquired the stock of venerable distributor,
   VideoLearning Systems, Inc. (VLS). This deal provided an
   additional eight salespeople, and three excellent managers.
   Integration is proceeding on schedule. VLS is on track to generate
   $2.5 million in revenue in 2001.

   Again, this is just part of the entire release  issued after the
   close today. Click here to read it in its entirety: LRCM NEWS
