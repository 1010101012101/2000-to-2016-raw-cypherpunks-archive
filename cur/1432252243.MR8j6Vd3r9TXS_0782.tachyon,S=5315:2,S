POLITICAL REPRESSION  Aug 23 2002
  The Execution of Sacco & Vanzetti: 75 Years Later
When Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were put to death on August 23, 
1927, radical America wept. Despite the dedication of people from Emma 
Goldman to Albert Einstein and demonstrations from Paris to Portugal, the 
worldwide fight to save the two Italian immigrants had failed.
Accused of a 1920 robbery, the anarchists were tried amidst the xenophobic 
and anti-leftist sentiments of Palmer-raid United States. They sat before 
an admittedly biased judge and were convicted contrary to evidence of their 
innocence. In the years following, the Sacco-Vanzetti trial became the best 
example of radicals in the U.S. being railroaded for their political beliefs.
New Yorkers will mark the trial with a 5 p.m. memorial in Union Square on 
Friday. On Thursday, a teach-in a teach-in was also held.
