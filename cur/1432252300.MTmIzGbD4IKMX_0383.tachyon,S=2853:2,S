indeed; the laundering would be well implemented.  it's unlikely
highly visible raw cash infusions are the mechanism, more likely
ancillary benefits in equipment, "unrelated" contracts, facilities,
and other infrastructure.

i've seen too much infrastructure build out in these
post-telecom-crash years (esp. landing points and backbone/gigapop)
that just seems suspect.  perhaps this also falls under the various
"critical infrastructure protection" programs juiced with cash post
9/11 with passive taps as added bonus.
