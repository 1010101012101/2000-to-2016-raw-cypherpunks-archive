Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the deve|opment of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
full-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
re|evant po|icies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fill the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
