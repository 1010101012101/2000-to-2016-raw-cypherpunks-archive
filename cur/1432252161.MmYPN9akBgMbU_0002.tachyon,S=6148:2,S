You're way behind the times. Julf's system has been down for several years.

A few Cypherpunks-style remailers support reply blocks, but very few. 
And if a reply block of some sort is not in the original message, 
it's of course hopeless. There were no such reply blocks in the 
messages cited here.

1. For starters, there are not a "hundred" spam messages a day. At 
the peak, when some yahoo (TM, The Yahoo Corporation) subscribed the 
toad address to many other lists, there were perhaps 50 such messages 
a day for a few days.

2. Being that the toad.com address was not to be the long term list 
address (Gilmore told us to find other host machines), I divert all 
toad.com traffic into its own folder. Which I sometimes look at, 
scan, but sometimes just delete en masse. This cuts out about 80% of 
all commercial messages, as near as I can tell.

3. Determining which remaining messages are spam is relatively easy. 
"THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BECOME WEALTHY!" and "Printer Supplies CHEAP" 
sort of gives it all away.

4. Filters.

5. There are compelling reasons to allow non-subscribed addresses.

These points have been covered in hundreds of posts in dozens of 
threads over several years. Consult the archives.

I've yet to see "Asymmetric <all@biosys.net>" post any meaningful or 
interesting articles, so I expect he's just another clueless newbie 
who's stumbled onto our list and now wants to remake it. Typical.

Your wish is my command.
