Hi
I'm looking for information concerning a SIGINT system with the codename
ELIXIR. I don't know much about it except that was (is?) deployed by the
US Air Force, probably in the United Kingdom, initially in the late
80'ies. I have located one former USAF Analyst who claims to have worked
with the system. He's in Florida now, but was in the UK 1983-1987. Any
info on ELIXIR will be much appreciated.

Yours
Bo Elkjaer, Denmark
