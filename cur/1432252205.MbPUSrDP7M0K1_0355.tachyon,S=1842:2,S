Protection of bits by legislation ???

Why is this a subject ? If you don't encrypt you will be listened to. Who the
fuck cares if intercept is legal or not. That is irrelevant. It's like trying
to obsolete summer clothing by making it illegal to watch pussies and dicks.
And the discussion about it is similarly moronic.

In olde times cypherpunks would applaud lack of legal bit protection as it
stimulates sheeple to encrypt more. I mean wear panties.
