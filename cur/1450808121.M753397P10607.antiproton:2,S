namely,=E2=80=8B the onus is on oneself to stay honest when passing by an
open/unsecured door, knowing full well the riches exposed within are ripe
for the "criminal element" to plunder.

We readily blame the owner for not securing their home/car/whatever when
theft occurs.  We don't hear weekly roll-ups of five-finger discounted
items, nor of items which may have "fallen off the truck."   Change the
theft to one based on bits, and it's front page news ... seemingly because
it's so much more nefarious but really only because it's still a novelty in
the Mind of the Many.

Why aren't people indignant about the extra costs associated with theft?
Which makes cyber related costs rather trivial.

The point being, inequality will allows foster theft.  Prisons will never
deter the Desperate nor Ruthless.  Since the System clearly benefits
overall from the inequality, and by extension the propagation of prisons,
this is a condition likely to continue - even probably survive The
Revolution:  Jail being seen as the barricade against "Them."
