Sure, and the URLs still work. The first URL opens the story and 
the PGP doc is mentioned at the jump at the 2nd URL:

http://semanal.expresso.pt/primeira/artigos/interior.asp?edicao=1520&id_arti
go=ES45175 

http://semanal.expresso.pt/internacional/artigos/interior.asp?edicao=1520&id
_artigo=ES45132 

Here's Babelfish translation of the passage:

  To the side of some techniques of combat, apparently 
  rudimentary, were possible to find a manual on one of 
  the techniques of criptagem of more advanced electrsnicas 
  communications of the world, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  
  This method, practically considered inviolable, was forbidden 
  by the Congress them United States for distrust that could 
  be used to hide activities terrorist.
