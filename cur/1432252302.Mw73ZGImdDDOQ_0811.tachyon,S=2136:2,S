Let's see.  The mint picks a prime, p, a generator, g, and a random number 
k, and publishes (p, g, g^k mod p).

The mint then signs stuff by raising it to the k power mod p, and not 
telling anyone what k is.

We blind coins by picking a random b, and sending the coin times g^b to
the mint, and after the mint raises it to the k power and sends it back,
we can reverse engineer coin^k.

Perhaps you'd care to publish your p, g, and g^k here on the list, so we 
can begin hacking them while you finish your pre-launch checkout. :)

(Does anyone recall the approximate equal difficulty ratio between bits 
 of factorization and bits of discrete log?)
