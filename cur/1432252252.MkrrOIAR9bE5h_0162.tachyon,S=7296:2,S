Even if you trust each remailer to "do the right thing" only 10% of the
time, by chaining 10 such remailers the probability of having your identity
revealed is only 1 in 10^10 - assuming that the remailers are independent.
[That secondary assumption can be improved by chosing remailers in different
countries.]

No - that by using an open-relay mailer you get the same anonymity as using
a Type 1 / Type 2 remailer.

Funny, that's how it looked for everyone. Admit it - you said something
stupid. [Even I admit I'm wrong sometimes. <g>]

Most of the regular subscribers are tired of the complaints (which are
usually worse - as in more and bigger - than the spam).

I don't use any (deleting) filters; I read about 500 messages each day, and
it only takes me 2-3 hours. A friend of mine reads around 2,000 messages
each day. It's not such a big deal.

Yep. Same thing - the fear of lawsuits - is why we were warned, when we came
to the US, to not even look at our female colleagues: even a hint of a
lawsuit would make our employer send us back to our country in a heartbeat -
whether we're guilty or not. [They wouldn't care.]

US sucks a lot. Too bad this is where the money is :)

One word: Freenet. See http://freenet.sourceforge.net

No. There already is a solution: the client filters everything. Wait,
there's also a second one: build your own cypherpunks node. [The second one
is even better.]

Spam takes <1 second to identify and delete.

Here I agree with you :)
