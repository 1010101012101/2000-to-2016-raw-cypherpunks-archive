There is difference between who has held the entire cache in their
own hands, versus who has been given [or just access to] select
documents.

It seems reasonable to presume Greenwald has a copy of the entire cache.
But such statement is far from clear as applied to the rest of the names...
Poitras, MacAskill, Appelbaum, Schneier, Green, couriers, in custody of
outlets, etc.
Same for if Snowden himself retained his own copies, whether in
person, or stashed in safe places. In games, you cannot accept
statements by such parties about who has what or does what as
always true, especially by the main actor[s]. Regardless of how
true any statements on other topics may be.

Before those questions may be answered the world may need to wait
for Snowden's own legal status to be resolves.. such as permanent
Russian or other citizenship and shield from remote US prosecution,
or return to US and resolution of process there.

What can be said is that there *appears* to be a very large
cache from which rather few docs have been released. Given
that most of what has been out is not truly damaging or earth
shattering, but merely embarrasing and key confirmatory of
suspicions... games of releasing just a few is disapointing,
and the pace is falling off. Maybe that is just waiting for
US election cycles and various moments now.
