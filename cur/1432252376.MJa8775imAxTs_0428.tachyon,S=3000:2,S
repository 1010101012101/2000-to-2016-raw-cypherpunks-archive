A US Federal Appeals Court has tossed out the $109 million verdict against
anti-abortion activists who ran a website called "The Nuremberg Files",
which listed the personal information of abortion doctors, and cheered
whenever one of them was killed.
     
The Judge opined that as long as the defendants didn't threaten to commit
violent acts, working alone or with others, that their conduct constituted
protected First Amendment Free Speech.
     
Specifically, speech which only "encourages unrelated terrorists" is First
Amendment protected.
     
Now what was it Jim Bell threatened to do with those pigfucker names and
addresses again?
