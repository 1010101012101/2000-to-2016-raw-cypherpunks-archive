Tim, see _Science_ 7 Sept 01, vol 293, p1773-1777 "The Origin and Control
of Pandemic Influenza" and related research.

Summary: you want to stockpile specifically anti-influenza drugs like
'Relenza' or
'Tamiflu'.  They impede viral replication by messing with an enzyme it uses
to release itself.

The genetic engineers have been figuring out what makes virulent strains,
and where they come from.  Basically bird flu mixes with human flu.  Damn
chinese chickens.

Hey, at least wearing masks in public will become socially acceptable, as it
now is in south NYC...
