Well, I use my real name in most places and communicate a lot with 
real-world friends and family by email, su using Peerio is therefore a 
step up in security for me even if I continue to go by my usual name and 
use my usual IPs.

If you need hard anonymity, this is only a marginal gain over regular 
email because metadata (when, who, how, where) is a significant threat 
to anonymity. So yea, use a burner email when setting up a peerio 
account (no longer required after setup, probably a throwback to 
email-as-salt in miniLock plus contact discovery by known email 
address), then use through Tor (do research whether websockets are 
tor-safe?).

Spideroak appears to be more about file storage and sync, whereas Peerio 
seems to me to simply be a better approach to server:client email. It's 
down to the bone: message-passing with attachments, and a nice UI.

As a crypto-app, it's targeted at the mainstream, and people who 
interact with the mainstream. People on this list will have better, more 
secure ways of communicating, but Nadim (to his credit) excels at making 
crypto-apps that can appeal to normal users while adding a significant 
privacy. It's an easier sell from "us" to "them".
