But since I did want to be found, it seemed perversely interesting to see
if he was the kind of person I could get to find me the same way I found
him...somehow it was much more satisfying to let him think my post was a
coincidence and he was the one being clever and doing the sleuthing. Sort of a
joke at him, at myself, at the absurdity of thinking you can ever be truly
anonymous. Whether or not I could I have pulled off posting about the subject
without being recognized is an entirely different question: if you disguise
your opinion enough, at some point it's not yours anymore. And if you take it
even farther and become too deeply enraptured by the perverse pleasures of
perception management, you end up deceiving yourself most of all. A joke within
a joke within a joke within still another joke that's not that funny, but there
you are.  

I'm not so blind I can't recognize and laugh at some of my more colorful tired
old crotchety hobbyhorses...since people are only going to see in you what they
want to anyway, I choose to ride them all the same. 

Or: fuck 'em.
