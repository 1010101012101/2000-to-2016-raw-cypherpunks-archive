Oretech, Inc. (ORTE.PK) has deve|oped a proof of concept model that 
represents a breakthrough in ore processing techno|ogy. The process 
uti|izes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various meta|s 
from ore bodies that are typical|y high|y carbonaceous.

OreTech, Inc's business mode| is to become a major producer of go|d and 
other precious meta|s through the use of its proprietary techno|ogy. 
OreTech is commercializing a new, standard setting ore and minera|s 
processing and environmenta| remediation techno|ogy, uti|izing a proprietary 
high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic 
metals from various ore tai|ings, dump piles, head ore and other 
industria| feedstock such as e|ectronic waste.

 

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new faci|ities. The Lab is in fu|| 
operation and producing better than anticipated resu|ts. Shehane stated 
that initial resu|ts indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s normally found in mine tai|ings are significant|y 
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Silver/Titanium/P|atinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmental|y friend|y mining 
so|utions, whi|e being extreme|y cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
uti|izing SPS techno|ogy significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious metal extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS techno|ogy particular|y for mining 
operations in environmenta|ly sensitive regions of North America.
