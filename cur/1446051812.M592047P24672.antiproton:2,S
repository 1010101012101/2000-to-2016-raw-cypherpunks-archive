Does it matter whether the crowds can do accurate predictions if the main
purpose is for special actors with the skills and interest to be encouraged
to create outcomes that are being wagered upon. I've not looked closely at
Augur but back in Cpunk days stumped for PMs that included forwards,
similar to financial futures, but where the participants could create
contracts which narrowed the prediction windows to months, weeks or even
days within the greater expiry period (e.g., Dec. 31, 2015) but were not
required to specify which month, week or day . By enabling such
sub-contract narrowing the benefit for an accurate prediction scales with
its temporal ratio with the general contract thus increasing leverage and
benefit to special actors.
