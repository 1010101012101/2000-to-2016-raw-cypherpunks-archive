Permanent holy war in Iraq would keep them busy and out of
mischief WITHOUT permanent large involvement from American
military.

Plus, of course, they would be pumping oil like mad in order to
fund it.

Finding Al Quaeda is hard.  Nation building is even harder.
Military training covers nation smashing, not nation building.

But arranging matters so that Al Quaeda is busily killing those 
muslims it deems insufficiently Muslim, and muslims are killing
Al Quaeda right back, seems astonishingly easy.   It is like
throwing a match into a big petrol spill.  Why are American
soldiers getting shot putting out the fire?   Why are Americans
dying to stop arabs from killing arabs? We *want* arabs to kill
arabs.  When arabs kill arabs, we fear that the wrong side
might win - but whichever side wins, it usually turns out to be 
the wrong side.   If no one wins, no problem.

But we learnt from history.  Europe, and Europeans, did learn
from the European holy wars.

First:  Three cheers for Timothy McViegh.

Secondly, the people who organize large scale terror can be 
identified, particularly by locals and coreligionists, which is
why they have been dying in large numbers in Afghanistan.
