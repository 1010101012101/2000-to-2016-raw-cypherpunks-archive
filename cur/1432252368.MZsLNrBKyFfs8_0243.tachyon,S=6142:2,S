FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Defense Fund Launched for Ross Ulbricht, Accused Silk Road Marketplace Op=
erator

New York, NY, November 20, 2013 =96 The family of the man accused by the =
US government of operating the Silk Road online marketplace has launched =
a fund for donations to their son's legal defense.

Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1st and charged with creating =
and operating the web marketplace Silk Road, under the pseudonym =93Dread=
 Pirate Roberts=94. The allegations include a variety of conspiracies, in=
cluding narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering, as =
well as planned acts of violence. Ulbricht denied all charges in federal =
court in San Francisco in October. He will appear at a bail hearing at th=
e United States District Court, Southern District of New York at 11:00 am=
 EST on Thursday, November 21.

On their website, the Ulbricht family states: =93Our goal is to provide R=
oss with what every American citizen is promised: a fair trial. In the US=
A we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.=
 We firmly believe in Ross=92s innocence and are working hard with the be=
st legal team to prove it.=94

The family has retained New York-based attorney Joshua L. Dratel to defen=
d their son in court. Mr. Dratel stated: =93It is crucial that we have a =
level playing field for defending Ross, and that requires resources from =
the communities that support him.=94

The Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund LLC is a Wyoming-based corporation e=
stablished by the Ulbricht family. All donations are used solely to pay a=
ttorney fees, fund accounting fees and ancillary legal expenses.
