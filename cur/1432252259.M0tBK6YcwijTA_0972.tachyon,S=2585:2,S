The bibliography of another NSA reorganization report
released today lists several entries under "Unified
Cryptologic Architecture" as well as a "U.S. Cryptologic
Strategy - Preparing for the 21st Century."

There is also a citation of "SINEWS - GCHQ Modernization
and Change Program."

We would appreciate leads or pointers for getting
these documents.

Here's the main text second report:
