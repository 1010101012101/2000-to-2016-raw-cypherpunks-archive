Unless it fails to contain all the elements required of a valid contract
(you know those elements, don't you Jimbo?) or it violates the Statute of
Frauds or similar rules (you know about the Statute of Frauds and similar
rules, don't you Jimbo?) or violates some public policy (you know about
those public policy concepts don't you Jimbo?).  Any failure along these
lines would render such a verbal "agreement" unenforceable in contract.
