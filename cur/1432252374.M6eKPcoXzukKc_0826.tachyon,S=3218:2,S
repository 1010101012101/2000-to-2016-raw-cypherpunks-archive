If the corporations didn't have the government to do their dirty work for
them, they'd do it themselves - like the historical terrorizing and killing
of labor organizers.  But I guess commies deserve it?

No, it doesn't really help put things in perspective.  In a time where it
has never been more apparent that the interests of the capitalist powers and
the government are very much the same - e.g. the oil
industry-controlled/owned gov't invades a sovereign nation for control of
more oil, and further consolidation and control of global resources - I do
*not* understand the argument that the government is bad, but the forces
behind that gov't action, and profits made from that gov't action, are good.

My point is only that control of information helps control outcomes that
effect everyone.  Entrenched corporate powers have a vested interest in
controlling information (as do the politicians they own in D.C.) so that
decisions regarding technology, etc. benefit them.  Crypto and other
technologies accessible to all threatens this control - both corporate and
gov't.

I just don't get the market-will-fix-everything argument.  Much of the
Internet is based on public resources and many of which (e.g. open
protocols) are valuable because they are *not* commodified.
