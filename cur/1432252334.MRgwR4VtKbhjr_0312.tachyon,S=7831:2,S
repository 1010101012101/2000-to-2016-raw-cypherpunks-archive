Sorry Joe, 

I'm no longer at liberty to discuss this matter.

There's a leaker on this "Private" list and I just got contacted by an
Australian Barrister with a full copy of my post to this list, and no word
as to whom may have forwarded it.

To bring a piece of sobering reality to the leakage on a private list just
let me point out some earlier jokes from last week where I was the object.

"ver didst you put zee microfeesh Vladimer?"

Not always as funny as that is it people?

So I may start up my own cc list of people on this list of people I
"Think" I can trust.
