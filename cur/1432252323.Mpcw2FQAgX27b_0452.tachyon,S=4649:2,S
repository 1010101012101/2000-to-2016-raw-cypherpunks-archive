3.  Go into your Web browser (open it if it's not already opened).
4.  Click in the "Netsite" or "Address" bar -- the place in your 
    Web browser where it says what Web address you're currently 
    looking at -- and delete the address that's currently there.
5.  In the blank "Netsite" or "Address" bar, paste the address by 
    selecting the "Edit" menu at the top of your screen and 
    choosing "Paste".
6.  Press Enter.
