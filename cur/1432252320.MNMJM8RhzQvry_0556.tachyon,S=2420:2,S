Actually I think it was called "Rising Sun" 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/RisingSun-1044927/about.php

It starred Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes investigating the murder of a woman 
in the corporate offices of a Japanese controlled corporation in Los Angeles.

(Hmmm, Sean Connery was in an Indiana Jones film too......)

Turned out the "reflection" was a witness to the murder, and the real killer 
was an American politician trying to hide is indiscretion.

Basically, it was a kung-fu film within the background of the conflict between 
Japanese and American culture. (This was back during the "The Japanese are 
going to buy out America" mania in the 80's).

I think it was based on a Michael Crichton novel too. (Hey, wasn't "Jurassic" 
Park directed by Spielberg who supported Directory George Lucas with the 
"Indiana Jones" Films ....... what's that noise, hey someone's breaking down 
the  door. Oww11 als;kfjlaskjlt6ihaklhglk;ajs al ........ CARRIER TERMINATED
