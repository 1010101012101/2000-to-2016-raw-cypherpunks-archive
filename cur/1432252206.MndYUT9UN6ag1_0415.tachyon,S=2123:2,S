We're talking about different things, the War on Bogeymen vs. the War for Oil.
In its war on bogeymen, the most notable thing the USG has achieved to date is
to create vastly more of them.  Its strategy is about as effective as the
paras were on Bloody Sunday, i.e. its actions serve mostly as a recruitment
drive for the opposition:

  I swear by Almighty God [...] to fight until we die in the field of red gore
  of the infidel tyrants and murderers.  Of our glorious faith, if spared to
  fight until not a single trace is left to tell that the Holy soil of our
  country was trodden by these infidels.  Also these robbers and brutes, these
  unbelievers of our faith, will be driven into the sea, by fire, the knife or
  by poison cup until we of the true faith clear these infidels from our
  lands.
