   You've got it exactly backwards -- it's only a small (and decreasing as
well) portion of the population that smokes, and it's the majority who don't
want to breath the second-hand smoke. That's why the mayor of NYC is able to get
away with banning smoking in bars and restaurants. 
   Get over it -- public smoking is going to be banned everywhere, plenty of
cities have already banned it in restaurants, public buildings, etc. It's only a
matter of time before it's also banned on the street, and there are already
proposed laws being considered to do just that.
