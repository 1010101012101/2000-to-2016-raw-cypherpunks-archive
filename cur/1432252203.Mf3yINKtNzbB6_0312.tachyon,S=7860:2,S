Are there any sources to the procedure how NSL's and other subpoenas / 
gag orders could be used to coerce certificate authorities to hand out 
their private keys?

My guess is the risk for using root certificate of different company 
for MITM is too high: EFF's SSL observatory would detect it. I'm 
suprised there has been no leaks about such attacks: It's fairly easy to 
mitigate, transparent, long term, and  extremely effective, even against 
PFS.

Does anyone have guesses or information about how CA's handle their 
private keys? Are all certificates they sign for companies done on 
airgapped computers? How high are the security standards of these 
companies?
