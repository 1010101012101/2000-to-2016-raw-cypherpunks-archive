It acknowledges the existence of common law.  Now that this has been cleared
up, your contention is that the US is not bound by, and does not follow ANY
of the precepts of English common law, is that correct?

are already paid for), where is the American common law that replaced the
now rejected English common law, that A7 refers to?
