Reply-To: science-liberation-front@googlegroups.com

Here's a basic concept for using mobile proxies.

The idea is that college students would install an android or iphone
app that would phone home and tell a server that a phone is now
available to take requests. The app would travel over HTTP (to prevent
any sort of port blocks) and ask the server for any new papers to
download. The app would perform the download, then POST or PUT the
file back to the server along with the metadata. The metadata could be
served back to the server by POSTing the HTML, actually.

Components:

1) android app

2) iphone app

3) a common protocol, probably JSON over HTTP

4) a central server to send requests

5) some way to access this server to manage a fleet or get back pdfs.

Any thoughts on how to make this work out? I can write the android and
iphone versions for this, and the server, but it would be better if
there were others involved. Additionally, I have been having trouble
finding an appropriate proxy to run on android that isn't limited to
HTTP requests.. surely there's some sort of botnet-provided proxy on
android already ? Transproxy isn't it, and proxydroid is really just
for redirecting outgoing requests, not handling incoming requests from
other machines.
