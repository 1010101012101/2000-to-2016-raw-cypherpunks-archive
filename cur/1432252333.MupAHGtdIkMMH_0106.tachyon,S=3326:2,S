And all of them are instruments of the affluent and well connected.
For example Shining Path was not poor peasants, but academics and
students.

For the most part using terror are not those suffering injustice, and
all of them are those inflicting injustice.  This is particularly the
case with Islamic terror.  For the most part it is not those suffering
Dhimmi status that engage in terrorism, but those who in their native
countries are successful in inflicting Dhimmi status on those of the
incorrect religion, and who apply terror in the hope of expanding this
success.

Al Quaeda attacked westerners because of their considerable success in
murdering and raping Afghans.   Jemaah Islamiyah because of their
considerable success in murdering and raping Timorese and Ambionese.

Today's Islamic terrorism, like yesterday's communist terrorism, is
the actions of evil men whose considerably privilege and comfort
arises from the injustice and oppression that they have successfully
inflicted, and that they intend to inflict a great deal more of.

Back before the fall of communism, wherever the master's boot smashed
into the face of a child, you lot would loudly praise the master, and
demonize the child as a CIA agent.  Now, after the fall of communism,
you are still at it, even though the masters no longer even pretend to
be acting to defend the poor and oppressed.
