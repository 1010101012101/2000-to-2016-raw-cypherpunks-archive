Why is it that many people here get red faced whenever someone
hints at their private property and can't even imagine that some
people might have a slightly different view of the world they're
in ?

Why do you want private property ? You want it because it helps
you live a better life, basically. So I'll pass the ownership of
land (as it's a dumb concept but unfortunately unavoidable to
enable the ownership of immobile goods (like what's built upon
it)), so property rights are just a visible barrier people put
between them and others.

It makes perfect sense to imagine this barrier having a different
geometry for other people. I, for one, am very annoyed at people
who take a bath in perfume and seem to have destroyed their nose
doing it for their lifetime.

Anyway, the whole thing is trying to live a better life through
a mix of interaction with others and separation from others. And
property rights is just a way to attain this. Someone needn't
start tinkering with your owned stuff to interact with you, be it
in a way you like or not. Property rights are only a part of the
notional barrier, which is really the barrier of where others'
freedom stops and yours begin. And it's a fuzzy barrier at best.
Property rights are just an attempt at codifying it, and not
perfect, though sufficient in a variety of ways.

<rant>
And to get back to this moronic argument that says "if you don't
like smoke, don't go downwind", have you fucking considered that
maybe I *didn't* go downwind, but the fucking smoker went upwind
of where I was ?
