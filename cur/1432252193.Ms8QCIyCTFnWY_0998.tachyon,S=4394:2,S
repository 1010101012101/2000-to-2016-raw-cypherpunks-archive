Sounds reasonable to me. Some things just can't be explained succinctly,
and even if they are understood may be perceived to be objectionable.

True, except for one point, and that was (what I recall) the
conversation on cpunx over the CIA possible front in Bell's area. But
that could have happened on many lists, and the "cypherpunk
philosophy" -- to the extent there is a philosophy -- should not be
particularly relevant here, it seems to me.

The sad thing is, I agree with Tim. If I were in his position, I would
likely feel the same way.
