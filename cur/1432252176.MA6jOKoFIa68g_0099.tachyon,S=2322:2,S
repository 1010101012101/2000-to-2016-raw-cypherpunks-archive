Or mine? I only have two entries in my killfile at this point (and I
subscribe to the lne.com node, so reading the list is far more
pleasant than it was a few years ago). Jamie makes a good point:
Complaining about someone's killfile does not make for interesting
reading or compelling discussion. Give it up and move on or be
ignored, I'd say.
