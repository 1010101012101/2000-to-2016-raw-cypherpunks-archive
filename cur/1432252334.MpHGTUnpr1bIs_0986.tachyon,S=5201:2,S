There should be no restrictions on the speech of the ranter on Usenet.

There should be no restrictions on the speech of a political 
campaigner. Ergo, both the Republican and Democrat versions of 
"campaign reform" are slam dunk violations of the First.

There should be no restrictions on the speech of a tobacco or 
pharmaceutical or any other company. Ergo, restrictions on 
advertising...you all know the drill.

The cigarette advertising restrictions of the 1960s were a blatant 
violation of the First Amendment. Not even the so-called commerce 
clause of the Constitution gives government the power to stifle the 
speech of a cigarette seller.

Sadly, this and many other restrictions (sometimes bringing in 
"interstate commerce" in farfetched ways as an excuse) were not 
challenged. Or the courts refused to face up to the real issues.

Now we are in a precarious position of having many forms of speech, 
many utterances, subject to various laws. We are not very far away 
from banning actual utterances which are in support of unapproved-of 
activities. Advertising, advocating illegal substances, hate speech, 
dislike speech, speech harmful to children and companion animals, the 
list goes on and on.

"You can urge your friends to vote for John McCain in 2004, but if 
you spend more than the amount that McCain-Feingold says you may 
spend you are a felon."

Free speech is for whisperers, it seems.

So much for "Congress shall make no law..."
