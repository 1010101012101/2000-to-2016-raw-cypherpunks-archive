Harm does,  but "harm" doesn't.  It's pretty easy to claim that
books and movies etc which "glorify" "bad" behavior lead to
viewers being more likely to engage in the bad behavior glorified,
or bad behavior in general,  without even trying to claim that
a particular "bad book" was responsible for a particular crime.

I have two differnet reponses to this kind of accusation:
1) Bullshit, I'm not responsible for other people's actions.
2) If I agreed about it being "bad behavior" I wouldn't be
"glorifying" it in the first place.

The problem with this analysis is that it ignores the crucial point 
that the people calling for labelling ("voluntary" or otherwise)
are not your customers, they're people trying to protect their
own or their children's virgin eyes from content they find
offensive or blasphemous or whatever.  You have an economic
incentive to please your customers, but you have no incentive to 
please people who aren't your customers.
