I'm making a somewhat wild assumption that you're voting in California --
as am I. As far as I can tell, Gore is going to take california, so by my
reasoning I'm free to vote with my conscience, since a vote for either
bush or gore wouldn't make a difference in this case. If you haven't
already you might want to consider that point (and do the research
yourself to back it up or disprove it -- don't take my word for it).
