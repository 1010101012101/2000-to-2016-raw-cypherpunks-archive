Although I appreciate the sentiment, your not really getting this. The 
timing was such that long-term impact was minimal. But if the blackout had 
come earlier in the day, and lasted for a few days, that outsourcing 
operation you work for might have been affected (ie, closed). Wall Street is 
here, for one, and Wall Street these days needs power.

Also, NYC now just assumes that power will be there. In 1975 the riots were 
fairly interesting...the wrong set of conditions could have made this MUCH 
more interesting (I was on a plane that landed a few hours after the 
blackouts began. I made my way to my residence as quickly as I could just in 
case things were going to get interesting again...)

As for the racist undertones in BBC and Amercian newfocus, I totally agree.
