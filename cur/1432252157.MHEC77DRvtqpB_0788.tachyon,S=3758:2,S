Yes. If people are not familiar with cjdns, here's a good
intro https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md

I've asked about this a while back among a few IPv6 people, 
and it does not seem to be a problem. The keys/addresses are 
randomly generated and are all in FC00::/8.

120 bits is a lot of space.

cjdns interoperates fine with dual-stack. The interesting
part is L2 routing over own infrastructure, and eventual
ASIC/FPGAfication of the router.
