In both cases, the very simplistic security measure raises the cost of
an attack out of the reach of a large class of attackers.

Using Bitcoin without Tor and generating a new address for each
transaction probably protects you against:

      * any moderately-skilled 14 year old
      * local law enforcement
      * your ISP

And several other classes of attacker below the level of, say, the FBI.

TAILS is just a system that forces all connections over Tor. There are
ways to force only specific applications to use Tor that the FBX can use
pretty easily. Since the FBX will write the FBX bitcoin client package,
it can configure bitcoin to, by default, only use Tor.

This isn't hard to do, and since this cheap measure puts Bitcoin out of
the reach of Dan Kaminsky, I'm not very worried about claims of
bitcoin's anonymity.

For reference, it's really, really, really hard to take web browsing and
make it anonymous. Forcing every connection from browsers to go through
Tor won't help you anywhere near as much as it does for Bitcoin. Bitcoin
has already done 99% of the hard work building a protocol that is
totally (as far as either of us can tell) anonymous if it's _just_
tunneled through Tor without any other filtering.
