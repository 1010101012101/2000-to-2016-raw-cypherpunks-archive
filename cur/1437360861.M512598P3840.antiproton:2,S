It's 10x for the drive, another 10x for the box to put it in, another 10x for a license for the software to get to it, ... 
(Roughly. ;-) )  You can be nickle and dimed up front or over time. In the latter case, it will continue to get more competitive 
and begin to have local systems with the same characteristics.

How much does an additional 4TB of storage for a z13 cost?

Most cloud systems fall into the embarrassingly parallel category. Many smaller, cheaper, cooler units completely outclass, in 
price and scalability, bigger, faster, higher bandwidth solutions, unless those are built inexpensively with smaller, cheaper, 
cooler units. We're finding out whether medium sized (Intel/AMD desktop / server class CPUs) or small (ARM mobile chipsets) are 
going to scale better, but either way, a many node system has an aggregate memory bandwidth that dwarfs old-style mega CPU 
systems.  It's not clear, but it appears that the z13 is just an integrated cloud-style clustered system with a bunch of nice 
added features[2].  If so, which is the only way it could compete on scale and cost, it is a branded cloud system.  Would it 
really be less expensive to operate than an Open Compute local cloud?  Probably only if you made a lot of assumptions about 
overhead, etc.

The z13 looks cool, and has a lot of interesting features.  It will be interesting to see how it does.

If you have the type of business where you know what you need and how much of it you need, you can competitively provision a 
local solution, although there are still plenty of ways to go wrong.  And many do, IMHO.  Many businesses have relatively modest 
needs, don't know what their growth will look like, etc.  Large up front costs are bad in a lot of situations, as is committing 
to a certain scale when there is a lot of uncertainty.

The number of businesses and organizations who fit that narrow situation are few and dwindling.  Sales will be able to rope in 
plenty more for a while, but for many it is not a sane choice. Security breaks are mostly about passwords, trojans, spear 
phishing, zombie machines, etc.  For every possible exploit of a cloud system, which at the infrastructure level should have 
well-funded security, I feel there are many more gaps in the typical local alternative: Sloppy, old Windows systems with a 
sloppy network, open to everyone file servers, poor access control, terrible custom programming, no significant physical 
security, etc.  The best systems + networks + policies + personnel are more secure, everyone else is just lucky not to be targeted.
