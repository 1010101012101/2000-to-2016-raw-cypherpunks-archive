---
Rowhammer‚Äù is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which
repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent
rows.
It was able to use this to gain write access to its own page table, and
hence gain read-write access to all of physical memory.

There is POC.

How much/what hardware does this bug affect?
