No, the American Revolution was fought to bring the colonies
independence from tyranny and instigated by the Boston Tea Party
incident and the Declaration of Independence.  The latter is good to
re-read to see very pointedly the ideals held.

That may be your interpretation, but given the foundation of "which it
stands" and by the letter of the Law, you have tremendous advantage
you can leverage on you, the individual's, behalf--regardless of how
corrupt various Legislative acts have made the Law as it stands today.
Remember the Bar Association is an unconstitutional monopoly that has
intimidated people out of their own rights by convincing them that the
law belongs to them.  Not so.  Even if they argue that they wrote a
Law, it is up to the elected Official to enforce it AND the Court to
uphold it as obeying the SPIRIT of the law (not the LETTER).

Constitutionally, police have no power EXCEPT as authorized by your
elected leader.  They are not mentioned at all in the Constitution.
Frankly, the whole federal government is a mess, and if you get
arrested for some heinous crime like copying data from a corporate
server somewhere, you need to point out that the federal executive
branch (which would be probably doing the arrest) is a schizoid,
psychotic mess and should not be trusted.  (To wit:  the "Department
of Justice".... under.... the Executive Branch. WTF?  Issues of
Justice are handled by the Judicial BRANCH.  It's not up to the
Executive to decide that they're executing Justice.)

Don't believe it.  The rights remain among the People and no Court is
going to be able to argue otherwise.  The Left has GIVEN away power,
mostly to media (do you question the veracity of national news?),
which is why the Internet is so important.
