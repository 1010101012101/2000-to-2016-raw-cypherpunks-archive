Culturocentrism at work.

A:

champagne:waterford::brie:_____

vs.

B:

colt45: crack hoe::a baseball bat:_____



Correct answer to A: "If one refers to the crystal, the answer is 
surely c), but if one refers the cracker, one must choose  b), but 
only, of course, if the brie is suitably soft."

Correct answer to B: "Whatha _fuck_!!"


And then there's

clipper:spies::toilet plunger:_____

and

shakespeare:borg::locutus:_____
