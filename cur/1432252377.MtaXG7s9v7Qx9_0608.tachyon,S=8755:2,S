In this the USA (ODNI / NSA / three-letter thing) is no different than
Russian Federation or China (some latest China stories I've seen
floated to this group here):

http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/security/chinas-new-rules-ask-tech-firms-to-hand-over-source-code


http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2476275,00.asp

This all brings to mind some things I've pointed out in the past and
things that people have harped about endlessly but which have mostly
gone ignored:

Support (or help develop) open source hardware projects that strive to
create independence from the sort of things we are seeing in the
corporate realm in which USA / Russia / China "force" Microsoft and
other companies to backdoor their products.  As suggested in this Jan.
2, 2014 blog post...
https://odinn.cyberguerrilla.org/index.php/2014/01/02/opensourcebuildguide/

"– Support or develop open source processors. consider using the Open
Core project as a starting point
– Learn more about OpenRISC development, participate in discussion
about it
– Become part of, or create, open source collaborative efforts (some
examples: Open Source Initiative, Open Daylight, the Open Source
Hardware Association (OSHWA), Open Source Firmware (DD-WRT, Tomato), etc.)
– Make informed buying choices: Purchase new hardware (any computer
equipment, mobile included) only from sources that have committed to
open source development of that hardware. (...)"
