Xray your novena. Compare it to Bunniestudios pgp-signed xray images.

Removing the jtag is like welding your hood shut because you're 
worried about cops tracking you. It pisses off your mechanic and
doesn't do anything about the cell phone that's already tracking
you.

Jtag is incredibly usefull stuff if you are a hardware geek or a
kernel and you want to debug why your laptop crashed.

If you actually want to make the Novena more secure, start reverse
engineering a full-open source toolchain to program the Xilinx 
FPGA, which is the most likely target for implants, cause we have
to use the crappy xilinx tools to program it.
