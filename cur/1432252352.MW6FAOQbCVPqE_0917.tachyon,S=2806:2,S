I saw a computer advertised in a magazine.  I attempted to buy it.  Seller 
wanted payment by paypal or moneyzap

Paypal had bugs, which caused my account to become frozen.   I phoned back.

Me:
	"You are not far from me -- how about I pay you the old
	fashioned way"
Seller:
	"We are not set up for that."


Trouble is of course, that paypal and the rest are based on true names 
registered with our beloved government which art in Washington.
