It's been a number of years since Jim Bell wrote his infamous "Assassination
Politics" essay.  If someone were to try to implement the system today and not
share Jim Bell's fate, they would need absolute anonymity and security.  The
technical requirements for implementing the system are:

1. Anonymous and secure communication between the organization and the
contributors and guessors.

2. Anonymous payment system.

3. Anonymous public presense of the organization to solicit contributions and
display bounties to potential assassins.

At the time AP was written, only the first requirement could have been met using
the mixmaster remailer network.  The last two requirements were not yet
available.   However, two new systems, DMT and Freenet, could be used to meet
the anonymous payment and anonymous public presense requirements.

If someone did want to implement AP, would DMT/Yodel, Freenet, and Mixmaster be
good enough to keep the TLA's from shutting the system down?
