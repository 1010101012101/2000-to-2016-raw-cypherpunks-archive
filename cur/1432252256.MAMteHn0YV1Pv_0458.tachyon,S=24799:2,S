  Issue 10                                               July 19, 2001

   Editor's Note                                              [Image]

   It's safe to assume that most of us, certainly most of us
   investors, are cell phone users and a large portion of that group
   are also PDA and Pocket PC users as well. If you use either cell
   phones or wireless computers, we think that today's issue of
   StockNight will be more than a little intriguing.

   In December of 2000, Bill Machrone, a contributing editor with PC
   Magazine, stated that "Streaming video to portable devices will
   change the world as much as cell phones have" and fantasized about
   the uses of such technology:

   "You may be getting a visual check on traffic at those troublesome
   bottlenecks as you walk to your car in the parking lot, doing a
   security sweep of your home in your absence, or viewing the
   relatives' visit to Sea World in real time, or surreptitiously
   catching up on your favorite soap opera while at your desk. Or any
   of a hundred applications that no one has thought of yet. "

   However, techies have worried for some time about the need to
   compress streaming video for wireless due to the present
   difficulties and constraints in sending wireless video
   applications to cell phones, PDAs and Pocket PCs, as well as low
   speed modems. Today our StockNight featured company has stated in
   their press release issued at 6:02 p.m. EST, that they have
   licensed new patent pending "technology that automatically reduces
   the size and bandwidth of digital video files" to be sent to
   wireless devices.

   Remember, this press release was issued AFTER THE BELL today so
   the market at large has not been able to react to this news yet.
   As part of the StockNight service we bring this information direct
   to your email as soon as it is made available to us.

              Vizario Licenses New Patent Pending Digital
                 Video Condensing Software Technology.
    Patent pending technology automatically and significantly reduces
                              the size of
          digital video files for wireless video applications.

   SAN CARLOS, Calif.----July 19, 2001-- Moving to ease the strain
   that video files place on low-bandwidth wireless networks,
   Vizario(TM), Inc. (OTCBB: VZRO) www.vizario.com) today announced
   it is licensing new patent pending software technology that
   automatically reduces the size and bandwidth of digital video
   files. Later this year, Vizario will incorporate the new
   technology in its mobile handheld device software system, which is
   designed for wireless video applications on cell phones, PDAs and
   Pocket PCs, as well as for use on low speed modems.

   Vizario Director David Schwartz, Digital Video Systems Engineering
   Manager Mike Chin and Senior Engineer Mike Tanaka have applied for
   the U.S. patent on the digital video condensing technology. ``It
   is clear that many people want digital video over low bandwidth
   wireless networks,'' Schwartz explained, ``but the sheer size of
   almost any video over three minutes long makes even previewing
   them problematic. Our new methods will make it easy for viewers to
   decide what they want to view or download without wasting time or
   money.'' Schwartz added, ``For system operators, we can
   substantially reduce the burden video places on wireless
   networks.''

   The new video condensing software technology is being developed by
   Imaginon, Inc., the parent company of Vizario. The exclusive
   rights to use the new technology in wireless networks are licensed
   to Vizario.

   Designed to put new capabilities into wireless mobile devices,
   Vizario offers both consumers and businesses a completely
   integrated, end-to-end wireless solution for finding and
   displaying data - especially rich media like audio and video. The
   Vizario consumer product features a client/server publishing tool
   allowing content carriers, promoters and content providers to
   distribute media assets to end users through the Vizario client.
   It also incorporates a Web interface where end users personalize
   their mobile Vizario further to add additional queries that
   deliver customized content. This solution offers unsurpassed ease
   of deployment in both Java and .Net-enabled handsets.

   As a vertical application suite, Vizario is a complete solution
   for companies that require distribution of image-intensive data to
   mobile devices wherever finding, encoding, decoding and displaying
   images for decision support in the field is considered critical to
   the mission's success.

   Vizario is a trademark of Vizario, Inc. The underlying technology
   is protected under U.S. Patents and a U.S. Patent pending.

   Except for the historical information presented herein, the
   matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking
   statements within the meaning of the ``safe harbor'' provision of
   the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or by the
   Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations, and
   releases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks
   and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
   materially. These risks include acceptance of Vizario software by
   developers and users, the successful development of competitive
   software to Vizario's, competitive pricing pressures for software
   and services, and the availability of financing to complete
   management's plans and objectives. In addition, other risks are
   detailed in Vizario periodic reports, Form 8-K of Vizario, filed
   on 5 June, 2001, and Rule 14F-1 Information Statement of Gallagher
   Research Corporation filed on May 10, 2001. These forward-looking
   statements speak only as of the date hereof. Vizario disclaims any
   intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
