They are more evil that we are, as demonstrated by their 
propensity to kill all sorts of people, including each other, 
and including us. This forces us to do something violent. 
Imposing democracy on Iraq at gunpoint was probably a bad idea, 
but it was selected as the option that would raise the least 
objection.  Any more effectual measure is going to piss you lot 
off even more.  A more effectual measure and considerably less 
costly measure would have been to confiscate Iraq's and Saudi 
Arabia's oil reserves, and ethnically cleanse all male muslims 
above the age of puberty from the oil bearing areas.  This 
democracy stuff did not work in Haiti and things look 
considerably more difficult, and more expensive, in Iraq.
