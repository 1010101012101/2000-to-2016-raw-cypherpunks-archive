Actually, that wasn't a question.  It's also the same John Palmer who mined UUCP 
maps and spammed paper junk mail to several thousand sysadmins offering the 
services of his Rabbit Network (whose logo Kibo once described as the ugliest in 
history).  He was often described as Usenet's Best Bad Example, and was 
semi-immortalized with his own alt.fan newsgroup.

I remember when he first started pushing alternative TLDs and urging people to 
use "sane" DNS that recognized them.  At the time, I dismissed it as more of Mr. 
Palmer's wackiness.  Little did I know that ICANN would rise up as it has, nor 
did I predict the Open Root Server Project.  

As I said, age brings wisdom (for all, it seems).  You are correct that John 
Palmer is on the right track.  I wish him success in his endeavour.
