Well I be darned if Mr May hasn't inspired a major burst of eloquence, 
between this response and Mr Young's.

As for this comment:

"Schools don't educate, but merely serve as a filter for employers to
locate those individuals who aren't going to make trouble at the factory."

At best. In the inner cities the function of schools is strongly hinted at 
by the following well-used phrase:

"Stay In School!"

In other words, schools keep the crime rates down, as is a well-known 
statistic. They are basically storage facilities. For real schools we white 
folks with $$$ can move out to the suburbs or send our kids to private 
school.

As for,

>Nonetheless, I think we do such people a disservice when we attribute
>their dislike of the education business to some sort of culturally
>ingrained sloth, and characterize them as looking to live on handouts of
>other peoples tax money.

I basically agree with this, though no doubt there are "Leaders" that play 
on this (and the latent laziness of all teeneagers) to a tune similar to 
what May is saying. But in most cases, even "good" schools are a joke, and 
black folks at least realize this. Did anyone notice that there's only 1 or 
2 states in the nation that still require Regents endorsements?

I'll tell you a story.

Back in the late 1980s I taught at a notorious HS in Bedford Stuyvesant. 90% 
of my students were black. I regarded few of them as stupid, but almost none 
of them saw the point of studying math...they just didn't see how it could 
benefit them, and they said this to me on a regular basis.

In one class I had some relatively young and non-troublemaking students. I 
told them from the beginning that I would not slip the standards so they 
could pass...they HAD to do homework in order to pass, as that would be the 
only way they could practice enough for the tests. For the first couple of 
tests all of the non-immigrant black kids failed. But I hammered them and 
told them it was going to continue like this unless they did the homework 
and studied. I made it absolutely clear what I expected from them.

By the end of the semester most of the kids were doing their homework, and 
passing the quizzes and tests, which I did not make easier in any way. I 
remember Willie Horne coming in before a test and "complaining" "Mr Durden, 
I STUDIED last night!". I reached out to feel his forehead and said "Willie? 
Are you feelin' alright?" Of course, he pulled back and stifled a smile, but 
he got a 90.
