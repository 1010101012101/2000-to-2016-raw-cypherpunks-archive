Spooky Cypherpunk Niggar Tim May Moroned:
#    When I hear Jesse Jackson saying that unless the Palm Beach voters
#    are given the chance to have a new vote there will be a race war, I
#    rejoice.
#    
#    I was just reading in misc.survivalism that some folks in Florida are
#    saying that if Al Gore and his Voters of Color succeed in twisting
#    the courts into stealing the election, that white folks will start
#    killing.
#    
#    Music to my ears. The fuse is burning on the powder keg.

Holy shit!

I vote you are hereby ex-communicated from the Cypherpunks club,
