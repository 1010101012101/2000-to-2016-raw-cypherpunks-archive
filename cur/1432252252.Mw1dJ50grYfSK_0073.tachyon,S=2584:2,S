I don't. I only use a nym for things that need to appear to have been
done by a third party, or for other reasons should not be traceable back
to Shawn K. Quinn.

Someone who I am currently not on speaking terms with once "clarified"
his/her position by stating her online and in-person personas were
different; his/her online persona made it appear he/she was more
approachable than he/she actually was. I simply don't play that game.

I do follow cypherpunk topics, I use PGP/GnuPG, Tor, Mixmaster, Freenet,
GNUnet, etc. from time to time, but for the most part, I'm not nearly as
paranoid as I used to be. For better or for worse. Hell, I quit
channeling my Google queries through Tor some time ago (I still only
accept session cookies from Google, and that's only to make the services
work that require a Google account).
