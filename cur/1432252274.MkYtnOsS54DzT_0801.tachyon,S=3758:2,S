See Tomlinson on Psion memory sleight-of-hand...

Not that you were ready for it.  Fuck.  You innocent.
You need a decent spycam, or a real-time sat uplink, an ultralight to
cruise the urban canyans and buzz Ms liberty.  A guardian angel
Predator hovering over your shoulder.  Best leave the war_photog
to Declan and similar Youngsters, and other einsturzende neubauten
paparazzi.

As if other more serious hobbyist documenters don't have Long lenses and

Sensitive film.

They must have picked up your antisocial electromagnetic emanations
cominng through your copper-mesh burkha; a lamb wearing an
aluminum-foil Stetson, gripping the 60 Mton phallus as it
GPS's its way home at 32 ft/sec^2, freezing on the way down
because its been shorn.

As if you're a fucking teenage arsonist-obsessive, coming back to enjoy
the scene.  Yeah, an architect ---he'd know the scoop on buildings
and physics, put him on our short list.  Shit, he's probably read the
Fountainhead.  Oooh, he's on *that* mailinglist too,
put him on our extradoubleplus short list.  Oh shit, he's got a document
scanner
and he knows how to use it.  Tap this bugger.  Seize his ass.  Ets.

First they pissed on themselves (d'oh; which wayz the wind blowin'?),
now they shit on themselves, brownshirts for sure.

Gotta thank the Muslim Falwells for accelerating things, Homeland
Fascism on
Internet Time.  We were getting bored with Condit anyway.
