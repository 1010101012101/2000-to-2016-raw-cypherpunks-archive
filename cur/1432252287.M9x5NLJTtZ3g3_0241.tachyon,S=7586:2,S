Synchronicity in the library with a hammer.
"Cell member Marwan Al-Shehhi, who investigators believe piloted the second 
airliner to strike the trade center, had a conversation in April or May 
2000 with a female librarian in which he mentioned the trade center as a 
target, Nehm said.
"There will be thousands of dead," Al-Shehhi, originally from the United 
Arab Emirates, told the librarian, according to Nehm. "You will all think 
of me." The librarian later came forward as a witness, according to the 
federal prosecutor's office, which declined to identify her or say when she 
provided the information."
Libertarian Europe an Oxymongo? No!
No to capitalist globalisation No to militarism No to Fortress Europe No to 
the extension of police powers Yes to a libertarian Europe from below FROM

<chekovfeeney@yahoo.com> Libertarians / anarchists against Nice Founding 
meeting for National Campaign Anarchist and libertarian groups and 
individuals from all across Ireland are meeting in Dublin on Saturday 7th 
September to found a campaign against the Nice Treaty. This follows on from 
local discussion that have already taken place in Dublin, at Ecotopia, the 
anarchist summer camps etc and on the Irish anarchism list. At this stage 
it looks like the campaign will include the WSM, ASF, AF, Cork Anarchist 
Alliance and individuals from RTS, Gluseacht and other groups and 
individuals involved in the Grassroots Gatherings. Discussions to date 
indicate that the probable basis of the campaign will be on the following 
points, although the exact wording etc is to be worked out. No to 
capitalist globalisation No to militarism No to Fortress Europe No to the 
extension of police powers Yes to a libertarian Europe from below Up to now 
the right have made most of the running with the No vote. We see a need for 
a libertarian No campaign that argues for a No vote on a libertarian basis. 
This is not just about defeating the referendum it is also about making the 
defeat a progressive one rather then one based on the sort of racist 
rhetoric that so far has dominated the debate. So we strongly encourage all 
anarchists and libertarians in Ireland, north and south, to attend this 
meeting. It will take place at 14.30 hours in the Teachers Club, 35, 
Parnell Square, Dublin on Saturday 7th September. We don't want a campaign 
where some group turns up at the first meeting with the campaign posters 
and leaflets already printed out. So please bring along draft posters and 
ideas for the campaign. A draft leaflet for discussion will be prepared on 
the Irish Anarchism list in the week before the meeting on the basis of 
drafts emailed to that list. So if you want to take part in that process be 
sure to join Irish Anarchism. This draft will then be amended at the 
meeting itself. We hope to print and distribute tens of thousands of 
leaflets in the run up to the referendum, again the number that we do will 
depend on your involvement. For more details or to add items to the agenda 
or if you can't make the meeting but want to receive any material produced 
please contact Chekov at chekovfeeney@yahoo.com or ring/SMS us at 087 
7939931. To take part in the ongoing discussion about the anarchist 
campaign email irishanarchism-subscribe@yahoogroups.com The evening after 
the meeting there will be a fundraiser for Reclaim the Streets. On Sunday 
there will be an RTS creativity session to prepare banners etc for the 
party on the 22nd so if you are travelling from outside Dublin you can make 
a weekend out of it. Various anarchists have already begun working on the 
referendum, and already there are some web pages up and some more in 
preparation. This includes the page at http://struggle.ws/about/nice.html 
which now includes some detailed briefing documents on the Nice treaty as 
well as links to the various official documents and other relevant 
articles. If you know of material that should be linked from that page or 
other Irish libertarian pages on Nice please email details of them to 
revolt@newmail.net. Again the founding meeting will be at 14.30 hours in 
the Teachers Club, 35, Parnell Square, Dublin on Saturday 7th September.
