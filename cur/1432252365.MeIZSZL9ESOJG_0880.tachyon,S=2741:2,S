Dearest Aimee,

It's discouraging that the FBI has, though its own actions, time and time
again, earned this disdain in which many of us hold it.

Trust is not something given lightly. And once lost, it is rarely
regained. What cause do any of us have to trust in the FBI and cooperate
with it now? Don't believe in the "common enemy" fallacy.
