 > How about Pond as email replacement?

I've looked at Pond long enough to see that it calls upon Tor for most 
of the anonymity heavy-lifting, and that it is clearly targeted at 
technical users. Most of the people in my life who I speak privately to 
are not technical. I don't think trivial UX is near in Pond's 
development roadmap.

Keybase could have been a great way to encourage PGP uptake among normal 
people years ago when things were accepted to be difficult universally, 
but PGP's days are behind us. PGP makes a good way to sign code but 
remains a terrible way to communicate securely, because although it's 
"uncrackable" when used correctly, it's very easy to accidentally screw 
up using PGP on either end of the conversation. Also, the lack of PFS 
ignores parts of the modern threat model that were speculative when PGP 
was created.

Suffice to say that, even ignoring the issues with Keybase encouraging 
key escrow by "allowing" or encouraging key upload (!!!), I don't think 
it helps. Perhaps as a basis on which to build a web-of-trust that can 
be transposed into newer cryptosystems, but the key escrow part makes 
falsification of trust a real possibility.

Anyway, maybe that's just me.
