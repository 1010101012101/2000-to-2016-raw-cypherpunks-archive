"So it's best to ignore the "unwashed masses" and their inability to 
understand untraceable money."

That's precisely the wrong conclusion, assuming everything else you wrote in 
this post is correct.

If one accepts that most young people don't understand the notion or 
implications of truely digital "cash", then one's tactics must change 
considerably.

If de-empowering some aspects of the State is your goal, a new constrant is 
that your methods must not rely on anyone giving a crap about your goals, or 
possibly of digital cash. This does not mean that these ideas are destined 
to flounder, but instead it may mean that for them to have life they must 
find it somewhere where people can understand their usefulness. For 
instance, I can easily see some notions of untraceable digital cash finding 
applications over certain kinds of P2P networks. But if you continue to 
discuss the issue in the abstract, or purely in the context of de-stating 
the state, the youngins won't pay attention long enough for them to 
recognize why this may be useful to them. Eventually, however, they'll find 
the need for these ideas and do their homework.
