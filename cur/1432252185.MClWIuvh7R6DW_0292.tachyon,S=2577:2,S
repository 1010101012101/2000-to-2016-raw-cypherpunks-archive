See my previous post. As for ATM being 'obsolete', well one might say this 
with good reason, but not because it isn't used. The core is still dominated 
by ATM. Waitaminue, not just the core but the edges too: DSL is basically 
over ATM still. As for bandwidth, that isn't a problem for ATM, though it's 
easy to bitch about the mapping penalties incurred by putting packets over 
ATM cells over OC-N.

On the other hand, having the ATM layer in there can complicate matters, and 
you don't need a lot of flow control if you're willing to give everyone 
globs of bandwidth. For both of these reasons and more G-PON is probably 
going to win out, and I'd suspect prices have already started to drop 
precipitously.
