Rumor is, one set of the "Martyr Airlines" replacement-crew had
left a video of how to fly planes, in Arabic, in his luggage.

What would be pretty cool is to find a copy of MS Flight Sim
with notes on simflying the large Boeing airplane over NYC terrain...

But Bill Gates != Steve Jackson, and the feds are *so* much better
at distinguishing fantasy from reality nowadays...


.....

Maybe it wasn't Osama, it was a conspiracy between Amtrack +
office-space realtors..
