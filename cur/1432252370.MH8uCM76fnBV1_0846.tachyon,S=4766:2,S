Sigh, the truth is out there; you just need to look it up.

Pu-239 (the major isotope of weapons grade plutonium) has a half life of
over 24,000 years, and is an alpha emitter. Alphas are very, very feeble, 
and won't get past the dead outer layer of your skin.

Pu-241 (a minor contaminant) is a bigger problem since it has a half life
of only 14.4. years, and decays to americium 241. Am-241 is a gamma
emitter, and a lot more difficult to shield.

Newly processed weapons grade PU in solid lumps is relatively harmless
stuff. I wouldn't want to hold it in my bare hand, but it's a pretty low
risk
operation. Any serious mechanical processing will make dust, which 
is an entirely different scale of risk.

I have a vague memory of seeing a photo of a ?3 inch? ball of Pu (isotopic
composition unknown) in one of those old Time-Life books. The ball glowed
a dull red with it's own internal heat.

[Bet this post gets me on some list. Knowing how to use Google is
starting to be viewed as suspicious.]
