So if we propose that maybe, after doing the requisite cratering, we
*do* leave the
arabs and the rest of them to their own family feuds, we're
sympathizers?

How about if we propose executing the Saudi "kings" and making the
fucking
place a protectorate (letting their women drive cars for a change)?
Where does
that put us?  Can we get the Budweiser concession at Mecca, or do the
Czechs get that?

to the Gulf?
