A good point about the SHA2-256 + RIPEMD-160 usage that I hadn't
considered. I'll change the design to use a single truncated SHA2-256
hash. As for length extension attacks, I don't believe I should be
concerned, should I? The transfer of messages within the network is
dependent on a defined protocol, so any extra bytes would just be
interpreted as a malformed message.

Out of interest, could you elaborate on the potential weaknesses in
the pairing?


As for a decentralised identity, it's an interesting problem, but I'll
be focusing on the micropublishing idea first. With my last project, I
delved into too many areas, trying to decentralise DNS, creating an
improved Kademlia DHT, providing a framework for P2P mutable
documents. Ultimately I built nothing (but learnt a lot).

Nonetheless I think technology develops too quickly to define any sort
of single specification for an online identity. The best we have are
public keys certified by webs of trust.
