Personally I found it shocking an operating system without proper security
precautions was used for the centrifuges. If I'd tell people nuclear
warheads [run on windows | are controlled using windows] they'd laugh. I
also think it's curious that it'd take half a year to cleanse a computer
system of a virus, just re-installing whatever software runs on it would
clear anything right out! Either people are really bad at managing their
computer systems or some really bad design has been adopted.

Let's just hope the Chinese don't make the western world nuke itself.
