We are not for "democracy." Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting 
on what's for dinner.

Crypto anarchy is about undermining democracy, causing the house of 
cards to collapse.

You are welcome to "refuse to give up on our way of life." Many others 
over the centuries have similarly refused to give up on royalism...I 
hear there are even clubs where people pretend to be various archdukes 
and viscounts, and even fan clubs for the grandchildren of royals 
deposed 75 years ago.

Maybe there will be fan clubs for "democracy supporters." Maybe they 
will even launch little wars agains the royalists.

Democracy will soon be consigned to the dustbin of history.
