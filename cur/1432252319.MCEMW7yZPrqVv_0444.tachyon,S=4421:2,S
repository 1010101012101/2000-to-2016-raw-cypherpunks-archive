This morning's NSA article from WaPo contains some slides mentioning
USRP equipment[1]. It's hard to say without more context whether it's
referring to the GSM equipment from Ettus...anyone care to speculate?
The USRP series doesn't exactly seem like carrier-grade equipment, but
perhaps the NSA has a good reason to use it. Maybe baseband
exploitation, as coderman has previously mentioned? Simply getting cell
tower database dumps from the telcos would suffice for location info, so
I would guess this has a different purpose.
