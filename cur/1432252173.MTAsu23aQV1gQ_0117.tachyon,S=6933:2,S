Fine, but "average" in this context isn't as useful as measuring the top n 
percent in terms of total value of information to any given participant.

I wonder why you seem to have missed my point about services like Hushmail 
and Cotse.

Even if the technology were 100% reliable, it's a matter of common sense.  
No amount of technology will ever keep you from trusting the wrong person, 
writing down something you should have kept in your head, or blabbing when 
you should have kept your mouth shut. 

In an absolute sense, "complete privacy" is only possible with an absence 
of communication signifiers. Developing privacy-enhancing technology, on 
the other hand, is absolutely crucial. But as I agree with what Bruce 
Schneier said about there being no such thing as "absolute security", I 
think it's always going to be a matter of what's "private enough" for any 
given situation.

How "high stakes" you find posting to a mailing list depends on your 
particulars. And for me, Hushmail and Cotse are fine. If somebody is hell 
bent on fucking me over--here or elsewhere--the best remailer in the world 
won't help if they have the requisite knowledge, time, and resources.

And I never said there was anything wrong with using a remailer. It's just 
that in the context of participating in a list, I think people tend to act 
worse since they have no real (or even symbolic) attachment to anything 
they say. I used to use a remailer to post to another list every single day 
for months. But I enjoy it more being a little more connected to it the way 
I participate here, that's all.

If your goal is to get rid of the technically incompetent and improve the 
quality of the list's content, you have to weigh the possibility of the 
bullshitting troll quotient going way, way up as well. And anyway, I think 
you're overestimating the skill level needed to use one: sure, the absolute 
cretins will have to go, but it remains to be seen how much moronic 
juvenalia will still be left over. Unfortunately, being intelligent and 
being immature are not mutually exclusive.

So are you basing your assessment of who to look down on solely on whether 
or not they use PGP and remailers here, or are you going by the total 
informative content(or lack thereof)in their posts? Personally, I wouldn't 
be too quick to assume I know what anyone around here can or can't do. 


>  Many, in fact, exhibit

That is a gross misreading of what I said. In the context of 
addressing "what makes participating in a list worthwhile", I just don't 
believe dictating from on high "everyone must use a remailer" is going to 
fix all the problems you think it will. And it'll probably create a lot 
more new ones. But I could be wrong, it'll be interesting to see how it 
turns out if you actually get one going.

>(None of these comments apply to Tim May, of course.)

Interesting how you know full well when you really need to make an 
exception to your too-broad generalization about people who use their real 
names on the list.
