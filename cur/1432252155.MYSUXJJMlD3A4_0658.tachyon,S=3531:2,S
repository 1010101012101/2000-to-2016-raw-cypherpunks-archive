Oh, right.  And nobody could *possibly* dust it for fingerprints, etch a fingerprint 
into a rubber pad, and tap the rubber pad on the sensor.  That might take what, 
a whole hour? 

Plus all the replay attacks, the possibility of induction monitoring on the mouse 
cable, software that captures the digitized fingerprint from the serial buffer, 
software that replaces the file that the fingerprint data is kept in, etc... 

My biggest problem with this is that people using it will *think* their data 
is secure.
