Toll roads. Pay for what you use.

Bank at Nugen-Hand if you want privacy:

There is no "right to anonymity" in anarcho-capitalism. If there is a
market for privacy then it will be met proportional to the demand.

Talk to John Gilmore. Just kidding. An anarchocapitalist would disagree
that travel should necessarily be free. The second answer regarding
"engaging in construction and contract": an entrepreneur builds a toll
road and runs it as a business. Part of the initial investment is the
contracting with land owners. Or call yourself the state and steal the
land.

You are number 6.

The notion that tolls are "evil" is a misnomer. In the context of the
state it is potentially an additional tax. But paying to use a private
road is not evil in nature.

There's always neurocam.

This is neocorporatism. When the state fixes an auction you don't have a
free market.
