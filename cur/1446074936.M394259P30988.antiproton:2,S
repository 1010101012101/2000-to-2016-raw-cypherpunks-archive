Well written. Spooner is now one for my must read list.

The apparatus of control is certainly impressive - a quarter of a
billion people living in fear, tyranny, living for others not for
himself, on the treadmill by consent just with a little stick prodding
of force and some shiny carrot things to ease the violation,
submission, subjugation of personal will.

Sounds like we're mostly dimmis, even without Islam the submission religion.

Split the 'democratic' parliament in two with a party system, each
party has a caucus or 'elite head group', and we're down to a handful
of individuals to be paid off or blackmailed to steer the nation
continually into the hands of the bankers.

I read once that Hitler, like America's two assassinated presidents,
tried to take the money power back from the banks, and thus had to be
demonised as no other. Just conspiracy we should be sure.
