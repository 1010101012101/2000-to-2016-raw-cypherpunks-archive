Use your imagination.

We're not talking about books and soapboxing today, class. We're talking
about "papers please" being required for everything you do. Including,
among other things, your internet access at home, mobile, in the library,
coffee shop and so on. Today you can somewhat preserve your right to be
anonymous and bigdata free, by manipulating inputs to some of these
things. If you haven't noticed, that's become steadily harder over time.

Hah! That's what you think. Pending some games in the
Supreme Court (if there are any brave souls left), it's already done...

> The OP was primarily concerned about other countries.

No. China and Facebook were referenced as two that were
already doing a semantic equivalent of REAL-ID for certain
usage contexts of the internet. And it was described what will
happen if you don't act. (If you know anything about history,
it should be clear that that applies to all places on the planet,
and that failure to act gets you what they want, not what you
want.)

You can add Russia to the list now too...
