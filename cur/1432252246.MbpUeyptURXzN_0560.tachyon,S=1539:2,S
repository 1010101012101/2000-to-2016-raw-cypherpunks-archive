Hilarious! Perhaps proof too that the Remailer/Tor networks are pretty 
strong, as I can only assume that Microsoft has tried hard to find this 
person or persons.

Beyond that, though, is it legal to sue a Nym? Even in 2006, don't you have 
to actually sue an identifiable person?

In any event this is a small signpost to the Nym era.
