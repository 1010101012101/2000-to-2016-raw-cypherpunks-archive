Any given mint only needs the belief by its customers that it will 
honor (redeem) its tokens.

Such a mint can, by demonstration, be as small as a corner store 
offering gift certificates.

Naturally, the blinded nature of tokens means that customers can "ping" 
such mints as often as they like. (There is the "pack up, leave town, 
and burn customers" scam, as there always is with a bank or mint which 
has not yet redeemed all of its obligations. The best fix for this is 
to distribute monies at many such mints. It is unlikely, though 
remotely possible, that all of them or even most of them will abscond 
at the same time. Note that reputation per se does not stop this scam 
from happening even with meatspace banks. It is rare, however, as most 
banks deduce that getting a fraction of a continuing stream of business 
is more advantageous than absconding.)

Nonsense. What you are receiving for free is either tame stuff or is 
just a "free sample," for marketing purposes. Look at the reports on 
monies spent on actual busted child porn rings: these consumers are 
spending real money, not getting their stuff for free as spam.
