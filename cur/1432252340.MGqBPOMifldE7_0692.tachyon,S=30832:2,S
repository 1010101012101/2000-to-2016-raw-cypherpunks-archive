> >
>
> November 2008 will mark the 12th anniversary of e-gold's debut as an
> alternative global payment system enabling Users - individuals or
> businesses - to receive payment in gold at extremely low cost and
> without risk of the sort of payment reversals that characterize all
> credit based systems.
>
> e-gold has been a pioneer in numerous areas and I am proud of its
> innovative accomplishments. Since 1996, the Internet has witnessed
> multiple online payment initiatives, several of them funded with
> $20-90 million of start-up capital, with distinguished founders and
> executive cadre, high profile brand name strategic allies, and
> favorable reception in the business press. But whereas Digicash,
> Cybercash, Beenz, Flooz, Peppercoin and a host of others each was
> promoted as the next big thing, all of them combined cumulatively
> [in their original incarnations - some have been restructured into
> other business models] executed less transaction volume than e-gold
> did in a typical single quarter.
>
> But this note is not about success. It is about e-gold's failure to
> date to emerge, its failure to transition from a marginal player for
> early adopters to a respected institution integrated into the global
> financial mainstream. I am talking about a vision that has not yet
> been realized and a determination to fix what needs to be improved.
>
> e-gold's failure to emerge so far is a result of many factors but
> the root causes were design flaws in the account creation and
> provisioning logic that led to the unfortunate consequence of
> vulnerability to criminal abuse. Criminal abuse of the e-gold
> system, in turn, led to a self-reinforcing negative reputation.
>
> Ultimately, criminal abuse of e-gold reached the point where the US
> Department of Justice intervened, bringing criminal charges against
> e-gold Ltd., Gold & Silver Reserve., Inc., (the Operator of e-gold
> and also of the online exchange service OmniPay), myself, and the
> other directors for violations of 18 USC 1960 [Operation of an
> unlicensed Money Transmitting Business] and 18 USC 1956 [Conspiracy
> to Commit Money Laundering]. The criminal case has been resolved.
> The resolution of the criminal case however provides for a second
> chance, an opportunity to address the flaws embedded in the e-gold
> system and to transform the "e-gold Operation" into the institutions
> I, the other directors, and our longsuffering employees and
> contractors have always envisioned, one that serves to advance the
> material welfare of mankind.
>
> In harmony with this transformation, we acknowledge that e-gold is
> indeed a Financial Institution or Agency as defined in US law and
> should be regulated as a Financial Institution. E-gold Ltd. has
> submitted an application to FinCEN to be registered as a Money
> Services Business and will be seeking licensure in all states that
> require it. Most importantly, working in conjunction with US
> government agencies, we will be exerting every effort to bring e-
> gold into compliance with US law and regulation as quickly as
> possible.
>
> I am going to briefly describe the systemic problems we are
> undertaking to rectify and a roadmap of where the system is heading.
> Going from where we are now to where we need to be is going to be a
> bumpy road, especially at first. Many legitimate e-gold Users have
> already suffered loss over the past year as the measures undertaken
> by the government to prevent dissipation of assets have severely
> impacted exchange markets with resulting illiquidity of a magnitude
> as to effectively make it impracticable to exchange e-gold for
> conventional money. There will be more disruption in the next few
> months but it will be temporary and will set the stage for powerful
> new features that enhance the usability and global reach of e-gold.
> If there is a silver lining, it is that the more illiquid e-gold has
> become, the more valuable it has become due to the (apparently
> ongoing) decline of the US dollar relative to gold and other non-
> financial assets.
>
> *e-gold User Agreement Changes*
>
> Before proceeding, however, let me make something clear that should
> have been made more emphatically clear long ago. Use of the e-gold
> system for criminal activity will not be tolerated. Memorializing
> this resolve, the following provisions are being added to the e-gold
> Account User Agreement <http://www.e-gold.com/unsecure/e-g-agree.htm>:
>
> *2.3.* User agrees to not use e-gold in any manner that violates the
> laws of whatever jurisdiction to which the User is subject.
>
> *4.6.1.1.* If e-gold investigators reasonably suspect that the e-
> gold account of User is being used to launder the proceeds of crime
> or for any other criminal purpose, Issuer may freeze the e-gold
> account and any other e-gold accounts of User. Additionally, at the
> sole discretion of Issuer, User will be subject to damages and other
> penalties, including criminal prosecution where available and the
> notification of the general public of Users actions, at the sole
> discretion of Issuer.
>
> *Design flaws in legacy e-gold system*
>
> A systemic flaw in the e-gold design, present from the very
> beginning, made it vexingly difficult for e-gold to expel a User, in
> a truly effective way, for criminal abuse of the system. e-gold
> investigative staff might detect suspicious activity, block or
> freeze the offending account, and later discover the same
> perpetrator had created additional accounts.
>
> One element was logic that allowed an e-gold account full privileges
> from the moment of creation and only revoked those privileges in the
> event of suspicion that the account holder was seeking to mask their
> identity or actually engage in illicit activity.
>
> Compounding this weakness was an unrestricted ability for Users to
> create multiple accounts without any obligatory indicator that they
> were all under the control of one person.
>
> The next generation of the e-gold application will undertake to
> enforce a "one-human being/one e-gold User" rule. Instead of the
> existing logic where a User logs directly into an account, a User in
> the next generation system logs in as a User. Only validated Users
> are empowered with the ability to create multiple accounts.
>
> The advantage from the cybercrime-thwarting standpoint will be an
> ever-stronger ability to blacklist a person who has abused the e-
> gold system.
>
> e-gold is intensively working on this next generation User-based log-
> in system but it is likely to be another 6-9 months to deployment.
> Meanwhile, emergency surgery is required NOW.
>
> *Shock Therapy phase* [may it be brief!]
>
> *1)* Effective immediately, new e-gold account creation is suspended
> until a compliant interim solution for Customer Identification can
> be ensured.
>
> *2)* We are requesting that autoexchangers - even though the
> technical beauty of the autoexchanger concept is sublime  cease
> supporting exchanges to or from e-gold for the time being. The
> problem with the autoexchanger concept is that although the
> autoexchangers themselves may be perfectly compliant with
> requirements [promulgated by Webmoney and e-gold] to automatically
> put tracking data in their memo fields, and despite the fact that
> Webmoney is also committed to aiding in the suppression of
> cybercrime, the fact is that a substantial proportion of the
> cybercriminals that abuse e-gold have evolved into a modus operandi
> that involves autoexchanging possible proceeds of crime into
> Webmoney, sometimes within minutes of receiving the value, thus
> making interdiction a matter of catch-up or closing the barn door
> after the horse is gone.
>
> *Looking Forward*
>
> We are confident that a regulated e-gold rebuilt to a more
> systematic specification will be less hospitable to criminals, and
> more attractive to mainstream business use without being less
> accessible to those disregarded by legacy payment systems.
>
> Please accept our apologies for the occasional turbulence you may

> TO MONEY LAUNDERING AND ILLEGAL MONEY TRANSMITTING CHARGES
>
>       WASHINGTON  E-Gold Ltd. (E-Gold), an Internet-based digital

> pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to money laundering and
> the operation of an illegal money transmitting business, Acting
> Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich for the Criminal
> Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeffrey A.
> Taylor announced today.
>
>       E-Gold and its corporate affiliate Gold & Silver Reserve
> Inc. each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in money laundering
> and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting
> business.  The principal director of E-Gold and CEO of Gold & Silver
> Reserve Inc. (Gold & Silver Reserve), Dr. Douglas Jackson, 51, of
> Melbourne, Fla., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in money
> laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.
> E-Golds other two senior directors, Barry Downey, 48, of Baltimore,
> and Reid Jackson, 45, of Melbourne, each pleaded guilty to felony
> violations of District of Columbia law relating to operating a money
> transmitting business without a license.  E-Gold, Gold & Silver
> Reserve and the three company directors were charged in an
> indictment returned by a federal grand jury on April 24, 2007.
>
> At sentencing, E-Gold and Gold & Silver Reserve face a maximum fine
> of $3.7 million.  Douglas Jackson faces a maximum prison sentence of
> 20 years and a fine of $500,000 on the conspiracy to engage in money
> laundering charge, and a sentence of five years and a fine of
> $250,000 on the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting
> business charge.  Downey and Reid Jackson each face a maximum of
> five years in prison and a fine of $25,000.  Additionally, as part
> of the plea, E-Gold and Gold & Silver Reserve have agreed to
> forfeiture in the amount of $1.75 million in the form of a money
> judgment for which they are joint and severally liable.  Sentencing
> for all defendants has been set for Nov. 20, 2008.
>
>       In addition to the fines and prison sentences, each of the
> defendants agreed that E-Gold and Gold & Silver Reserve will move to
> fully comply with all applicable federal and state laws relating to
> operating as a licensed money transmitting business and the
> prevention of money laundering which includes registering as money
> service businesses.  Also as part of the plea agreement, the
> businesses will create a comprehensive money laundering detection
> program that will require verified customer identification,
> suspicious activity reporting and regular supervision by the
> Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Bank Secrecy Act Division, to which
> the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network delegated authority
> according to federal regulations.  E-Gold and Gold & Silver Reserve
> will hire a consultant to ensure their compliance with applicable
> law and hire an auditor to verify the companies claims that all
> transactions are fully backed by gold bullion.
>
>       Under federal law and District of Columbia law, in addition
> to other jurisdictions, the E-Gold operation was required to be
> licensed and registered as a money transmitting business.  However,
> according to information in plea materials, the E-Gold operation
> functioned as a money transmitting business without registering with
> the federal government and without a license in the District of
> Columbia.  Because these businesses and individuals illegally failed
> to register and follow applicable regulations under federal and
> District of Columbia laws, the resulting lack of oversight and
> required procedures created an atmosphere where criminals could use
> e-gold, or digital currency, essentially anonymously to further
> their illegal activities.
>
>       Specifically, according to information contained in plea
> materials, the E-Gold operation provided digital currency services
> over the Internet through two sites: www.e-gold.com and
> www.Omnipay.com
> .  Several characteristics of the E-Gold operation made it
> attractive to users engaged in criminal activity, such as not
> requiring users to provide their true identity, or any specific
> identity.  The E-Gold operation continued to allow accounts to be
> opened without verification of user identity, despite knowing that
> e-gold was being used for criminal activity, including child
> exploitation, investment scams, credit card fraud and identity
> theft.  In addition, E-Gold assigned employees with no prior
> relevant experience to monitor hundreds of thousands of accounts for
> criminal activity.  They also participated in designing a system
> that expressly encouraged users whose criminal activity had been
> discovered to transfer their criminal proceeds among other e-gold
> accounts.  Unlike other Internet payment systems, the E-Gold
> operation did not include any statement in its user agreement
> prohibiting the use of e-gold for criminal activity.
>
> By failing to comply with money laundering laws and regulations,
> the E-Gold operation created an environment ripe for exploitation by
> criminals seeking anonymity in conducting online transactions, said
> Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich.  This case

> the applicable rules and regulations created to ensure lawful
> monetary transactions.
>
> The operations of E-Gold Ltd. and the other defendants undermined

> and created opportunities for criminal activity, said U.S. Attorney
> Taylor.  Because of the successful prosecution of these defendants,

>
> The Secret Service is pleased with the successful outcome of the E-
