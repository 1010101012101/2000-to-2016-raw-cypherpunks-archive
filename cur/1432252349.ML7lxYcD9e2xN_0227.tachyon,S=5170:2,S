WTF, seriously... 

What crypto-nerds fail to understand is human-factors, and use-of-force,
because properly run BANKS call in guys with guns when money gets stolen,
and if it's stolen electronically, transactions get reversed.

If you think MtGox is incompetent, then show me the fucking code of a better
exchange, or shut the fuck up. If you think you need 'money' to build such
a thing, then you have even less of a grasp on the human factors than the
banks do on cryptographic secrets.

If you think you need 'money' to write a better exchange, then you are just
another crypto-snake-oil salesman, and are WORSE than Gox, who at least gave
us a good example of failure.

However, if you want to put your code (and failures) where your mouth is,
I'll give you free room and board if you show me good code, and an honest
effort to learn from failure. Nowhere in this exchange is money involved.
