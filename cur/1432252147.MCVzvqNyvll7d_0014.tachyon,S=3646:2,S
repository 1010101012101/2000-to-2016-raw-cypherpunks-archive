Regarding "digital notes circulating in the wild without server 
contact," you need to look at some of the articles here (Cypherpunks) 
from around 1994-97 on "money changing."

Cf. articles by Doug Barnes, Ian Goldberg, myself, and others. 
Accessible via Google.

Basically, there is no reason why intermediaries will not develop who 
agree to take in digital money and issue new digital money, for a fee.

The operation of making change is just this.

In principle, and probably fairly quickly in practice, the connection 
with an "issuing bank" (whatever that strange thing may be) is not 
needed often.

"Everyone a moneychanger" and "agnostic" systems work for reasons that 
would take a lot of time to get into. Several dozen articles, as noted 
above, get into this.

Having a solid, robust, core system of first-class objects is a step we 
haven't had. The Mark Twain Bank system was too expensive to do 
experiments with (and didn't last long enough), and so on for other toy 
systems.
