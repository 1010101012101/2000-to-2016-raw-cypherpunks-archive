Fine.  My basis for my claim is that the NSA is the best funded and
best equiped electronic intelligence agency in the world, and they
have employed some of the smartest people in the world.

Fine, it's a claim made by the clueless.  I'm not claiming to be
something other than clueless, but I am claiming to have not meant
what I sent to this list.  Again, not a good proofreader.  Again, sue me.

enough to evaluate my qualification as a twit.

Get off your fucking high horse.
