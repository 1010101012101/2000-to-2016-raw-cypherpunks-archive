I'm confused here.  Is possession of castor beans possession of ricin?  
Is possession of chopped castor beans possession of ricin?

I could pick up a container of Drano, and make the same commment.  Big 
deal.

Still legal to own, as far as I know.

Obviously this news story is the grand prize winner in an innuendo 
contest.

And WTF does this have to do with the guy with the castor beans?

Looks like "Ricin Theatre" has joined "Anthrax Theatre" in the armory of 
Weapons of Mass Deception.
