Issues
When looking at antitrust it seems prudent to consider, to whatever degree 
possible, whether regulatory intervention achieves the intended goals or 
whether it merely substitutes one set of problems for another.  Market 
dominance/penetration has been a major issue in antitrust.  Reduction of 
consumer choice through stifling of innovation should be included with 
predatory pricing and other consumer impacts in consideration of antitrust.

At a workshop presentation last spring I suggested a non-regulatory way to 
include reduction in choice effects.  Under the proposed changes Congress 
would set market size and penetration limits for all markets (based on SIC 
or its newer offspring) exceeding some minimum size threshold (e.g., 0.1% 
GNP) and enabling competitors to sue in federal court for removal of 
trademarks and copyrights of the monopolist related to the industry in 
question.  Since trademarks and copyrights are privileges and not rights 
they can, theoretically, be rescinded.

Under this new regimen companies would be inclined to self-police rather 
than risk legal proceedings from their competitors.  By setting legal 
market share limits and placing the initiative in the hands of competitors 
rather than the DOJ it is hoped to remove much of the political involvement 
in antitrust.
