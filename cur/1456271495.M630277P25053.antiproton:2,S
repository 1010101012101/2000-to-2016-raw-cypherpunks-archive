How *do* you make a complete backup of the stored content of a 
sealed device with an internal battery that can, and should, if
properly designed, wipe it's internal crypto keys if opened?

A sufficiently savvy niche market device vendor like apple would
not do this 'for user privacy', they'd do it prevent the attack
of the cheap phone clones.

Now, the particularly iphone in question probably has a flash 
chip I could read the (encrypted) data out of rather easily with
schematics obtained from an underpayed apple campus janitor, or
with moderate difficulty with a few 10-15 sacrificial phones.

So it seems there should be a market for phones with strong crypto
tamper-protection to maintain both evidentiary integrity, AND force
public disclosure of any attempts to pull data off said phones.

Would it be a good trade for Gov, Industry, and Public to agree 
that if the Gov wants the data on a device considered 'evidence', 
that *everyone* gets the data, or no-one at all gets the data?

Can such an 'evidence disclosure' protocol be *securely* designed?

Might it look something like bitcoin multi-sig, where N of M 
parties must swear under oath, in multiple jurisdictions that 
the encrypted blob has been made public, and can each add their
portion of the multi-sig key to the public record?
