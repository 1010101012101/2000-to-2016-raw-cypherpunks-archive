Yes, it was subtle. But it was also, as I understand it, pointless
except as an attack. And it was new behavior, right?

But still, it wasn't fair to say "ignored". They just didn't see it.

Right. And they apparently didn't start looking until the Black Hat talk
was announced. I did note that they might have been blindsided by a zero
day vulnerability.

I'm not technical enough to answer that. But generally, I think that
they ought to put more effort into monitoring. Especially for new
relays. Look for anything unusual.
