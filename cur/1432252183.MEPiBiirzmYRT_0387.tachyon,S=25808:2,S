          MA Union News Reports New Smith & Wesson Super-Light
                                 Guns
             Could Be Carried By Flight Crews On Commercial
                                Airliners

        In the Spring of this year, Stockupticks brought you
        the story of a small-cap company that produced firearm
        safety and security products. That company,
        Saf-T-Hammer (OTC BB: SAFH) later acquired legendary
        gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. One of the products in
        development at that time was a gun made from a new,
        lightweight, exotic-metal alloy making the gun easier
        to carry and conceal. Due to interest in using this
        weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners,
        the dealer response has been tremendous.

                 Lightweight revolvers hot item for S&W

          Wednesday, October 24, 2001
          By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN

          A new line of ultra-light revolvers in stores this
          month is proving a success for Smith & Wesson, which
          can't keep up with demand. The new guns are among the
          first in the world to use scandium, a metal that has
          been used in Russian fighter jets and baseball bats.
          They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label
          and all are capable of firing a powerful .357-caliber
          Magnum round that had been previously unavailable in
          such a lightweight gun.

          The smaller revolvers, which weight just over 11
          ounces, have been shipping for several weeks; larger
          guns should reach dealers in the coming days.
          "It's a hot item," said Herb A. Belin, handgun
          product manager for Smith & Wesson. "Our constraint
          is our production rate." The guns are more expensive
          than stainless-steel revolvers. New guns carry a
          suggested price of between $700 and $800 each.

          The lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people
          who want them for personal defense, especially those
          with permits to carry concealed weapons, Belin said.
          Officials said developing the guns using the new
          metal took longer than expected and taught them some
          lessons in metallurgy. In high-speed video footage of
          the gun firing, the frame and barrel moved
          dramatically due to the scandium alloy's flexibility.
          "That gun does the rumba," Belin said.

          Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun
          to reduce flexing. Titanium was used in the cylinder
          for strength, but testing showed it was also needed
          in the center pin and other parts of the weapon.
          Steel is used for the hammer and trigger. "This
          taught us to make even stronger, tougher guns," Belin
          said.

          Scandium is a little-known metal that occupies a
          place on the periodic table immediately before
          titanium. Discovered in the late 1800s, it found use
          in the former Soviet Union, which had a virtual
          monopoly on the supply from the Ukraine. The Soviets
          used it in fighter jets and missile parts. When the
          Soviet Union broke up, the metal began to see more
          widespread use, for example in aluminum baseball bats
          and mountain bike frames.

          Although scandium costs about $7,000 a pound, the
          amount needed to mix with aluminum and other alloying
          agents is small. Adding a little scandium to aluminum
          strengthens the material more than twofold, Belin
          said.

          Its weight will increase the number of people willing
          to carry it, Belin said. "You don't need a holster.
          You can carry it in your pocket."

          The lightest of the scandium guns is less than half
          of the weight of the lightest .357-caliber Magnum the
          company made before. Because of their light weight
          and flexible scandium-aluminum alloy frame, the guns
          deliver a rapid "kick" to the hands of the person
          firing them. "Recoil is an issue," Belin said.

          The gun can fire less-powerful rounds than the .357
          magnum, for example the .38 special, that can reduce
          recoil. "You really have to work at not flinching
          (when firing,)" Belin said.

          Smith & Wesson officials believe there may be another
          market for the super-light guns. They have developed
          a prototype scandium alloy gun that could be carried
          by flight crews on commercial airliners. There have
          been calls for flight crews to be armed, although no
          steps have been taken by the government in that
          direction.

          The Smith & Wesson prototypes are black with an
          internal hammer, so they could be carried in a
          trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the
          fabric. The guns could be modified to fire a
          lower-velocity round, which is less likely to cause
          damage to an aircraft, officials said.

          The prototype air crew guns have not been publicly
          revealed before, Belin said. A spokesman said the
          prototypes are simply a design concept and will not
          necessarily be produced or be shared with people
          outside the company.

<p>Wednesday, October 24, 2001

<p>A new line of ultra-light revolvers in stores this month is proving
