Fat chance. For some strange reason you must have missed that no one
trusts a single sentence coming from Redmond, rightfully suspecting it has
been cleared by if not originated in the local Ministry for Propaganda and
Disinfo.

We knew which party line you're relaying, but you shouldn't come on so

really have a far easier time channelling Dr. Goebbels.
