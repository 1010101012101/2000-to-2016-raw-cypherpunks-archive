I think this was Petro, who I think was a Marine, and therefore should know 
better.
The Uniform Code of Military Justice *requires* soldiers to
refuse to obey illegal orders.
Police generally are required to uphold the Constitution,
and no amount of weaseling about "I'm not the departmental legal counsel,
I'm the guy with the blue suit" relieves them of that responsibility.
There are substantial differences between these two situations -
usually an illegal order to a soldier involves shooting people,
while an unconstitutional action by a cop involves arresting people
or serving warrants on them, which can be argued about later,
so it's far more critical that a soldier individually do the right thing,
even though an inappropriate refusal by a soldier can result in lots of
dead people, while an incorrect refusal or inaction by a cop
only results in somebody not getting arrested or the
city's insurance company paying a bunch of lawyers for a lawsuit.

It's both.  And enforcement of laws typically has a huge latitude -
the DMCA doesn't say anything about refusing to give Dmitri a bail hearing,
or whether to take every piece of electronics in a "hacker's" house.
The "I know it when I see it" test for obscenity is very broad.
And the property-forfeiture-for-drugs laws may allow police to
steal anything nailed down or not if they think they can make a case
that there might have been drugs around that the victim won't have
the resources to successfully defend against, but don't require it,
and enforcement seems suspiciously correlated with which police
departments make a profit from doing it.

Certainly Janet Reno and Louis Freeh were a bad lot and we're well rid of them,
but Ashcroft's belief in the Constitution certainly appears not to
include the First Amendment.  We'll see how much he likes the others
as he goes along.

I strongly disagree.
Let's start with a terminology rant -
Cops used to call themselves "peace officers".  Sure, it was propaganda,
but the point is that they're there to "serve and protect"  (at least for 
the upper classes.)
Or they claimed they were in the "Justice" business.
Now they're calling themselves "Law Enforcement", trying to use the
culture's leftover respect for "law" as a protection of individual rights,
rather than its current meaning of "whatever the legislature writes",
whether that's special-interest support like the DMCA or
religious/cultural preferences like the laws against some drugs,
and trying to use this to justify the use of however much force it takes
to force people to obey.  No different from what an invading army does.

If a cop believes that a law is unconstitutional or unjust,
then if anything his job is not to resign and let someone else enforce it,
but to prevent its enforcement, at least through inaction
if not through active reorganization of the police force.
If equal application of the law has a part to play here,
it's in getting other cops NOT to impose injustice,
not in copping out by imposing injustice himself or quitting.

         [Example 1 - people don't know if they'll be pulled over by Good 
Cop or Bad Cop, especially near town border.]
         [Example 2 - Good Sheriff replaced by Officer Hardass. ]

It's still wrong to enforce unjust laws, and also to enforce 
unconstitutional ones.
If a law's on the books, the citizens have to decide individually whether 
to obey them.
The examples given involved concealed handguns and searches for same -
if police are doing unconstitutional searches, there are problems anyway.
Problems with differing laws at borders are difficult anyway,
but having a location where laws are enforced less strictly is certainly
no risk for the neighbors, and we've already got enough laws that you're
probably violating some of them without even realizing it.

A friend of mine has a button that says "if the public were required to
*know* all the laws, and not merely to obey them, there'd be a revolution 
tomorrow"....
