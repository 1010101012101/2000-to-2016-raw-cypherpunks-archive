Probably because the passengers and crew never thought they 
were in any serious danger as historically there has been no similar 
suicide hijackings in the US.  No one knew with certainty they were 
going to die.  If they knew they were going to die they may have 
fought back.

My guess would be if a similar attack was tried next week the 
passengers would fight back as they don't have much to lose.  But 
then, we are trained by our government and law enforcement not to 
take matters into our own hands as only the proper authorities can 
act appropriately.

Listening to the news reports it has been noted many times there 
was a failure in intelligence gatherings and more resources, read 
more money and less personal freedom, will be required to counter 
such threats in the future.  It was also mentioned that a simple 
terrorist group would be incapable of mounting such an attack.

There is no reason a group could not organize such a project with a 
week's notice once you know airport security is going to let you 
pass with pocket knifes and cardboard box cutters.  Bully the 
stewardess, break down the door to the cockpit, get the pilot to turn 
around and point the aircraft in the right direction, once you see 
your destination chase the flight crew away (craft would not be on 
autopilot) and steer the craft to the target.  The plane targeting the 
Pentagon apparently hit the ground before hitting the structure, 
almost a failure to achieve its target.  The aircraft crashing in PA 
totally missed its target.

I don't see where only a terrorist group backed by the resources of 
a national government could pull this off.  A week or two for planning 
and a group of people who can keep their mouth's shut plus the 
most important quality, big gonads and a desire to die for a 
perceived purpose.

My guess would be that the final analysis will show these terrorists 
were more lucky then skilful.  They were lucky to get past airport 
security, or airport security was that bad (what do you expect when 
you use near minimum wage labor with no leadership, vision or 
goals), they were lucky the passengers never fought back, they 
were lucky the weather allowed great visibility, they were lucky the 
cockpit is not secure and they were pretty lucky in hitting their 
targets.

Unfortunately the American people are the unlucky ones, paying the 
price in pain and suffering, increased taxation and the probable 
loss of freedom the government solution will entail.

I don't know if having a plane load of armed angry drunks crammed 
into inadequate seating with surly cabin staff is a viable solution.  
Having a citizenry which is willing to question authority and willing to 
act accordingly in crisis situations would help but would probably 
offend the powers that be.
