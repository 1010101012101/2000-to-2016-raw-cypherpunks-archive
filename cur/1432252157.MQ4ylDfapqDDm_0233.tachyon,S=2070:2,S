Im suffering from a very severe case of the traveling itch. i feel like i havent been on a real trip if forever (vegas and san diego definitely dont count)...i think that i should probably save up all of my vacation time so that i can do a big trip in december - india or greece. but i dont know if i can hold out that long - im going stir-crazy here. bombi, padh and i have been talking about going to greece for such a long time, but i havent been to india in so long, ahhh, what to do? just cant wait to go somewhere and have amazing food and get lost in another language.


until next time


Claire
