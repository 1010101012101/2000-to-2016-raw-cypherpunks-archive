A consequence of issuing subpoenas to news folks
is to inhibit their reporting on the trial, for witnesses are
excluded from the proceedings, at least before their
testimony -- I'm not sure about exclusion after testimony.

No doubt a rich publisher will assign a second reporter
to cover the trial. Which is what superrich Cryptome will 
do, as well as get daily transcripts, hopefully in digital form
for immediate publication -- even to be laptopped by those
excluded from the trial. Unless this public announcement
precludes this 1A plot. If so, then we'll go to backups 1, 2, 3
and so on.

Anybody know who the second subpoenaed reporter is?

Jeff answered the inquiry about my GJ transcript: "don't
get your hopes up. I've never heard of that happening,
instead only portions of GJ testimony are available if
introduced at the trial." That's not what Robb told me
before testifying, but then he's a mouther rather than
a shooter like Jeff.

Anybody who thinks questions posed during testimony 
will be limited to what was assured beforehand has got 
to be from Pluto. Same credulity for "off the record."

The feds will tell you anything to get your cooperation.
And leave to your imagination and planted news stories
what will happen if you don't. Jim Bell is a poster boy
for that, and I continue to believe that's his role, probably
with his help, coerced or willing.

This is not to say that journalists, any seducer, are so 
different. That's the problem with privilege and
pulling rank -- they're a corrupting, contemptous 
divide of us-winners/you-losers. And do seducers
scream when their scams are exposed.

Robb wants the attention poster boy Declan can give 
his vendetta, the gov's intention to show who runs
cyber-space and -spacers.
