The announced purpose of TCPA/Palladium is to introduce some
intermediate cases.  For example you could compile your own code,
and then encrypt it so that it can only run on a specific target
computer.

As somone who sells code, I would think this would be a great
idea, were it not for the excesses we have been seeing from the IP
lobbyists.
