Last Minute Comments:

* Meeting/BBQ/Party at Tim May's house, Saturday, September 14th, 1 
p.m. onwards. Formal agenda to start promptly at 2 p.m.

* I've had a lot of confirmations (not required, except for lurkers and 
strangers) from a lot of people, so PARKING is OFFICIALLY BECOMING A 
PROBLEM. I live at the top of a  hill serviced by a one-lane road going 
from the valley floor up several hundred feet to my driveway above. I 
have had parties where about 15 cars were in one of several places:

-- my own parking lot, handling about 4-5 cars besides my own 2.

-- my driveway, handling about 4-6 more cars, depending on whether they 
block others!

-- the side of the road at the very top of the hill, handling 3-5 other 
cars

-- the rest, I'm not sure where they parked!

* Those who arrive earliest will of course get the best parking, but 
may also get hemmed in (blocked) by later arrivals. (FILO)

* OK, so you've again been warned. TRY TO CARPOOL. Twelve cars carrying 
2-3 people each will give us a normal 20-30 person attendance. Twenty 
or thirty cars will be a disaster.

* About 8 people, counting couples, have contacted me about sleeping 
space. The two spare bedrooms are spoken for, and the sofas are spoken 
for. For those who still want to stay over, there's some space on the 
floor. Be sure if you think you might stay to bring a sleeping bag or 
blankets, etc. Also, you may need to go out and move your car around if 
others are blocked.

* Directions again follow.

* Several interesting talks are expected...more can be done ad hoc. In 
addition, I hope we can talk about meaty issues of where things are 
going, besides just the usual griping about new laws. Cypherpunks write 
code.

I look forward to seeing you there!

Getting to Tim May's house in Corralitos:
427 Allan Lane (MapQuest works well). 831-728-0152

 From Santa Cruz, south on Highway 1. Take Freedom Boulevard exit in 
Aptos. Go inland, on Freedom Blvd.  Travel about 5 miles, to first stop 
sign. Take a left on Corralitos Road. At the the next stop sign, the 
Corralitos Market (good sausages!) will be on your left. Just before 
the stop sign, bear right on Brown's Valley Road. Cross bridge and then 
bear left as Brown's Valley Road turns. Travel about one mile to Allan 
Lane, on the right.

Allan Lane is at about the "360" mailbox point on Brown's Valley 
Road...if you go too far and enter the redwoods, turn back! Drive to 
top of hill on Allan Lane.  At top, bear left, over a small rise, past 
a house on the left, then down my driveway. My house will be the white 
stucco semi-Spanish style, with a red Explorer and black Mercedes in 
the driveway.

Note for parties: You can park either in my driveway or at the top of 
the hill and walk a few hundred feet. Don't block any driveways!

 From points south of Santa Cruz, take Green Valley Road exit off of 
Highway 1. Travel about 2 miles to Freedom Boulevard. Turn left. Then 
right at Corralitos Road.
