Bitcoin does not have to end with the pyramid scheme outcome - where it
stalls and all those still holding any lose - so long as there remain people
willing to exchange goods for bitcoin after the dust has settled.

Anyway my point is even if the deployment phase is a wild ride, with some
winners and some late losers who bought in above the final stable value, so
long as a stable value results at the end, I dont see that as a big problem.

Its not like we havent had bubbles and instability in various phases of any
other forms of money or assets.

If you take out the speculation, currently with people minting coins until
they get to 21 million coins that would be inflation (limited inflation due
to the mining cost); but also that more people are joining is deflationary
(less coins per person).  Then there is supply and demand - supply from
minting (so long as the sell price is above minting cost), supply from
people cashing out, and demand from people buying in.  Cashing out and
buying in maybe for trading or speculation.

Once the 21 million coins are created bitcoin would remain deflationary
during the next phase as until the user base grows to saturation.  Once
bitcoin grows to saturation, the remaining deflation would be limited by the
underlying population and economic growth.  That might be workable rate of
deflation.
