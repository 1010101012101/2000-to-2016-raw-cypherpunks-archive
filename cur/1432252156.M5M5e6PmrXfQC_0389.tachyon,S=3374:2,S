"Non libertarian anarchy?"

Libertarian socialism,anarchy.anarcho-sydicalism,green anarchy,eko Anarki 
yes.(Libertarian anarchy?: Redundant.)

"The trouble is that a lot of socialists call themselves
anarchists either as a simple cynical lie:
(parody of standard commie liar)
: : "This time the state really will wither away.
: : Trust us. We are different. Once we have total
: : power over you and yours you will love it."

Yes,so? They are quite easy to expose and I pursue chomsky,Klein and others 
to pin them down.I oppose the state above all.The biggest most 
dangerous(amerdika) first.All anarchists should do the same IMHO.

: "I am really opposed to concentrated authority,
: : therefore when I and people like me have all the
: : necessary power to do all the good we intend to
: : do to those selfish ignorant ungrateful masses,
: : it will be the opposite of concentrated
: : authority."

I AM really opposed to concentrated authority! Thats why Im an anarchist 
and NOT a 'libertarian' I dont seek 'necessary power' for anything except 
operation soft drill.I have great faith in the spontaneous altruistic 
enlightened grateful masses to overthrow the last empire.You sound a little 
bitter and twisted on this subject james,are you OK?
