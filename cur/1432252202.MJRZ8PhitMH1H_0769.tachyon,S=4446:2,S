    Gore and Bush: Equal-Opportunity Censors?
    posted by cicero on Tuesday October 17, @10:58PM
    from the affirmative-action-for-censorhappy-politicos dept.

    There was something absent from this evening's presidential debate,
    and it wasn't Al's horn-blowing sighs or Dubya's runny-nosed
    sniffles. What was missing was an appreciation for the benefits
    of free speech, the perils of blocking software, and the hazards
    of blaming the world's woes on the Internet. In response to an
    audience question about "the morality of our country," both candidates
    talked up rating systems, blamed Hollywood, and recommended having the
    government help parents who have, allegedly, failed. Al Gore, who
    likes to talk about privacy, waxed downright Carnivorous over a
    "feature that allows parents to automatically check, with one click,
    what sites your kids have visited lately.. if you can check up on
    them, then you -- that's real power." Quoth Bush, who had similar
    ideas: "There ought to be filters in public libraries, and filters in
    public schools, so that if kids get on the Internet, there's not going
    to be pornography or violence coming in." Bush was talking about
    legislation currently before Congress that ties filtering to checks
    from the Feds.
