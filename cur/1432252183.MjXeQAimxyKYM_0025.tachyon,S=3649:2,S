Of course you do Jimbo, but I guess you already know your limits.

$96 bucks and a good har har on poor old Sandy and arrogant young BU.

The test is on October 6 at the University of Texas at Austin and
Huston-Tillotson College.

	The LSAT (Law School Admission Test)
	is a half-day standardized test
	required for admission to all 197
	law schools that are members of the
	Law School Admission Council (LSAC).
	It provides a standard measure of
	reading and verbal reasoning skills...

"Reading and verbal reasoning"?  Why it should be a walk in the park for a
smart cookie like Jimbo.  [Irony alert.]
