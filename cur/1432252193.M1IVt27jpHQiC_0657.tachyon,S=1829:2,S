The security app note is also entertaining reading.  For example it lists one
of the motivations for getting security right as "your husband may find out
...".  On why they didn't save a copy of the test data for the NIST suite:
"(Hey, do you have 10TB of disk drives lying around? We can fill a 30 GB drive
with raw bits in a little more than 30 minutes - if the drive controller can
keep up with us.)".  And a little further on it refers readers to "Marketing
quote from CRI" (which was a slip-up this time).  The app note was actually
written by humans.  Cool.

Peter.
