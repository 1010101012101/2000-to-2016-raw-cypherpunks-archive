The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you wil| sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
