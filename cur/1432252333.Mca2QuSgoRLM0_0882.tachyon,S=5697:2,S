Well, I don't know who's responsible, but teaching what basically amounts to 
a liberal arts cirriculum is almost certainly useless in the inner cities, 
and black kids know this...they want something they can USE. Things like 
authomotive repair or, perhaps, airline baggage screening probably makes a 
lot more sense.


"I don't give a shit whether they're "fully human" or not. I only care that 
they stop stealing from me, that liberal Jews stop saying that my taxes have 
to be increased to support these "fully human" bags of shit."

Well, this is where you lose a lot of credibility on this list, despite your 
sometimes farily acute technical observations.  Let's just say that your 
'philosophy' has concluded that it's probably better for the "useless 
eaters" be burned off, and that this would be good for the planet (the scary 
thing is that it's becomming obvious that in the near future neither the 
planet nor human society will really need 6 billion or more people). So this 
is your "philosophy"...fine. But you seem to have little or no emotion or 
sympathy towards those 'lumpen proletariat' (cue commentary on term by James 
Donald)...in other words, these are people who love/hate/fear/lust/eat just 
like you, and who don't regard themselves as 'useless', and yet it would 
seem that history just might pass them by, and that there may be a large 
segment of human population that will (in the short run) be marginalized, 
and in the long run be wiped out (according to your philosophies), 
apparently in some terrible and painful cataclysm.

That your philosophies seemed to have erased any interhuman emotion you may 
have in this context seems strange. And no, I'm not suggesting that you cry 
your way out of your ideas, but recognize that if your ideas are correct, 
they're tragic. That which is 'inevitable' and also cataclysmic and 
(arguably) avoidable may also easily be tragic. Hell...that's probably the 
very definition of tragic, and in the most pessimistic of appraisals (ie, 
yours) the fate of American black folks (with many, possibly millions of 
exceptions) might easily be tragic, and that's a shame, like all human 
suffering.

As you can probably tell, I've never read many secondary or tertiary 
sources. (ie, as a physicist I've always considered it of dubious usefulness 
to read ABOUT physics...) I've only read the few more famous von Neumann 
journal articles I've come across w.r.t. cellular automata...I actually 
thought he had only written two or three, and I don't remember his ideas of 
self-replicating machines as including something like a GA, but then again 
it's easily possible I didn't pick up on the ramifications of what I was 
reading (which is granted when I was much younger).

Well, perhaps he's just wise to his market.

If true, this is tragic. You might argue that it's necessary, "good" and 
inevitable, but it's still tragic. Some of these people will be living lives 
of very high quality, despite their "need for killing". If you got out more, 
you might know that.
