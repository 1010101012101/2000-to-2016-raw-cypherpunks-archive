I have two points to make about this:

a) We can't change the licence (until we rewrite the whole thing).

b) I like BSD-style licences because it means people get to use the 
software even if they are doing the wrong thing - but I do hope they'll 
see the light in the end and do the right thing.

Correct answer: contribute the patches back to OpenSSL, then you don't 
have this problem.

That's probably fuller of holes than I care to think about.

Vulnerable or potentially flakey would be their choice until you've done 
your testing. I know what I would choose.

There would have been patches, too, of course.

Because they know that the attackers know, too, of course.

Cheers,
