Toronto Sun:

 5 million on terrorism list
 Canuck: U.S. on the lookout for 'potential problem'
 By TOM GODFREY, TORONTO SUN

 U.S. security agents have a master list of five million people worldwide
thought to be potential terrorists or criminals, officials say. "The U.S.
lookout index contains some five million names of known terrorists and
other persons representing a potential problem," Brian Davis, a senior
Canadian immigration official in Paris, said in a confidential document
obtained by the Sun.

 Names on the list are compared against those applying for visas or on
flights travelling to the U.S.

 Anyone whose name is on the list is questioned or banned from entering the
U.S. -- as passengers were on two British Airways flights to Los Angeles
two weeks ago.

 The master list was revealed by U.S. embassy officials to a Canadian
standing immigration committee in April 2002. Its existence was revealed in
Davis' document, obtained by Montreal lawyer Richard Kurland through an
Access to Information request.

 Davis said Canadian visa officers abroad do not keep an extensive list
like the U.S. because terrorists can use bogus documents and change their
identities.

 "We examine each application according to profiles," he said. "(We) apply
experience and knowledge gained from a variety of sources. Canada's
approach to identifying persons who may pose a danger was as sound as
possible."

 CSIS agents in Paris send a "brief" to Ottawa for cases that require more
in-depth investigation.
