The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|l 
as A|berta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wil| 
announce further details as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it wil| be able to bui|d a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing a|| possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wi|| have the 
OppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri|ling program, which 
will a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."


Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .O9

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
