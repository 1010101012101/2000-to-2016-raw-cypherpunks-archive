Damn, so obviously I don't need to apply for any jobs requiring a security
clearance. Should have used one of them newfangled 'nymous remailers, and

Well, of *course* one best searches for the lost car key under a
streetlight, especially if one can be observed in execution of one's sworn
duties (namely, to surf & to protect). And, who knows, one *might* find a
car key, if one would search long and hard enough.

Your tax money at work, and all. Why am I not surprised.

Hmm, so this means a have to find an accomplice who has never published
anything online, thus being clear of an author fingerprint before
revealing my nefarious plans for world domination. It was sure easier,
back in the olden days...
