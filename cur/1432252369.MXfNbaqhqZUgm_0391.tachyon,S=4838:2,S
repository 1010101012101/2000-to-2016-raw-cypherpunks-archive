Seems to me there are more interesting things to spend time on than 
refuting Choate.

Item: There are huge numbers of reported cases (no, I don't have URLs, 
but I have heard testimonials directly, for example) of guys who lied 
about their ages to enlist. (Some later rose high in the ranks...). This 
is hard to do if a birth certificate is "required." I take this as 
strong evidence that birth certificates were not universally required, 
probably not even _usually_ required.

Item: Many hobos, drifters, and the like enlisted. Not a lot of them 
were in contact with their birth towns, or even knew where there birth 
towns were. I doubt many of them ever managed to get a copy of their 
birth certificates.

Item: Assumed names were, and still are to some extent, common in 
America. I doubt many able-bodied men were turned down for military 
service just because they'd changed their name one or more times.

Of course, in Choate Prime, the reality sometimes parallel to our own, 
but usually not, men routinely avoided the draft by the simple stratagem 
of not remembering where their mothers said they were born, thus making 
getting a birth certificate impossible. "Sorry, I have no idea where I 
was born. Momma says we moved around a lot. So I can't get a birth 
certificate. Be seein' ya!"
