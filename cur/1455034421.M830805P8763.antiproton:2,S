Hey Steve,

I've never posted much to CPunks, preferring to listen when people who
now no longer post such as Peter Gutmann, John Young, Eugen Leitl,
Cathal Garvey, Griffen Boyce, and others. My first post to the cpunks
list that I've archived was in early 2010, in a discussion of Mozilla
Perspectives. That was back when the CPunks list discussed things of
that nature, rather than "racial strength," which is assuredly
crypto-white nationalism (in the "attempting to disguise" sense, not in
the "cryptographically secure" sense).

Most of the people I name above no longer post. I notice the first post
I see from you is from 2014, which might indicate you missed this period
of the cpunks list. You might want to read some of the archives from the
previous five years, rather than limiting yourself to the last six
months. This list used to be quite good and contained reasoned
discussion of a variety of technical topics.=20

As for ideology, I use my real name on this list because I'm already
openly anarchist and cypherpunk in my meatspace identity and see no
reason to hide this. However, you seem confused on the nature of
anarchism. As a rejection of all forms of coercion and hierarchy,
anarchism is both implicitly and explicitly feminist, anti-racist,
anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist. If you're still confused about
this, I suggest "Said the pot to the kettle: Feminism for anarchist
men." It's very basic, but if you find it too basic you can look at the
recommended further readings for more advanced topics. If you do
consider yourself an anarchist, I urge you to meditate on why you chose
to embrace anarchism as an ideology, and whether those reasons also
compel you to embrace feminism and anti-racism as explicitly as
anarchism.=20

If you're a "libertarian," I urge you to stop using a word that
everywhere but the united states means "anarchist" in the sense I have
been using it and in the sense anarchists throughout history have used
it including but not limited to Emma Goldman, Assata Shakur, and Bill
Haywood, and instead say "neo-feudalist" which is perhaps more
appropriate.=20

Cypherpunk technology always appealed to me as an anarchist because it
equalizes all people against those who would attempt to oppress them.
Technology does have the capacity to be liberating. But for that ideal
to be realized, the communities around those technologies need be at
best ideologically neutral. If a black liberationist, who should be the
ally of any anarchist, came on this list today, I'm sure she would be
dissuaded from using any actually secure technology because the tone of
this list has shifted from discussing cypherpunk technology, to "racial
strength" and arguing over whether people should have the "free speech"
right to build fascism.=20

The only way this can happen is if people like you look inside yourself
and decide what side you're on.=20
