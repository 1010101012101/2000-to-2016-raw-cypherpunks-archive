The public schools do teach this much, but it's an elective.  I didn't like 
Vo. Ag.

Yes, if you ONLY restrict inflation, those who come first can purchase your 
full stock and resell it to a higher bidder later.  Simple supply and 
demand.  From my perspective, this would only work if the government also 
limited the buyers to a set amount, and then included some element to 
restrict someone from hitting several stores for the same quota.  The three 
methods I can see to do the latter are, stiff penalties for buying more 
than allowed, ration tickets, and both.

Did the government have such limits in place?

Good luck,

Sean
