Surely giving Obama the Nobel Peace Prize before he had done
anything except talk about what he would do to end persistent
warmaking must indicate that all he had to do was talk the talk
to arouse delirium for Woodrow Wilson method acting.

Kissinger was called a war criminal for that and remains on the
wanted list (not really) of some countries who love Obama who 
does not appear to be Strangelove in Ghandi drag.

Talkers, aka diplomats and scholars and national security
experts and judges and lawyers and peace-niks and anti-war 
NGOs and foreign policy tanks and RANDs and anti-WMDs, 
provide excellent amply rewarded apologia for war-threat 
beneficiaries like themselves. Terrorism Allah-sent to head 
off Cold War winddown.

Reminds of the comsec-loving greeders who warn of cyber
insecurity and privacy invasion and soul losing who pray and 
lobby for the protection money to never end.

Come on, nasty hackers, aka sinners, sysadmins, security pros
and TLAs, churn those threats and counterthreats you were 
trained for. NDAs and official secrecy and confessional hootches
protect you, well, except for your ass crack of insecurity-mongering.

Question is, what classified threat was inrrefutably delivered to
Obama (as with predecessors) about himself and his family, 
aka the nation, that caused a change of heart and mind. Could
be related to the prospect of becoming poor rather than a
rich -- no greater fear in capitalists. 

Courage is hardly contagious, trickery and deception are
viralent.
