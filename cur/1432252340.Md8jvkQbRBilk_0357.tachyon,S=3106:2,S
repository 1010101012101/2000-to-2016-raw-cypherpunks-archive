Only 300 Km from Germany, in England, we never had any trouble with 
"legal access to nationalsocialist propaganda such as "Mein Kampf"". It
was available to me as a child, in my local (government-funded) library
& I managed to locate two copies within 10 minutes in the library of
this  University. My Dad (an anti-Nazi left-winger) had a copy. IIRC it
was the version published in English by the  anti-Nazi left-wing
publishing company, Gollancz (and yes, I think the founder was a Jew) on
the principle that people would be less likely to become Nazis if they
could actually read the stuff. It seemed to work. I don't think he ever
paid any royalties though.  I don't think we've all becopme Nazis yet.

Superiority? Inferiority rather Why would people who thought themselves
superior need to submit themselves to a leader?
