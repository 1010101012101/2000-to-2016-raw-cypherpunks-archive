I suspect given the circumstances (i.e. using hushmail as an smtp 
endpoint for web orders) a large proportion of the mail will be normal 
unencrypted SMTP rather than hush2hush traffic or conventionally openpgp 
encrypted from outside the system (I have extracted keys for 
conventional crypto on occasion from the hushmail web interface, but 
doing so on a regular basis is like pulling teeth)
