Can it be that prison guards are actually trying to steal his ideas? I swear
that seems farfetched. Rather, I'd think it was a way for them to just screw
over another prisoner and let him know who's in charge. It costs money to
patent an invention, unless you know how yourself, and then you only have a
patent not a check you can deposit in your bank account.

The again, what isn't too farfetched in Bell's case is that he's actually
developed something as interesting as AP and someone far outside the system is
trying to interfere with it somehow, using some local leverage.

Meanwhile, the annouced personal freedom conference in late June in NYC is
looking like a cypherpunks reunion.
