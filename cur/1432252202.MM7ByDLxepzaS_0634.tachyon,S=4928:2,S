The stealing of the Presidency 2000 has been swept under the rug by the 
Democratic establishment. The media would like us to believe that we should 
move on but that would be rewarding criminal actions by the Bush gang. 
Already history is being rewritten – with Gore being attacked for running a 
poor campaign and being ridiculed as loser who should get out of the way, 
and while the criminal degenerate Bush is admired for being a winner. Every 
democratic candidate for President must be forced to address what happened 
in 2000 so that history does not repeat itself, and to remind the 1000s of 
voters in Florida who were disenfrachised that they have not been forgotten.

Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election is the riveting story about 
the battle for the Presidency in Florida and the undermining of democracy 
in America. Filmmakers Richard Ray Pérez and Joan Sekler examine modern 
America's most controversial political contest: the Election of George W. Bush.
What emerges is a disturbing picture of an election marred by suspicious 
irregularities, electoral injustices, and sinister voter purges in a state 
governed by the winning candidate brother. George W. Bush stole the 
presidency of the United States… and got away with it.
"…the movie highlights those on the front lines—from the African-Americans 
who were turned away from the polling booths for assorted reasons. … In one 
memorable scene the filmmakers freeze-frame a 'protest' against the ballot 
recount, identifying participants as staff members of Republican elected 
officials."
