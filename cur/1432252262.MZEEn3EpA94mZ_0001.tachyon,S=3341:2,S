Dave Baker: P(aranoid)GP
              A keysigning station and standalone data signer, for
              people who are paranoid about untrusted computers,
              keystroke recorders and other attacks that get around
              PGP or GNUPG protection.

Robert J. Meier: Classic RSA Box
              A PGP appliance with an electrically isolated
              box-in-a-box with capacitive sensor interlock and
              optoisolated data channels. Intended to self-destruct if
              tampered with.
