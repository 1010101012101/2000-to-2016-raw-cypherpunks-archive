  Cryptography system goes underground (Aug 19)
  http://physicsweb.org/article/news/8/8/13
   A group of scientists in Austria and Germany has installed an optical
   fibre quantum cryptography system under the streets of Vienna and
used
   it to perform the first quantum secure bank wire transfer (A Poppe et
   al. 2004 Optics Express 12 3865). The quantum cryptography system
   consisted of a transmitter (Alice) at Vienna's City Hall and a
receiver
   (Bob) at the headquarters of an Austrian bank. The sites were linked
by
   1.45 kilometres of single-mode optical fibre.
