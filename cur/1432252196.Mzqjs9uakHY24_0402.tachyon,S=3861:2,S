Never say never, especially since drugs had been legal in the United 
States.  Prior to passage of the Harrison Act in 1914 drugs like 
cocaine were widely available at any general stores or pharmacy.  And 
such drugs could be purchased by anyone, including children. 
Marijuana was criminalized in 1937.

BTW, cocaine is produced legally in some areas (It is used for dental 
procedures in some nations) and the price hovers around  $10-14 (US) 
for a kilo.
Incidentally, in the cocaine producing areas such as Columbia and 
northern Ecuador you can purchase a single kilo of refined cocaine 
for around $100 (US).
