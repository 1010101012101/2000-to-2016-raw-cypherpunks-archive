No, there are not.

The only way that AP would be harmless to an anonymous person is if they
were anonymous to EVERYONE. The entire point of AP is to provide a
mechanism to reach ANYONE who might infringe upon your 'rights'.

Trying to pitch AP as if only certain classes of people are at risk is
simply ignorance (you didn't really read AP now did you) or else you
intentionaly misrepresent. Either way, your point isn't valid.
