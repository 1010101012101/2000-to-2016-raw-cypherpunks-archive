Well, I said only that knowing hardware xor software  would
tell you what you *could* do.  I didn't say it would be *easy*.

If you ran a file-system-integrity-checker and kept your checksums
in a different system, you'd catch some changes.  As well as your
more directed search.  The more the merrier; defense in depth.

That being said, due diligence (vigilance?) requires the readers of this list
to consider both, and countermeasures to same.  And 'out of the box' hazards
like video bugs in the smoke detector.
