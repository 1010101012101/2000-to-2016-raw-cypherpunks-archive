This is just broken.

How do you know what address the sender was sending to?  You have no
reliable access to envelope to: addresses.

Joe bcc's james@nowhere.net, politely generating a hashcash token over
james@nowhere.net and the mesID.  Nowhere.net expands that alias to
james.t.doe@treas.gov.  Whoops.  Hashcash is now invalid, as there's no
reliable mechanism MTAs use to note the original address before the
change.  Some might note it with Delivered-To:, others note it in
received headers, others (qmail, ahem) don't note it at all.

Worse, even if there were a reliable mechanism, all it takes is one
loose cannon with an open mass-mail list and as long as it doesn't
delete whatever header (maybe delivered-to:, maybe something else) that
indicates the list was an envelope to: address, one hashcash token works
for one email to the entire list.

Isn't it simpler to use message IDs for replay detection?  No need to
look for replays using another mechanism when there's already one that
works fine, and that many people use for dup detection today.

No argument there.
