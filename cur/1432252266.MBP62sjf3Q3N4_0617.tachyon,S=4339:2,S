AARG!, our anonymous Pangloss, is strictly correct - Wagner should have
said "could" rather than "would".

However, TCPA and Palladium fall into a class of technologies with a
tremendous potential for abuse. Since the trust model is directed against
the computer's owner (he can't sign code as trusted, or reliably control 
which signing keys are trusted), he has ceded ultimate control of what 
he can and can't do with his computer to another. 

Sure, TCPA can be switched off - until that switch is disabled. It 
could potentially be permenantly disabled by a BIOS update, a 
security patch, a commercial program which carries signed 
disabling code as a Trojan, or over the net through a backdoor or 
vulnerability in any networked software. Or by Congress 
which could make running a TCPA capable machine with TCPA 
turned off illegal.

With TCPA, I now have to trust that a powerful third party, over
which I have no control, and which does not necessarily have
my interests are heart, will not abuse it's power. I don't
want to have to do that.
