   [1]aychamo writes "The American Civil Liberties Union today joined an
   expanding group of organizations filing [2]lawsuits against a new rule
   that increases the FBI's power to conduct surveillance on the
   Internet. The rule being challenged is one the Federal Communications
   Commission adopted in September, granting an FBI request to expand
   wiretapping authority to online communications.he ACLU charged in a
   petition to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
   Circuit that the ruling goes beyond the authority of CALEA, which
   specifically exempted information services. "The ACLU seeks review of
   the CALEA order on the grounds that it exceeds the FCC's statutory
   authority and is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,
   unsupported by substantial evidence, or otherwise contrary to law,"
   the organization charged in its petition."
