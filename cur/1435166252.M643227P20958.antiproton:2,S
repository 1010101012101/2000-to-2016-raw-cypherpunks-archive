Looks like it was developed with an $800,000 federal grant and someone from 
the Philadelphia police dept:

http://technical.ly/philly/2013/11/07/azavea-philly-police-crime-prediction-software/

Interesting article (sorry for no excerpt, I'm currently mobile.)  They 
even use the weather as a variable?

Main site: hunchlab.com

Still have to look up Azavea and see who's behind them/ how much money they 
suck from the fed teat.
