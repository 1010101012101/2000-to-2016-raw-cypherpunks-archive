THIS IS NOT SPAM! THIS IS NOT SPAM!
YOu can make thousands off PayPal!

Dear Friend: 

RE: About Your PayPal Account, in response to your message. 

This is something that I wouldn't normally even look at, except that I 
read an article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about PayPal and 
x.com. There have been other articles written about these companies in 
other well recognized journals. Because I'm a member of PayPal,I knew that this was real and would work. If you need 
to make a few thousand dollars 
REALLY FAST, then please take a moment to read this simple 
program I'm sharing with you. 

THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!! 

Complete it in one hour and you will never forget the day you first 
received it!!! 

Oh! Did I say FAST? "The speed of the Internet-type fast." The 
Newsletter and all payments are made on the Internet by E-Mail. NEED 
PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from individuals who decided to 
invest nothing more than a little of their time. 

Testimonials from: 
********************************************** 
Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA: 
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of our frat = 
brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 grand yet, I'm up to = 
$8,285. Hook me up when you run this program again. 

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC: 
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to you... OH MY GOD! = 
I sent 20 e-mails out like you said and went on vacation. When I got = 
back, my account was up to over $12,000! I owe you! 

GETTING STARTED. 
The very first thing you need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It 
takes two minutes and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That 
makes this program FREE! Here's the link: 
https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=jiva19@aol.com

BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO $100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!! 

Then...... E-Mail the $5.00 from your PayPal account to the FIRST name 
on the list (#1) along with a little note like "Please add me to your 
mailing list." BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE 
DISAPPOINTED!!! 

Read the following and you will agree this is a very exciting 
opportunity. 

ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW? HOW DOES $20,000 IN TWO WEEKS SOUND? 

Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait for the others to 
start working. One hour of work to get started and no mailing lists! 
This service is 100% legal (refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 
18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, 
also in the code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 
436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money 
received). 

Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this THREE LEVEL 
PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much faster. because it is so easy, 
the response rate for this program is VERY HIGH VERY FAST -- Internet 
E-Mail FAST -- and you will see results in two weeks or less! JUST IN 
TIME FOR NEXT MONTHS BILLS! 

You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs). You 
should also send them to people who send their programs, because they 
know these programs work and 
they are already believers in the system! 
Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE 
RATE! Even if you are already in a program, stay with it, but do 
yourself a 
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 

START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes NO INVESTMENT! 
It will pay off long before others letters even begin to trickle in! 
Just give ONE person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is $5.00 
YOU GOT FREE WHEN YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE PayPal account). That's all! If 
you already have a PayPal account and do not receive their $5.00 gift, 
feel free out of the goodness of your HEART to donate a $5,00 GIFT to 
the person in the number 1 spot for him to have your name added to the 
advertisement list. So anyone's MAXIMUM INVESTMENT IS $5.00. 

Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 in 
your bank account! Because of the ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH 
PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! FROM just 
ONE $5.00 bill that you get FREE at PayPal!!! 

Follow These Simple Instructions: 

E-Mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST name on the list 
(#1) along with a note saying "add me to your mailing list". Only the 
first person on the list gets your name and five dollar gift. Edit only 
the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE 
LIST. 

Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD 
(#3) position. 

Don't try to add your name in the first place in order to earn money 
fast! If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you sent e-mail to 
and then your name will be immediately removed from the first place and 
you can't reach more people! But if you add our 
name on the 3rd place, there will be tons of people receiving E-Mails 
with your name first later!!! NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal 
referring URL in the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring 
URL. Send out 20 copies of this letter. 

ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the 
response time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! 
CONSIDER THIS, MILLIONS of people surf the Internet everyday, all day, 
all over the world! 

Here are the 3 people to start with. 

Sign up and send $5.00 to the first person!!! 

1. webmaster@setyournet.com
2. stevec@infowest.com
3. jiva19@aol.com
Fifty thousand new people get on the Internet every month! An excellent source of names is the people who send you 
other programs and the names 
listed on the letter they send you. Your contact source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities! 
Mail, or should I say E-mail, your letter and payment TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of your 
time, THAT'S IT! 

To send your newsletter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE and paste it in 
the message of your E-Mail TO DO THIS: 

1. Go to "edit" and "select all" 
2. Go to "edit" and select "copy" 
3. Start (compose) a new E-Mail message (make sure it's PLAIN TEXT so 
everyone can view it!) 
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box 
5. Go to "edit" and "paste" (Then you can format it anyway you want!) 

Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the top name, adding 
your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply changing 
the numbers. Remember, YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and move the other 2 
names up. But DO NOT forget to send $5.00 by PayPal (along with your 
note) to the TOP E-MAIL address before deleting it! 

NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in this e-mail of the 
letter with your own PayPal referring URL. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. 
When your name reaches the first position in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY! The money will be 
sent to you by 2,000 to 
4,000 people like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to receive $20,000 in cash! 

That's all! There will be a total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your 
mailbox (account)in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is real money that you can spend on anything you 
wish! Just deposit it to your 
own bank account or spend it directly from your PayPal account!!! It's that easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you? 

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T 
THAT BE NICE? IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF 
COURSE YOU CAN---this plan is structured for everyone to send only 20 letters each. However, you are certainly not 
limited to 20. Mail out as 
many as you want. Every 20 letters you send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or 
whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! 

Each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! Simple enough? 
You bet it is! 
Besides, there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the printer or copier, and you can do it again and 
again with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up a new group. 
Be SURE and PAY the first person on the list. This is proof that you paid to get 
put on the list which is the service rendered to make all this legal!!! = 
Why not? It beats working! 

Each time you receive an MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name 
will climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. Follow the 
simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. Your name must run 
the full gamut on the list 
to produce the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it 
only cheats the other people who have worked hard and have earned the right to be there. So please, play by the 
rules and the $$$ will come to you! 

$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will prosper! GOOD LUCK 
$$$ 

You are probably skeptical of this, especially with all the different 
programs out there on the web, but if you don't try this you will never 
know. That's the way I felt. I've been watching this type of program for years and this is about as easy and fast as you 
can get it and it can even be free to try now with PayPal, no stamps, no envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little 
effort and faith!!! This program = 
really "Kept It Short and Simple"! OH BY THE WAY....each time someone 
signs up with your link under your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal... so they pay to open up the account but 
they also pay you when 
someone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! 

Let's all make some serious money $$$$$$ 

GO TO THIS REFERRAL SITE TO SIGN UP FOR PAYPAL
https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=jiva19@aol.com
or if you
are already signed then go to your paypal account and send $5 to the first
name on the list. And please just play by the rules, this doesn't cost
anything but your time and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS. 

GOOD LUCK and THANKS !!!!!
