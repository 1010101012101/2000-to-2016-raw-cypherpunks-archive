Yet I seem to hit false citations, citations that are misleading and 
sometimes nonexistent, every few pages of Chomsky.  If Justin Schwartz has 
a success rate is so strangely different from my own, perhaps he can find 
the infamous citation  "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were 
false".  Which massacre reports were these?

And while he is at it, can he explain how come the eyewitness reports of 
terror and intimidation taken by Ponchaud constitute third hand reports in 
Chomsky's cites of Ponchaud?

And while he is at it, how come one of Chomsky's highly qualified experts 
who supposedly ridiculed the false reports of Khmer Rouge crimes later said 
that Phnom Penh was evacuated to smash resistance (a claim later confirmed 
by Pol Pot) and that perhaps ten percent of the population of Phnom Penh 
died as a result of the evactuation, an estimate he made before the famous 
left wing U turn on Cambodia, an estimate that contradicts the general tone 
of the letter Chomsky quoted, but does not contradict the substance of it 
or the facts reported.
