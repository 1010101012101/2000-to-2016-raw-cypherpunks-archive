"Contrary to expectations, however, sales of the chip have been suprisingly 
low, with zero interest shown by major PC manufacturers. One major PC 
industry executive, who wished to remain anonymous sated: "There are 100s of

such technologies be used, but by then it's going to come down to a battle 
of lobbies: The Entertainment industry vs Telecom+PCs++Software. Which can
