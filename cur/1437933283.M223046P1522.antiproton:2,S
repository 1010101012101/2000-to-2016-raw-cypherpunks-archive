Achieving receivers and spectrum analyzers with wide frequency coverage, high dynamic range and wide bandwidths (with very low noise circuitry, stable local oscillators, etc.) simultaneiously has, up till recently, demanded very high prices. That's why few outside of governments, corporations and well-funded professionals could afford them. However, with the rapid growth and falling prices of SDR this has and is changing.

For example, Ettus' USRPs, covering VHF to 6 GHz or so, starting under $1000, that not long ago were in the $10,000s. The HackRF (which some have complained is little more than an IF strip) effectively covering down to below 10 Mhz is only $300 (though its performance, due to only 8-bit ADC, is not in the same league as the 16-bit USRPs). If some hardware hacker were to deliver a 14-16 bit ADC daughter board (there are afforadble chips offering up to 60M samples/sec) for the HackRF (it is provisioned to accept one) it could substantially improve its use.
