So said Marx.  He also said that markets would make the workers
poorer and poorer.

Despite the fact that the trend has been in the other direction
for the past two hundred years, despite the fact that what Marx
wrote was obviously false then, and has become more obviously
false in the 150 years since he wrote, Marxists repeat Marx's
prophecies with the more confidence, the more obviously the
facts contradict them.
