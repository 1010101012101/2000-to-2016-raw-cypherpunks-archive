After  a heads up from a 2600 au fellow subber,I believe the victorian 
police are making crude attempts
to set me up. something about spreading sweet and low on voting forms and 
ISP bills.
I could try and make life sweeter for various strangers,BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG!
It was an obvious plant as Im famous for advocating not voting and not 
paying bills/taxes
So the vic.police ,so well described by ned kelly ,so long ago will have to 
try harder.
They can take my laptop,but they'll never take my FREEDOM!
