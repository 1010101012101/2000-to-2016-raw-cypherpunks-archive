Of course it should be protected speech. As are Web sites promoting 
the growing and processing of marijuana and opium, Web sites 
promoting the killing of those who need killing, Web sites promoting 
espionage, draft dodging, and terrorism.

While the _activities_ being promoted or advocate may (or may not) be 
illegal, talking about them and advocating them is a *speech act*.

Cf. the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
