Well luckily, unlike John, I've never had to whore myself when I wrote.  I
wrote what I thought and they published it.  I can see why someone who
allowed himself to do that might wish to reassert his manhood by battling
his own inner policeman.  If that works for John, so be it.  I shall
continue to write clearly so that my ideas will be communicated.  That does
not necessarily mean that it will be grammatically correct, boring or
uninspired--just meaningful.

Sounds like a personal problem to me, John.  I never had to do any of that
(nor would I).  Why did you?

John, have you actually read any of my stuff?  Please point to some of my
"prefabricated sunshine."  If I really do it, I should know it so I can
capitalize on it.  :-D

John, you know, I know and most folks on this list know, I never argued for
grammatical correctness.  I DO favor comprehensibility.  Don't you think
it's a cheap shot to trivializes real concerns about communication by
mischaracterizing critics as grammar cops?

"War is peace"  How Orwellian...

You know, John, there aren't any rules-makers on Cypherpunks.  You can write
all the gobbledygook you want; no one will stop you.  By the same token,
though, anyone here is free to point out that the emperor has no clothes.
