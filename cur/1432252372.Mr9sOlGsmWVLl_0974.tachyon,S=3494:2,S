CREDIT CARD PROCESSING COMPANY REJECTS FIREARMS INDUSTRY

REFUSES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS . . . Citi Merchant Services and First  
Data Corp. are refusing to process any credit card transactions  
between federally licensed firearms retailers, distributors and  
manufacturers -- a move which will severely limit available inventory  
of firearms and ammunition to military, law enforcement and law- 
abiding Americans.

The first company to be affected by this decision appears to be  
firearms distributor CDNN Sports Inc.

"We were contacted recently by First Data/Citi Merchant Services by a  
June Rivera-Mantilla stating that we were terminated and funds were  
being seized for selling firearms in a non-face-to-face transaction,"  
said Charlie Crawford, president of CDNN Sports Inc. "Although  
perfectly legal, we were also informed that no transactions would be  
processed in the future, even for non-firearms. I find this very  
frightening."

To voice your concern to Citi Merchant Services and First Data Corp.,  
please contact June Rivera-Mantilla at 631-683-7734 or her supervisor  
Robert Tenenbaum at 631-683-6570.

To change to an NSSF-affiliated credit card processing program,  
contact Payment Alliance International at 1-866-371-2273 (ext. 1131).
