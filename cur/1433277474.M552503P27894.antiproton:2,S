There's a big difference. A nation-state attacker you assume is maximally
competent. Parents you don't. A nation-state attacker cannot personally
monitor all their citizens. Parents can personally monitor all their
children. As long as you aren't caught, a nation-state attacker cannot
arbitrarily restrict your movement. Parents can. Besides non-automated
methods such as looking up browser history, parents have a finite set of
commercially-available software, with a mostly common set of capabilities.
Nation-states have to be sort-of cautious -- if there was a mass-reveal of
total surveillance of everyone, there would at least be some blowback,
whereas there's not any social pressure on parents at all. In terms of what
they care about, parents will prioritize moral issues -- being gay, trans,
atheist, etc., among other stuff, depending on the family -- whereas
nation-states will prioritize direct plans of action against them.

There's probably a lot more differences, and I probably messed up on some
of them. Here's someone else's probably-pretty-inexperienced attempt at
threat modelling parents:

But there's not "no difference".
