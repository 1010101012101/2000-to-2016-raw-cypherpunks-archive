Hey if there's a good side of the US mis-election this year.. it is that 
finally there will be an attempt to improve and modernize the process.

One of the technologies to improve the voting process is secure 
e-voting..Can anyone enlighten me as to who is working in the field.. Looks 
like it will be the only tech stocks that will do well in 2001 !

regards

robert
