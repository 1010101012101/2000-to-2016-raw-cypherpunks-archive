And/or indeed, on newer players. In the UK at least 
(http://uk.eurorights.org/issues/cd/docs/celdion.shtml) the new 
generation of anti-theft CDs have been reported to be useless on modern 
DVD players/car stereos, by design. Some older players either lack the 
"feature" or are less sensitive, I assume, so can be ok. It's just a 
case of matching a technology with the right player...

So not content with limiting public demand for new hardware (a minor 
issue), the extra precautions actively encourage consumers to not buy 
legal content. Woo. Better to get illegal content that you can do what 
you want with.

With regards to the analog[ue]/digital stop-gapping, r o f l m a o. This 
would be just as effective as, ooh, copy-protecting CDs? Oh, humm... 
Chasing down peer-to-peer outfits? Uhh... Trying to ban videos? Oh, wait...

Firstly, in order to prevent widespread ripping of analog signals 
through disabling mass consumer device, there needs to /be/ mass 
consumer ripping. How many people do you know who actually go to the 
trouble of transferring their taped episodes/films onto their PC? It's 
not as simple as grabbing mp3s. As with other such "distribution" in its 
relevant infancy, the hard work's carried out by a much smaller number 
of people - millions of films may be downloaded every month, but there's 
generally only 2 or 3 versions of each film, from different sources, 
max. Believing that crippling the populace will fill this tiny leak 
is... well, amusing.

Secondly, how much work is going to go into protecting a fading 
technology? This is from both the MPAA's and the consumers' points of 
view. For the former, analog avoidance is only of any use if the content 
is not readily available in digital format already. Most of the analog 
content that I guess the MPAA want to stop conversion of is either 
people in cinemas with cameras, or people with tapes of episodes at 
home. The former is hard to stop through watermarking (I'm unsure of the 
technicalities, but I'd have thought preserving it between screen and 
camera would be tricky? Even without people geting uo and walking past 
the view...), and even then it's only one source of films. The latter 
is, I suspect, more the target of the MPAA's volley. If this doesn't 
move towards digital origins, i.e. through PVRs or cable-streams 
obtained via PC (which are subject to a different smother), then the 
abundance of existing technology, and probable (anonymous) circumvention 
  of new ones anyway renders all actions proposed useless. The question 
then is how much investment do you want to throw away?

Outside the US, I suspect that the circumvention may go the same way as 
DVD region "control". Looking at players recently, it was quite hard 
(after checking around, as most people would) to actually _avoid_ 
region-locked DVD players. The only real factor that really keeps 
regions in place is their localised supply to meatspace shops, or the 
boundaries of international postage & packing.

Foolishness, foolishness, and yet more foolishness. Perhaps if we just 
ignore them, then they'll go away eventually :)
