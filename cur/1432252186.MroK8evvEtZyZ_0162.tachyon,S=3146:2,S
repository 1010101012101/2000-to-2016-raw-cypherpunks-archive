No, I don't do those things. I hire an accountant for my taxes, a
lawyer for such affairs, a mechanic for my car, and so on. Modern
society is build on trust relationships in a free market, combined
with a division of labor.

Crypto is subtle, true, but so is tax law, litigation, and modern
automotive control systems. It is not in principle different from
those areas, where money, property, and life is at stake, and we trust
others to help us.
