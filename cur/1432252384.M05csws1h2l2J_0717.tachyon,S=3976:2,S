   That's for sure -- you should read the history of the strike back around the
early 1900's on Minnesota's Iron Range. The goons would surround a whole small
town, then go from house to house beating *everyone*, even children, with
axehandles. Killed a lot of people too.

   Not to mention all the goons they still hire all over the 3rd world to break
strikes, kill organizers and labor leaders, etc.

   Nonsense -- corporations are not humans, they have zero rights. Together we
could be a partnership, with 100K others we could be a partnership as
well. Corporations where the owners (shareholders) and employees are not liable
for the crimes and debts of the corp should be illegal. And there's nothing at
all socialistic or statist about that -- in fact, it's more that corporations
require statism to even exiest.

    Why not? If Thomas Jefferson and George Washington had their way,
corporations would be illegal in the US.
