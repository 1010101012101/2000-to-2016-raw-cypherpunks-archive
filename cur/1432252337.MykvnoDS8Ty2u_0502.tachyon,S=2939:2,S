Well, here I meant after registration, etc...in a "regular" IP network it 
can take seconds to minutes in order for routing tables (at layer 3) or the 
local MAC Address tables (at layer 2) to recognize that you're back on line. 
With a Tor node I'm wondering how long it takes for the greater Tor network 
to both notice your existence and then trust that you're here to stay...for 
a while.

In other words, am I contributing to the greater Tor network if I allow my 
USB Tor node to function while I'm sucking down a cappucino or two?

In other words, just for me. That, of course, is great.
As for simplicity, I need that: I know my way around the BLSR protection 
switching bytes in an OC-48 4 fiber ring, but I'm a veritable IP dummy (oh, 
well I DID design parts of a layer 2 GbE switch, but I'm no routing jock). I 
just don't have time to have to fiddle with the OS myself, so this will be 
interesting. Think I might get me one of those gizmos and then stick it on 
my PDA.

So: Can Tor support VoIP Yet? I could call up bin Laden from a Starbucks!
