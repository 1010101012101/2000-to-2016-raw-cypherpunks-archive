Thank you, excellent sugestions.  I put in the anti-aliasing thing and
that is clearly something which will piss off an OCR device.  Here's
an example of my current attempt at something which would be
neigh-impossible to OCR reliably:

http://www.sidereal.kz/~drevil/anti-ocr.png

What do you think?  It's got some shear, some rotate, some spread, and
some swirl.  And anti-aliasing, which was a great sugestion.  I'm
going to experiment with adding some dotted lines, too.

As you may be aware, Doctors have notoriously bad handwriting, but
alas, it must be machine-generated.

Right, screwing around with color contrast may not be effective at
all, because those things are very easy to take out by just editing
the color map, and suddenly it's sharp and clear.

Ah, but the Men in Black are not the threat in this case.  Au
contraire!  This is part of an anti-money-laundry thing.

I'll check there.  They are mostly concerned with a different problem,
which is duplication.  I want to make stuff that humans can read, and
machines can't.  It's all going to be PNGs, so machines can duplicate
it no problem.
