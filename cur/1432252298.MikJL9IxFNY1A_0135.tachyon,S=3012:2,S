The virii are typically executables for x86/Windows machines, not Macs. 
You said you were using a Mac, so why do you think IE for the Mac 
exposes you to virii?

Religious nonsense. I tend to avoid MS products because I can get good 
alternatives for very little money, but few would call Microsoft Office 
"third rate." I've seen the version for OS X and it looks very good. 
Maybe "1.5" rate, but not second rate and surely not third rate.
