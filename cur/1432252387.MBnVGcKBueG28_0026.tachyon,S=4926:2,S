RDSEED provides the output of the /enhanced/ non-deterministic random
number generator (ENRNG

Which is "enhanced" by being whitened.

And therefore makes it just as impossible to tell if the supposed
randomness is backdoored as RDRAND does.

What we need is the output of the entropy source.

Supposedly we have a circuit that generates fairly random offwhite
noise. (The entropy source) This is then AES encrypted (the enhanced
non deterministic number generator), and the enhanced non
deterministic random number generator then continuously seeds a pseudo
random number generator, which provides the output of RDRAND

To tell if there is a backdoor or not, we need the output of the
entropy source, unenhanced.

If the entropy source is real, it will show its analog characteristics
leaking into the digital abstraction.  The correlations and anti
correlations between nearby bits will reflect the analog values of the
circuit, thus no two chips will show quite the same correlations, and
the correlations will vary with temperature and overclocking.  These
analog variations would be compelling evidence that the entropy source
is the something very like the claimed circuit.

Because RDSEED gives us the encrypted output of the entropy source, we
cannot tell if the entropy source is a real entropy source, or a
counter encrypted with the NSA's secret key.

Since the whitening is deterministic, it is potentially reversible,
but Intel does not appear to be releasing sufficient information to
reverse it.
