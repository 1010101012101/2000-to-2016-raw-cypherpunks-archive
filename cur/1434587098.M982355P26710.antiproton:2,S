	Fine. Now work out the logical conclusions that follow from that
	premise. Here's one : any violation of such rights is criminal.

	Not really. And I happen to live outside the direct
	'jurisdiction' of the US government. Now, if you want to send
	one of your friends, unarmed, to my house, I might talk to
	him. From a safe distance and while pointing a gun at him, just
	in case.

	They are people who kill other people when ordered to. That's
	all that counts.

	If individuals are free to NOT participate in such
	organization if they wish, then yes, it's anarchy. 

	If individuals are subjected to such organization against their
	will then no, that's not anarchy, bakunin or not. 


	And since you like dictionaries 

	http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anarchism?s=t


	"a doctrine urging the abolition of government or governmental
	restraint as the indispensable condition for full social and
	political liberty. " 


	Oops. Government and anarchy just happen to be mutually
	exclusive concepts. (That of course shouldn't be news...)
