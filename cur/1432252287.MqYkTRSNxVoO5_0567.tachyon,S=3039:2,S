Jim's Bell's trial was not completed this Friday.  He has requested that
this message be posted to the list:

He thinks the newsmedia has been boycotting his case, and says that it is
utterly, absolutely, and completely important that these trashy rags start
covering the story.

He would like as many cpunks as possible to send emails to
	editpage@seattle-PI.com
	opinion@seattletimes.com
	editors@columbian.com
	letters@news.oregonian.com
and tell them that they absolutely must be there at his trial this Monday;
that extraordinary things will be revealed, and totally amazing things will
be covered.



Make of this what you will.
