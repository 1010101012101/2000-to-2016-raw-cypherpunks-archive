Everyone,
     Just a quick observation here. According to the Wired chart, it appears
that the Republicans average roughly 49.85058296 and the Democrats average
roughly 47.27853081 on the Wired News scale, with one representative being
independent (Bernard Sanders), and one representative with an "A" for their
party designation (Spencer Bachus). Here's my Republicans vs. Democrats
breakdown of the Wired News chart:

Party  | Republican  | Democrat    |
-----------------------------------
HR2301 | 0.181818182 | 0.343137255 |
-----------------------------------
HR3615 | 0.153846154 | 0.024509804 |
-----------------------------------
HR3709 | 0.958715596 | 0.697115385 |
-----------------------------------
HR3125 | 0.218009479 | 0.575129534 |
-----------------------------------
HR1501 | 0.440909091 | 0.908653846 |
-----------------------------------
HR10   | 0.522522523 | 0.058252427 |
-----------------------------------
HR1714 | 0.986175115 | 0.695652174 |
-----------------------------------
total  | 3.381165919 | 3.203791469 |
-----------------------------------
votes  | 6.798206278 | 6.777251185 |
-----------------------------------
score  | 49.85058296 | 47.27853081 |
-----------------------------------

These are all just averages, and I omitted the "A" and "I" designated
representatives. In regards to the "A" designated representative, Spencer
Bachus, I think the "A" is an error. I was under the impression that he was
a Republican. If he is, in fact, a Republican, then that changes our
averages slightly:

Party  | Republican  | Democrat    |
-----------------------------------
HR2301 | 0.180995475 | 0.343137255 |
-----------------------------------
HR3615 | 0.153110048 | 0.024509804 |
-----------------------------------
HR3709 | 0.95890411 | 0.697115385 |
-----------------------------------
HR3125 | 0.216981132 | 0.575129534 |
-----------------------------------
HR1501 | 0.438914027 | 0.908653846 |
-----------------------------------
HR10   | 0.520179372 | 0.058252427 |
-----------------------------------
HR1714 | 0.986238532 | 0.695652174 |
-----------------------------------
total  | 3.375       | 3.203791469 |
-----------------------------------
votes  | 6.799107143 | 6.777251185 |
-----------------------------------
score  | 49.75558036 | 47.27853081 |
-----------------------------------

     Which still puts Republicans in more of a hands-off strategy for
technology, according to voting history. If Spencer Bachus is not a
Republican, then please tell me what the hell an "A" party designation
stands for. 
     If you are interested in seeing TOTALS as opposed to AVERAGES, here is
your chart:

Party  | Republican  | Democrat    |
-----------------------------------
HR2301 | 40          | 70          |
-----------------------------------
HR3615 | 32          | 5           |
-----------------------------------
HR3709 | 210         | 145         |
-----------------------------------
HR3125 | 46          | 111         |
-----------------------------------
HR1501 | 97          | 189         |
-----------------------------------
HR10   | 116         | 12          |
-----------------------------------
HR1714 | 215         | 144         |
-----------------------------------
total  | 756         | 676         |
-----------------------------------
votes  | 1523        | 1430        |
-----------------------------------

     Again, it is entirely possible that my information is incorrect. I do
recommend that you do the research yourself, as relying too much on these
numbers means relying on numbers collected by a media source and in turn
sorted and re-calculated by some punk-ass on the cypherpunks mailing list.
     To the best of my knowledge, however, this looks right. What alarms me
is that though there is a slight difference in the overall score between
Republicans and Democrats, neither party has a very strong leaning one way
or the other, which illustrates the frustrations that a two-party system
creates for those of us who would like to see a strong stance (either way)
on the issue of government regulation of technology. I anxiously await any
speculation that might take place on this list regarding how Libertarian
representatives might have voted had they been in there, but the fact is
that we live in a two-party system for the time being, and if we feel
strongly about these issues, we need to accept that our representation may
not be hearing us. Is it because we aren't speaking loudly enough on these
issues?

ok,
Rush Carskadden

Subject: Wired News tech scorecard for U.S. House of Representatives

At Wired News, we've compiled a list of the technology voting records of 
each member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

That meant picking seven tech bills and grading all 435 legislators -- at 
least the ones who showed up those days -- on their floor votes. If they 
chose to take a hands-off approach, they got a "1", while regulatory votes 
got a "0." (If you disagree with us, flip the scale around.)

Here's the list sorted by last name (scoll down to find your legislator):
   http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39637,00.html
Sorted by score, with the two California reps with 100 percent at the top:
   http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39636,00.html

And a summary of the results, with some methodology:
   http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,39625,00.html

Some interesting results: Purported privacy advocates like Democrat Ed 
Markey didn't score well, getting a 33% of 100%, in part because of his 
opposition to financial privacy legislation. Republican Bob Goodlatte, 
Internet caucus co-chair, got just 43% because of his support for speech 
and gambling restrictions.

-Declan



The floor votes scored:

HR2031: A vote to restrict online sales of alcohol. (No is 1)
HR3615: A vote to create a new federal agency to spend $1.25 billion on 
rural TV service. (No is 1)
HR3709: A vote to extend a temporary federal ban on Internet taxes. (Yes is
1)
HR3125: A vote to prohibit Internet gambling. (No is 1)
HR1501: A vote on an amendment to restrict the sale of violent material 
such as videogames to anyone under the age of 18. (No is 1)
HR10: A vote on an amendment to protect financial privacy by restricting 
government monitoring of bank accounts. (Yes is 1)
HR1714: A vote to allow the use of electronic signatures. (Yes is 1)
