Although this list is mainly focused on the social implications of crypto 
and privacy.  It has also been a frequent forum for libertarian ideals: 
like smaller government.  There can be no greater lever to reduce the size 
of government than "...to cut off its oxygen," that is revenue.  

One of the better examples of the intersection of the Fifth Amendment and 
taxes involves W4 and 1040 U.S. federal tax forms.  For many years legislators 
have publicly maintained that we have a nation of voluntary tax compliance. 
 (Yet woe onto those who decide not to volunteer.)  Widely accepted federal 
court rulings consider statements on these tax forms as testimony (not evidence) 
in a court of law.  Since under our Constitution one cannot be compelled 
to testify against himself it seems reasonable that one cannot be compelled 
to submit to endorsing either form.  Only one case I know of (Conklin vs. 
U.S.) has been adjudicated on this issue.  Conklin won but the case.  The 
federal court ruled that submission of tax forms was voluntary, but the 
ruling was suppressed by a legal procedure which allow courts to selectively 
deny its citing in subsequent cases.  Adhocracies like ambiguity

Napster has tapped into a broad reservoir of resentment and resistance to 
paying too much for music.  I believe all U.S. libertarians on the list 
should be considering how a high profile test case of the constitutionality 
of the U.S. federal tax system might tap into a similar disdain for taxation 
and achieve substantially more constraint of government encroachment on 
civil liberties than our valiant crypto coding efforts.
