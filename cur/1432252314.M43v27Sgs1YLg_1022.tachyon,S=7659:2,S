Oh I see. Using L4 makes sense then. But, if concern goes as far as
files prepared with hostile intent, I again mused myself once (what a
muser I am) with idea of filtering this stuff through
software/converter running on non-386 emulator, like PDP-10 (simh or
something, running TOPS-* is optional), vax (again simh, some modern
bsd should fit) or even S/380 (modified Hercules emulator, modern
variation on S360 mainframe, hobby project, gnu software ported to
MVS/380 which itself descends from one commercial mainframe os, which
at one point of time became public domain - if memory serves, of
course).

Since those are all musings and no hard work, I cannot claim any kind
of success or if this makes any sense or not at all. Seems doable,
requires time and reading some old manuals written on typewriter and
scanned, and the font is ugly and scales poorly on 6'' ebook reader...
