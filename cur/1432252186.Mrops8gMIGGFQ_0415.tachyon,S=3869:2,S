There is a terrible campaign under way by the name of "Drown the IRS 
2002." It is organized on the web by an angry group of over-taxed, 
bitter libertarians. We must do everything we can to stop them. They 
are planning to send millions of bogus 1040 tax returns to the IRS next 
tax year. They are going to use freely-available W2 templates, social 
security numbers (SSNs), and employer identification numbers (EINs). 
They hope to swamp the IRS with their own paperwork.

This is a danger to our huge-government, socialist way of life. These 
dangerous freedom-lovers must be stopped. Life without a massive, all-
powerful Federal Government is unthinkable. Please forward this warning 
to as many message boards as possible. We must get the word out to as 
many people as possible in order to stop them.
