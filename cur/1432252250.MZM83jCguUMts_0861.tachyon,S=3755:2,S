Well, this is not well understood by those outside the credit world.

What the law actually states is (basically) a defaulted loan must be 
forgiven after seven years. In other words, it is illegal to continue to 
attempt to collect on a loan, 7 years after the default.

However, it is perfectly legal to remember that an individual failed to pay 
back a loan. In practice, this means that a large brand-name Credit Card 
company can choose not to send an offer to someone that defaulted 10 years 
ago. Of course, they can't dunn that person anymore, but they don't have to 
offer a card. I know without any doubt that there is at least one that does 
this, and it's not like the Feds wouldn't notice!

>And the responsibles need killing.

Well, in a lot of cases I agreed with May's sentiment, even if I'm not 
entirely sure this would do much. However, as for putting the Jews and 
blacks up chimneys, well add to that what appears to be an almost State 
Corporatism stance, and there's a discernable vector there...look up 
"Boehrman Flight Capital Organization" and I'm still not convinced the 
resemblance is coincidental.

But those are side issues. At least, aside from the technical content, I 
still view May's harshest rantings as a sort of Fredom of Speech acid 
test...if one would try to forcibly or legally shut him down, then one 
probably "needs killing".
