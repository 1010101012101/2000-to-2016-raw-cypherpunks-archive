Riiiigggh!  And posting your full name, address, phone number, date of 
birth, social security number, the account and expiration dates of all your 
credit cards + the 3 digit extra code on their backs, ATM card account # 
and the PIN, plus, several samples of your signature (optional) in JPEG 
format, and the code to your alarm system on your web page will prevent 
identity theft.

So, whaddayasay?  It's a fine bridge, lightly used, as you can see, it's 
got a lotta traffic between Manhattan and Brooklyn, I could sell it to you 
real cheap, 'cause you look like a nice guy and all, you know, you could 
make a fortune, setup a toll booth and all that.
