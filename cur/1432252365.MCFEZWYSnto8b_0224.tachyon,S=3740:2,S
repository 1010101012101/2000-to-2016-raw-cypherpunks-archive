Look it up. The _Reactor Handbook_ is a good source on spontaneous decay
rates of fissionables. Plutonium dust is a deadly chemical poison, but a
properly formed (and protectively plated) mass of plutonium has very low
radioactivity.

Consider that nuclear weapons could not be built if the fissiles had
high rates of spontaneous decay - the stuff would detonate prematurely,
resulting in a fizzle. That, incidentally, is why plutonium cannot be
used in a gun-type device - two isotopes are inevitably present, one of
which (forgot the mass number, but you can look that up, too) has a
spontaneous decay rate that is too high for the (relatively) slow
assembly rate of a gun.
