   from the at-least-statistically dept.
   [1]Autoversicherung writes "Physicists including Purdue's Ephraim
   Fischbach have completed a study [2]comparing the 'randomness' in pi
   to that produced by 30 software random-number generators and one
   chaos-generating physical machine. After conducting several tests,
   they have found that while sequences of digits from pi are indeed an
   acceptable source of randomness -- often an important factor in data
   encryption and in solving certain physics problems -- pi's digit
   string does not always produce randomness as effectively as
   manufactured generators do."
