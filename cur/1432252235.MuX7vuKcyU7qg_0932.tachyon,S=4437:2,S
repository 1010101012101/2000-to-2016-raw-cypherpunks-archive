Hey, Vulis, I was the one who pointed this out earlier than nearly 
anyone else. Yesterday, early afternoon, my time.  Check it out.

I'm fully aware that the Democrats will likely win through exactly 
this trickery. The Dems used their Jew lawyers very quickly and very 
shrewdly. The Republicans trusted to the count and recount, which 
they won.

As I have said, it will be a "good" thing that the Democrats steal 
the election this way.
