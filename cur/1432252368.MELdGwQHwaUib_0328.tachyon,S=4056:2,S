In places where crypto is illegal, this approach would also likely be illegal.

"But, Obergruppenfuhrer Mueller, I am not actually using crypto. 
These hundreds of broken up files I have received are merely unwanted 
messages sent to me. "

BTW, the issue is a lot more than just "plausible deniability." This 
may work in the U.S., until the Constitution is further shredded. But 
"plausibility deniability" is not enough when dealing with the 
Staasi, or SAVAK, or Shin Bet, or the Ayotollahs. Mere suspicion is 
enough.
