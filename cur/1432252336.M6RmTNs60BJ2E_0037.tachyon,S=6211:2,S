Extending your quote for revolving context...

"The trade association also reveals in the document that Sifma has
retained former NSA director Keith Alexander to "facilitate" the
joint effort with the government. Alexander, in turn, has brought
in Michael Chertoff, the former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security,
and his firm, Chertoff Group."
"Alexander had been pitching Sifma and other bank trade associations
to purchase his services through his new consulting firm, IronNet
Cybersecurity Inc., for as much as $1 million per month, according to
two people briefed on the talks."


The article full of other juicy things...
