its not too much, in fact, it is not precisely what you are looking for.
but check this paper out: 
	http://freehaven.net/doc/mix-acc/mix-acc.pdf
(also check out other papers on the freehaven project, they are working
on prjects which, in theory are similar to what you just described.)
	http://freehaven.net/papers.html
it is about reliabilty in mix net networks, describes a
reliabilty system and (this is the part that might be of interest to
you) it describes potential failures and weak points in a system that is
theoretically similar to yours. hope that helps... --gabe
