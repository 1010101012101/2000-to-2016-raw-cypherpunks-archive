In Sweden, Gothenburg, police fired into a crowd.  Arguably they had just cause.

But US police, facing similar circumstances in Seattle, did not fire into the crowd.

I do not wish to suggest that Swedish police are a bunch of stormtroopers.  They are not.  But the general trend is that the more disarmed the population, the more apt the police are to open fire.  That is not merely a matter of lawsuits and stuff, but an inevitable consequence of human nature.
