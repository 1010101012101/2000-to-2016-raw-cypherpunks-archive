 >>...is supposedly uncrackable encryption, due to the law of indeterminacy.<<

Im a big booster for uncrackable encryption.Thats why Im  confident of 
crypto-anarchy sooner rather than later.
Singh is a good popularizer whose TV series was on here earlier this year.

UE could be an infinitely receding mirage as indicated by bill honigs 
theory back at quantum encryption hazard post.
The standard model is definitely in play at the moment.(possible socialist 
plot by flying saucer freaks)
The standard model is totally unable to explain mass without the higgs 
boson.Theres a hitch finding this 'god'
particle according to new scientist,dec 8.01.Im unclear as to the 
difference between "ether" (honig) and a 'higgs field'(NS article)
maybe jamesd could help us out here?
