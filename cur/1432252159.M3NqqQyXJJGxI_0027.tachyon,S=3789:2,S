I certainly don't trust repositories ;)

btw, I think this heartbleed story is
exaggerated. If it were code execution
it would have been much worse.

browser vendors fix _a lot_ of
"unspecified memory hazards" every few
months.

IMO getting owned by a browser bug is
much more likely than by heartbleed.

Is there a significant rise of revoked certs caused
by HB paranoia?
