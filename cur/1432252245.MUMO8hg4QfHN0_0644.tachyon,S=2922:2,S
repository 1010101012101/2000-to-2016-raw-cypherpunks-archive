Camera Phone Criminals Targeting Holiday Shoppers

Identity Theft Is Fastest Growing Crime In Florida

POSTED: 6:36 am EST December 23, 2004
UPDATED: 6:54 am EST December 23, 2004

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Thieves armed with camera cell phones are using the
devices to steal credit card numbers, bank account numbers and even ATM
numbers from holiday shoppers, according to a Local 6 News report.
 Police said that criminals who are able to get close enough to a person's
personal information can snap a photo of the card or bank account number,
and steal the number.

Orange County sheriff's deputies said they are aware of the latest identity
theft -- the fastest growing crime in Florida.

"It's real easy to capture someone's information by standing behind
somebody, pointing to where they can get personal information," Orange
County sheriff's spokesman Carlos Torres said. "As the technology gets more
advanced, criminals get more advanced with it."

Police said whatever information a shopper pulls out in public is subject
to being photographed and used to a criminal's advantage, Local 6 News
reported.
Central Florida resident Robert Devers said his aunt was likely the victim
of a camera phone criminal.

"My aunt's ATM account was wiped out, because someone was able to get a
hold of her PIN number," Devers said.

There have been no arrests in connection with Devers case.
