OK, suppose we've got a bank that issues bearer "money".

Who owns the bank? It should be owned by bearer shares, of course.

Can any clever person here devise such a protocol?

I'd guess that all the Bank's finances should be available to anyone who
asks. That should include an accounting of all the "money" issued. And not
be reliant on one computer to keep the records.

Or the propounders wanting to: make a profit/control the bank?
