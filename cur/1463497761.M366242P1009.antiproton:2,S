Looks nice. I guess you have your reason to make such choices and
perhaps I will try it myself one day. For now however, and in my case,
emacs does the job (keeping some activity log/record, notes, maybe
todo lists, maybe pieces of code - it seems there are some extremely
cool things possible when mixing code into org) so I tend to avoid
"more advanced" stuff [1]. I think it is possible to edit some (other)
wiki with org-mode and send content to it without needing a browser,
which would be huge plus for me. And if I was in need of wiki then
maybe I would look for something which does not require Javascript (as
Tiddly seems to, but I only glanced over few pages and into one zip).

YMMV, of course.

[1] Well, ok, if I see something as more advanced, I would at least
try to include it into my toolbox etc etc. My current needs are such
that emacs (and elisp) appear to be more advanced (compared to browser
and JS). But I have no intent to evangelize people about it.
