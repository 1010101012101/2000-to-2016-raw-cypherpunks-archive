If they don't they are screwed.

And everyone outside the US will build their cards without the detector,
or with a software switch to turn it off so they can sell more in the US.

Common sense says they are corrupt pigs who will stop at nothing to
get their profits back up.

And what are they going to do when people build MP3 players from auto
ADC's that don't detect watermarks?  Make them illegal?

And what's to prevent it from happening at a high level if there's
enough profit in it?  MPAA is a tiny market compared to the rest of
the electronics industry - it will be easy to bypass the law on a
huge scale.  You don't need to be a "sufficiently talented electrical
engineer" when you can go across the border, buy 1000 simple/cheap
devices and bring 'em back in your pickup truck.

MPAA is definitly a waste of everybody's time.  They need to be shot
so we don't have to listen to them anymore!!!

Patience, persistence, truth,
