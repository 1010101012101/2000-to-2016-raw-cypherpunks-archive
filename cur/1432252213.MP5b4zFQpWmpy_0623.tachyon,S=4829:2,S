yeah- heard it through the wire its a rough crowd over there...

not worth being stabbed by a ham while walking down the street

also, best to avoid the pyre if at all possible, re: fool/fuel use


has me wondering about the two crypto lists in conjunction,

if a census has been conducted or online survey for background

in that, seemingly there are two or three main areas i am guessing

for crypto backgrounds-- those from the military, those from academia,

mathematics and-or linguistics, & those from computers/webdev


for instance, percentage of ham operators in given age ranges

how many had a parent with electronics or engineering background

how many approached via software development online or pre-internet


it would be interesting to know how the list populations are different

e.g. perhaps older, military trained crypto at the cryptography-list

more computer-based, software development crypto at cypherpunks


also in this same regard; how many learned electronics during era

of crystal radio building etc. or other DIY independent exploration or

homebrew computing or are now involved in microcontrollers today, etc.


and in this same way it would be interesting if more projects/classes/

education could occur for electromagnetic literacy in electronics today

as a foundation for both knowledge and skills yet also experimentation,

prototyping, new code, programming, proof-of-concept crypto systems

that move from ideas into hardware and software models, vice-versa
