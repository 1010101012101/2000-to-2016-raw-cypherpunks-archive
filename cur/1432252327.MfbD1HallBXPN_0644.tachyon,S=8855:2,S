Sierra Wireless Embeds Certicom's movianVPN Client in new Voq Professional
Phone(TM)
Tuesday May 11, 7:02 am ET

New smart phone to provide business users with secure e-mail capabilities
while leveraging existing security infrastructure

MISSISSAUGA, ON, May 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Certicom Corp. (TSX: CIC -
News), the authority for strong, efficient cryptography, today announced
that Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ: SWIR - TSX: SW) has embedded movianVPN(TM) by
Certicom into its VoqMail(TM) Professional Edition (VoqMail Pro) wireless
e-mail solution, offered for the new Voq Professional Phone(TM). As an
embedded feature that supports multiple VPN gateways, the solution is
designed to offer IT managers minimal administration and a better return on
their existing security infrastructure investment.


Based on the Microsoft Windows Mobile(TM) software for Smartphones, the Voq
Professional Phone was developed specifically for enterprise users and
mobile professionals. The product is designed to offer vital business
applications, such as e-mail, and strong security for sensitive and
confidential information.

A key feature of the Voq Professional Phone is the ease with which the
movianVPN client can be integrated into an enterprise's existing security
infrastructure and its minimal impact on performance and battery life of
the phone. By making security an integral part of VoqMail Pro and its
VoqManager desktop IT provisioning tool, and not a separate add-on, Sierra
Wireless has created a turn-key enterprise and business data access
solution that saves time and effort by eliminating the need for IT managers
to work with third parties to buy and configure software and policies for
each device.

"Voq was developed specifically for the needs of the business professional,
and the IT Managers that support them. During development we recognized
that a key requirement of the enterprise was the ability to integrate a VPN
client without comprising the end user experience or increasing the burden
on IT administrators," said Andrew Harries, senior vice president of
marketing for Sierra Wireless. "Working with our partners, we believe we
have succeeded in building a powerful product that provides a strong, user-
and IT-friendly solution."

For over 15 years, Certicom has focused on developing and providing
security for constrained environments. This expertise has resulted in a
wireless VPN client that is one-tenth the size of desktop versions but with
equivalent functionality. It provides strong security, including
confidentiality, integrity and authentication from handheld devices to the
corporate network.

movianVPN, an award-winning wireless VPN client, meets the IPSec standard
to provide secure access to the corporate network via wireless handhelds.
movianVPN fits with existing infrastructure by supporting more than a dozen
gateways, including those from Cisco, Netscreen and Nortel and the three
leading operating systems - Microsoft Windows Mobile, Palm OS and Symbian
OS - including the various versions of the platforms.

"The combination of Sierra Wireless' deep experience in the wireless market
and their diligence in developing the Voq Professional Phone to meet
specific end user requirements has resulted in a Smartphone that addresses
today's needs of the enterprise. They have optimized the user experience
while focusing on process, security, and power management," said Roy
Pereira, vice-president of marketing and product management at Certicom.
"We believe the Voq Professional Phone will become a real success story in
the mobile market."

Sierra Wireless announced the VoqMail Personal and Professional Edition
software on February 11, 2004, introducing an always-there(TM) e-mail
experience and providing easy-to-use, cost-efficient, and secure access to
corporate e-mail. For more information, visit
