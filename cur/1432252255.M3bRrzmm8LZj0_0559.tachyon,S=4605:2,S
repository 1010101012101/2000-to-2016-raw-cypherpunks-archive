I meant it as a joke, not really a cheap shot. The paucity of emotive
grammatical structures in English obscured that. (Let's hear it for
Lojban, the clear choice for a universal human language!)

<eyebrows raised> Oog. c-punks is the major filler of my inbox. Maybe I
just need to subscribe to more mailing lists to lower the percentage

That's clear enough. I don't think the 80% is right, though if you
disregard the obvious trolls and spam you probably nailed it.

A lot of the posts aren't especially related to the technology, use, or
politics of crypto, but are of interest to people of a c-punkish
mindset. No objection to those. My only real objection to the list
traffic is the inconsistency of some of the regular posters. If Joe
Smegface posts nothing but garbage, he's easy to filter. If he posts
about 85% garbage but 15% really good stuff, I don't want to filter him
because the 15% is worth it. The problem is the time and aggrevation
involved in identifying and discarding the 85%.

Agreed. Coderpunks is good for the code aspect, cypherpunks for
all-round issues.
