You need to get away from Manila, Mattd. It just ain't the Philippines,
any more than Paris is France.

Also: give yourself some time for acclimation before writing. I'm glad I
didn't see this piece in '96 before I first came here, because I would
have had a completely false impression of the place.

We notice the things we're not used to and forget the multiple instances
of violence we see in our hometown news in the States because we're used
to that. Perspective is needed.
