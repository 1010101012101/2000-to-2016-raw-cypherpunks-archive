Why do I have this feeling that both statements are true?

Reminds me of the Iran Contra hearings where they had "country number one"
and so on.  (Meanwhile, in the background, the Pacifica announcer in a
golf announcer-type voice is saying things like "and because of <some
foriegn paper publication>, country number one is Saudi Arabia".)

Just because something is sitting in a museum on public display does not
mean its not classified!
