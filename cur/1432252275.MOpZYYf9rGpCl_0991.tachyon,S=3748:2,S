Declan and others know this well, but it bears repeating:

-- the main reason people give interviews is to get their name out in 
the press, to drum up business.

This is why people will drive 20 miles to get to a television studio to 
appear for 70 seconds on CNBC or CNN. All they want is the exposure.

Ditto for most telephone interviews. Most people quoted are selling 
something, either a product or a consulting business or just want 
exposure for future uses.

There are a very few journalists who are actually doing in-depth 
coverage of some topic. These journalist cultivate a handful of sources, 
sources who are not necessarily interested in getting 25 seconds of 
"face time" on a network.
