Actually there's a much more mundane reason for people not viewing the
ads on algebra.com.  The javascipt code is broken and doesn't display
anything in netscape.  So if you view the page with netscape, the ads
don't show...

Oh well, using javascript is a stupid idea anyway.  I think you got
what you deserved on that one...
