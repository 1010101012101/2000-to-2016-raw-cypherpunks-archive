Exactly so. This list, like so many other lists, is gradually moving 
toward "public politics" and "the law" as the focus of many members.

The "public politics" part is obvious: discussions of boycotts of 
Adobe, letter-writing campaigns to Washington, complaining about 
Ashcroft and Feinstein and all of the other vermin, and hand-wringing 
about the need for different laws.

The "law" part is about the above, and exhortations by the lawyers 
here (5, by my count) about what one mustn't do, how courts will 
react, the need to be scrupulously legal in all of one's actions, etc.

"Laws of mathematics, not men."

We risk becoming just a pale--a very, very pale!--imitation of the 
Cyberia-L list.
