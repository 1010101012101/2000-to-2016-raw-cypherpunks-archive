Voluntary DRM can never stop piracy.  With voluntary DRM, people 
can break once on one machine, then run the latest Napster 
replacement on the every machine on the internet in non DRM mode, 
and copy that file that was ripped on one machine, to every 
machine.

Voluntary DRM is only useful to the content industry as a stepping 
stone to compulsory DRM

Voluntary DRM is only useful to the industry to reach the point 
where they can say "Only copyright pirates, terrorists, drug
trafficers, child pornographers, tax evaders, and money launderers
need to run their machines in non DRM mode."
