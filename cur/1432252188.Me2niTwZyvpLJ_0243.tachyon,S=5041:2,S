Hi, Angel,

If I get real ambitious and write the definitive expose' on why "Project
Exile" is the best thing for the "right to keep and bear arms" since the
discovery of smokeless powder, would you have the "good sense" publish same
on your site?

Keep the Faith,

Neal

				David, use this link when sharing the
Project Exile Condemnation Coalition's statement:
				http://www.KeepAndBearArms.com/exile2
<http://www.KeepAndBearArms.com/exile2> 
				...so it doesn't wrap to a second line.

				I am intrigued by the fact that NRA's Board
of Coalition Builders has yet to respond to that statement; considering how
many longtime dedicated leaders and proven patriots have signed it, one
would think they'd have at least said "something."  I guess the fact that
gun rights groups whose memberships collectively represent a large segment
of their own membership aren't important.  Kinda reminds me of those who say
we're wrong but have never taken direct exerpts and challenged them in a
ready-for-publication article so they can be converted by KABAnators in
private emails and then come back to us with gratitude for being patient
with them while they were busy being right.
				By the way, Lao Tzu said, "Brevity is the
root of all grace."
