Much evidence to the contrary. My life is sucking pretty bad lately, due
to either a long series of fairly unlikely and uniformly unpleasant
coincidences or else the machinations of a malevolent universe set up
specifically to piss me off. Another possibility is that suggested by

in the stories told by Authors, the multifarious and nefarious gods.
