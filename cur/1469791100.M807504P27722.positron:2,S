I don't think Zen's point can be stressed enough... There is literally so much out there, if you really want to learn something well it's important to develop a little tunnel vision, verging on myopia, until you have sufficient mastery... At which point you can branch back out to a broad view and see how your new understanding of <whatever> informs future research & learning endeavors...

I have this exact problem myself.
