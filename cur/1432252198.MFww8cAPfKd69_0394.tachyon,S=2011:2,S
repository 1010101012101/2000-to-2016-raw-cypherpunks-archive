I'm fairly sure that virginia in 1996 was similar -- I voted absentee in
VA that year (being a college student at the time) and I don't recall
having to find a notary public, which, given that I was in bumfuck, west
virginia would have been a significant outing (along the lines of going to
K-mart -- and I remember all the times we did that...)
