In this loooong comment, i see so many lies and propaganda... so many
delusions and contradictions (some of them Juan has commented), so many
psychological techniques that mislead the direction of the discussed
subject/s.... that it seems like *a big fucken ameriCunt SARCASM*, when
someone claims, among other false things, that there is no propaganda
in/from the us, providing a billion tons of cheap US propaganda by himself.
