They raised more than 60,000 US dollars in 5 days on kickstarter
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721744279/push-the-freedombox-foundation-from-0-to-60-in-30

"The donation that pushed us over the edge came from Blaine Cook, the
former lead architect for twitter, which is a nice vote of confidence,
but we would like to take a moment and send our thanks out to all of
the people who have helped contribute to this great drive, and
encourage everyone else to take a look." They announced on their
website yesterday

You have to keep reminding your government that you don't get your
rights from them; you give them permission to rule, only so long as
they follow the rules: laws and constitution.
