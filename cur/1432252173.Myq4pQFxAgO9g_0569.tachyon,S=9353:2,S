Announcing 3 Co-located Workshops


Dear Colleagues,

We are glad to announce 3 workshops co-located with the Financial
Cryptography and Data Security.

Workshop on Real-Life Cryptographic Protocols and Standardization
https://www.nec.co.jp/rd/en/event/RLCPS10.html
Paper Submission Deadline: October 2, 2009, midnight PST

As a fruit of modern cryptographic research, we have seen many
cryptographic primitives such as public-key encryption and digital
signature algorithms deployed in real life systems, and standardized
in many international organizations such as ISO, ITUT, IEEE, IETF,
and many others. We have also seen some cryptographic protocols as
well, such as key distribution and entity authentication, and some
dedicated protocols for limited purpose systems. This workshop aims
to bring researchers and engineers together to share their
experiments regarding the design of cryptographic primitives and
protocols deployed in real life systems. These schemes may not be
published in current conferences due to the perceived lack of novelty
of their core design components. However, the process of designing
the best suitable protocol in the presence of hardware and software
limitations in a real life system is worth sharing. This workshop
also aims to stimulate discussions on standardizing cryptographic
protocols.

Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security Research (WECSR 2010)
http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~spock/wecsr2010/
Submissions Due: October 15, 2009, 11:59pm, EDT (UTC-4)

Computer security often leads to discovering interesting new problems
and challenges. The challenge still remains to follow a path
acceptable for Institutional Review Boards at academic institutions,
as well as compatible with ethical guidelines for professional
societies or government institutions. However, no exact guidelines
exist for computer security research yet. This workshop will bring
together computer security researchers, practitioners, policy makers,
and legal experts. This workshop solicits submissions describing or
suggesting ethical and responsible conduct in computer security
research. While we focus on setting standards and sharing prior
experiences and experiments in computer security research, successful
or not, we tap into research behavior in network security, computer
security, applied cryptography, privacy, anonymity, and security
economics. This workshop will favor discussions among participants,
in order to shape the future of ethical standards in the field. It
will be co-located with the Fourteenth International Conference on
Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2010.

Workshop on Lightweight Cryptography for Resource-Constrained Devices
http://www.wlc2010.udl.cat/
Paper submission: September 30, 2009

Lightweight devices like smart cards and RFID tags are at the core of
novel emerging technologies in the information society. These devices
must be cheap so as to permit their cost-effective massive
manufacturing and deployment. Unfortunately, their low-cost limits
their computational power. Other devices, like nodes of sensor
networks suffer from an additional constraint, namely, their limited
battery life. Secure applications designed for these devices can not
make use of classical cryptographic primitives designed for
full-fledged computers. In this sense, research on low-cost
cryptography is fundamental. This workshop aims to be a forum for the
presentation and discussion of current research on different topics
related to low-cost cryptography, from cipher design to
implementation details.

Financial Cryptography and Data Security
Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
25-28 January 2010

http://fc10.ifca.ai

Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major international
forum for research, advanced development, education, exploration, and
debate regarding information assurance, with a specific focus on
commercial contexts. The conference covers all aspects of securing
transactions and systems.
