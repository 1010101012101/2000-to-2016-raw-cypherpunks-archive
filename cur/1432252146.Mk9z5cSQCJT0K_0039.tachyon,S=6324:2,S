Wiretapping usually involves collecting content or traffic metadata
that is identifiable to the user. When not against a specific user,
disclosing a real IP address in itself might be more of an edge case
along the lines of circumvention of the tech, cracking what the user
setup, etc. There probably need to be test cases to cover these areas
as applied to anonymity networks.

That's still thinking in terms of some BS non-full-disclosure
legal/professional/industry play-nice rules. There's no reason
why, if their is no crime, no contractual party loss, etc that
the 1st amendment can't be used to disclose it.

And ZERO reason whatsoever that the research cannot simply
be anonymized, rewritten and anonymously posted somewhere
as if it were developed in parallel by some anon.

It's as if while playing their legal/credit games they forget/ignore
that vulnerable users come first. Or someone bought them out.
