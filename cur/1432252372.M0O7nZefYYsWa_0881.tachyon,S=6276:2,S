Some would say the program is globalization... more delicately,
a cooperation of sovereignties towards a common goal. Whether
you can expect to see written evidence proofs ala Snowden
depends on how much of the material in groups like the above,
Bilderberg, UN, the usual suspects are recorded as opposed to
being just chats. Another question is if so, what is/are the common
goals? Are they planned/negotiated, or simply coming together from
the subconscious. These are areas where you need wide ranging
research/articles/books as in the OP taking it all in to take speculation
to hypothesis to discovery of a presence, if any.
