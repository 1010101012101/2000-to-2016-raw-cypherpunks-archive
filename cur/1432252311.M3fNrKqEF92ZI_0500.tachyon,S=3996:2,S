I use Agent.

If you do not use such a newsreader, you should probably use the 
"secret-admirers" list, to ensure that no one can tell which particular 
message you care about.

If, however, you use a newsreader like Agent to download all of 
alt.anonymous.messages, as I do, you get the same security, and greater 
obscurity.
