	It seems kinda obvious to me that analyzing the security of
	say a symetric encryption algorithm is very different
	than analyzing the security of something like tor. 

	In the case of tor there a A LOT more probabilities and
	unknowns involved. Also in the case of tor there are a few very
	damning knowns.

	So, any advertising regarding something like tor must have a
	lot more disclaimers than say, AES advertising.

	It's not just 'history'. Tor is fucked up because of its
	nature, purpose and past and current funding.

	The appelbaum soap opera is totally irrelevant actually, except
	that it's good because it shows that the members of the tor
	project are backstabbing clowns.

	Now, think how much trust people who don't even trust
	themselves deserve.

	The 'traffic analysis' of tor is not even crypto. It's based on
	IXPs taps, not on fancy math and number crunching.

	There isn't any fallacy there. They weaken crypto because that
	serves their ends. 

	And if they need a 'secure' cypher they won't use any of the
	ones they sabotaged. 

	But, again, this doesn't apply to tor.

	I don't think the US military are dumb. If you do, then you are
	not thinking as correctly as you should.
