Cellphones are cheap enough, and monthly charges are small enough when 
N machines share the same monthly account charge (Dad, Mom, Johnnie, 
Suzy, and Alarm). I would be surprised if today's alarm companies 
already aren't making good use of cellphones.

I have a couple of perimeter lights and alarms on solar panels. Nothing 
to cut without either first using a ladder or, possibly, an accurate 
pellet gun to somehow disable the electronics. (One is mounted under 
the eaves of my roof, very high up. I may put another one in a tall 
oak.)


I've also considered installing a full system with a beeper, with 
802.11b cameras wirelessly sending to a laptop on a large battery. (If 
invaders/thieves/government agents find the laptop, in a closet devoted 
to this, they may not find the second such receiver, possibly hidden 
quite well. Or, for those who live near others, kept in a closet in the 
home of a friend. And even if they find it, I'll presumably still know 
I was invaded.)

I figure that for a few thousand dollars and a spare laptop or two I 
could have a system very resistant to cutting phone or power lines, and 
something which would make surreptitious entry teams think twice. 
(Leave a couple of the 802.11b cameras visible, put another behind a 
Lexan plate, etc.)
