It was interesting, but unless I misread it (a distinct possibility)
the squirrels didn't really have something we'd call a reputation.
The squirrels would remember "that squirrel keeps claiming there's
a stuffed badger when there is no stuffed badger" and would
ignore his warnings, but a real reputation system would be more 
like a new squirrel shows up and the experienced squirrels
tell the new squirrel which squirrels are reliable and which aren't.
I don't think squirrels are capable of that.

The idea of a universal scalar reputation would be that every 
squirrel in the world has the same opinion of every other
squirrel's reliability. I don't think anything like that exists
in any species.

But that's not the issue.  The point is that repution ins't a simple 
scalar i.e. one can have a repuation as being highly informed in
certain circles and be considered a complete nutter in others,
or considered extremely well informed on certain topics and
woefully misinformed on others.  Even a reputation for morality 
implies conforming to a specific idea as to what moral behavior is.
