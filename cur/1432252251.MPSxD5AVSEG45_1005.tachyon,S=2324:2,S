Yes, but the old question needs to be asked: How much of this crime would go 
away if crystal meth were legal? There's little doubt that the vast majority 
of drug-related crime stems not from some crazed crime spree but from issues 
relating to supply and demand. Legalizing drug XYZ no doubt drops the cost.

Then again, if we legalized a lot of drugs then what would all those 
corrections officers do for a living? Become airport security experts no 
doubt.
