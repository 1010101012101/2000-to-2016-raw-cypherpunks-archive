  The sixth beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is now available from the
  OpenSSL FTP site <URL: ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/>.  This beta
  contains just a few fixes since beta 5.

  This is assumed to be the final beta.  The final release of OpenSSL
  0.9.7 has been rescheduled for somewhere between Friday 2002-12-27
  to Monday 2002-12-30, mostly because of all the holidays around that
  time.  To make sure that it will work correctly, please test beta 6
  thoroughly, for example with your favorite piece of software, and
  please report back to us!  Also, please test on as many platforms as
  you have available and you have time for, especially on less common
  platforms.

  If you're interested in helping further, please join the
  openssl-dev@openssl.org list, where test requests on specific
  development snapshots will be announced.

  Changes between 0.9.7 beta 5 and 0.9.7 beta 6 include:

      o Solaris shared library fixes.
      o Support for new platforms: Linux 64-bit on Sparc v9
      o Now only builds PIC code when shared library support is requested.
      o Makes symbolic links to or copies of manuals to cover all described
        functions.
      o Dynamic lock bugfixes.
      o Correct DES header protection macros for better backward compatibility.

  The full set of changes between 0.9.6{x} and 0.9.7 beta 5 include:

      o New library section OCSP.
      o Complete rewrite of ASN1 code.
      o CRL checking in verify code and openssl utility.
      o Extension copying in 'ca' utility.
      o Flexible display options in 'ca' utility.
      o Provisional support for international characters with UTF8.
      o Support for external crypto devices ('engine') is no longer
        a separate distribution.
      o New elliptic curve library section.
      o New AES (Rijndael) library section.
      o Support for new platforms: Windows CE, Tandem OSS, A/UX, AIX 64-bit,
        Linux x86_64, Linux 64-bit on Sparc v9
      o Extended support for some platforms: VxWorks
      o Enhanced support for shared libraries.
      o Now only builds PIC code when shared library support is requested.
      o Support for pkg-config.
      o Lots of new manuals.
      o Makes symbolic links to or copies of manuals to cover all described
        functions.
      o Change DES API to clean up the namespace (some applications link also
        against libdes providing similar functions having the same name).
        Provide macros for backward compatibility (will be removed in the
        future).
      o Unify handling of cryptographic algorithms (software and engine)
        to be available via EVP routines for asymmetric and symmetric ciphers.
      o NCONF: new configuration handling routines.
      o Change API to use more 'const' modifiers to improve error checking
        and help optimizers.
      o Finally remove references to RSAref.
      o Reworked parts of the BIGNUM code.
      o Support for new engines: Broadcom ubsec, Accelerated Encryption
        Processing, IBM 4758.
      o A few new engines added in the demos area.
      o Extended and corrected OID (object identifier) table.
      o PRNG: query at more locations for a random device, automatic query for
        EGD style random sources at several locations.
      o SSL/TLS: allow optional cipher choice according to server's preference.
      o SSL/TLS: allow server to explicitly set new session ids.
      o SSL/TLS: support Kerberos cipher suites (RFC2712).
	Only supports MIT Kerberos for now.
      o SSL/TLS: allow more precise control of renegotiations and sessions.
      o SSL/TLS: add callback to retrieve SSL/TLS messages.
      o SSL/TLS: support AES cipher suites (RFC3268).

  The distribution file name is:

      o openssl-0.9.7-beta6.tar.gz
        MD5 checksum: 8877ea9643e4d6ac18476bc63015c450

  The checksum was calculated using the following commands:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.7-beta5.tar.gz
