There was a weapons charge as well, which will always complicate matters considerably.  The unconventional life is a more or less fine thing until it gets perpendicular to the conventional life, usually in the form of law enforcement agents.  When that happens, and it almost surely will, what is necessary is a relatively big bunch of money, or a plea bargain.

What happened here is happening to young men (yes, usually men, and as in this case, of color) all over this country all day long every day who are found in possession of light amounts of controlled substances.  You people think being an anarchist makes you special?  Sheesh, gimme a break.

An anarchist has been sentenced to a year in jail for having links to
explosives information on his Web site.  AmeriKKKa is further fucking the
First Amendment by restricting whom he may associate with in the future,
and what views he may espouse.

As is usual in most criminal cases today, the defendent was forced to plea
bargain to avoid the threat of worse charges if he went to trial.

LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- A federal judge sentenced a man to a year
in prison Monday for creating an anarchist Web site with links to sites on
how to build bombs.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson sentenced Sherman Austin to more than
the prosecutor had recommended under a plea bargain.

Austin, 20, pleaded guilty in February to distributing information related
to explosives.
