No... but they're UNDOUBTEDLY more reliable then your sources.

If you think a'moon-walker robot' could move something that size, go

That's NOT a 'logical question'. That's a leading question containing a

Dast I say... "The 'solid evidence' is up your ass and your asshole's so
big you can't tell it's there"?

The rest below is just as idiotic, full of speculation, and not worth
responding to.
