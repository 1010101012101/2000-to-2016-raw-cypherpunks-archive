I wouldn't use Borders for my OP book searches in any case.  I use
addall.com.  That particular book doesn't show up currently but a title
search on 'modern explosives' does turn up some other books by Eissler
that may be of interest to the well-heeled fans of explosive devices.

For educational purposes only.

Note that the unlicensed private use of explosives may be legal in America
depending on time and place.  Need any stumps cleared?  How can we stop
that Canadian armoured column slicing through Buffalo and heading down the
Thruway towards NYC?
