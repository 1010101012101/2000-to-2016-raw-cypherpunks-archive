"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the 
candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with the 
result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always 
followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
