           The Digital Commerce Society of Boston

                         Presents

   well, The Digital Commerce Society of Boston, actually...


  "5 Years of Digital Commerce: An Anniversary Celebration"


        Birthday Cake and Champagne will be Served
                 Tuesday, October 3rd, 2000
                        12 - 2 PM
              The Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
                One Federal Street, Boston, MA
           The Club's Dress Code is Business Casual



At Noon, on Tuesday October 3rd, 1995, at the end of summer in a year
when all commerce on the internet was measured in mere tens of millions
of dollars, one year *after* the first book was bought over the net (not
on Amazon, but using a PGP-encrypted credit card between two people on
the cypherpunks list) the 29 folks below:

Richard Blatt        Pierre Bouchard
Jeffrey Bussgang     Travis J.I. Corcoran
John DeYoung         Gerald Gold
Phillip Hallam-Baker Fredrick Hapgood
Steven Hecht         Craig Heim
Robert A. Hettinga   Arthur Hutchinson
Owen D. Johnson      Howard Kaye, Jr.
John Kelly           Rohit Khare
Peter Krautscheid    David Lash
Yezdi Lashkari       Norbert Leser
Richard Lethin       David Lindbergh
Peter Loshin         Kevin B. McLellan
James O'Toole        Ken Rodrigues
Richard Salz         Jeffrey Sutherland
Christopher Wysopal

...put on their suits and ties, went to Downtown Harvard Club of Boston
on the 38th floor of the once-Shawmut, then-Fleet, now-Sovereign Bank
Building.  They had lunch, signed a membership book, and formed Boston
Society for Digital Commerce, which, at the its next meeting, at the
suggestion of Donald Eastlake "to make it more instantiable", changed its
name to the Digital Commerce Society of Boston.

Since then, every first Tuesday of the month (yes, we were the *first*
first Tuesday, though not the First First Tuesday, :-)),with exactly two
exceptions, one an act of God and the other an act of the Harvard Club
and SailBoston :-), we've met, had lunch, schmoozed a bit, and listened
to various principals in the business of digital commerce talk about how
they do what they do.

At the end of this message is a very long list of those who have spoken
to DCSB so far. If we may say so, this list is indeed impressive, not
only for the quality of the speakers and who they became, or even were at
the time, but also for the prescience of their content.

A lot of things have happened since then. Commerce on the net will soon
be measured in trillions of dollars every year, and most people now
believe that *all* commerce of any consequence will happen on the net
soon enough.

Oh. And the Harvard Club doesn't require a jacket and tie anymore. Why?
Because of commerce on the internet, of course! :-).


This meeting, we'll do something of a reprise of the first. Everyone will
be given a chance to reminisce about the last 5 years, but more
important, to predict three things that they think will happen in the
next 5.  Plus ca change, and all that. See you next week!


This meeting of the Digital Commerce Society of Boston will be held on
Tuesday, October 3rd, 2000, from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of
the Harvard Club of Boston, on One Federal Street. The price for lunch is
$35.00. This price includes lunch, room rental, A/V hardware if
necessary, and the speakers' lunch. The Harvard Club has relaxed its
dress code, which is now "business casual", meaning no sneakers or jeans.
Fair warning: since we purchase these luncheons in advance, we will be
unable to refund the price of your meal if the Club finds you in
violation of what's left of its dress code.


We need to receive a company check, or a money order, (or, if we actually
know you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by
Saturday, September 30th, or you won't be on the list for lunch. Checks
payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will have to be
sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they *must* be made payable to "The Harvard
Club of Boston", in the amount of $35.00. Please include your e-mail
address so that we can send you a confirmation

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've
had to work with glacial A/P departments more than once, for instance),
please let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something
out.


Upcoming speakers for DCSB are:

November    Zully Ramzan and
               Nicko van Someren          "A Micropayment Shootout"

As you can see, :-), we are actively searching for future speakers. If
you are in Boston on the first Tuesday of the month, are a principal in
digital commerce, and would like to make a presentation to the Society,
please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Committee, care of Robert
Hettinga, <mailto: rah@shipwright.com>.

For more information about the Digital Commerce Society of Boston, send
"info dcsb" in the body of a message to <mailto: majordomo@ai.mit.edu> .
If you want to subscribe to the DCSB e-mail list, send "subscribe dcsb"
