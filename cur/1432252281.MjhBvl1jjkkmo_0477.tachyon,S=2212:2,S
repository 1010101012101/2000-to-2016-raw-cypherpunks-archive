   Uhh, are you not able to read these days? Better re-read my last post, you
snipped it and then said what I just said:

" Spin doctor yer ass. A bullet is a bullet is a bullet. Cartridge is quite
something else -- made up of case, powder, primer, and *bullet*. So their
ignorance is apparant, if they don't even know the basic facts, what could they
possibly have to say that was relevant? 
"
   I don't mean "casing". 

   Geez. What is your problem?
