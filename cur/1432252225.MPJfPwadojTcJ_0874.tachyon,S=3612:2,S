Good point #1.  Excellent point, in fact.

Good point #2.  Excellent point, in fact.

So, given 1 and 2, it sounds like a good strategy might be:

a.  Declare your sensitive variables volatile and zero them normally.
b.  Check the assembler output because you have to do that anyway  :-)
c.  If (b) exposes an out-of-spec compiler, report it far and wide to all 
available e-mail lists.  Then preferably use a different compiler.  If 
that's not an option, try the va_list trick and go to (b).
