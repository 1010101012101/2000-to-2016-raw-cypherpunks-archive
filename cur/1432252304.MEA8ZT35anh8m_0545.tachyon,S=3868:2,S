I think it is not sensible to include trojans in the threat model, here.
After all, it does not matter how deliciously secure your application seems
to be if you assume there can be a keyboard sniffer there, somewhere.

Why is this? To me it seems that key management at the system level is far
more likely to be securely implemented than the personal blend of a given
app coder.

The same does go for encrypt capable applications as well, only there's
considerably more hassle in trying to setup many of those in a row than in
simply relying on an encrypted backing store.

Could you elaborate a bit on why system level key management isn't enough?
I'm afraid I might be missing something here...
