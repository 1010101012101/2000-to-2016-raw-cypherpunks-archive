This looks like an interesting site.  The Wikipedia admins have backed off 
a bit on their Justin Berry feeding frenzy, and allowed a new, albeit 
somewhat tamer article, to be written. 

I'm now banned under several accounts until the entropy death of the 
universe, although I did manage to disparage Jimbo for a while until I was 
locked out.  

Progress, I guess. :)
