In RE to the DMCA/Dmitry affair, private enforcement, new intellectual
property enforcement divisions, etc. --

We are increasingly holding individuals criminally responsible for crimes
against corporations and many feel an imbalance, or even a double-standard,
in terms of corporate accountability for crimes against people.

I received the following today, by Robert Weissman, co-author of _Corporate
Predators_, (corporatepredators.org) in regard to the Sara Lee Ball Park
Frank Hot Dog incident, in which 21 people died. It prompted them to visit
the White House to inquire as to 'a corporate death penalty.'
