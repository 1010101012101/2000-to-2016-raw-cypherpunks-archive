"Collateral damage" occurs in any battle. If you hold the battle in
Switzerland the "collateral damage" would simply include a higher "loss of
human life" content. (forshadowing of the coming WTO summit in Qatar?)

The real issue is the fact that the battle takes place.

Protestors don't gather and put their personal well-being at risk for no
reason. In the case of those protesting in Genoa, the reasons are varied but
centered around a single point: globalization and big government has not
helped the people. Money doesn't matter; government doesn't matter; people
do matter. The people have not been helped by the forces of globalization.
The people have not been helped by the World Bank, IMF, G8. That is, the
people that populate the cities and farm the countryside. The elite few % of
the people who control the world, via government and corporations, exploit
the rest of the world for their benefit. G8 is just one of their tools. They
are helped by the World Bank. They are the ones being opposed by the
protestors. They will be made accountable for their actions--these battles
will not end.

Revolutions and Civil Wars have occurred regularly for hundreds of years
over this very issue. This war has simply escalated to the scale that is has
because the enemy has escalated to the scale that it has. It takes tens of
thousands or protestors to get a message out against a global governmental
organization.

Contrary to the statements made by current "world leaders", this is
democracy in action.
