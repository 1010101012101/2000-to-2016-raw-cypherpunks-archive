But what is your actual evidence, as opposed to your belief that 
overheating is a likely outcome? I have said that I know of many 
machines (tens of thousands of CPUs, and probably many more I don't 
know about directly) which are running CPU-bound applications 24/7. I 
have heard of no "burning up literally" cases with the many Beowulf 
clusters, supercomputers, and 24/7 home or business screensavers and 
crunching apps, so I suspect they are not common.

If you have actual evidence, as opposed to "likely outcome" 
speculations, please present the evidence.

This is true whether one is running Office or a stamp program. You are 
just repeating a general point about losing a fan, not about stamp 
generation per se. Boxer fan lifetimes are usually about comparable to 
hard drive lifetimes, which also kill a particular machine. You are not 
presenting anything new here, and the association with stamp generation 
is nonexistent.

Most clusters use exactly the same air-cooled machines as are available 
from Dell, Sun, Apple, etc. In fact, the blades and rackmount systems 
are precisely those available from Dell, Sun, Apple, etc.

You are presenting no evidence, just hypothesizing that your stamp 
protocol somehow burns out more CPUs than render farms do, than 
Mersenne prime apps to, than financial simulations do, etc. Yet you 
present no actual numbers.

Evidence is desirable, belief is just belief.
