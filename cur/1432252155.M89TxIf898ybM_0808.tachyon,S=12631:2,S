Yeah. You just need a noisy channel. Radiation is really overkill.

You probably could use quantum tunneling on a silicon chip to produce a
reliably random noise source small enough for a an port.

The issue, however becomes the computer itself. It isn't hard to muck up a
serial port so that you wouldn't even know you aren't getting the true
data.
