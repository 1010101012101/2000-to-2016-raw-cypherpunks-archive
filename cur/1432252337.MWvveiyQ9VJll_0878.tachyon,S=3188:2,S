The west, including the US traded and continues to trade
heavily with Castro, yet somehow that does not lead you to
believe they think Castro a good guy, nor does it lead you to
believe they are actively supporting him.

Every citation Chomsky gives is fraudulent.

I recently posted a paragraph by paragraph examination of one
of his more notorious articles.  Every single citation he gave

It merely means you are dealing with one enemy at a time,
rather than all of them at once.
