Accroding to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:

The proposed rule ... would include a damaged electronic chip as
an additional basis for possible invalidation of a passport....
Under the proposed rule, a passport that contains a damaged,
defective, or otherwise nonfunctioning electronic chip ... may
be invalidated by the Department of State.... If the damage were
caused deliberately, the passport would be invalidated upon
discovery.

The proposed regulation itself provides as follows:

Sec. 51.6 --Damaged, mutilated or altered passport: Any passport
which has been materially changed in physical appearance or
composition, or contains a damaged, defective or otherwise
nonfunctioning electronic chip, or which includes unauthorized
changes, obliterations, entries or photographs, ... may be
invalidated.

I discuss this, and some of Moss's other statements, at:
