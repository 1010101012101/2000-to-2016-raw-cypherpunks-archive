Sure, why stop there though.  Let's raise taxes a bit more and we can
feed everyone who is hungry.  No, that's not enough, let's raise it some
more and we can also clothe everyone - in designer wear.  After all why
should the majority look like slobs when they could be wearing what the
models wear, and for a little more we could send everyone to college, and
for even a little more we can house everyone, in luxury apartments, and
provide them with free cable TV and internet access...

And since government and religion don't mix, let's ban all religeons,
let's burn and sack the churches, they are after all a form of drug
addiction without any drugs and feh! who needs corporations, they
just keep the profits to themselves, let's not tax the People, let's
let the people own the fruits of their work, let's have the workers
profit.  Yes, and to make sure that the capitalist pigs don't come back,
we'll institute government oversight of everything.

While we're on the topic of healthcare, it seems to us that lots of
people don't agree with the party's teachings.  After all, what the
party says is good for the people and for their benefit, therefore those
who disagree with the party are evil capitalists, or more likely they
simply need (re)education.  So let's send them to our glorious mental
clinics.

And so that the People may prosper, let's institute a series of 5 year
plans and great leap forwards...  Sure they'll have to work hard and
sacrifice themselves for a few years, but it's for the children and
the future...


Is this what you are after Nathan?  Socialism/Communism?  Well, in that
case, I have a few words for you:
