I'd wager that overall code and feature bloat is the far larger
consumer of electricity, especially since crypto in hardware.
Also note how if your personal electricity use has dropped but
your bill same or went up, doesn't matter what you use, they
tax you for what they want.
PKI like RSA has always been more costly than stream
like AES, so some auth and special marked stream overhead
isn't likely to save anything, because it's bloat.
Nothing says you can't log your own proof of innocence
Exhibitionists like you could even ship the footage in your
house daily to your good cops for their innocent entertainment.
Why not task yourself to keep yourself secure and thriving.
And have a good laugh about ISIS with the good cops should
they mistakenly knock once in a while about your crypto.
