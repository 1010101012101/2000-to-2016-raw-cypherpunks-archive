Lets be a little fair here, just copying and just
chatting during exams are malpractices, the students
have much political support and relegious support in
these places.
As for openly consulting books durin exam,most of the
universities don't conduct open book exams,except may
be at the iit's.Its a malpractice,elsewhere.

The university sends special squads appointed by the
university itself to check exam malpractices, how ever
if the students counter the squad with sickles and
knifes and swords-it becomes a common practice that
the invigilators get armed police protection. So,in a
riot when the students are out to kill,very little can
be done to protect themselves and people sadly,get
killed.

There are a few sensitive spots in india but where I
am and in South India,we had no such encounters as
yet.
