Informacam

"InformaCam is a mobile application for Android that enables users to
inflate image and video with extra points of data, or metadata. The
metadata includes information like the userâ€™s current GPS coordinates,
altitude, compass bearing, light meter readings, the signatures of
neighboring devices, cell towers, and wifi networks; and serves to
shed light on the exact circumstances and contexts under which the
digital image was taken. With InformaCam the app starts to behave
almost like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, supporting non-destructive,
layer-based edits to media built on top of Obscuracam."

There is a sub-project to standardize metadata called j3m. http://j3m.info/
