Some servers do go down on occasion.  SSZ had an ISDN widget burn out.

Toad.com has been deprecated for several years.  Also, it's not the most
reliable machine - crackers periodically attack it, and it occasionally
has hardware or load problems.

There are other machines - cypherpunks-request@cyberpass.net
is one of the most-used, and Jim's web pages on SSZ point to 
the current list of other ones.



				Thanks!
