Not always - certainly, windows cache goes to a partition that must be
available at windows startup - but webbrowser cache can happily live on an
encrypted disk (I have done this many times)
Further, there is always the Drivecrypt pluspack which mounts an encrypted
volume before windoze starts, and hands over to windoze as it comes up (I
believe the same mechanism is used as for doublespaced drives, but I can't
be sure; drivecrypt is closed source, hence I refuse to use it)

At least in theory a lilo boot could mount an encrypted partition while
still in the initrd stage; as crypto support is moved into the kernel, I
expect to see this become an available option.
