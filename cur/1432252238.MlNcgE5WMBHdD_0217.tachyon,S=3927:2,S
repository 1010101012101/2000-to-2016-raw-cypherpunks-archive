Because it's impolite to attribute other people's ideas and commentary to 
them in a public forum if they assumed they were speaking to you 
informally, in confidence. Hearsay and hot air.

I'm assuming you find Rijndael interesting.

The idea has been around, but not the free software from Sandia.

Never said it was. 50? try 512.

232.6 billion operations a second still looks fairly impressive to me.
