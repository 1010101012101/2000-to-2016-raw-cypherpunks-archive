It took less than a decade for EFF to make a full turn, from championing
unrestricted uses of technology to censoring who can do what and in which way.

In this regards EFF resembles technological empires - like Cisco, for example,
that get born because of radically new ways to do things and then end up trying
to stop any further change.

At some point EFF left the course of enabling individuals and joined their
adversaries in the sense that masses should be patronized and given this or
that. Such EFF is likely to lose its support base and compete with others for
generic feel-good support public.

Anyone has right to offer anything. If there are enough imbeciles to take it,
that's good. Imbeciles should be exploited as much as possible. Those who
capitalize on imbecile protection racket are called politicians.
