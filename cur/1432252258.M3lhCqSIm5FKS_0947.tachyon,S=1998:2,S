802.11b can be jammed very easily; simply by having an 802.11b card 
with a really powerful amplifier (just sniff the traffic and find which 
channel it's transmitting on, then transmit garbage at 50w).  Best to 
have regular ethernet backup channels in at least the most important 
cameras.  Of course someone would need prior knowledge of your system, 
but I think with the level of professionalism you're talking about we 
can assume a decent amount of time/effort put toward surveillance.
