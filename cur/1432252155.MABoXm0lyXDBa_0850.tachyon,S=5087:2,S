Finland's Smart Mobs
Howard Rheingold: Helsinki's Aula.The Aula community in Helsinki and 
cyberspace is still my favorite smart mob - five hundred Finns who design 
and use mobile media to flock and blog, socialize and collaborate in 
geographic and virtual places simultaneously. When I spent an evening in 
June, 2002 with some of the Aula members, I had the opportunity to hang out 
in the "urban living room for the networked society" they were still 
constructing when I first met them, a year previously.
Howard's upcoming book, "Smart Mobs", has been getting lots of press lately 
including this piece in the Washington Post. I visited Aula just before it 
opened a year ago, and was dazzled by its founders' ideas. Howard has 
captured perfectly what's happening there.
The smart mobs notion is going to turn into a meme. Count on it.
