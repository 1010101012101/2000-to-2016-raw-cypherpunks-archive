No, you just don't want to admit you have no clue what Hayek was talking
about...

Where it came from is irrelevant.

Hayek refutes it in Chapter 5 himself. Of course it doesn't apply to the
real world because you CAN'T create any of the three minimum conditions
necessary of a free market.

It's why Hayek also introduces the concept of 'imperfect competition'.

You didn't read (understand) Hayek, come on, admit it...

But Hayek draws a distinction, which damns your argument because you
ignore it, between 'competition' and 'information'.

No, it is related to Tim applying his bigotry. In a free market a seller
has a limited number of factors they may consider. Cost to manufacture,
cost at sale, difference in those prices and whether the market level is
enough to stay in business. It's also worth noting that in regard to 'free
market' the 'perfect information' is related to the product and the price
in the market, not the seller or buyers personal beliefs or actions
outside of the economic exchange.

Please provide a quote from Hayek to support your claim of his meaning.

Quid pro quo.
