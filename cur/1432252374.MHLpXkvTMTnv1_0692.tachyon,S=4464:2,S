No offense meant, of course.

To make sure I don't miss stuff like that is why I subscribe to your
list anyway, even though I'm also subscribed to most of your sources.
It is also why I was glad you caught something he said that
confirmed, precisely, why he's still in my killfile. :-). I don't
need to raise my blood pressure more than necessary.

[Ob Cypherpunks: Seriously, folks. How clueful can someone be who
clearly doesn't know how to use more than one remailer hop, as proven
by the fact that he's always coming out of the *same* remailer all
the time? Even more important, nobody *else* uses that remailer,
which is why killfiling the idiot works so well to begin with...]

Anyway, on this list in particular, I've found that what any number
of smart people say about what the idiot du jour says is much more
interesting than what the actual idiot says himself, which is why he
can safely reside in a killfile.

(Having said more than my share of stupid things here myself in 8
years here, and being no stranger to the odd killfile myself :-), I'm
sure lots of peoples' irony meters are pegged, but, by definition,
those folks can go fuck themselves, I figure. :-).)

Cheers,
RAH
