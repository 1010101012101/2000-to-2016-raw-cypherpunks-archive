Tim May made a faustian pact when he chose crypto-anarchy over 
cyber-liberty.By choosing crypto he chose wisely and well.Kudos to a 
techhead with a screwed down 'tude.We can all see where 'cyber' pulled 
up.Crypto will always posses hidden mystery,"Get stiff in your 
crypt!."Cyber is spacey and losing value."Cyber on dude!",Yeah 
right.Entropy city.
Now we come to anarchy.No one owns it and if they did,they're 
dead,right?...Wrong. L.Beam didnt invent leaderless resistance and Tim May 
didn't invent the word 
'anarchy'.See,proudon,bakunin,kropotkin,malatesta,infoshop,etc.
See,there was a bunch of people who called themselves anarchists before 
Timmy was born,while he was spouting methane and there will be anarchists 
after mays funereal day.They let fools use their good name as long as its 
not abused and/or twisted out of shape to much.When its pimped,flogged and 
perverted they may have something to say.
Well what's this all got to do with me? I hear YOU say.Only,like the cliche 
goes,If you dont know Hirstory...
It'll repeat on you.With the present govt budget for repression anyone 
vaguely associated with anarchy could easily and quickly share the fate of 
all those hundreds of thousands of anarchists who've been slaughtered by 
the states;fascists and communists states.It wont stop the homeland defence 
force when you say your a capitalist or even a Christian.The moniker 
anarchist will be your fatal injection.Better run while the runnins 
good,curse that damn mule Tim May as you run,but run like hell,cos the 
state is like the pharaoh in ancient Egypt.They don't like their slaves 
goofin' off and gettin' ideas.
Bad play Timmy,you aint no fuckin' moses,you aint even crazy abe.No,sad to 
say,Tim Mays the latter day Onan and if we don't start calling ourselves 
cyber-libertarians soon,we'll all be turned to piles of salt or nailed to a 
tree.Merry crypto Xmas.
