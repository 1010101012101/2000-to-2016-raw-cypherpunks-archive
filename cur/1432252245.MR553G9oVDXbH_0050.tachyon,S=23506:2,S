You've validated my statement.

Your problem is if bitcoin becomes a world economy. That means bitcoins
usage grows by something like 2 orders of magnitude. Except that bitcoins
are already halfway mined, which means that the circulation will not keep
up. That is what drives the price up.

If you want a currency that will scale with it's global usage (IE when the
market cap hits $21 trillion, there are 21 trillion in circulation), you
need some mechanism that knows how to equate 1 bitcoin to 1 dollar, that
way more bitcoins can be printed as the market cap goes up.
