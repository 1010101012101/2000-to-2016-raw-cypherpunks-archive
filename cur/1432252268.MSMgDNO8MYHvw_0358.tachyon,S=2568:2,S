Seymor Hersh writes in the October 22 New Yorker about
extensive NSA intercepts of high level Saudi communications
which frankly own up to massive corruption among the 
hard-whoring 5,000 princes and anthrax-snorting co-criminals, 
with a big chunk of the pork-bloodied money going to America's 
most wanted and US-oil-subsidized potbellied piggie.

Not online yet at newyorker.com, but perhaps soon elsewhere.

If Hersh got to hear the intercepts for his detailed accounts
that could get his anonymous source disappeared (no,
not k*lled).
