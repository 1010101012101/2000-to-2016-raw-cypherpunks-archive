UV is actually a very good disinfectant. It works by damaging the
DNA/RNA of bacteria and virii. There is evidence of some viruses being
re-activated by sunlight. UV coupled with a primary disinfectant like Cl
makes a pretty safe system. The 4ft GE Quartz UV bulbs are powerful. The
water should be clear - turbid water attentuates the UV too much.

In very poor places where many children die of dehydration because of
contaminated water and where there is little or no money for water
systems, aid workers have taught the kids to put water into clear
plastic drink bottles ( the kind our landfills are clogged with ) and
leave it in the sun. It works quite well.

How are RO systems at removing microorganisms?
