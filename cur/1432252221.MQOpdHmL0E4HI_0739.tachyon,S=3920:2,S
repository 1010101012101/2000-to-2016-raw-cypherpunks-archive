DEAR SIR,

         REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.

I AM MRS CECILIA MARK AKU, WIDOW OF LATE ISHAYA MARK
AKU,MINISTER FOR YOUTHS AND SPORTS IN NIGERIA, WHO
DIED
ON 4TH APIRL,2002, IN A PLANE CRASH . I HAVE BEEN
INFORMED BY MY FAMILY ATTORNEY, BARRISTER JAMES MOSES,
THAT MY LATE HUSBAND DEPOSITED TWO TRUNK BOXES
CONTAINING MONEY AMOUNTING TO THE SUM OF THIRTY-FIVE
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS
($35,500,000=).THE MONEY WAS DEPOSITED AND CREDITED IN
THE NAME OF A FOREIGN PARTNER WHO WILL RETRIEVE THE
MONEY FROM THE SAFE KEEPING COMPANY. 

IN VIEW OF THIS, THE ATTORNEY NOW ADVISED ME TO SEEK
THE CONFIDENCE OF A FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN 
VOLUNTEER
THE RETRIEVAL OF THE TWO TRUNK BOXES FROM THE 
SECURITY
COMPANY, FOR ONWARD DISBURSEMENT AND INVESTMENT, 
BASED
ON THE FOREIGN PARTNER'S DIRECT SUPERVISION AS
DIRECTED IN MY LATE HUSBAND'S WILL.

TO ENSURE A REWARD FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, YOU WILL BE
COMPENSATED WITH 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM OF
$35.5M.SIMILARLY,5%OF THE FUND HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR
EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF
RETRIEVING THE TRUNK BOXES.LASTLY,MY OWN SHARE WILL 
BE
65% OF THE TOTAL SUM.

AS EARLIER STATED,HIS WILL HAD INSTRUCTED THAT FOREIGN
SHARES,BONDS AND STOCKS SHOULD BE BOUGHT AFTER THE
FUNDS HAVE BEEN RETRIEVED FROM THE SECURITY 
COMPANY,AS
WELL AS INVEST IN THE PARTNER'S COUNTRY WITH HIS
ASSISTANCE. THIS IS AIMED AT SECURING THE FUTURE OF
OUR CHILDREN.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL, 
THEREFORE,KINDLY FORWARD YOUR RESPONSE BY EMAIL TO 
ME
URGENTLY. YOU CAN ALSO SEND YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE 
AND
FAX NUMBERS FOR FURTHER EASE OF COMMUNICATION.

TO THIS END,NOTE THAT I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT THE
TRANSACTION WILL BE CONCLUDED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF
RECEIVING YOUR RESPONSE. ON HEARING FROM YOU ALSO,I
SHALL IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE THE PROCESS OF RETIRIEVING
THE WILL.MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR
CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION, WHICH IS TO
PREVENT THE UNNECESSARY INTRUSION OF THE GOVERNMENT 
OF
MY COUNTRY.

I SINCERELY DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE
CONFIDENCE I REPOSE ON YOU.THIS, YOU WILL ACHIEVE, BY
GIVING ME ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON THE FUNDS
WHEN YOU RETRIEVE IT FROM THE SAFE KEEPING COMPANY.
