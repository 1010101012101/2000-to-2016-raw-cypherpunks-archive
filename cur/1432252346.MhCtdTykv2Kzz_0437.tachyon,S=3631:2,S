For once, I am even harsher than Tim, or at least what Tim wrote.

FBI and other agents admitted to making "misleading" statements in
their arguments to keep Mr Lee in jail. Every goverment employee
involved in "misleading" statements, pressure on Lee's family and
friends, and supression of exculpatory evidence should be immediately
jailed and held in solitary confinement for some multiple of the time
Lee was held.

Those who would monitor and control our behaviour should be held to
higher standards than those they would control.
