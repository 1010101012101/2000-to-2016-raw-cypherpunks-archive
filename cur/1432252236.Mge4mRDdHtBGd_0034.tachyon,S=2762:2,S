     It doesn't surprise me that terrorists are using this trick. The
     very aspects of steganography that make it unsuitable for normal
     corporate use make it ideally suited for terrorist use.  Most
     importantly, it can be used in an electronic dead drop.


There are plenty of applications for businesses, primarily in digital 
rights management. The watermarking systems pursued by SDMI may not 
be foolproof, but that doesn't mean that they don't accomplish 
business goals. There are many corporate uses.
