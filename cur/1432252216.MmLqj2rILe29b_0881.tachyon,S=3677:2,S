There is no such thing as 'the Internet topology'. There are many
topologies and protocols. Some aspects are fractal, some are not. If
you're talking strictly of the connectivity diagram, it is certainly
self-similar (which would account for the power law, I made reference to a
similar power law, m/4, that is used in biology related to branching) and
space filing, but that doesn't make it self similar enough to qualify for 
'fractal' in the strictest sense of the word. Different branches, while
they are both branches, wouldn't share enough common sub-structures to
have similar fractal dimensions, and it still retain any convenience from 
a global perspective.
