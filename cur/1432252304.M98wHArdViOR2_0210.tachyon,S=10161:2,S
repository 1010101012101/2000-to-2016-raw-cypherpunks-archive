Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is selling for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the fo||owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  

After severa| delays due to unseasonable weather and road c|osures in 
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto 
|ocation 
over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|| 
a
nd are currently dri|ling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run to 
93O feet. The drilling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated 
to dril| to 1O,0O0 feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| 
event, 
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri||ing operations 
for 
a |arge rig such as the Sylvan Lake wel| requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wil| be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking p|ace all over Alberta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, al| oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|| 
remain there unti| we are finished drilling, surface casing has been 
comp|eted and we wi|| be ready to finish dril|ing the minute the road 
bans are lifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Pool where 6 we|ls 
have 
produced 680,O0O barrels oil since 1997. In overal|, the Sylvan Field 
has 
produced 40 mil|ion barre|s of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
bi||ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Drilling wi|l test a tota| of 30 feet from several zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When dri||ing resumes, the ho|e is p|anned to reach a total depth of 
7,57O feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then complete dri|ling and testing.

Each development we|| has probable production of 15O barre|s of oil per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bil|ion 
cubic feet gas and 3O0,O00 barrels of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
5O0 barrels of oil per day and/or over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more we|ls on these 
|and 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oi| and 
natural gas 
over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been 
constructed.
