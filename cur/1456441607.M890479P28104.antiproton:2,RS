Notification (Failure)


OK, new threads by me are definitely getting rejected, and
instantaneously too...

Due to a separate rejection, I take it that cross-posting has also
been banned for my email address.

I will not do any run around of creating (or using) an alternate email
address especially for cp@.
That's just an arms race and as I've always said:
- it has been and remains my intention to respect the intentions of
the founders/ creators of this mailing list

So whoever is running/ administrating this list has decided they want
to clip my wings. In principle that's fair enough, BUT:

- no one ever emailed me offlist or onlist saying that they are an
administrator of the list and that they wanted me to post less, or to
meet some other conditions
- such behaviour is cowardly, like a stab in the back
- such behaviour provides no opportunity for me to respect the
administrator(s) of the list - since they never owned up to being an
administrator, and never admitted to me their requirements about
posting less or in some other way, they are being cowardly and
providing no opportunity to me, to meet their requirements
- I do not accept cowardly behaviour from list administrators
- I thought cp@ was not a list of cowards, or for cowards

I am not interested in participating in half a mailing list (one where
I can only receive emails and reply to other people, but not post new
threads and not cross-post).

I am not interested in participating in a mailing list where temporary
(or permanent) restrictions are put in place without notice to the
person being restricted. I will not accept such cowardly behaviour.

SO, short of the cypherpunks list administrator(s) apologising to me
for their cowardliness, and reinstating my posting privileges for my
primary email address, and stating clearly their requirements for
posting to the list, and doing this publicly on the list so other
people know the requirements for posting to the list, then I shall
remove myself from this so-called "community" and find some other
place where who I am is respected, and where cowards are told to grow
the fuck up! Some place where children are not pretending they're
adults with their cowardly behaviour.

Alex, Juan, Jim, coderman and Steve, in one way or another you have
eached gained my respect. Thank you each for being who you are. If any
of you have a suggestion for an alternate mailing list, I would
certainly consider joining. I am still not in a stable enough living
environment nor with any ADSL internet access, so I am still not in a
position to set up an email server myself - but I am confident that
this situation will change within about 1 year.

Best regards,
Zen

PS, if anyone wants to post this email publicly, I certainly consent
to you doing so.
