      I've been checking headers watching for the X-Toad, but none so
far -- not much spam either, but one thing I did notice, that I hadn't
seen before, was an extra X-Loop: on some messages with (in just two,
there hasn't been much traffic) a cypherpunks@algebra.com and ssz.com.
This is in addition to the usual X-Loop: openpgp.net  -- and looking
back, I don't seen those. Is this a new thing? And, it would seem, that
this one does show the origin node? At least in the case of Choate's
message it would seem to -- so toad.com should show up here, I'd think,
and could be filtered on, or is it going to be an actual X-Toad?
      Either way, I'm quite happy to see it! Thanx.
