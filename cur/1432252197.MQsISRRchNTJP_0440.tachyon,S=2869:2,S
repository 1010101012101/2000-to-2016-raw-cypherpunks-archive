#    And what is wrong with simply closing the lines at the closing time.
#    Put a cop or other official at the end of the line and say: "You
#    arrived at 8:01. Polls are closed. Everyone ahead of you will be
#    allowed in to vote, but you are too late."

See text about woman who tried to vote all day,
starting at 10AM.

Any more questions?
