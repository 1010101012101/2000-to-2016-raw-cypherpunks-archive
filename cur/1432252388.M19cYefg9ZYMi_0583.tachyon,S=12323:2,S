Subject: Your PayPal Account


  RE: Money in your PayPal account 

Dear friend, 

That's what you will see if you choose to do this program 
-- and lots of it!! Seriously!! 
This is something that I wouldn't normally even look 
at, except I read an article in the Wall Street 
Journal on June 16th, 2001 about Pay Pal and x.com and the 
e-mails just keep coming in for this. That means somebody's 
making money with it. I finally decided to read the darn 
thing and I'm glad I did. Please read on! 
There have been other articles written about these companies 
in other well recognized journals. Because I'm a member of 
PayPal and use it everyday in my business, I knew that this 
was real and would work. 

THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!! 

Complete it in one hour and you will never forget the 
day you first received it!!! 
Oh! Did I say FAST? "The speed of the internet-type 
fast." The Newsletter and all payments are made on the 
Internet By E-Mail. NEED PROOF? Here are just two 
testimonials from individuals who decided to invest 
nothing more than a little of their time. 

Testimonial from: 
********************************************** 

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC: 
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to 
you..... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mails out like you 
said and went on vacation. When I got back, my account 
was up to over $12,000! I owe you! 
GETTING STARTED. 
The very first thing you need to do is go to PayPal 
and sign up. It takes two minutes and PayPal will 
deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this program 
FREE! 

Here's the link: 

https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_home



BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER ACCOUNT OR 
YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO $100 DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU 
WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!! 

! Then E-Mail the $5.00 from your PayPal account 
to the FIRST name on the list (#1) along with a little 
note like "Please add me to your mailing list." 
BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE 
DISAPPOINTED!!! 

Read the following and you will agree this is a very 
exciting opportunity. 
ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW? 
HOW DOES $20,000 IN TWO WEEKS SOUND? 
Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait for 
the others to start working. One hour of work to get 
started and no mailing lists! This service is 100% 
legal (refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, 
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in 
the US code, also in the code of Federal Regulations, 
Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product 
or service must be exchanged for money received). 
Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much 
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate for 
this program is VERY HIGH VERY FAST -- Internet E-Mail 
FAST -- and you will see results in two weeks or less! 
JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT MONTHS BILLS! 
You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in 
other programs). You should also send them to people 
who send their programs, because they know these 
programs work and they are already believers in the 
system! Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER 
and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are 
already in a program, stay with it, but do yourself a 
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 

START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes NO INVESTMENT! 
It will pay off long before others letters even begin 
to trickle in! 

Just give ONE person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, 
this $5.00 is $5.00 YOU GOT FREE WHEN YOU SIGNED UP 
FOR THE PayPal account). That's all! If you already 
have a PayPal account and do not receive their $5.00 
gift, feel free out of the goodness of your HEART to 
donate a $! 5,00 GIFT to the person in the number 1 spot 
for him to have your name added to the advertisement list. 
So anyone's MAXIMUM INVESTMENT IS $5.00. 
Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you 
will have $20,000 in your bank account! Because of 
the ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 

This program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! FROM just 
ONE $5.00 bill that you get FREE at PayPal!!! 
Follow These Simple Instructions: 
1. E-Mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (#1) along with a note saying "add me 
to your mailing list." Only the first person on the 
list gets your name and five dollar gift. Edit only 
the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST. 
Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the 
list in the THIRD (#3) position. 
Don't try to add your name in the first place in order 
to earn money fast! If you do that, you will ONLY 
reach people you sent e-mail to and then your name 
will be immediately removed from the first place and 
you can't reach more people! But if you add your name 
on the 3rd place, there will be tons of people 
receiving E-Mails with your name first later!!! 
NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring 
URL in the body of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL. Send out 20 copies of this letter. 
ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via 
E-MAIL, the response time is much faster... 
ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! 
CONSIDER THIS, MILLIONS of people surf the Internet 
everyday, all day, all over the world! 

Here are the 3 people to start with. 

Sign up and send $5.00 to the first person!!! 


1.- irahick@yahoo.com

2.- vdice@snet.net

3.- stonecoldcool@home.com


Fifty thousand new people get on the Internet every 
month! An excellent source of names is the people who 
send you other programs and the names listed on the 
letter they send you. Your contact source is 
UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to think of all the 
possibilities! Mail, or should I say E-mail, your 
letter and payment TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of 
your time, THAT'S IT! 

To send your newsletter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE 
PAGE and paste it in the message of your E-Mail 
TO DO THIS: 
1. Go to "edit" and "select all" 
2. Go to "edit" and select "copy" 
3. Start (compose) a new E-Mail message (make sure 
it's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!) 
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box 
5. Go to "edit" and "paste" (Then you can format it 
anyway you want!) 
Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the 
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. 
Remember, YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and move the 
other 2 names up. But DO NOT forget to send $5.00 by 
PayPal (along with your note) to the TOP E-MAIL 
address before deleting it! 
NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in 
this e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. 
When your name reaches the first position in a few 
days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY! The 
money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people 
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! 
That's all! There will be a total of $20,000 in $5.00 
bills in your mailbox (account)in two weeks. $20,000 
for one hour's work! This is real money that you can 
spend on anything you wish! Just deposit it to your 
own bank account or spend it directly from your PayPal 
account!!! It's just that! easy!!! 

I think it's WORTH IT, don't you? 

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4 
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF YOU TRY IT, IT 
WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF COURSE YOU 
CAN---this plan is structured for everyone to send 
only 20 letters each. However, you are certainly not 
limited to 20. Mail out as many as you want. 
Every 20 letters you send has a return of $20,000 or 
more. If you can E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or 
whatever, GO FOR IT! THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE 
MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! 

Each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up a 
new group. 
Be SURE and PAY the first person on the list. This is 
proof that you paid to get put on the list which is 
the service rendered to make all this legal!!! Why 
not? It beats working! 
Each time you receive an MLM offer, respond with this 
letter! Your name will climb to the number one 
position at dizzying rates. Follow the simple 
instructions, and above all, PLEASE PLAY FAIR. That's 
the key to this program's success. Your name must run 
the full gamut on the list to produce the end 
results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list 
WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only 
cheats the other people who have worked hard and have 
earned the right to be there. So please, play by the 
rules and the $$$ will come to you! 
$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will 
prosper! GOOD LUCK $$$ 
You are probably skeptical of this, especially with 
all the different programs out there on the web, but 
if you don't try this you will never know. That's the 
way I felt. I've been watching this type of program 
for years an! d this is about as easy and fast as you 
can get it and it can even be free to try now with 
PayPal, no stamps, no envelopes, no copies to be made 
- just a little effort and faith!!! This program 
really "Kept It Short and Simple"! 
OH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your 
link under your name... you also make $5.00 from 
PayPal... so they pay to open up the account but they 
also pay you when someone signs up from being 
referred by you. AWESOME! 

Let's all make some serious money $$$$$$

Please just play by the rules, this doesn't cost anything 
but your time and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS. 
GOOD LUCK and THANKS !!!!!
