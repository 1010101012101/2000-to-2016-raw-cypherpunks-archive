the best kind of problems!



> Datagrams don't give you any useful anonymity,

correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.

protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.

usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.

sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!

this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.

you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)



and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!
