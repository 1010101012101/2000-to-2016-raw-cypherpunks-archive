You're not the only one. It is a sad state of affairs when this level of
socialism invades our lives. What they should be teaching is self-respect
and self-reliance coupled with a sense of community. Not pity and a 'class

In a couple of more generations democracy will have spin-doctor morphed
into a completely unrecognizable entity.
