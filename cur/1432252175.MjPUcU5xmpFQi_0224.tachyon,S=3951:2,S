Not at all, That's only one example. Unfortunately it isn't sufficient for
your point, the economics weren't the PRIMARY goal as your stipulation
requires. Primary mechanism <> primary goal.

Further, to be absolutely accurate, your commentary 'begs the question'.

A bank robber is not a terrorist.

A terrorist may be a bank robber (as many have been, eg. SLA).

It's not I who is not thinking broadly enough.
