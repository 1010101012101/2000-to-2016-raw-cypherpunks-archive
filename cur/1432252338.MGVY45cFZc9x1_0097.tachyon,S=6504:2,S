What the fuck do you mean unfortunately?

Why is it forbidden by law?  Bob signed a contract with Mallory waiving
certain rights in exchange for the service provided by Mallory. Mallory
provided full disclosure of it's rights to Bob along with Bob's
responsabilities, etc.  Bob chose to accept those terms, how is this
illegal again?

If the service Mallory provides Bob is inadequate, that's between Mallory
and Bob, not between Alice and Bob.  Alice and Mallory have no contract
what-so-ever.  It's upto you, Alice, to convince Bob of this fact.  If you
can't, that's Bob's choice, not yours.  And you have no business to
interfere between Bob and Mallory.

Wrong.  Bob agreed to those terms of service, it's not a denial of
service, it's part of Bob's agreement with Mallory.

No.  Either you have agreed to live in said house by purchasing it, and
have therefore become a citizen of said city, and by such actions agreed
to abide by it's laws, or pre-existing laws allowed the city to run such
water services through your propery.  This too is by contract.

Where, Ms. Alice, is your contract with Mallory again?

No, it does not.  Please take this to
alt.dumb.law.questions.asked.by.clueless.morons.  This has nothing to do
with cypherpunks.

So, in that case if you need a red stapler, you should be able to break
into AOL's offices and steal one?????  Since fucking when?

That's the choice of your friends and family, not yours.  Take it up with
them, not AOL.

This is true - utpto the point where you place said packets on the
internet.  From that point on, while you may retain copyright (even that
is questionable), you have explicity caused an automated action that takes
said packets and puts them into the machine that is the internet, for it
to do what it does.  If some of the members of that machine do things
differently than you expect, it sucks to be you, but that's your problem,
not theirs.  You decided to place those packets on that network, not the
members of that network.

If you put a book you wrote into a shredder, well, who are you going to
sue?  The shredder company? Or yourself?

No, dumbass, you placed those packets on said network repeatedly after you
have discovered that they will be dropped in the bit bucket, that's too
bad for you.  You've vandalized your own packets.

And that is their right, as contractually agreed to by their customers -
your friends and family members included.  You have no stake in this, nor
any relationship with AOL.

> This is clearly an abusive use of property, and I have
> no tolarance for it.  

No, you abused your own property knowing full well it would be dropped
into the bit bucket right after the 1st time you tried it.  And since
you've got no contractual agreement with AOL, you have no expected
reasonable expectation that AOL would forward your packets to your f&f,
especially if AOL deems your packets to be harmful to it's network for
whatever reason.

Your idiocy is showing.
