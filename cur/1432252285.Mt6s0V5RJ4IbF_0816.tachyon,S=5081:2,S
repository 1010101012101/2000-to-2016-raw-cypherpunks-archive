I didn't "dismiss" it. In fact, I wrote more about this issue, which I 
haven't seen brought up by anyone else here, than 95% of all posts to 
Cypherpunks have in their entire amount of original material!

I never claimed that a stable end-state is that of some airlines have 
"no security procedures." Such was not the case before 911, so it is 
even less likely today.

I don't know what the evolution will look like. The ecology of the 
security measures will probably, if allowed to by regulators, have a few 
hyper-conscious players like El Al, a few cattle car playes like People 
Express, and a bunch of players in between.

I was not "dismissing" this issue of collateral damage, of tort damage. 
I said Friedman explores such things in great detail.

However, the current system does not allow the positive effects I 
described. Any airline in the U.S. (or many other countries) which 
attempted some obvious security measures would face lawsuits by 
"discriminated against" customers.

This is a more pressing problem than some extremely unlikely scenario 
wherein some carrier adopted a "no security procedures" policy.

You are making my point, not arguing against it. I never claimed that a 
spectrum of security measures would be a stable, or even a short-term, 
state.
