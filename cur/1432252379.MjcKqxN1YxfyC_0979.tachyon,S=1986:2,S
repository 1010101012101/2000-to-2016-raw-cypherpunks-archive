Non anonymous digital money is inherently reversible.  For many
purposes, this is a good thing.  For other purposes, damn near
intolerable.  Reversibility imposes large costs on issuer,
buyer, and seller.

Reversibility imposes on all participants not merely the
possibility of tracking identity, but the necessity to track
identity, which is expensive and a major pain in the ass.
