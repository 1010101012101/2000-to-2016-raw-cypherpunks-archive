Well, if you take this as technically literally as possible:
- as few as two log files counts as "access log files", and
- say those log files recently discovered as part of a cryptome
archive, counts as "from 1996", as in "since 1996, just not inclusive,
nor complete"

How very punk, and how very cypher.

This is all hilarious - $10K, or bittorrent. At least he included the
donation link...

John, just for the record, and from most all of us I'm certain, thank you again.

No, I don't object to any of the questions that have been asked -
something about speech and remotely related to fr... fre... freedom
was that? Ah, whatever... memory ain't the best right now.

Peace,
Zenaan
