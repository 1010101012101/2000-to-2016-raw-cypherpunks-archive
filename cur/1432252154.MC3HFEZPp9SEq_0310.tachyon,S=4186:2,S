Does anybody know if anything ever came of PGP Inc.'s
attempts to get the Vatican to use PGP?

(I couldn't find a PGP key on www.vatican.va,
though they could be using them just internally.
They do have the Secret Archives on CD-ROM now,
at least for Popes from a long time ago.
I guess the secrets you can find on CD-ROM
aren't the real secrets....)
				Thanks!
