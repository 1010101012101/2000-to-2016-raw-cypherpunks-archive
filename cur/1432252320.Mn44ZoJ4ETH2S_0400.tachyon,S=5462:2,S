> (2) threats to the United States and its interests from terrorism;

Not only is the action not well defined 'terrorism', nor is
the resultant 'threat' from it, nor is the source and sink
of that action. So not only is Muhammad flying his
private 747 from Arabia into the Empire State subject
to general warrants in bulk... so is Joe Midwest Farmer
marching on Congress pitchfork in hand or burning
his fields to stop up the just in time food flow in protest
of some subsidy issue.
Same loose interpretation could be applied to most of
those stanzas.
Weasel words and mission creep, a year from now and
everything will be the same, unless Joe and Corp do
in fact continue to get up and act up about it.
