i'm sorry, my coping mechanisms are limited. you must assume the right filters.

in all seriousness,
 as for teaching others,
  surely i do this much more badly than most.

missing experience combined with lack of teaching knowledge a starting
point position.  there is no How Children Succeed (Paul Tough) for How
Children Nuture The Hack. there is no "the smartest kids in the world
and how they got that way" (Amanda Ripley) for the skilledest hacker
kids in the world and how they hack that way. there is no Building a
Better Teacher (Elizabeth Green) for Building a Better InfoSec Mentor
and Research Leadership Culture.  inspiring more STEM in general a
challenge, infosec same and then additional complexities and
complications... [0]

regarding DEF CON specifically, the joy always and will be the people
and conversations. while i may harp on the talks in dark humor, the
con as a whole is premium despite oversold and diluted trends to
current. DEF CON++ :)

last but not least, a 8x512G Samsung 840Pro SSD single dumb logical
drive in full bay enclosure works best for throughput. what throughput
can you reach in this setup? TBD: host mainboard w/ 12TB DDR3 slotting
ala COPACOBANA; formal request for DEF CON 23 volume mirror operations
- PCIe x16 lanes to memory resident copy of content.. for SCIENCE!

 perhaps best retort an abridged collection for just this. the set of
what i've found useful a good base of usefullness to others. ETA:
unknown until post-Vegas. suggestions solicitied!
