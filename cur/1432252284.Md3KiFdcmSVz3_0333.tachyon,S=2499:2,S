The claim that Brands' signature scheme is linkable is incorrect (I 
haven't checked the other claims in the paper). The attack checks that 
a^{c'c^{-1}}.g^{s'-c'c^{-1}s} = a' for a signature {m', z', c', s'} and 
a view {m, r, z, a, b, c, s}.

The above equation reduces to

  = g^s' a^{c'c^{-1}} g^{-c'c^{-1}s}
  = g^s' (a g^{-s})^{c'c^{-1}}
  = g^s' (g^s y^{-c} g^-s)^{c'c^{-1}}
  = g^s' y^{-c'}

which is the normal signature validation term. If fact, you can see that 
the attack will match _any_ signature with _any_ view. Therefore, it 
provides no information to the attacker.

Cheers,
