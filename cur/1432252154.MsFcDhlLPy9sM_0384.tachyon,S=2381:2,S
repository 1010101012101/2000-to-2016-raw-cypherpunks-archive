thoughts on making this simpler?

0. insert new second disk of equal or greater size
1. boot from trusted cd/dvd ISO image
2. insert USB memory stick (or two if you want a backup)
3. enter new password / passphrase (see good password howto)
4. agree/confirm to copy over empty / target disk
5. wait as new disk is encrypted via loop-aes, keys are stored on
password protected USB image, all existing OS data* on source disk is
copied to encrypted volume on new disk.
6. reboot into new encrypted volume and copy back over original source
hard disk with loop-aes and store keys for this disk on USB image.
7. Johnny gets a data backup with his privacy.

* ubuntu, knoppix, slackware, linspire and centos supported.  a
windoze or other partition (vfat, ntfs, etc) can be copied and mounted
under a new installation of the previously mentioned linux OS'es on
the new encrypted disk. (if one of these linux flavors is not already
installed)
