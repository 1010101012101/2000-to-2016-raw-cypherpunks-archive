			   Global Freedom From Force


	   Independence From Politics and Currency-Based Economies

		 A Precursor to Digital Neo-Tech Revolutions

	     For A Volitional, Anti-Force, Capitalist Civilization



Outlining the possibilities of creating freedom through new, non-traditional
financial business strategy and technology, in business- and economic details,
and specifications for technical development, this manuscript represents the
first integration of New-Technology/Internet-driven business infrastructures,
logistics, and markets of the future with core concepts of Neo-Tech and
Neo-Tech business. It outlines how the integration and evolution of three 
existing basic concepts -- 1) Wide-scope accounting strategies to protect
business assets, 2) Cyberspace/Logistics/Reputation-driven Barter Communities,
and 3) A Global Anonymized Computerized Market -- can together lead to total
economical freedom and volitional trade, on an individual and ultimately on a
world-wide scale. The practical implementation of the strategies described, and
the necessary infrastructures, while today in planning by only a small number
of businesses, is an enormous opportunity for any entrepreneur, manager or
CEO to understand, integrate with his business, contribute to and profit from.

First, what is Wide-Scope Accounting a.k.a. Golden Helmets? As a concept, it
is almost as old as human society itself, but was first explicitly identified
and named by Frank R. Wallace, author at Neo-Tech Publishing. The original
explanation of the concept of Golden Helmets, given in a courtroom speech,
can be found at: http://www.neo-tech.com/golden-helmet/chapter3.html

Wide-scope accounting is a wealth management tool, allowing a person to live
without any taxable personal income. Rather, all money is kept by one's company
and utilized to expand the company and maximize its values, while one's own
expenses necessary to live and work (food, housing, car, etc.) are company
expenses. Any individual living this way, in a 100% service environment, but
without private income or excess property, therefore, cannot be taxed. One's
own company itself focuses not on immediate profits but on building maximum
high-quality values, efficiency and new jobs. Taxable profits in a company are
minimized by re-investing, while the value-maximized work leads to high
revenues, and widens the business through additional partners and employees.


		Breaking The Chains Of Today's Criminal Politics

With Neo-Tech, Frank R. Wallace also openly identified that the reason for the
modern, century-old economy-controlling/economy-draining high income taxes are
not primarily to satisfy the financial requirements of governments and
"the public", which could as well be achieved through less compulsive, more
voluntary taxation schemes. Rather, the prime reason for income taxes and
their often life-destroying enforcement by armed government hunters is to
keep control over people -- legal, bureaucratical, social and psychological --
by controlling everyone with a strong, limiting grip on his or her prosperity,
privacy, business, happiness, and ultimately, life.

Wide-scope accounting in business lets a company always pay excess taxes
indirectly, by creating jobs and boosting markets, which leads to direct and
indirect tax payments by multiplying the profits of others, while minimizing
one's own financial liability. It allows any businessman to outmaneuver
criminal politics without being an "Atlas that Shrugs" -- in contrary, it
means producing more and harder than ever, and in the long term, profiting
enormously, but at the same time withdrawing all support for the force-backed
tax system -- legally, and without making any force or resistance necessary.


		Regulated Currencies Mean Regulated Values

However, despite the tool of wide-scope accounting readily available to
everyone, one must face the reality of a politically undermined/controlled
economy existing practically everywhere today. Vast economies -- valuable,
but yet, drained -- today depend on monetary systems ultimately regulated
by local and international political authorities. Thus, the task is to
sublimate traditional economical dynamics to direct value-creation/value-
exchange dynamics of an economy beyond wide-scope accounting within traditional
currency systems -- immune from external force, authorities and corruptions.

Without making a mistake about it, official currencies do represent the
material values that they are exchanged for. And, contrary to the views
propagated by dishonest media, academics, traditionalists, politicians and
activists, money is not the "root of all evil". Yet, in a way, all official
money is corrupted, since it is regulated directly and indirectly by
governments through taxation-, banking-, anti-inflation-, anti-deflation-,
public insurance-, tariff-, business- and economic regulations and laws which
affect everyone who uses money and indirectly forces everyone to pay up insane
proportions of his personally earned wealth. As all official, government-issued
currencies for value exchange are regulated, drained and corrupted in
traditional economic systems, every magnificent commercial value is, too!

Hence, even beyond wide-scope strategies to protect from direct government
confiscation, taxation and attacks, the problem of force-backed economic
control remains. How could non-authority, non-force businesses and individuals
generate sufficient availability and acceptance of efficient, but gradual and
fully volitional changes from state-owned systems based on money to
individually-controlled, systems based on market value, available world-wide
to everyone? Obviously, cyberspace, which cannot be efficiently regulated, may
play a role. However, the decentralized Internet is only the foundation, upon
which scaling levels of infrastructures for specific financial solutions must
be consciously conceived and implemented with foresight and long-term efforts.

The globalization of free business activities, i.e., international competition
between businesses and between the degree of freedom in different states,
is crucial for a cyberspace-based economy to succeed -- as business on the
Internet does not have to be based in any single country and be restricted
by its laws. Unfortunately, the globalization of recent international political
policies, which enforce regulations (e.g. "financial-crime" surveillance,
international liability to violation of political/ethical/cultural policies,
international trade bans and regulations of certain goods, etc.), may partially
limit and dis-empower the trend of overcoming national laws through
globalization. These newly emerging freedoms of globalization
must not be limited. In order to achieve and maintain freedom from local laws,
regulated economies, mandatory regulated currencies, and now, international
regulations, a combination of logistical, technological, communicational and
financial solutions must be brought forward by market entrepreneurs
to prevent or reverse the expansion of international government force.


		Bartering Communities And The Argentinian Lesson

Wide-scope accounting is a simple protective measure, but it can require a
full-scale revision of business and employment policies. Ultimately, the
question is, Can wide-scope accounting alone and in every situation solve
the problem of ending political regulation of earnings and business values?

Bartering Communities, mentioned by futurist authors, including Alvin Toffler
and Barry Carter, as a complementary approach to wide-scope accounting,
especially when upgraded with modern technology and e-commerce dynamics,
are ironically exemplified within the politically/economically-collapsing
nation of Argentina. The concept is based on the idea of having trade
systems for goods and services that do not rely on officially issued
government currencies, and hence cannot be regulated by means of regulations
based on official currencies. It can also protect against inflation, deflation,
fiscal instability and other traditional economical short-term problems.

Argentina is taken as an example here because of the interesting grassroots
business infrastructures that have been building as a result of the total
government-led control and collapse of that country's traditional economy.
Those infrastructures are privately created trade/bartering communities,
not based in cyberspace, yet highly effective because of the enormous demand.
People meet at a physical center, i.e. a local community center, and offer
their own goods or service to others for some other goods or services, but
not for official currency. "Prices", i.e. the amount and ratio of values is
negotiable. Some of the people are well-known (i.e. their identity can be
confirmed by others at that center) and carry a reputation. Also, a completed
trade of goods or services has effects on the reputation/trustworthyness
of both exchange partners involved in that transaction. A completed trade may
also establish or re-affirm guidelines for specific exchange ratios, e.g.:
"1 pound of sausage for 10 apples", "1 haircut for 1 carwash", "400 sheets of
paper and a printer for 2 hours of business- or legal consulting". The same
works with privately-issued currencies: goods and services can be traded for
ad-hoc currencies, e.g. 5 ANON-Credits, 10 XYZ-Credits, 120 ABC-Credits.

Bartering communities are a very capitalistic answer to vanishing government
regulation. Capitalistic in the original definition of the term, i.e.,
a powerful solution, yet, an economical laissez-faire solution that works
by volitional free trade, without using force or fraud in any instance.
That nonviolent Ghandi-like withdrawal of support from the public systems is
even legal according to government's own laws. Removing that support is
achieved by ignoring currencies, and by privatizing the issuing of currencies,
a concept that only becomes so effective once combined with flexible, and
low-cost e-commerce technology -- a possibility that no government
originally conceived. As a result, it frees individuals and their businesses
financially, the economy, and ultimately, everyone -- from workers, small-
business "middle-class" producers, up to the richest, highly successful
entrepreneurs, but also and especially the poor, the needy and those without
an official job (as observed in Argentina, for example), by offering them
easy, unregulated work, as well as highly competitive, minimum-cost products
manufactured by unregulated companies using bartering-network logistics. It
benefits the whole of productive humanity, excluding only those who decide
to rely on support of organized politics or activist/lobbying groups,
regulation-based corporate privileges, or established force-backed
institutions. In fact, it can effectively ruin all those who live from systems
which finance themselves by any means of force (including higher social/
political causes rationalizing force), rather than volitional/competitive work.

Important to note is also that today, bartering systems, beyond niche
economies or other exceptional situations, are not science-fiction, but
already today a practical reality. The facts are that 40% of the world economy
is represented by some kind of bartering trade rather than financial
transactions, and that over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies at some
point are engaged in bartering.

Though it may seem as if there are no problems holding back the bartering
solution to an unrestricted economy, they unfortunately do exist in form of
big-brother governments in the economically most important western countries.
The US Internal Revenue Service, for example, claims that
any profits made through bartering, including intangible profits, are
taxable as income, officially demanding money for the state for each
successful bartering deal. Although it is much harder for the IRS to enforce
or to prove its taxation cases in bartering scenarios, this still has a
profound impact on the growth of the bartering economy. From an official
point of view, bartering is regulated and bartering independently of government
systems would be tax evasion and illegal. This is a major problem because
in business, profound trust, seriousness and security are generally expected
and required before a system will become widely accepted and employed.

A resolution of this issue could be to avoid relationships between any values
offered within the bartering economy and any and all officially issued
currencies. While pseudocurrencies, as mere internal aliases for values
exchanged, could exist, there must not be possibility to directly or
indirectly establish exchange rates of bartering goods and services
to official currency. Today's bartering and e-bartering seems to fail
exactly here, with none or relatively loose policies regarding the
association of bartering values with traditional money. By enforcing
contractual policies throughout e-bartering networks against the introduction
of official currencies in any exchange, and any products which obviously
translate to preset currency value (gold and stocks, perhaps), with all
the complications such a move might lead to, this could efficiently make
it impossible to tax bartering profits as income. With no easy-to-determine
equivalents of money for bartering profits, taxation may become impossible.
Whenever that happens -- secure, large, tax-free barter networks -- demand and
involvement in such networks by individuals and businesses would rise sharply.


                An Unassailable New Economical Infrastructure
                  Based On Privacy, Anonymity And Technology

Obviously, because of major issues that won't go away -- growing government
control and taxation in new areas, the need for permanent security and
stability of a widely accepted business system and the need for practical
feasibility, broad customer confidence and ease of use -- a solution beyond
simple bartering and e-bartering systems is necessary to successfully start
off a new, genuinely free economical system on a global scale.

The integration of all relevant knowledge, ideas and scenarios on this topic
suggests that the only viable route not dependent on politics or social change
must be based on technology, which involves cryptography-based anonymity that
conceptually cannot be subverted and trust/reputation-based transactions
through a decentralized network. Dealing with this concept involves detailed
technical specifications of the basic requirements and concepts necessary to
develop such a system. While some of these details may not be comprehensible
for technical amateurs, it is only important to understand the core concept,
and the fact that it is possible to create fully anonymous and untraceable
communication infrastructures with the help of extensive cryptography and
theories of information technology -- as outlined and partially implemented
by the libertarian cypherpunks and others.

There have been small-scale and experimental projects such as Freenet,
and limited-scope/limited-feature projects with the same goal such as
ZeroKnowledge's Freedom or Type-2 Mixmaster remailers. But, nobody has ever
attempted anything like the implementation of a global, decentralized, fully
anonymous trade and communication infrastructure before. Hence, chances are
that such a broad, complicated strategy will work. But first, what are the
current problems standing in the way of the achievement of that goal?

Realize that the establishment of the first business and private communication
infrastructure that couldn't be regulated or effectively banned by governments
equals a great confrontation between individual and government interests;
perhaps the first major nonviolent confrontation in western countries after
the violent days of past revolutions. Now, without any part of the
implementation of the infrastructure itself having to be illegal according to
current laws, anything that is a de-facto threat to today's authorities resting
on bona-fide subjective law, can be declared illegal -- if through no other
means, then by "democratic" criminalization through the manipulation of popular 
opinion through the association with terrorism and other non-sequitours. It
is this, and the necessity for political correctness and social acceptibility
of today's manipulated western cultures, that practically all significant
major businesses adhere to. Most managers feel that their company's success,
their customer relations, their very survival, depends on being politically
correct and devoting time and energy into what their government deems to be
"important tasks", "valid business activity" and "beneficial to society".

Yet, those managers and CEOs of major businesses are deeply mistaken. Many of
today's business leaders are merely non-thinking, easy-going individuals,
manipulated by public-opinion games into a following-mode of following the
"public interest" -- actually coming down to political agendas of a few
influential lobbyists -- including tax authorities, banking authorities,
socialist politicians and other destructive political hardliners. As long
as top business executives shun the controversial politically incorrect,
they keep shunning the confrontational dynamics of real business -- expansions
into new, untouched sectors and strategies that go beyond competition --
especially the competition of government and businesses who count on political
support to "succeed" economically. As long as controversial trade, development
and infrastructure-building business projects are shunned by stagnant major
companies, which once were active business giants, their only option is to
continue faking business success and growth off the existing assets of the
often great, valuable companies they manage; through creative bookkeeping and
projects that only are profitable through government privileges like "public"
funding or corrupt, competition-destroying legal/regulatory advantages.

To get involved in a confrontation-mode project, a business must be ready for
the politically incorrect, be willing to ignore intimidations, and must be
growing or willing to grow through hard, independent, competitive efforts
and money-generating actions of all of management and all employees. Also,
those companies must achieve a large customer base and broad private-sector
support in the early phase to be economically and technically successful.

>From a technical point of view, the new economical infrastructure would be
based on strong cryptography and an ad-hoc public key infrastructuring model.
For it to be decentralized, all participating parties should be equal in
respect to the kind of communication and communication infrastructure, i.e.
a peer-to-peer network. This would effectively mean a decentralized, encrypted
network infrastructure on top of the decentralized public Internet. This
infrastructure would provide for anonymity (via routing over multiple
machines using routers that maintain distinct keys and routing information
for each source and destination) or pseudonymity (i.e. anonymity in which
parties are associated with an established, verifiable alias/pseudonym which
however is not directly linked to and does not reveal their official identity),
depending on what is necessary for a particular step in a business transaction.

On top of that infrastructure, a decentralized supply/demand infrastructure
could be built, with computer-based matching -- either, integrated into an
automated peer-to-peer protocol, directly between individual parties, or done
by one or many bartering agencies who collect supply and demand messages and
provide automated matching services.

One array of problems that naturally emerges under anonymous conditions,
are reputation issues -- as traditional reputation, trust and legal liability
that are given with officially issued identities (i.e. government identities),
do not exist or at least cannot be verified and relied on. For an anonymous/
pseudonymous trade system to work, it must efficiently deal with the issue
of trust and reputation under conditions lacking an infallible identification
of individual parties.

With a protocol supporting verifiable identity-hiding pseudonyms that last
permanently or for a longer time, initial reputation/trust could be
established for untrusted newcomers after a first successful mutually
consentual transaction, which would then continue to grow on subsequent
transactions. Reputation of a peer increases if he has provided the promised
values (including pseudo-currency) according to the transaction, and is
given mutually to each other by two or more parties involved in a transaction.
Technically, that reputation could take the form of serialized confirmation
tracking numbers combined with a cryptography-based digital signature by the
party confirming another party's reputation. In anonymous networks, reputation
becomes a value in itself because it guarantees more transactions, trade
and profit. Money, like pseudocurrencies, is merely an abstract promise to pay
later, and exchanged goods and services are direct payments, while reputation
assures security in-, and provides potential for trade. Hence, striving for
high reputation means more opportunities profits on the direct trade level.

Besides internet-driven local and global bartering communities, further great
potential is held by the idea of anonymous digital cash (e-cash) systems.
Though not using official currency, the existing digital cash systems are not
perfectly safe because their transfers can always be logged and parties have
to be identified to central servers and each other. Anonymous e-cash and other
digital currencies and checks (including anonymous bartering checks) can best
be established in a network that allows routing by 1) writing down the value
of the check or money transaction 2) adding a unique serial number 3) digitally
signing the check with a signing key that identifies the paying party by
a known (reputation/trust-based) pseudonym. This one-time certificate for
a money or bartering transaction is then sent over an anonymizing network,
encrypted with the public key of the recipient's pseudonymous identity.

Alternatively, according to a "BlackNet" scheme, encryption keys can also be
exchanged in secret, so they are only known by both parties, with only the
public-identification signature signing the transaction certificate (which
happens a level beyond that encryption layer for confidentiality). Then, those
messages are unidentifiable for third parties and can be posted into public
forums (such as news://alt.anonymous.messages) using anonymous remailers.

A broadly used digital cash system, however, would provide many more
benefits than just anonymity. With automated end-to-end transactions,
money transactions would become faster and the economy would become more
efficient, especially when guaranteed to be free of force-backed bureaucracy.
With money being circulated faster and more money circulated within
transactions than in static investments or savings, the global amount of
money effectively available increases. As a proof, consider that since the
financial world similarly migrated to satellite- and computer-based digital
bank transactions and online stock trade, the amount of wealth available
at any given time has increased, making modern world trade possible.

This new infrastructure would most probably resemble an ad-hoc heterogenous
environment with many different digital businesses doing combinations of
banking, trade, trust and anonymity services. Only some of them would have to
offer anonymity, some could offer converting online/digital currency to
official currency or paper checks describing an equivalent of digital currency.
Also, currency-less bartering checks could be used online and offline, even
anonymously with a system that supports it. Bartering is simply a matter of
supply and demand, which could be recorded (anonymously) in form of checks
with serial numbers, or saved on smart cards which would contain the necessary
cryptography algorithms, standard protocols, and public keys.

With financial transactions and other (i.e. bartering) exchanges encrypted
with public keys of the participating parties and reposted anonymously, they
efficiently become independent of, and safe from the surveillance by any third
party. Anyone issuing and accepting anonymous transactions could then decide
to become a customer of a digital business offering anonymous conversion
between pseudocurrencies and official currencies. Payment would largely be
in percentages of the exchanged wealth, which could be exchanged anonymously.

With confidential and pseudonymous transactions, new types of businesses
are imaginable. For example, eBay like matching/bartering services based on
pseudonymity and reputation, which could match supply/demand in goods,
services, inofficial currency exchange and more. Also, thinking about the
huge market that advertising is today, especially on the internet, ad space,
ad services, site traffic and hits could become niche markets with dedicated
businesses offering ad-hoc exchanges in advertising. Using certification
hierarchies, all of these services could also allow users to "export" their
reputation/trust gained from successful transactions to other markets.


		     Incubating Unbeatable Businesses

The development of wide-scope business policy concepts to protect from
taxation and governments; the development of digital trade centers and
routine forms of bartering trade, and marketing them to combat inflation
and regulation; the design and creation of the underlying technology-based
infrastructure for anonymous networks against government regulations, and
the anonymization of existing business systems through informal gateways and
inofficial exchanges; this is a comprehensive complex of plans. Ultimately,
these plans have to be achieved, by one or more businesses, for creating a
safe and free future. Here is an outline of a combination approach.

Financial wide-scope accounting is necessary for basic individual independence
from governement and its destructive institutions. It is going to take the
form of general, officially legal accounting strategies in business.
The ultimate goal is to prevent all government attacks against private
property, -income and -assets. The necessary requirement is the readiness
of businesses on a broad scale to adopt new accounting strategies,
business policies, business philosophy and payment policies.

Digital trade centers are necessary to prevent government interference with
world markets. It is going to take the form of legal companies, departments,
and business models offering logistics and communication infrastructure for
financial trade and exchanging goods and services without currency. The
ultimate goal is to prevent inflation and economic depression caused by
government taxation and control exerted through regulated official currencies.
The necessary requirement is the establishment of providers of logistics
trade networks, and reputation/trust systems for pseudonymity, starting
websites, and offering start-up funding to build infrastructures for
global decentralized trade.

Technological anonymization/pseudonymization infrastructures for free trade
networks allow untraceable money transactions based on reputation/trust
schemes, privacy concepts, and a stealth, decentralized, internet-based
network infrastructure which utilizes strong cryptography. This leads to the
possibility of uncontrollable, unpreventable, "illegal" money transactions.
The ultimate goal is to establish indestructible black markets to catapult
the world economy beyond direct government control. The necessary requirements
are the establishment of a performant new peer-to-peer internet infrastructure
that provides decentralized, indestructible anonymity/pseudonymity, privacy
and confidentiality (using public-key encryption, digital signatures and
public key infrastructure), as well as trust/reputation services that work
with pseudonyms -- as a base for reliable financial transactions.

Depending on its size and possibilities, a business may take on all three
of these goals, one at a time (although they will eventually be interdependent
to some degree), or a partial accomplishment of one of these goals. As the
involvement of a Fortune 500 or larger company into this plan cannot be
expected, it has to be started by small business/bantam company efforts.
So, a more segmented approach is the most realistic -- especially, when it
comes to coordinating the efforts of marketing and business-to-business
affiliation and infrastructure building.

Any company initially creating and offering the technological or logistic
infrastructure would do best by disclaiming direct liability of third
party transactions performed over its independent infrastructure. Making
the burden of legal liability to the third parties who use the infrastructure
clear, similar to current internet trading businesses which aim to
emulate the Napster business model -- by officially taking the liability that
may or may not exist (including tax liability) to the third parties who
actually do the transactions -- would mitigate much of the legal risk involved.

To get to a free unregulated market one has to physically operate from within
today's regulated society. Unarguably, one of the biggest problem is the
inability of the majority of persons and small businesses to build private
(and investment) capital. Taxes are designed to destroy or prevent
accumulation of capital, earnings and potential investments that are necessary
for individuals to found their own businesses and jobs, for developing new
products, technologies and bootstrapping new business infrastructures.

Bartering somewhat does legally solve this problem by allowing tax-free
bartering "assets" to exist (according to current regulations on bartering),
in form of non-monetary "I-owe-you" service/good exchange checks and
certificates. To be efficient at this, however, bartering must include better
capital building mechanisms legal according to the current system, possibly
via allowing safe accumulated credits based on trust certification, i.e.
credits for specific material goods and services, which would not be official
or inofficial currency but could serve as de-facto savings currency.

The most probable chance for a commercial success of an anonymous trade
network is providing commercial incentives for maintaining high standards
of reputation. In this probably scenario, reputation would necessarily
have to become a second-level currency (as result of successful, mutually
consentual transactions, and secondarily, as result of a vote of trust
by already highly trusted parties). eBay like systems would be used to
build reputations and meta-certification authorities would make the
transfer of reputation between different anonymous businesses possible
(which could be practically realized as joint ventures between businesses
willing to exchange user reputations between their different systems).

At least three definite requirements exist for any businesses that
expects to be able to launch a project advancing one or more of the
three free-trade goals as stated above.

First, the independence from political correctness and social acceptance.
A competent business must act independently of the opinion or wishes
of any authority, only satisfying demand where it objectively exists,
by hard effort and trial and error strategies. Fear from government,
political entrepreneurs, and business regulations, but also with
government agencies, attempts to profit by "public" jobs or government
privileges, in the sense of political entrepreneurialism, will hold back
the competitiveness and dynamic of a business too much for it to be
able to participate in a project as controversial as this.

Secondly, the ability to step out of close-ended viewpoints and business
strategies is an absolute necessity for growth and success in new, unique
areas of business, (as also outlined under http://www.neo-tech.com/global).
Businesses must be ready to accept that the evasion of government restrictions
through peaceful, volitional, business/technology/free-trade actions and
strategies will yield benefits for themselves, and ultimately for society
and everyone. This is an important not only for individual businesses, but
for the whole corporate world. The question of a controversial new area of
business being eventually able to succeed is a question of attaining a critical
mass of businesses and entrepreneurs who are ready to discard dogmas for new,
"politically incorrect", open-ended business viewpoints and strategies. Hence,
being able to easily affiliate with other companies finding business
associates, and being very active in the business-to-business area is a key
competency of a bantam company participating in a free-trade project, which
ultimately requires getting broader support in the business world.

Third, building effective customer confidence in systems which do not base on
traditional currency, and even in anonymous markets which are vastly different
from known economical systems, is crucial. Despite the probably vehement
opposition by established media/government authorities, honest business/
technology/media pioneers must propagate the honest facts and show how the
goal of markets with full choice, privacy and freedom leads to the greatest
net benefits for essentially everyone. High efforts and much care are also
required for designing business solutions around the basic concepts that
are comfortable, usable and appealing from the start, in order to create
a large base of customers/businesses which broadly use and thereby support the
bartering and anonymity features of a project, and with that, contribute to
its decentralized infrastructure. Such approaches require fast, dynamic and
highly adaptive strategies which balance between trial-and-error strategies,
and integrated trust/confidence-building strategies from the very beginning.

The different aspects of a business venturing into a free-market building
project in areas of finance, trust services, trade services, internet
services, communication, and so on, include at least: technical (mostly
internet software, cryptography and pki, network software, website interfaces,
user interfaces, secure payment applications, interfaces to existing
e-commerce systems); funding (fund raising and investment, currency systems
design, currency stability, user fees, price monitoring, capital management,
offshore management, general accounting); advertisement and marketing
(promotion and press handling, legal issues and court battles, if necessary
also against slander, business plan design, confidence and trust building,
mass distribution, quality assurance and ease of use for user applications,
marketing strategies, perhaps introducing Neo-Tech memes, business contacts);
art and business image (website design, user application design, quality for
user-friendlyless, ease of use and general appearance of software and offline
systems, corporate identity, press contacts/protection from press slander);
economics (wide-scope level infrastructure design, testing and building;
establishment of local communities, trials and test deployments of projects).

This publication ends here, after having provided much practical, action-mode
business information, possible strategies, caveats and solutions, and
wide-scope viewpoints on society in respect of a free trade project. What you
make of that knowledge, individually, or as entrepreneur, is up to you.
Independent economy means independence from criminal politics, regardless of
what anyone else thinks, says, or does. Try extrapolating that potential
and integrating it with different wide-scope effects.

Independence means freedom to create. Efficient value production means
increasing efficiency in any areas of business, especially new technology
and applied science, including communication, medicine and publishing. Your
own efforts count and can effect changes. Realize that anyone investing his
or her efforts into the first, most basic steps toward secure routes to
business freedom can profit enormously. The achievement of a free trade
project is up to individual actions. In any case, it will eventually be
achieved, and the speed and the specific routes that are going to be taken
are simply undetermined, open opportunities, waiting to be seized.
