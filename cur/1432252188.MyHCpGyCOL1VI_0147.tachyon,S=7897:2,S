The UN has demands on what makes a nation. It requires land. I'm not sure
if Sealand qualifies, but I think it's overhyped.

There's plenty of island nations, why not buy one of them? If you agree to
donate shares to the government they might be all ears.

You could band together with some other corporations if you don't have the
capital/value.

Have to wonder what's the point though. Save tax? Apple already does it, no
need to own the island to profit from it. Liberty? As if Google doesn't buy
law already. It might make them too scary.

I think Google should do it. It'd be a fun project, Google Nation.
