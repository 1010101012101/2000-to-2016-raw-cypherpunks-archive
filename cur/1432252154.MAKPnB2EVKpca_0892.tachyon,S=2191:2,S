Of interest:  though the unnamed spokesman asserted that the FBI is opposed to 
profiling students to detect potential school violence, the article still 
includes a laundry list of "warning signs": "The FBI provided a list of clues to 
look for after a student has made a violent threat."

"Unsupervised" computer and Internet access is mentioned twice.

Soon to come:  "We cannot be so fixated on the right to free access to 
information..."  For the chiiilldren, of course!
