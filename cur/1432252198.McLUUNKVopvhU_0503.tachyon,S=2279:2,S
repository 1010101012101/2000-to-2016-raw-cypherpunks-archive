As a brief historical note, the company name Combex
(http://www.combex.com/) was chosen in a Palo Alto cafe using a Metricom
modem.  For those who don't know about Combex, "Combex is a pioneer in the
development of secure distributed computing systems. Combex's personnel
represent the vast majority of the expertise in the use of the E secure
distributed computing platform that is the result of over $11M of R&D
effort expended over a six year period."

Cheers - Bill
