As to your first point, not exactly, I was trying to distinguish something
THIS SNAKE said, and the entire basis of his law-oriented argument: "no
difference/same data/no intercept" -- I think the moment is important
because of the sense of security we have at THAT moment is an extreme
interest. Is the interception requirement just a result the technology from
our telephone wire past? It would seem the moment of genesis is even more
sacred, not less.

You went farther into the 5th/mental processes, and I don't know that
anybody has put it so well. I replied to your points individually, but felt
like I was being inconsiderate of your thoughts in breaking them up.
Certainly words this most-high individual should hear.

Cypherpunks should reply to Scarfo EN BLOC.

I know it's "old news" to you old dogs, but it isn't to everybody else. Your
words do travel. You are 10 ahead of the public agenda. Or, you used to be.
"The agenda" appears to be catching up with you.
