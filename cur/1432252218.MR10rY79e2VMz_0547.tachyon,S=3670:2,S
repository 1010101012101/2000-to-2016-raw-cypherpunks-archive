This is the wrong solution.  One of the important factors in the
Internet's growth was that the IETF exercised enough control, but not
too much.  So HTTP is standardised, which allows (theoretically) any
browser to talk to any web server.  At the same time the higher levels
are not standardised, so someone who has an idea for a better browser or
web server is free to implement it.

If you build a protocol which allows selfish behaviour, you have done
your job badly.  Preventing selfish behaviour in distributed systems is
not easy, but that is the problem we need to solve.  It would be a good
discussion for this list.

Exactly.  This has already happened with unauthorised AIM clients.  My
freedom to lie allows me to use GAIM rather than AOL's client.  In this
case, IMO, the ethics are the other way round.  AOL seeks to use its
(partial) monopoly to keep a grip on the IM market.  The freedom to lie
mitigates this monopoly to an extent.
