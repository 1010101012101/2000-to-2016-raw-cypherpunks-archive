So, the torturers should get rid of their pliers and jumper cables, and
instead get a dozen boars and a bottle of Viagra?

Here's a religious question: If a devout Moslem prepares himself for a
martyr's death [1] but is caught by the cops before his act and is
buggered to death by a dozen pigs [2] on Viagra, does he still go to
heaven? Does it matter if he spills the beans first or if he keeps
silent until death?

[1] Setting aside questions of whether killing innocents really gives
you an express pass to heaven.

[2] Four-footed pigs, I mean, not policemen.
