President Bush ( news - web sites) is expected to allow resumption of a
program to force down  or
   shoot down  airplanes suspected of carrying drugs in Latin America,
a senior administration official
   said Thursday.


Does Mr. Bush understand tit-for-tat?   Hasn't he figured out that he
can bust all the petty hawalas he
wants, but the Cartels have *cash* to spend, an excellent distribution
network, and a few submarines?
Looking for True Believers speaking spanish...

Maybe the Saudis will start taking planes out for carrying ethanol...
