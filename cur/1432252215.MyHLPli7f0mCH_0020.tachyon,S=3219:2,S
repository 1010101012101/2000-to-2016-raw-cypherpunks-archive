	Please don't top-post.

	Optical TEMPEST of the type we've been discussing has
	nothing to do with specular reflection.

	As your CRT screen is raster-scanned, the point at which
	the electron beam is pointing at any given moment is much
	brighter than the rest of the screen. That the screen seems
	uniformly illuminated is a result of your persistance of vision.

	Optical tempest records the brightness of the light reflecting
	off the wall behind the user as a function of time. This can be used
	to reconstruct the brightness of each pixel on the screen, since
	they are refreshed sequentially in raster order.
