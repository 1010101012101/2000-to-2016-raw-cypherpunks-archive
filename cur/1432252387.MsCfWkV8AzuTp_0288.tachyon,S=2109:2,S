Are there any publicly available documents that detail interrogation
protocols and what brainwave patterns and bloodflow look like during truth
telling and lying?  Preferably something that gets into how to consciously
alter brainwave patterns and bloodflow with this application in mind...

A document with a thorough discussion of various depressants on such an
interrogation process would also be most interesting.

We all know that no lie detector is not perfect, but trying to convince
captors that I'm part of a minority of subjects -- those who appear to be
lying when they're not -- is not my idea of fun.
