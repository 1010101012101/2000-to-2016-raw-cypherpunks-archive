Well, I guess Juan's rhetorical question is voicing my concern that 
crazy-people political rants are not what I sought when I subscribed to 
this mailing list.

Stop talking in blanket terms as 'propaganda' please, have you seen what 
ISIS PR came up with for this summer? Maybe Zenaan can cry next about 
their border inviolability next
http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6663326/f5c24e5e/isis_shock_video_zomer_2015.html

Maybe you'll get inspired by people being shot in a car with an RPG, or 
the explosive necklace or drowning in a cage. Fun Fun Fun.

You can discuss the nature of western governments all you like. As long 
as an argument is well put together I and others will listen and won't 
even complain. Zenaan's stuff is neither.

Well, and in addition of bringing things to the table that are way out 
of bounds, I also happen to disagree with just everything that Zenaan 
has to say.

Zenaan not believe Russians are operating in the Ukraine.

Zenaan conflates ethnic cleansing of an ethnic minority with 
international politics.

Zenaan is tremendously biased towards a lot of issues.

Anyway, I've got a pretty sweet solution to this:

If you're running spamassassin on your mail server add the following 
rule in /etc/spamassassin/local.cf

body        ZENAAN_CAUSES_BRAINROT   / Harkness/i
score       ZENAAN_CAUSES_BRAINROT   5.0
describe    ZENAAN_CAUSES_BRAINROT   cpunks.org mailinglist IDS (Idiot 
Denial System)
