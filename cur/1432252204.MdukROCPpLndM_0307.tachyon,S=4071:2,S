actually, we mean burned literally.  the stamp creation process raises 
the temperature of the CPU.  Most systems are not build for full tilt 
computational load.  They do not have the ventilation necessary for 
reliable operation.  So, they may get by with the first 8-12 hours of 
stamp generation (i.e. roughly 2000-3000 stamps per machine) but the 
machine reliability after that time will degrade as the heat builds up. 
  Feel free to run this experiment yourself.  Take a cheat machine from 
your local chop shop, run hashcash in an infinite loop, and wait for the 
smoke detector to go off.

there is nothing quite like waking up to the smell of freshly roasted Intel.

that is a nasty bit of news.  I'll run some numbers based on that and 
see what the ratio of spam to stamp engines would be.  gut sense is that 
it's still not horrible, just not as advantageous.  but you never know 
until you run the numbers.

thanks for the information and the source.
