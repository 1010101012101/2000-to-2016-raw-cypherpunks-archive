I've used the graphics and explanations that were in Digicash's Users Guide 
with non-technicals to great effect.  They portrayed blinding using 
envelope, wax seal and wax token.  The token was placed in the envelope and 
sent to the mint.  The envelope represented the blinding function performed 
by the user's SW.  The wax seal: the mint's digital signature pressed onto 
the envelope and "by pressure" into the enclosed coin which has not been 
seen by the mint.  And the wax token, once removed from the envelope, the 
un-blinded coin.
