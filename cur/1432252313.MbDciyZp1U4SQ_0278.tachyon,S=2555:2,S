MINNEAPOLIS - Daryl Miller didn't make it through airport security because 
he couldn't keep his pants on.

	 

Airport police said a security screener was waving a metal-detecting wand 
over Miller's pants area on Friday when Miller pulled his shorts down to 
his ankles. He wasn't wearing any underwear.

Miller then said, "There, how do you like your job," thus ending the 
screening, according to the police report. He was charged with indecent 
exposure and released on $300 bail. 

...

 "This person exposed themself in a public area, a clear violation of the 
law, and we needed to take some action on that, otherwise everybody would 
be dropping their pants," Christenson said.
