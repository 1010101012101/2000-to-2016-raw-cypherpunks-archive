WTP Congress Internet System Takes Wing

WTP Web Pages For Every 
State and County Across America
 

Institutionalizing Vigilance: It's Underway
 


Today, the We The People Congress unveiled its network of county and
state Web Pages - one for each of the 3141 counties and 50 states in
America. 

Soon, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be able to go to any county or
state WTP Web Page and find out when and where the regular local meeting
is held, what's on the next agenda, the contact information for the
local WTP management team, which local companies have stopped
withholding, the date and time of regular conference calls, the details
about upcoming special events, what the local, state and federal
governments are doing that is unconstitutional and what the local people
are doing about it, upcoming appearances in the region by people of
interest, special projects requiring volunteers, the construction
schedule for that state's Citizen Vigilance Center, and much more. 

"Think about it," said Bob Schulz. "Soon, more than 3141meetings will be
taking place on the same evening of every month, all across the country.
They will be working on the same solution to the same governmental
problem, often engaged in the same interactive teleconference, watching
and listening to the same speaker, working together to hold local, state
and federal government accountable to the state and federal
constitutions. And, in a planned and organized way, they will be
distributing information to their communities about the essential
principles underlying our system of governance -- information,
unfortunately, that the People are not getting from anywhere else these
days." 

The web pages can also feature local businesses that are either owned by
local constitutionalists  or that offer discounts to WTP Congress
members. Significant future enhancements are already being developed. 

This is a strategic move aimed at directly empowering the People to
restore the Constitution through enhanced communications and coordinated
forward planning.  Now that this system has been deployed, the WTP
Congress management team will be able to quickly take advantage of these
integrated communications functions and begin to fully execute the
mission and organized activities of the WTP Congress. 

All local and state WTP Coordinators will have access to their own WTP
web page, enabling them to post local news stories and meeting agenda
items. WTP Coordinators need only "sign in" to the WTP web site to
upload these items through a simple fill-in-the-blank user interface.
All web page formatting is done by the system. 

To see the new WTP Congress Web Pages and to see sample "news", local
content and experience some of the potential of this system, click here
<https://givemeliberty.org/user/congress/map.aspx>  , then select the
state of California, select the county of San Mateo and click on the
News, Events & Resources link. 

All county and state coordinators are now asked to begin entering the
localized information required for their WTP Congress Web Page. To do
this they need to click on the "My WTP" link at the top of the main WTP
home page <http://givemeliberty.org/default.htm> , sign in (if
necessary) and select the "Edit WTP Congress Web Pages" option that
appears.  A "Help" file and a statement of "Use Policy" statement are
available and should be read by the WTP Coordinators.    

We urge everyone that has been considering becoming a WTP Coordinator to
"step up to the plate" and get involved. Now is the time for all good
men and women to come to the aid of their country. The continuing
deployment of extensive internet based WTP communications tools coupled
with the professional management of the WTP Congress and the execution
of a nationwide strategic plan is about to make things very exciting.  

"It's a new day," said Bob Schulz. " All across America we have always
had people who knew when government was doing something it had no
authority to do - who knew the truth - but they were isolated and felt
disenfranchised because they didn't have anyone to turn to that was
interested in confronting unconstitutional behavior by those wielding
governmental power. The WTP Congress is changing all that. It's an
organization that will soon have a presence in every community and where
those People who are concerned about 'republicanism' and the health of
our Constitutional Republic will feel at home - and be empowered through
numbers." 

After the new DC national office of WTP opens on June 30, the new
Executive Director of the WTP Congress, Devvy Kidd, will contact all the
WTP Coordinators and begin to initiate tactical aspects of a nationwide,
integrated strategic plan closely coordinating with the WTP Foundation
and the WTP Legal Defense Association.  

Remember - as important as this development regarding the Congress web
page system is, the BIG story for WTP is just days away. . . Stay tuned.
. .  

And finally, you will notice the image of Thomas Jefferson's home
(Monticello) that appears on each WTP Congress Web Page.  As a symbol of
the inspiration and defense of liberty undertaken by Jefferson and
others, the icon of the Virginia home built by Jefferson will play
prominently in the future landscape of the WTP Congress and in each
capital city in America. 

Bob Schulz intends to see the construction of a Monticello-like building
in every state capital to establish a physical, visible, public presence
from where the emerging "institution of vigilance" will operate and
exercise the inherent authority of We The People in the defense of both
the Constitution and our freedom. Eventually, when the People see those
buildings, they will instinctively know that this is where the People
are watching the government. 

"The federal Congress is an institution. The Presidency is an
institution. The Judiciary is an institution. We will make 'vigilance'
an institution," said Bob.
