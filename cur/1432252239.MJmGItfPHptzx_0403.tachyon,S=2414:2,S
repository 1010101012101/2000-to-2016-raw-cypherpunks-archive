It looks like Dr. Stefan Brands' book, "Rethinking Public Key Infrastructures
and Digital Certificates; Building in Privacy",  with outstanding
discussion of, among other things, ;-), internet bearer transactions, has
gone through the mill at MIT press and come out the other side.

If you couldn't get a copy of it when Stefan offered it as a self-published
version of his doctoral thesis, now's the time to get it.

Cheers,
RAH
