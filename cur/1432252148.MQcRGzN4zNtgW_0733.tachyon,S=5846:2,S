They weren't, except perhaps by me.  Oden was first selected because of
how her ticket was purchased, then singled out for special treatment
because of how she acted in the airport.

No, you still don't get it.

Dammit! No matter how hard I try to be quiet and lurk, the
stupidity on these lists just forces me to decloak!

Her name was flagged in the computer, which Ms. Ogen 
MISINTERPRETED as meaning it was because of her politics.

The real story is that it was flagged, but not because of
politics, but because she bought her ticket online. People
who use Expedia, CheapTickets, LowestFare, Orbitz, and other
rock-bottom and somewhat ANONYMOUS ticket services are having
their tickets flagged for (S)earch much more frequently than
people who use ticket agencies or buy their tickets direct
from the airlines.

Second, when law enforcement officials are fucking with your 
shit and tossing your car or your house, you do not interfere. 
If you feel the need to assist, with a stuck zipper on your l
uggage, for example, you ask politely if you can help with 
that. You do not grab at it as if you were dealing with your 
clumsy spouse or child.

Only a fucking stupid person, whose mind has been liquefied
by the benefits of privilege would even remotely think that 
they could "show ass" in this sort of climate and get away 
with it.
