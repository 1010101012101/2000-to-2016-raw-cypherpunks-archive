For one, somebody who wants to boost their odds of not being found by deciding
to opt for a 100% randomization of their "bug out" location. I got the idea from
Thomas Schelling, actually: don't remember the piece but "Strategy of
Conflict" ought to be a good place to start. ha. Work through the math of it
and it makes fiendishly good sense. Not so practical for escaping a terrorist
attack, but it could prove really useful in other circumstances I'm sure you
can imagine.

Anyway, wouldn't you enjoy knowing you had a better chance of making it no
matter what kind of environment you found yourself in? If you had no money, no
food--rock-bottom flat on your ass in the middle of nowhere--that you could
still manage to have resources within yourself to pull through? I find that
infinitely appealing. Diogenes had it right all along...you can quote Nietzsche
and Ayn Rand as much as you please but the Stoics and Cynics still have a lot
to offer. Even further off topic, here's a passage from
www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/latergreeks.html you might find interesting:


Cynicism

After Plato and Aristotle, the concerns of the philosophers moved further and
further from metaphysics, epistemology, and anything resembling modern
science, to the issue that had always concerned the ancient Greeks the most --
ethics.  What is it to be virtuous, to have character, to live the good life,
to have "arete" (nobility)?

Antisthenes (445-365) was the son of an Athenian citizen and a Thracian slave
girl.  After starting his own school, he came to recognize that Socrates was
wiser than he.  He went over, students and all, to learn from the master.
Antisthenes is the founder of cynicism.  Cynic comes from the Greek word for
dog, originally because Antisthenes taught at the Cynosarges (Dogfish)
gymnasium, which had been set up for the poor of Athens.

Cynicism involves living the simple life in order that the soul can be set
free. It is a back to nature type of philosophy, ala St. Francis of Assisi.
By eliminating ones needs and possessions, one can better concentrate on the
life of philosophy.

Cynicism makes virtue the only good, the only true happiness.  You cant
control the world and lifes ups and downs, so control yourself!  Inhibit
your desires!  become independent of the world!...Rejecting civilization, cynics
tended to withdraw from society, even to live in the desert.  In this, they may
have influenced early Jewish and Christian monastics.

Cynicism wasnt entirely negative (from todays values perspective):  They
strongly encouraged individualism, believed that all men were brothers, were
against war and slavery, and believed in free speech.  They also believed in free love and the legitimacy of suicide!

The most famous of the cynics was Diogenes (412-323), a student of
Antisthenes.  He saw himself as a citizen of the world ("cosmopolitan").  There
is a famous story that has Alexander the Great finding him sleeping in the sun
and announcing "I am Alexander the great king!"  Diogenes replied "I am
Diogenes the dog!"  Alexander asked if there was anything he could do for him.
Diogenes just asked him to move out of the sun.
