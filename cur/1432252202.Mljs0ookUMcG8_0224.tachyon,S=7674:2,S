The only way I can think of to prevent this is to have the disk
completely encrypted in which case you could safely give a copy to
anyone who wanted one. The BIOS shouldn't be trusted either. The problem
then is booting which could be done from some sort of card/dongle that
you carry with you that requires a (many digit)PIN before it
regurgitates your boot code.

Yup. Maybe a bootFLASH can be replaced with some SRAM which must be
downloaded from your key device before booting. Something like : power
up, hold processor in reset, remove boot SRAM from bus, load boot code,
switch boot memory to system bus, allow startup.

A physical device plus a PIN seems somewhat immune to that problem. In
fact you could keep multiple copies.

Probably anything that is exported and some that aren't.

Not if there is no code in the clear on the machine - no functional
BIOS, no usable HDD.

With the BIOS and HDD encrypted off is safe.

Might be a neat little gizmo with a keypad. BIOS is encrypted on the
motherboard. Boot memory is SRAM that is lost when power is removed (
lost short of extreme detection measures that is ). The little gizmo
reads the encrypted BIOS, decrypts and transfers it to boot SRAM.

Maybe just installing an OS you got as a binary is all it takes to be
F'd. Maybe rebuilding that OS with an F'd compiler propagates the
effedness.

If you have everything encrypted until your key device readies it for
boot then you could run a F'd BIOS, OS and apps as long as you kept the
system isolated. Let it log all it wants. Sounds like a good sentence
for a Windows box.
