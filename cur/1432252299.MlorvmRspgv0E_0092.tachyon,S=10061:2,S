A few comments regarding both articles.

There is nothing that is new in either pieces. There is alot of fluff and
Israeli self promotion in both - in that sense I see both articles as a
form of psyops. Regarding Afek's "groundbreaking" thesis - bullshit.
Perhaps in Hebrew it is unique, but the legal aspects of cyberwar have been
researched and discussed in many forums. The Tallinn document of the EU for
example. International relations theory, political science and legal
theory, within academia and the military have been dealing with this for
years. For example, serious treatment of the concept of "just war" in cyber
terms.

As a senior legal officer in the IDF, Afek is directly responsible, at the
macro level, for whitewashing the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and at
the micro level legalizing Israeli crimes against Palestinians. Exactly the
kind of person you would want to draft a thesis on cyberwar. Not.

One can google Saalbach, or Thomas Ridd as a start regarding a more serious
discussion of cyberwar.
