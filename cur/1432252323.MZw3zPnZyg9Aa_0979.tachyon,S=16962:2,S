GEORGIA Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
September 26, 2001

The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi has received credible information that American
citizens in Georgia are being targeted for kidnapping.  U.S. citizens are
urged to maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to
enhance their security.  Americans should maintain a low profile, vary
routes and times for all required travel, and if at all possible, are
encouraged not to travel alone or to remote or sparsely inhabited sections
of the city.  U.S. Government personnel have been advised to take the same
precautions.  There is no information to suggest that this threat has any
connection to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.

While previous kidnapping concerns have centered around the Pankisi Gorge
north of, and including, Akhmeta and the northern mountainous areas of
Georgia bordering Chechnya and Dagestan, the current threat focuses on the
Tbilisi region.  Furthermore, we can not discount the possibility of a
similar risk to Americans elsewhere in the country.  The Embassy's previous
warnings to avoid travel to the Pankisi Gorge, Ossetia and Abkhazia regions
of Georgia remain in effect.

The Embassy will provide additional information should it become available.
American citizens overseas may contact the American Citizens Services unit
of the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi by telephone or fax for up-to-date
information on security conditions. The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located
at 25 Atoneli Street, Telephone: (995)(32) 98-99-67; fax (995)(32) 93-37-59.


For further general information regarding travel to Georgia and, in view of
recent events, Americans traveling and residing abroad should monitor
closely the Department's Internet web site at http://travel.state.gov,
particularly the Department's Worldwide Caution, when considering travel
abroad.

This Public Announcement expires on November 30, 2001.

GEORGIA


November 17, 2000

COUNTRY DESCRIPTION:  A mountainous republic situated in the heart of the
Caucasus range, Georgia has borders with Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
Russia.  Living conditions are improving, but do not meet Western standards.
Tourist facilities outside of Tbilisi, the capital, are not highly
developed, and many of the goods and services taken for granted in other
countries are not yet available.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS:  A passport and visa are required.  U.S. citizens may
receive a visa upon arrival at Tbilisi Airport, the Port of Poti, and the
Red Bridge ("Tsiteli Khidi") crossing on Georgia's border with Azerbaijan.
Americans intending to enter Georgia at other points-of-entry must obtain a
visa beforehand at a Georgian embassy or consulate abroad.  Armenian and
Azerbaijani visas are no longer valid for transit through Georgia.
Travelers to Georgia must fill out a customs declaration upon arrival that
is to be presented to customs officials when departing the country.  Failure
to declare currency and items of value can result in fines or other
penalties.  For further information, contact the Embassy of Georgia at 1615
New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20009, tel. (202)
387-2390, fax (202) 393-4537; Internet: http://www.georgiaemb.org.

SAFETY AND SECURITY:  The U.S. Embassy advises American citizens to avoid
travel to the separatist-controlled region of Abkhazia.  There are reports
of continued fighting and terrorist activity in Abkhazia (and around
Zugdidi), including attacks and kidnappings of international observers.
These incidents have included bombings and the mining of roads which pose a
serious threat to vehicular traffic.  While Abkhaz "border officials" may
demand that travelers entering the region purchase "visas" from the
so-called "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia," the U.S. Government
does not recognize the separatists' declaration of an Abkhazia independent
from Georgia.  As a result of the restricted access of U.S. officials to
Abkhazia, the ability of the U.S. Government to assist American citizens
there is extremely limited, even in emergencies.  American citizens in areas
of Western Georgia near the Abkhaz border are advised to be aware of their
surroundings at all times and to avoid straying off main roads and traveling
after dark.

American citizens are also advised to avoid travel to other areas of
continuing security concern: specifically, the Pankisi Gorge north of
Akhmeta and the northern mountainous areas of Georgia bordering Chechnya,
Dagestan and Svaneti.  There have been instances of kidnappings for ransom
purposes in these regions.

As a result of a threat posed by banditry and other criminal activities,
American citizens should carefully evaluate the implications for their
security before considering travel to South Ossetia and along the Georgian
Military Highway north of the Gudauri ski resort.

CRIME:  While petty thefts and pickpocketing were previously  the most
common crimes, recently foreigners in Georgia have also been victimized by
muggings, home break-ins and other violent crimes.  Most muggings have
occurred on side streets near Tbilisi's city center.  In all instances, the
mugging victims have first been knocked unconscious by blows to the head.

Petty theft is  particularly a problem on the Tbilisi metro system and in
mini-vans used for public transit.  While the security of overland travel in
Georgia has improved, vehicular and rail traffic remains vulnerable to
robbery.  Americans  visiting or residing in Tbilisi should take the same
precautions they would in any major city where crime can be a problem.
American citizens in Tbilisi are advised to remain aware of their
surroundings at all times, day or night; and to stay off dark or unlit
streets even when traveling in a group; to avoid carrying large sums of
cash; and to be particularly cautious of being singled out for victimization
at establishments frequented by foreigners.

The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately
to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  U.S.
citizens may refer to the Department of State's pamphlet "A Safe Trip
Abroad" for ways to promote a more trouble-free journey. Additional
information on the region can be found in the brochure "Tips for Travelers
to Russia and the Newly Independent States."  Both publications are
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, via the Internet at
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs, or via the Bureau of Consular Affairs
home page at http://travel.state.gov.

MEDICAL FACILITIES:  Medical care in Georgia is limited.  There is a severe
shortage of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles,
anesthetics, and antibiotics.  Elderly travelers and those with pre-existing
health problems may be at risk due to inadequate medical facilities.
Georgian doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment before
rendering medical services.

MEDICAL INSURANCE:  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the
United Sates.  U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not provide payment
for medical services outside the United States.  Doctors and hospitals often
expect immediate cash payment for health services.  Uninsured travelers who
require medical care overseas may face extreme difficulties.

Check with your own insurance company to confirm whether your policy applies
overseas, including provision for medical evacuation, and for adequacy of
coverage.  Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical
evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Ascertain whether payment will be made to the overseas hospital or doctor or
whether you will be reimbursed later for expenses you incur.  Some insurance
policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment and for disposition
of remains in the event of death.

Useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas
insurance programs, is provided in the department of state's bureau of
consular affairs brochure "Medical Information for Americans Traveling
Abroad," available via the bureau of consular affairs home page or autofax:
(202) 647-3000.

OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION:  Information on vaccinations and other health
precautions may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP
(1-877-394-8747); fax 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299), or via the CDC's
Internet site at http://www.cdc.gov.

TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:  While in a foreign country, U.S.
citizens may encounter road conditions which differ significantly from those
in the United States.  The information below concerning Georgia is provided
for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular
location or circumstance.

Safety of Public Transportation:            Fair
Urban Road Conditions/Maintenance:  Poor
Rural Road Conditions/Maintenance:   Poor
Availability of Roadside Assistance:     Poor

As in the United States, vehicular traffic in Georgia moves along the right
side of roadways.  Speed limits range from 80 to 100 km/hr. on highways, and
from 60 to 90 km/hr. on urban thoroughfares.  Motorists are not permitted to
make right turns on red at traffic lights.  While legislation mandating seat
belt use has yet to be enacted, drivers and passengers are nevertheless
strongly advised to buckle-up on Georgian Roads.  Children under seven (7)
years of age are required to be restrained in child-safety seats.  Under
Georgian law, a driver may be considered to be driving under the influence
of alcohol with any blood alcohol concentration exceeding zero.

Inter-City travel in Georgia by bus and public minivan is readily available,
and expanding and improved train service links the capital to most large
cities and towns.  It is also possible to hire private taxis for inter-city
travel at a reasonable cost.

The state road police, who come under the authority of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs, are responsible for maintaining road safety in Georgia.
As many local drivers do not operate their vehicles in accordance with
established road rules, motorists should exercise extreme caution when
driving, and pedestrians should be careful when crossing streets.

Roads in Georgia are generally in poor condition and often lack shoulder
markings and centerlines. In addition, traffic signals may not work as a
result of power outages and burned-out bulbs. Undivided two-lane roads
connect most major cities, and motorists attempting to pass other vehicles
may encounter oncoming high-speed traffic.  Driving at night can be
especially dangerous.  Travel on mountain roads is treacherous in both rain
and snow, and heavy snowfalls may make some roads impassable.  During the
first ten months of the year 2000, 375 traffic related fatalities and 1,670
traffic-related injuries were reported to the state road police.  These
figures indicate that the fatality and injury rate on Georgian roads is
several times the U.S. rate.

For additional information about road safety, including links to foreign
government sites, see the Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs
home page at http://travel.state.gov/road_safety. html.

AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:  As there is no direct commercial air service by
local carriers at present, or economic authority to operate such service,
between the U.S. and Georgia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has not assessed Georgia's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with
international aviation safety standards.

For further information, travelers may contact the Department of
Transportation within the U.S. at tel. 1-800-322-7873, or visit the FAA
Internet home page at http://www.faa.gov/avr/iasa/iasa.pdf.   The U.S.
Department of Defense (DOD) separately assesses some foreign air carriers
for suitability as official providers of air services. For information
regarding the DOD policy on specific carriers, travelers may contact DOD at
tel. 618-229-4801.

Power outages have occasionally disabled Tbilisi Airport's guidance beacon
for short periods of time, forcing aircraft to land using visual flight
rules.

CRIMINAL PENALTIES:  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject
to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly
from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available
to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more
severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating the
laws of Georgia, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.
Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict
and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.

CURRENCY INFORMATION:  While the Georgian Lari is the only legal tender,
dollars can be freely exchanged for Laris at market rates.  Credit cards are
rarely accepted outside of upscale hotels and restaurants, and travelers'
checks are difficult to cash.

CHILDREN'S ISSUES:  For information on international adoption of children
and international parental child abduction please refer to our Internet site
at http://travel.state.gov/children's_issues.html or telephone (202)
736-7000.

REGISTRATION AND EMBASSY LOCATION:  U.S. citizens living in or visiting
Georgia are strongly encouraged to register at the Consular Section of the
U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, where they may obtain updated information on travel
and security within Georgia.  The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located at 25
Atoneli Street, tel. (995)(32)98-99-67 or (995)(32)98-99-68, fax
(995)(32)93-37-59.
