Absolutely agreed. I don't, personally, see it as a "compromise" to 
security that concessions are made to usability, given that usability is a 
factor in security. In fact, in this case we really must assume no 
technical sophistication on behalf of the whistleblower (and if some of 
the leaksites that have popped up are any indication, only minimal 
technical prowess on behalf of the site operators.)

I believe it's the former, but I'm not certain. Can anyone comment?

Agreed, though it remains a real problem. But we can divide the components 
of such a system so that working on solving the one doesn't block on 
solving the other.

Very well put.

I'm not sure we should get hung up on that; that argument always stuck me 
as "legal cleverness" of the sort judges laugh at. If the purpose of this 
platform is to disseminate documents in the public interest, which happen 
to upset some legal entities be they corporations or governments, the 
"public interest" argument is what's going to keep them online, imo. 
Further, "But I don't technically know what I'm hosting" isn't going to 
change Amazon's mind when they want to pull the plug on you.

So, I'm imagining a system where the "leak site" receives files from a 
source (somehow; we want this to be an anonymous submission process but 
it can be treated as a black box), *reviews them and selects documents for 
publication*, and then pushes them to a document distribution platform, 
which should be syndicated to mirrors to leverage jurisdictional arbitrage 
and affect censorship resistance. The problem of false documents entering 
the distribution process is one of human error; however, the leak-site 
operators are acting in the role of journalists, and the onus is on them 
to authenticate their source material. I don't think a technical fix is in 
order here.

One thought I should mention: on the submission side, it would be very 
nice to have a built-in metadata stripper either as part of the submission 
process, or as part of the publication process. Where you put it depends 
on whether you want the leaksite operators to have access to potential 
metadata or not; arguments can be made either way. But we can't assume 
either party is sophisticated enough to worry about this themselves. (Nor 
can we expect to produce a metadata redaction filter that is anywhere 
close to comprehensive, and metadata will continue to be a major attack 
vector for outing whistleblowers, but the protections provided by this 
system are not binary.)

I've used BitTorrent in conjunction with anonymous publication systems 
before; it served as the distribution protocol for the design of a Private 
Information Retrieval based nym server Bram and I proposed a few years 
back. I'm considering the suitability of PIR in the present use case; it 
turned out that our use of BitTorrent opened the system up to certain 
attacks on the querant's anonymity, but that may not apply in our use 
case.
