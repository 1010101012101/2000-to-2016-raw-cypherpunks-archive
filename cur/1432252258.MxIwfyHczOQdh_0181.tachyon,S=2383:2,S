GodDAMN George W is a dumb fuck.

If the guy's IQ had broken the 3-digit barrier he might have figured out 
that by nearly directly replying to the new bin Laden video he's basically 
elevating bin Laden to a hostile head-of-state.

OK you TLA snoops...surely some of you montioring this list must have 
noticed that? Where are Mr Asswipe's brilliant advisors? Isn't this kind of 
acknowledgement practically Rule 1 in your anti-terrorist manuals? Or do you 
tacitly cooperate for the sake of job security? (ie, bin Laden gains more 
followers-->more terrorism-->more need for laws and YOU guys.) And don't get 
me wrong, I think this image shift for bin Laden will probably end up being 
a good thing (ie, we stop fuckin' around over there), but unfortunately a 
bunch of us will probably end up getting blowed-up or whatever in the 
process.

We know you're there so why not come in on an anonymous remailer and tell us 
how it feels to be you these days.
