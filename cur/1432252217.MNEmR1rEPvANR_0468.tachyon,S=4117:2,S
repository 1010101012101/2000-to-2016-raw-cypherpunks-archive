Either one runs seriously afoul of the First Amendment.

Remailers are publishers. Publishers cannot be "licensed," nor can they 
simply be closed down.

There is no issue of the "public airwaves," which is what allowed the 
FCC to license broadcasters and to yank the licenses of those who ran 
afoul of various rules.

One who takes in submissions, processes them according to his own 
proecedures, and then sends some output to other sites is a publisher.

Further, it is doubtful than any of the oft-discussed "all packets must 
be traceable to a meatspace" person are constitutional. The little 
matter of "unsigned political fliers" comes to mind (though fascists 
like McCain, Feingold, Feinstein, and others are attempting to use 
"campaign finance reform" to require meatspace identities).

And there are various practical enforceability issues, discussed here so 
often:

-- the vast number of "degrees of freedom" in networks, intranets, mixes 
inside warehouses, wireless, transnational, regulatory arbitrage, stego, 
etc.

I could write more on this, but I gotta go.
