OK, I checked what you sent to us yesterday and last week, and you 
posted more than just URLs. I was wrong about that.

But you forwarded articles (and URLs) from other lists, other news 
sources. I saw one from the Extropians list, another from Yahoo/CNET, 
one from Dave Farber, etc.

This is in some sense better than just dumping URLs on us, but it's 
not needed. We can read Yahoo to read about Singapore cameras. And so 
on. Unless there is some new twist for Cypherpunks, or some urgency, 
why make the CP list a dumping ground for what is better read with 
browsers?

As I said, I'm confused about how you say you're doing this because 
you have poor connectivity at work and zero at home? And yet you 
clearly found these articles in the first place, so how does mailing 
them out to Cypherpunks help you with connectivity problems?

Puzzled,
