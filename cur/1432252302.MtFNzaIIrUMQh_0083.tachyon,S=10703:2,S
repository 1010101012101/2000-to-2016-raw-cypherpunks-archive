Dear Gang:

Based on my conversations with Dave Brennan, Vic Schiller and Chris Manning, 
technical analysis indicates that we are going to have a Nasdq pullback 
before Christmas.  I am emailing you to let you that we are getting prepared 
to profit on the coming Bear attack on the NASDQ.  I am going to have an 
immediate "Emergency How To Profit From The Nasdq Correction, before 
Christmas TeleSeminar"  It will be on December 11th 6pm PAcific Time.  The 
traders that are ready are going to make money when the Bear swipes at the 
NASDQ.  I have a special guest lined up who will discuss how to protect 
positions you have now, how to make money of the coming pullback, how to deal 
emotionally and confidently with the coming pullback.  I don't want anyone to

learn how to play the downside easily, naturally and confidently. Most of all 
you will make money.  This can be a big opportunity for the trader that knows

as our guest.  Her name is Toni Turner.  I caught up with Toni just after she 
broke her foot, so she couldn't run far.  I talked to Toni for 30 minutes and 
I knew immediately that this lady is genuinely interested in sharing her

individuals that want major results in their trading accounts, in a short 
amount of time.  Her commitment is even on her website it reads:  "My goal is

seminars around the nation.  She uses technical analysis as the key to her 
success.  She confessed to me, like most people, she lost most all of your 
trading portfolio when she first started trading and that experience allowed 
her the burning desire to master trading.  When I say master trading, you

trader that no one knows about and that I have met.  I can't get into too 
much detail of what she will be talking about, however it will involve Candle

will talk about her favorite indicators that she uses to make money 
consistently!

December 18 - December 18 - Rob Stanley 
This is our first diversified investment Teleseminar. I use to live in 
Dallas, Texas and I was able to met and hear about some really good oil and 
natural gas companies. The organization that we are interviewing is 
recognized as one of America's more successful independent oil and gas 
companies. Comprised of carefully selected oil and gas professionals, Reef's 
management represents an important synergism of industry experience in the 
key areas of finance, land, geological and geophysical exploration, drilling, 
completion, and production. This experienced management team, together with 
highly skilled technical consultants and the latest computer technology, 
enables Reef to operate without layers of corporate bureaucracy to make 
faster, more aggressive decisions which have resulted in significant 
discoveries of oil and natural gas reserves. What really impressed me was 
that the individuals that are running thecompany, the one with the least 
experience has been in the industry 17 years. Rob Stanley, who has been in 
the oil industry for numerous years will visit with us about why oil and 
natural gas investments are great right now, how to get involved, what to 
know before getting involved, 3 mistakes investors make and how to avoid 
them, tax credits and tax eliminate tools, secrets about the industry no one 
will tell you, how wealth is created in this industry, how to cut your risk 
and get great returns! If you have ever thought about orheard about oil and 
natural gas investments Rob is going to share everything with us. Join us!

December 20 -  I met this guy last summer a friend of mine was/is real 
impressed with the returns she has been getting with this guy's website.  
Allow me to introduce to you Vic Schiller, who is a successful options trader 
and has one of the hottest options websites on the planet.  He has a patented 
formula for screening and helping you find the stocks that you are looking 
for.  It is called SmartSearchXL, a patented decision support technology that 
identifies the highest return option trade opportunities.  This allows you 
the convenience and control required to automatically sort, filter, screen, 
organize and analyze a database of all 2,700+ optionable stocks and 100,000+ 
options online to find investments to meet your profit goals. Plus he brings 
together timely essential data, extensive analysis, and comprehensive option 
information.  With the tools that Vic has helped develop, it allows you to 
make money in bullish, bearish or a stagnant stock market.   The thing I like 
most about Vic’s information is once you get all of this data (are there can 
be a lot of it)  he then gives and teaches strategies that you can apply and 
start making money with.  I have not met too many people that believe in 
their product so much that they have an incredible and unheard of guarantee.  
Here is how it reads:  "If during any month you do not make at least five 
times your subscription fee on your option investments, your next month's 
subscription fee will be free."  He is specifically going to address:   How 
he picks and exits option trades.  He is going to go over specifics  that 
have made him a great trader and consistent moneymaker.  The Secrets to how 
"You" can squeeze dividend-like income from non-dividend paying tech stocks.  
 How to insure the value of your portfolio the same way you buy car 
insurance?  How you can use options to hedge your stock portfolio and make 
more money.  He is going to go over his "never before revealed" way of
