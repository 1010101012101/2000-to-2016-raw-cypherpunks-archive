Fantastic!

Now we're talking mainstream-able, market-able. I can see most people
will -not- race out and promote AP, but the little bounties for
"common sense system enslavement bucking" is salable by most people to
each other.

And with a single-click option to "pay it forward to the next
guy/gal", if it's "only" $150, some people would pay it forward,
thereby doubling the effectiveness of the initial contribution.

Others might double it up, adding their own bounty as well as paying
it forward, cause they like it so much.
