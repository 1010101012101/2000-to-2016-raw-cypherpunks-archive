No, probably parts of it: the ones that don't have to think of the big
picture.  The U.S. government is not monolythic.  The NSA has shown a
number of times that they are interested in strong civilian
cryptography for reasons of... national security.  In a battle between
law enforcement and national security the latter has to win.

Key escrow == gigantic SPOF.  Even if you split the escrow across
several agencies and don't use a single master key, it's still
concentrating systemic failure potential into too few points.  To
build a single point of catastrophic failure into one's economic
infrastructure is one of the biggest strategic blunders I can imagine
(obviously there's worse, such as simply surrendering when one clearly
has the upper hand, say).  Back in the early 90s this probably wasn't
as clear as it is today.

Most users already pay heavy battery/performance taxes in the form of
uninstallable adware built into their devices.  The vendors might be
the ones to object then since they might have to stop shipping such
software.  But ultimately this argument depends on how heavy a burden
the users end up feeling.

For my money the winning argument is the strategic idiocy/insanity of
unnecessary SPOFs.  Who wants to ever even think of saying to the
POTUS "Mr. President, we have a mole, they've stolen the codes for our
civilian networks and they've shut them down from the people's shear
fear of financial and other losses. It will take months to re-key
everything and in the meantime we'll lose X% of GDP. The stock and
bond markets have crashed."  As time passes X will tend to increase in
the event of such a catastrophe.  The higher that percentage the more
crippling the attack, with derivatives losses becoming overwhelming at
small values of X.  It could get worse: "Mr. President, we can't even
re-key without changing all these hardware dongles that are
manufactured by the enemy, who's now not selling them to us."

If the point of key escrow is to make law enforcement easier then
there are much simpler non-cryptographic solutions -- not ones to your
taste or mine perhaps, but certainly ones that don't involve strategic
SPOFs.

I'm with you: key escrow is necessarily dead letter, at least for the
time being and the foreseeable future.
