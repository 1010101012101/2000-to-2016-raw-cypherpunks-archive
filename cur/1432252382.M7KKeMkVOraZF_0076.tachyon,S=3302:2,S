That's the primary objective of the Internet and telecommunications
and SM networks. Official spies are no longer the only ones and may
be the least threatening but a handy stimulus for all-too-suspicious
privacy and security products that have all-too-hackable holes and,
ahem, faulty implementations to be blamed on the victims who
shouldn't trust shit, so says those who rush shit to market.

Damn, who is who in the race to cruelly exploit while waving a flag 
of warning.

Somebody crankily said he is fed up with newly discovered security 
breaches and faults which turn out to be false alarms hiding deeper
treacheries which turn out to be "harmless" design features which
turn out to be fucked-up works in progress forced to market by 
economic and political ambitions. So what if a few thousands
die, "compared to auto and cancer and suicide deaths those 
are insignificant."

Apologists have it right. Jump to admit minor, formulaic, entertaining
errors to divert attention from unspeakables.
