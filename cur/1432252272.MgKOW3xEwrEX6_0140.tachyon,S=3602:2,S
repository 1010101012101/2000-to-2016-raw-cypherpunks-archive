It's annoying that crypto papers hardly ever seem to be made available
online.  I wonder if there is any chance of crypto researchers joining
the scientific journal boycott...

The boycott is described here among other places:

http://www.scientificamerican.com/explorations/2001/042301publish/
http://slashdot.org/science/01/04/24/149257_F.shtml

Basically the researchers, who are currently mostly in the life
sciences, want papers published freely on the web after six months.
So if you need completely up to date information, you buy the
journal.  If you aren't bothered you can look on the web.  According
to the Scientific American article they have 15,000 researchers
including several Nobel prize winners.

This wouldn't help Alex, though...  :-(
