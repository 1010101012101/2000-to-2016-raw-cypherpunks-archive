I don't know.  He may have done as little as personally offended
someone with the power to order his disposal.  It does seem a bit much
to call a conspiratorial operation at this scale "massive" in the
world where the 911 attack happened, and U.S. propaganda assets
continue to sell false narratives of /many/ violent events to the
public.

The stunning success of efforts to manage Western press coverage of
the annexation of Libya on Secretary Clinton's watch is more
frightening to me than the whole history of the Bush/Obama
Administration's nuclear brinksmanship vs. the Russian Federation,
still in progress and apparently locked in for eight more years.

To me that seems the most likely answer.  "Douchebag" is in the eye of
the beholder, and it doesn't take much to trigger disproportionate
retaliation in a hostile workplace environment.

Lao Tzu has a lot to say about the strategic value of calculated
non-action.  Attorneys generally advise world + dog to wait for the
opposition to disclose everything it has before doing anything other
than assert the right to remain silent.
