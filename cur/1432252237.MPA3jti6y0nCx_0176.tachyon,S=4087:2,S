#    Ashcroft to Christian Crowd: Use Government to Sell Jesus
#    
#    The Gospel According to the A.G.
#    
#    by Ward Harkavy
#    
#    In a speech that never surfaced during his confirmation hearing 
#    but reveals much about his agenda as attorney general, John 
#    Ashcroft clearly laid out his dream of government-sponsored social 
#    programs helping convert people to Jesus. Behind the scenes, 
#    his Justice Department is now helping make that possible.
#    
#    Government "gives only half a gift when it doesn't give the spirit 
#    of Christ," Ashcroft, then a Missouri senator, told the dinner 
#    crowd at the Washington Court Hotel on September 18, 1996, as 
#    he received the Christian Statesman of the Year Award. "It doesn't 
#    give the spirit of God, it doesn't give the spirit of forgiveness, 
#    it doesn't give the regeneration of healing with its gift."
#    
#    Those sentiments, captured on tape and obtained by the Voice, 
#    don't surprise Ashcroft's critics. "That is a statement saying 
#    the government must evangelize," said Barry Lynn, the liberal 
#    minister who's the head of Americans United for Separation of 
#    Church and State. "He views the goal of a politician to be an 
#    active agent of religious conversion."
#    
#    What threw Lynn and others was Ashcroft's insistence during the 
#    Senate hearings last January that he could keep his well-known 
#    religious beliefs from affecting his performance as the nation's 
#    top law enforcement officer. "In the past, unlike during the 
#    confirmation hearings, he couldn't separate the secular from 
#    the religious," said Lynn. "He never even suggested that he could. 
#    And I couldn't believe him when he told the Senate that he could."
#    
#    For good reason.
