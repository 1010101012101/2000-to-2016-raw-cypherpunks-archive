And signal refuses to work with my SIP number on Android 6.  Which makes it almost a non starter (that and the stated lack of adoption)..

    Personally I think having to expose the phone number of a smartphone
    to another user to establish a chat is an incredible security risk
    in the short and long run and leads to all sorts of metadata
    harvesting of your unencrypted info. It appears one should keep a
    low-budget smartphone for that use instead of their main number for
    better persec.  <br />
    <br />
    I questioned Morgan Mayhem (Intercept's sysadmin/cybersec guy) about
    that when he broached how secure signal is (he's one of the
    developers) on his twitter feed. Never got a reply.<br />
    <br />
    Telegram allows the use of an @name instead of exposing your number
    if you set up an account but I'm unsure what happens when a
    connection is established and the contact is added to you contact

        WhatsApp Forensic Artifacts: Chats Aren’t Being Deleted<br />

        Sorry, folks, while experts are saying the encryption checks out
        in<br />
        WhatsApp, it looks like the latest version of the app tested
        leaves<br />
        forensic trace of all of your chats, even after you’ve deleted,
        cleared,<br />
        or archived them… even if you “Clear All Chats”. In fact, the
        only way<br />
        to get rid of them appears to be to delete the app entirely.<br />
        <br />
        To test, I installed the app and started a few different
        threads. I then<br />
        archived some, cleared, some, and deleted some threads. I made a
        second<br />
        backup after running the “Clear All Chats” function in WhatsApp.
        None of<br />
        these deletion or archival options made any difference in how
        deleted<br />
        records were preserved. In all cases, the deleted SQLite records<br />
        remained intact in the database.<br />
        <br />
