: limited/dev C5J boards to play with though...
: 
: i reallly want to get my hands on an armful of nano-itx esther systems. :P

I've got five systems (three of which I use on a daily basis) with the
Nehemiah core.  A local supplier just notifed me the other day that they've
now got Nano-ITX in stock, although they're still C3s.  I'm not holding my
breath for Esther; it was some time ago they announced their DP line, and
I've yet to see any dual-processor C3s available for purchase.

That being said, it looks like Gigabyte has a board ready for the C7.  I
still don't see any news on the actual *chip*, though.

I'd really like to see a commercially available (there was a project some
time ago to do a home-brew version) C7-based laptop...
