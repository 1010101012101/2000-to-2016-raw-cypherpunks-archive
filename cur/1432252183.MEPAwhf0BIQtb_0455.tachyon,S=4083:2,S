Now, I love hyperbole as much as the next guy, but you have no idea what a
Chinese-type police state could declare outlawed. I heard about a country
that declared illegal people's own gold. Wait, maybe you heard of it too!
[Duh...]

If China declares that all people with an IQ over 70 are to be killed
tomorrow, they WILL be killed tomorrow, and those few who manage to escape
will be prosecuted by everyone - especially by those with IQs below 70. I've
seen something like this at work in my country, right after our revolution -
the "We Work, not Think" slogan was actually very much in use, and I won't
be very surprised to find people who still believe / embrace it. (People
WERE attacked because they were "intellectuals", which was worse than
"burgeoise" for several months in 1990.)

You still failed to say why. This is Tim "Saying that gold will be outlawed
is silly" May for you.
