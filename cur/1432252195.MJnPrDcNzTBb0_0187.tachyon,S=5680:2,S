Al Qaeda propaganda website shut down


Wednesday November 17, 05:54 AM


Al-Qaeda propaganda website shut down

A web site that reportedly contained speeches by Suleiman Abu Ghaith, an
alleged spokesman for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was shut down by a
Swedish internet provider after the site was traced to its server.

Spray Network, a subsidiary of Lycos Europe, shut the site down after being
informed of the site, said Fredrik Skaerheden, a Spray Network spokesman.


"We have a very clear policy that any material that in any way may urge or
encourage criminal acts or violence is immediately removed," Skaerheden told
The Associated Press.

The web site, www.members.lycos.co.uk/abugaith1, reportedly contained
several audio files of Abu Ghaith giving speeches and sermons in Arabic, and
contained several violent and bloody images.

According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI, which first
traced the site to the Swedish server, at least one of the sermons called
for Muslims to give their lives to fight the United States.

A report on MEMRI's Web site quoted the sermon as hailing bin Laden and
describing the Jihad fighters as people who "seek death as others seek life
and seek Allah's promise in the Koran and sacrifice their property, their
blood, and their lives as a sign of the sincerity of their faith."

Anyone can create a web site for free on Lycos' servers, Skaerheden said,
adding that many of the Lycos Europe member sites are hosted by Spray's
servers in the Swedish capital, Stockholm.
