Just watch the Israel trolls. Most are morons, but they sure make some
'noise'.

Influence: Search Engines so googlers see THEIR info first.

Disruption: Make the forums they infest less desirable with
disinformation, sometimes quite obvious, repeated over and over and over
again intended to (see 'influence' first and...) generally annoy users
who disagree with them using ad hom filled rants, often tail-ending
comment threads so their info is first/last seen.
