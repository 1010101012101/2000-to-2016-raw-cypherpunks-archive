White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer just announced pending
appointment of the "Officer of Cyber-Security" to the Homeland Defense
Team. I believe the appointee name was Roger Clarke, I may have the
first name wrong. They're going to brief more on this in about 30
minutes, and I'm sure more details will be evident by day's end.
