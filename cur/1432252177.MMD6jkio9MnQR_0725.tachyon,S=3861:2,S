	FBI: Uncorroborated threat received against Texas schools 
	12/12/2001 
	By CONNIE MABIN / The Associated Press 
	
	AUSTIN - FBI agents have alerted schools throughout Texas 
	that a vague threat has been received suggesting two people 
	may retaliate against unknown Texas schools for the U.S. 
	bombing in Afghanistan.
	"Basically, as vague as I gave it, is as vague as we have 
	it," Houston FBI Special Agent Bob Doguim said Wednesday. 
	"This is coming to us from a foreign government. We are 
	working with them to try and determine the reliability of 
	it."

Yeah, but those foreign government agents will believe anything
they read on the internet...

I guess poor Katie will be the youngest person ever to have her 
school club declared a proscribed terrorist-supporting NGO.
