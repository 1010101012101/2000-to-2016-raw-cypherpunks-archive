Same here. We pretty much stayed in our seats. None of the spontaneous 
wandering around the room I have seen in video footage of today's kids. 
Sure, some kids were more active than others, but nothing like what I 
hear about and see today.

But they were polluting our essence back in the 1950s, when water 
fluoridation and fluoride toothpaste became common.

Aluminum frying pans? Teflon?

Or, more likely: endless gallons of sugar water. When I was a kid, a 
6-ounce bottle of Coca Cola was a special treat. (Though I recall we 
drank a fair amount of Kool-Aid. And Fizzies, before they were banned.) 
Today's kids tank up on Big Gulps and Supersize It! 32-ounce portions. 
Even soda vending machines in the schools, and soft drinks served with 
lunch.

Likewise, a lot more fast food today. Where once it was a treat to go 
to a burger place, now they dot the landscape and many kids eat at them 
nearly every day.

And lack of discipline is probably a big factor. If teachers simply 
told the kids to sit down and stop fidgeting, as they did with us, 
maybe there would be fewer of these alleged ADHD cases.

But the single most likely reason for the rise in alleged ADHD cases is 
the pharmaceutical industry. And job security for the "psychiatric 
staff" at K12 schools. Where once there was a nurse bandaging cuts and 
scrapes, now there's a staff of psychobabblers and sexuality counselors.
