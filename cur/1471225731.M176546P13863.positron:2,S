** Ron Paul says ‘CIA involved’ in government overthrow in Ukraine, war
brewing over Crimea (VIDEO)

As Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams correctly point out, the whole crisis
originates from the U.S. backed overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ,
Ukraine’s constitutional and democratically elected President. The U.S.
backed regime that seized power in Ukraine as a result of this coup has
pursued a militantly anti-Russian line, provoking the secession of
Crimea and Russia’s actions there. Though this has created a crisis on
Russia’s border in an area where the U.S. has no direct interest, the
U.S. continues to meddle, fanning tensions and internationalizing the
problem.

>From the Ron Paul Liberty Report:

Russia claims to have stopped a sabotage operation by Ukraine’s
intelligence service. Ukraine denies the charge and has beefed up the
military on its border with Crimea. Is another war brewing? Is the US
pushing for it?

A very important point Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams make is that the
U.S.’s unqualified backing for the Kiev regime simply encourages it to
take the sort of dangerous and reckless actions we have just seen in
Crimea. The result is that every attempt to reduce tensions in the area
– of which there have been many coming from the Russian side – have come
to naught. In Ukraine, as in other places (including Syria – also
touched on by Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams in the video) U.S. policy is
creating problems, not solving them.
