Indeed they do.  In a context where the test subjects are
self-selected (volunteers) from a population and culture deeply
committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.

I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.

Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.

You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.

Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.

Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.

More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.

Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.

I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
difference.

History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled
by a gang of criminal bankers?

As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.

An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.

We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.

As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.

This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.

What I mean by "this" requires the context of the paragraph the
sentence above has been removed from:  "This" is the growing gap
between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.

You might say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

Power creates authority.  Authority is the exercise of expressly
defined power.

Something "works" when it has the desired effect in practical

I'm a think I wandered into Monty Python's Argument Clinic.  The

I hate to say it, but yes.  Example:

My position is that holding oneself to be inherently superior to
most of the human race is elitist.

If you refer to my first post in this thread, you won't find a
hissy fit.  You will find a simple statement about my dislike for
the term 'sheeple'.

Sure, as long as we are clear that the entity making that
statement is a human.  Personally, I imagine that humans in
general, and you in particular, are much more than that.
