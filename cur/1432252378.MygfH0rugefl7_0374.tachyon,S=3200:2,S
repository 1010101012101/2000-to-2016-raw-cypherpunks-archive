Actually if Giotti found a tape recorder (or keyboard bug) in his house
I'm pretty sure he'd
do more than blank its bits...

*legally*, and despite the obvious implication that someone's
investigating something..

Behavior can't be 'contemptous' of court orders if there are none.  You
can't
spoil evidence if the artifacts are not yet identified as evidence.

Its not illegal for Condit to toss all the evidence of his
fucking-anything-that-moves,
because no judge has asked for it.
