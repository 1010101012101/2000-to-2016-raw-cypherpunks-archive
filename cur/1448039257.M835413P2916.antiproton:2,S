Truecrypt is not extinct.  Before its developers decided to stop
working on it, Truecrypt was considered adequately secure for
practical applications.  After its developers decided to stop
working on it, Truecrypt is considered adequately secure for
practical applications.

Nothing changed, except that if you don't have a copy of Truecrypt
you will have to find one can be verified as authentic via digital
signatures made from known good packages.  This is not hard, so if
you can not do it you should not trust /any/ cryptographic tool
until you have learned more about network security.

A recent in-depth security audit of Truecrpt found room for
improvement but no "show stoppers."  A more recent report asserts
that Truecrypt is "insecure" on Microsoft operating systems.
Examination of that claim reveals that the Microsoft operating
systems themselves, not Truecrypt, contain the security flaw in
question.  Where "security" is a major concern the use of
Microsoft products is ruled out, due to the availability of much
more secure alternatives; so this particular claim is not relevant.

Truecrypt will eventually become obsolete due to changes in the
operating systems is can be used with, as its predecessor
Scramdisk eventually became obsolete after development stopped.
It makes sense for Truecrypt users to start looking at alternative
tools now, and plan for a smooth transition away from Truecrypt at
their convenience.  Other posts in this thread mention several
candidates.

But the sky has not fallen and there is no particular reason to be
in a big hurry to dump Truecrypt right now.
