Hash: SHA1

While we are on the topic, someone recently sent out lots of make
money fast spam with my name as the from address.

It included what looks like (I'm in Australia) a US Toll free number
(1-888-293-6065 Code # MT-1), If anyone has seen this spam,
particularly if it has my address on it, please send me a copy of the
headers.

I am not offering much of a reward except for warm fuzzy feelings and
in the case of helpful people small chunks of e-gold.  Specifically
half a gram for the first person who can ring and see if this number
exists and who they are, I'll bump it up to a whole gram if you can
also find a suitable law enforcement email for that jurisdiction. 
Offer good for the next week or two.

Has anyone else had this happen to them?  Or have I cheesed someone
off real good.

	cya,	Andrew...

See what happens when you send chain letters?  I'm really trying to
work
up some sympathy here, but I'm just failing.  You participated in an
illegal chain letter and now you want to be protected from the
consequences of your actions.  Tough.

HTH, HAND, FOAD, etc.
