Oh, come off it.

Stu is a well known NSA zealot. The only reason there's a bridge
between Kapor and Baker is due to the cavernous ravine that lays
between them. Kapor is now apparently half-way across, following
Stu's silently bekoning finger, fearfully running from the sounds
of angels wings; fooled into believing that they lie behind and
not ahead of him.
