Uh...huh?

You really get a lot of things mixed up. If you think Ho Chi Minh was a KGB 
sockpuppet then you really don't know anything about Vietnam, China, or East 
Asian history. Think of Ho Chi Min as, utlimately, a violent pragmatist...he 
was going to get his guns from whoever he could, and that's what he did. He 
also had Chinese guns and, during WWII, American guns (yes: We were allied 
with Ho Chi Minh against the Japanese during WWII).

Likewise, you accused Saddam Hussein of being allied with bin Laden, which 
is also silly. In fact, bin Laden has regularly called for Saddam's death, 
and I see no reason to believe he wasn't serious.

Likewise, your lambasting of Chomsky on the "Chomsky Dis" website also 
indicates huge and suspicious gaps in knowledge. I'm starting to connect the 
dots here: I dare you to read the name that signs your paycheck.
