1. All Italian tax payers' data made public online by the Italian Government
============================================================

To the unpleasant surprise of many Italians, for a few hours on 30 April
2008, the Italian government, through its Agenzia delle Entrate, published
on the agency website, agenziaentrate.gov.it, the financial information
filed by all Italian taxpayers.

Although operational only for a few hours, many people had the opportunity
of seeing how much other people were earning, including celebrities. As
Corriere della Sera daily newspaper puts it, the site was "a delicious
opportunity to find out with a click how much your neighbour or colleague
or, for gossip fans, celebrities earn".

The present centre-left government made public every citizen's declared
taxable income as part of a crackdown on tax evasion. The action brought
forth the quick attack and critical attitude of consumers, privacy advocates
and politicians alike. The consumer group ADOC considered the action as "a
clear violation of privacy law" as the tax return forms did not include any
request of consent for data publishing, therefore, the appearance of the
data on the Internet being illegal.

At the complaint of the Italian Data Protection Authority for violation of
privacy, the Italian Treasury ordered the national tax office to close down
the site which was providing full details of tax returns, including declared
income and tax paid for 2005 but also names, addresses and birth dates.

The Deputy Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco said he did not see what the
problem was: "It's all about transparency and democracy". Massimo Romano,
head of the tax office,considered that the publication had been "in the
public interest, in order to allow the free circulation of information in a
framework of transparency" and he stated that the action had been in
agreement with guidelines from the privacy watchdog. However, Francesco
Pizzetti, the head of the Italian DPA, said that he had not been informed
about this.

The opposition which won the elections last month accused Visco of having
released the data as "an act of revenge". "It's a very strange thing to do
on the last day before clearing off" said Guido Crosetto, a member of
Berlusconi's party who also added: "Taxpayers need to pay less tax, not to
know how much all the other Italians are paying."

"It's madness," was the comment of Beppe Grillo, a very well known Italian
comic. In his opinion the government had "given criminals information about
the income and address of taxpayers." He also added: "This is going to make
paying taxes very dangerous. (...) It will be much safer and less risky to
just evade taxes and pay the fine if you're caught."

2. Important personal data lost by the Bank of Ireland
============================================================

The personal data of about 10 000 customers of the Bank of Ireland (BOI) are
now in the possession of thieves as four laptops with the unencrypted data
were stolen from the bank between June and October 2007.

The four stolen laptops had been used by staff working for the bank's life
assurance division. Not only the customers' data including medical history,
life assurance details, bank account details, names and addresses were not
encrypted, but the bank notified the thefts to the Data Protection
Commissioner in Ireland only on 18 April 2008. Furthermore, until now the
bank has not written to individual customers whose information was lost.

The case is now investigated by the Financial Regulator as well as by Billy
Hawkes, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. "The investigation will
focus on the justification for the personal data, including sensitive
medical data in some cases, being placed on the laptops in the first place,
the security arrangements in place and the exact circumstances which led to
the delay in the reporting of this matter internally within the Bank of
Ireland to the appropriate personnel for the taking of further action," said
a statement from the Commissioner.

The only justification the bank gave in its defence was that it "monitored
all of these customer accounts and can confirm that there has been no
evidence of fraudulent or suspicious activity" which, of course, cannot
possibly cover fraud that may occur somewhere else. And this definitely does
not justify the fact that the bank did not notify its customers so that they
may protect themselves.

It's not yet clear what sanctions will the bank receive or whether it will
receive any sanctions at all. In a similar case in England, the Nationwide
Building Society was fined around 1 300 000 euro by the Financial Services
Authority for having failed to provide proper information security
procedures and controls.

"Consideration will then be given as to what further action will be sought
from Bank of Ireland to ensure that the obligations contained in the Data
Protection Acts in this area are met. The Data Protection Commissioner and
the Financial Regulator are cooperating on this matter and we will refer any
relevant issues to the Financial Regulator" says the Commissioner's
statement.

More and more, financial organisations create a risk to the security of
their customers' data. According to the UK Information Commissioner's Office
half of the data security breaches in the private sector reported since last
November involved financial services companies.

The problem is that, presently, there is no general legal obligation for a
body to notify the people in case of losing their data. As reported by
EDRi-gram, the European Data Protection Supervisor has suggested amendments
in this respect to the forthcoming e-Privacy Directive.

3. More control over the Internet wanted in Russia
============================================================

The Russian prosecutor's office wants to extend the anti-extremism laws to
the Internet, proposing an amendment to the rules that presently govern
printed media on the basis of which newspapers considered by the court to
have published extremist material can be shut down.

In terms of the new proposal, which began circulating in the State Duma's
Security Committee on 10 April 2008, any kind of material considered
extremist or website deemed to have hosted extremist material should be
blocked by ISPs. If found guilty of repeatedly hosting extremist materials,
the website will be shut down. A list of extremist Internet-based materials
and sites must be regularly made available and the ISPs will be bound to
stop hosting these sites.

The proposal asks from law-makers to clearly delineate "what is unacceptable
on the internet in terms of public morality, public safety and
anti-extremist legislation" and to "place responsibility for the
dissemination of any such materials on those who furnish space for it."

"We are speaking about the self-controlling of the providers and
telecommunications companies" said Aleksey Zhafyarov, the deputy head of
Directorate supervising enforcement of laws on federal security, interethnic
relations and countering extremism.

Internet is considered too free by the Russian governors. Alexander Torshin,
the vice-speaker of the Federation Council, has painted a very dark image of
the Internet believing it is "a means of terror propaganda" that can
be considered "the academy of terrorism." In his opinion, terrorists use the
Internet to "practically propagandize their ideas in the open, recruiting
new adherents, buying up weapons and munitions, (and) communicating with one
another." He said that lawmakers should "work out unified identifying
criteria for terrorist websites, formulate techniques to expose them and
constantly monitor their activities, nationally and internationally, and
also (work out) the means to close these sites."

The proposal has created concerns related to the abuses that such a law
might bring forth. "It is difficult to find anyone who is not against
extremism but it depends on how the law is used. The government uses (it)
selectively" said Oleg Panfilov, director of the Centre of Journalism in
Extreme Situations. There have been cases when blogs and websites belonging
to the opposition have been shut down after having been labelled as
extremist. For example the news website gazeta.ru was warned for using
extremist materials last year after it wrote about cartoons that satirised
the prophet Mohammed.

Even some of the Russian lawmakers have doubts about the usefulness of any
new measures to control the Internet. "We tighten the screws and the
situation only gets worse" said Gennady Gudkov, the deputy chairman of the
State Duma Security Committee.

Critics also believe that there is enough control already and law
enforcement agencies have the means to shut down Internet providers as in
the case of the 10 ISPs who were shut down by St. Petersburg prosecutors on
14 April 2008 for hosting extremist content.

Since the beginning of this year, the pressure to regulate the Internet has
increased in Russia. In January, Russia's Parliament began work on a law "On
the Internet," that should create a legal framework to deal with online
matters. In February, Vladimir Slutsker, a Federation Council delegate,
introduced a draft normative act that will force all Internet sites with
more than a thousand daily visitors to register as mass-media outlets. There
is also a project currently in the State Duma that would limit foreign
investment in the telecommunications and internet industries.

On 25 April 2008 Russia's lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, passed,
nearly unanimously, an amendment to the law on mass-media, in its first
reading, giving greater powers to authorities to shut down media outlets.
The new law forbids using a registered media source to spread "false facts
that discredit the honour and dignity of another entity, or undermine their
reputation."

4. Automatic face recognition in UK airports
============================================================

Starting this summer, the UK Border Agency will use facial recognition
technology at automated unmanned gates. A machine would accept or reject the
match between the scan and the computer information on people with biometric
passports.

The pilot project will be open to UK and EU citizens holding new biometric
passports. "We think a machine can do a better job (than manned passport
inspections). What will the public reaction be? Will they use it? We need to
test and see how people react and how they deal with rejection. We hope to
get the trial up and running by the summer" said Gary Murphy, head of
operational design and development for the UK Border Agency, during a
biometrics-related conference that took place in London in April 2008.

Home Office minister Liam Byrne said: "Britain's border security is now
among the toughest in the world and tougher checks do take time, but we
don't want long waits. So the UK Border Agency will soon be testing new
automatic gates for British and European Economic Area citizens. We will
test them this year and if they work put them at all key ports (and
airports)."

As there is concern that passengers will react badly if rejected by an
automated gate, the technology will err on the side of caution and innocent
passengers that are rejected may be redirected to traditional passport
queues, or authorized officers may override the automatic gates after having
performed the necessary checks.

However, the technology is highly criticized. Phil Booth of the No2Id
Campaign explains: "Someone is extremely optimistic. The technology is just
not there. The last time I spoke to anyone in the facial recognition field
they said the best systems were only operating at about a 40% success rate
in a real time situation. I am flabbergasted they consider doing this at a
time when there are so many measures making it difficult for passengers."

The facial image contained by the EU passport is actually a digitised copy
of the normal passport picture which is not a biometric data and, according
to a report of the UK National Audit Office "current facial recognition
technology is not reliable enough to enable the automated checking of
applications against the full database of existing passport holders". The
report also says that the technology may be useless in cases when the
two-year guaranty chips are contained into 10-year long passports. Besides,
the face may change very much in ten years making the database even more
unreliable.

Tony Bunyan, Statewatch editor, comments: "The UK and other EU governments
refer to the digitised passport photo as a biometric when it is not for
ideological reasons - to get us used to the idea that they already have one
of our "biometrics" so why should we not give them another - our
fingerprints. The process however is very different. In most cases the
passport picture is simply submitted by post or at an office whereas the
compulsory taking of fingerprints requires the physical presence of the
person at an "enrolment centre" where they have to prove "they are who they
are".

The Government has not yet decided how many airports will take part in the
trial but, if the pilot project is successful, the technology will be
extended to all UK airports.

5. Radio Free Europe's websites in Belarus under attack
============================================================

Several Radio Free Europe websites were under a distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attack in the past week. The attacks started on 26 April
2008, the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, primary
targeted at the Belarus Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) service
which was offering live coverage of a rally of protest organized in Minsk
against the plight of uncompensated victims and a government decision to
build a new nuclear plant.

Martins Zvaners, RFE spokesman, thinks that was the largest attack ever
experienced by RFE. At its peak, the DDoS attack was sending more than 50000
requests to the RFE sites, flooding its servers' capacity and throwing them
offline.

Although there is no proof of who was behind the attacks, Zvaners pointed
his finger at the Belarus administration: "This started on the day of a
demonstration that they wanted no one to cover. They've never been real
happy with us. In an ongoing sense, they are always 'jamming' our signals.
We can't say for certain who did it, but you look at the circumstances and
you can start to draw some possible inferences."

US State Department spokeswoman Jessica Simon stated that it was the
Belarusian Government's responsibility to stop such kind of attacks while
Nina Ognianova, the program coordinator for Europe and Central Asia at the
New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said it was also the
responsibility of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka to find and punish those
responsible with the attacks. "In Belarus especially, RFE/RL service is
significant now more than ever because Lukashenka's regime has destroyed the
other independent and opposition broadcasters. (...) So we certainly are
very concerned about this short-lived but successful attacks" said
Ognianova.

RFE issued a news release on 28 April following which the attacks
stopped and the sites went back online. According to Zvaners, RFE has now
taken protection measures against similar attacks.

During the three days of the attack, RFR/RL's Belarus Service was supported
by 22 Belarusian sites that hosted its content. "Dear friends. We value your
solidarity and we promise to support any site that falls victim to such an
attack in the future. (...) Thanks to all of you for your support of
freedom" said Alyaksandr Lukashuk, director of RFE/RL's Belarus Service, who
considers that the response to the attack was an example that could create a
precedent for future online "esprit de corps" among journalists and
pro-democracy advocates.

6. EDPS wants data protection considered by EU research projects
============================================================

Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) wants privacy
and data protection requirements to be considered in the future EU research
and technological development (RTD) projects, especially those developing
information and communication technologies.

The EDPS' main role is to monitor EU developments which have an impact on
the protection of personal data, especially the development of ICT and "to
advise the Commission and/or project developers on their efforts to use
privacy and data protection-friendly RTD methodologies and of course to
develop technologies and processes that will promote and reinforce the
effectiveness of the EU data protection legal framework".

On 28 April 2008, EDPS adopted a policy paper establishing his role and
developing possible models of contribution both in the preparatory phase of
the overall EU research framework programme as well as for individual
research projects. The EDPS contributions have as purpose to reinforce the
application of the "privacy by design" principle as an inherent part of the
RTD initiatives.

"Privacy and data protection requirements need to be highlighted and applied
as soon as possible in the life cycle of new technological developments in
order to contribute to a better implementation of the data protection legal
framework. The European RTD efforts constitute a very good opportunity to
accomplish these goals" says Hustinx.

The EDPS' contributions in this direction could be achieved by:
- participation in workshops and conferences intended to identify future
challenges that can be relevant for EU RTD policy;
- contribution to research advisory boards launched by the European
Commission in connection with the Framework Programme, and provision of
opinions on data protection matters;
- assistance to the European Commission in the evaluation process of
proposals, in particular regarding possible data protection issues these
proposals might trigger;
- provision of opinions on data protection matters in relation to
individual RTD projects on his own initiative or at the request of a
consortium.

Also, as "research projects of an EU Framework Programme usually have the
obligation to involve partners from several Member States, the EDPS could
also, in this case, contribute to and facilitate the cooperation between the
corresponding Member States or third country data protection authorities
which might be involved" says the paper.

7. German Intelligence caught spying on journalist's emails
============================================================

The German Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND),
has been recently under pressure for having illicitly monitored the e-mails
between Spiegel correspondent Susanne Koelbl and Afghanistan's Commerce
Minister Amin Farhang.

The German parliamentary commission in charge with investigating the
activities of the secret services (PKG) criticised BND, believing the agency
had been compromised by this case that it considered "a grave breach of
basic rights". "The trust between the PKG and the leadership of the BND has
been violated by this," stated PKG. The commission also considered it
unacceptable that Uhrlau, the BND president, had not informed the German
government or the commission about the case and that even BND's leadership
had learned about the case only a year after the operation took
place, which represented a violation of the internal policy requiring
official clearance.

Although Uhrlau publicly apologised to Susanne Koelbl, apparently, the
target was not the Spiegel journalist this time, but Amin Farhang,
Afghanistan's commerce minister, who exchanged e-mails with the reporter
between June and November 2006. Koelbl's correspondence was retrieved by
using a "Trojan horse" software which invaded the minister's computer system
and which was sending copies of his e-mail messages to the BND. Furthermore,
Spiegel has learned that the BND was performing more extensive spying
activities in Afghanistan having actually monitored the entire computer
network of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. BND specialists had
succeeded in retrieving several government e-mail addresses, confidential
documents and even passwords.

Der Spiegel, after having asked Farhang's permission to reveal his name,
stated that the minister had been a secret source for some of its articles
in the recent years. The magazine called the case "a grave encroachment on
press freedom" and threatened to take legal action against the BND.

The Afghan government was shocked by the case. "I am appalled and disgusted
by these methods, which have no place in a constitutional state," commented
Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta. German Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called his Afghan counterpart to apologize for
the monitoring operation. The German Foreign Ministry said Steinmeier would
also contact Farhang to express his regrets personally.

This espionage action is not the first for the BND in relation to
journalists. In 2006 it came out that German reporters were placed under
surveillance by the intelligence agents to find out sources of leaks from
the BND. As a result of the big scandal the followed this discovery, the BND
president was changed. Ernst Uhrlau, the new president, had pledged to make
the service more transparent.

"It hasn't even been three years since the BND's last scandal, over
systematic domestic spying on journalists. (That scandal) led to an
internal directive forbidding surveillance of reporters. The directive is
still in force, according to the BND. But we now know that only a short
while later, in June 2006, a new half-year bugging operation was mounted
against a German journalist - this time in Afghanistan. There are hints
that she was not the only one" wrote Die Tageszeitung.

It appears Uhrlau will keep his job although he seems to have lost control
over some of the agents and had failed to inform the Chancellery, which is
responsible for supervising the BND's activities.
However, a draft law would be drawn in the coming months to give the
Parliament powers to monitor the agency, as stated Hans-Peter Uhl, a deputy
from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party.

8. IFPI continues to pressure ISPs to act as Internet police
============================================================

Despite the criticism and negative reaction of the ISPs in several
countries, IFPI continues to pressures them in turning themselves into
Internet police. Following Denmark, Norway and Ireland, it is the turn of
the Swedish ISPs to be the target of the association.

What IFPI asks is for ISPs to restrict their customers' access to websites
allegedly facilitating copyright infringement. As until now it had little
success in its discussions with the ISPs, IFPI has decided to use legal
pressure. "We believe that ISPs have a special part to play in this and must
help us. The discussions we've tried to have with the ISPs haven't led
anywhere" said IFPI's Managing Director in Sweden, Lars Gustafsson.

According to Gustaffson, the focus will be on one particular company that
allegedly facilitates filesharing on the Internet and one of the services
they are after is The PirateBay. IFPI has already sent out letters to
several service providers, asking them to monitor their customers and to
filter websites.

However, most ISPs have refused to cooperate with the IFPI. Telia Sonera, a
large Swedish ISP considered such actions are illegal under EU law and
Norwegian ISPs had the same response.

IFPI argue that restricting access to filesharing sites might be to the
advantage of ISPs. "Illegal P2P file-sharing may have helped drive broadband
subscriptions in the past, yet today these activities, particularly in
respect of movies, are hogging bandwidth," they state.

Until now, IFPI obtained a victory in February in Denmark when Tele2 was
order by the court to block its customers' access to The PirateBay but
the decision is now under appeal and the PirateBay has announced its
intention to ask for compensation.
