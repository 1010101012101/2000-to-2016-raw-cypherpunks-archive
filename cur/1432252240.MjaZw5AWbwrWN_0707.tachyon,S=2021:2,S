This doesn't fit Joe Lunchbox's current model in which he dumps his
outgoing mail onto his provider's server and turns off his machine.
His provider either has to deliver synchronously and bounce the
computational payment burden back to Joe, pay it for him, or bounce
the message.  In the latter case, the receiver who demanded cycles
needs to recognize the problem it set and accept the answer on a
later date.
