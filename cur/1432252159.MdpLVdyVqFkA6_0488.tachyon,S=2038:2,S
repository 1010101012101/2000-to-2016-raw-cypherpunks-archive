You're forgetting the many anonymous tipsters, including his neighbors
(at least one in the pay of the Feds, I recall) who reported on
Hawash. One alleged he was wearing "eastern" garb and had let his beard
grow after 9-11. Other evidence included one of the "Portland Six" having
Hawash's telephone number written on a business card or something similar.
