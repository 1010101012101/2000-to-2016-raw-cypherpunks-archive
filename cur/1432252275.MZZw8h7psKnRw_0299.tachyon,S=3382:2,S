Posters to the cypherpunks list can be divided into those agitating on behalf
of the united states federal government and others. Isn't attempting to turn
people in a group against each other about the oldest trick in the book?
Hopelessly transparent. Back to the drawing board, eh?

Everyone here is perfectly capable of deciding who they find worth reading and
who they don't. I'll bet you'll have a hard time getting anyone to take this
kind of divisive playground squabbling seriously. But if it makes you feel
better to "get revenge" on people who somehow pissed you off, well, knock
yourself out. Harmless enough, though not exactly what most people would find a
fascinating and brilliant contribution to the forum. Here's a thought: quit
bitching about everyone else's lousy posts and start adding some serious value
of your own. If you're up to it, that is. Couldn't hurt to try!
