Here's another meme on the issue:

>U.S. Unloading WMD in Iraq
>
>TEHRAN (Mehr News Agency) - Over the past few days, in the wake of the
>bombings in Karbala and the ideological disputes that delayed the signing
>of Iraq's interim constitution, there have been reports that U.S. forces
>have unloaded a large cargo of parts for constructing long-range missiles
>and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the southern ports of Iraq.
>
>A reliable source from the Iraqi Governing Council, speaking on condition
>of anonymity, told the Mehr News Agency that U.S. forces, with the help
>of British forces stationed in southern Iraq, had made extensive efforts
>to conceal their actions.

>He added that the cargo was unloaded during the night as attention was
>still focused on the aftermath of the deadly bombings in Karbala and the
>signing of Iraq's interim constitution.
>
>The source said that in order to avoid suspicion, ordinary cargo ships
>were used to download the cargo, which consisted of weapons produced in
>the 1980s and 1990s.
>
>He mentioned the fact that the United States had facilitated Iraq's WMD
>program during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq and said that some of the weapons
>being downloaded are similar to those weapons, although international
>inspectors had announced Saddam Hussein's Baath regime had destroyed all
>its WMD.
>
>The source went on to say that the rest of the weapons were probably  
>transferred in vans to an unknown location somewhere in the vicinity of  
>Basra overnight.

>"Most of these weapons are of Eastern European origin and some parts are
>from the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The U.S. obtained them

>This action comes as certain U.S. and Western officials have been

>In addition, former chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix has emphasized

>A security official for the coalition forces in Iraq said that he has not

>Shane Wolf told the Mehr News Agency that the occupation forces have

>Coalition forces and inspectors have so far been unable to find any Iraqi
