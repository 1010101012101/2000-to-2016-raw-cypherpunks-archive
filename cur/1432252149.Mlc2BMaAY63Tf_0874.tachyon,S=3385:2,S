Why are you propagating this nonsense? You're turning into the new Choate,
the new Hettinga, the new troll zoo-keeper. People interested in remailers
are already on those lists, and I guarantee you that they aren't
interested in that drama. It isn't anything new. If you've been around
more than a few weeks on alt.security.anon-server, you know about it. The
only "unfolding" is that it has finally bleed over onto the remops list --
and now, thanks to you, the cypherpunks list.

Ninny.
