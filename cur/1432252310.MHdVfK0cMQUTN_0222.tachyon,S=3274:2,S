Oh, well that might have a little something to do with the fact that I 
never made the point that brute-forcing keys was the way big and powerful 
NSA computers are going to blow our house down, mightn't it.  The fact 
that "brute-forcing keys" was the only thing you could think of when you 
saw my phrase "interesting possibilities for cryptographic applications" 
and then chose to fixate on proving what a damn poopy head whippersnapper I 
am instead of deigning to bother over what methods I meant to refer to is 
indicative of your own limitations, not mine.
