Glowing Quotes
==============

bAbsolutely, I've been very impressed with Tahoe-LAFS, both the

it just yesterday). It's fast, reliable, and has been making steady
progress.b b Mourad De Clerck

Keepalives
- ----------

erpo41 asked for `information regarding Tahoe-LAFS' use of keepalives`_
over their TCP connections.  Brian Warner |warner| pointed out
Tahoe-LAFS sends a keepalive packet once every eight (8) minutes.  This
setting is configurable via "timeout.keepalive" as noted in
"docs/configuration.rst".

Switching from Introducers to Gossip
- ------------------------------------

Brian `proposes switching from introducers to gossip`_.  Brian's idea is
for all nodes to offer a "grid-control" service.  "grid-control" allows
you to publish Announcements, either your own or ones you are forwarding
for someone one else.  Brian proposes several approaches to this
concept:

* fully-connected mesh: every node makes a Foolscap connection to every
  grid-control provider they hear about, subscribe to hear about all
  announcements, and publish any announcements that the other side
  doesn't already know about.
* opportunistic: clients only connect to storage servers, and storage
  servers don't make outbound connections to anybody, but if you *do*
  happen to be connected to someone who also offers "grid-control", then
  connect to their grid-control object too and exchange Announcements
* cluster-of-Introducers: normal nodes don't offer grid-control, but
  multiple Introducers do, and all of them know about each other. All
  nodes connect to all grid-control providers (which means all
  Introducers).
* one Introducer: this is just a degenerate cluster-of-Introducers

grid-updates
- ------------

darrob `announced the release of grid-updates 1.1.3`_.  grid-updates is
Tahoe-LAFS helper program.  Originally a shell script, darrob rewrote
the program in Python, so it runs on all platforms supported by
Tahoe-LAFS.  grid-updates helps manage volunteer grids.  It's core
feature is downloading and uploading the node's introducer list and has
a new feature of downloading lists for shares and repairing them.
darrob is testing the program against 1.9.2a1.  The program is packaged
for Windows, Arch and Debian.

Patches Needing Review of the Week
==================================

There is one (1) ticket still needing review for 1.9.2:

* `#1778`_: increase maximum mutable share size

There are six (6) ticket still needing review for 1.10.0:

* `#1777`_: cleanups to tests and mutables for 1.10
* `#166`_: command line order is problematic
* `#937`_: 'tahoe run' doesn't work for an introducer node
* `#1539`_: stop putting pkg_resources.require() into .tac files
* `#1159`_: stop using .tac files: make it possible to change appname,
  Python package-directory name, perhaps other names
* `#1693`_: flogtool doesn't get automatically provided

There are two (2) tickets still needing review of 1.11.0:

* `#1265`_: New Visualizer is insufficiently labelled/documented (plus
  layout problem)
* `#1382`_: immutable peer selection refactoring and enhancements
