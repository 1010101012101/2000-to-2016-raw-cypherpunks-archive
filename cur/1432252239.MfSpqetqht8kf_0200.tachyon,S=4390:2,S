That's the claimed design, yes.  I see no particular reason to believe
that the hardware in my server implements the design.  I can't even test
that the AES whitening does what it is documented to do, because Intel
refused to provide access to the prewhitened input.

Providing accessible "test points" (software interfaces to the innards
of the implementation, with documentation of expected behavior between
the components) would be the absolute minimum to provide believable
assurance of the absence of a backdoor.  Better would be documents from
Intel of how the chip is designed at the mask level, and a third party
mill-and-microphotograph of a retail chip showing that the shipped
implementation matches the design.

Intel will never go for that, of course, since their chip masks are
their jealously guarded IP.  Since they can't provide evidence of a lack
of a backdoor, any reasonably cautious user should avoid depending on
Intel's implementation.
