Not enough information.

Please clarify the following ambiguities:

	What kind of an apple is it?
 
	Is she a witch?  Magic scares me.

	Is the woman a het, or a mongoose bull-dyke?

	Whose definition of beautiful are we using here, anyways?

	Why would I be walking through the woods alone?

Assuming a spherical woman...
