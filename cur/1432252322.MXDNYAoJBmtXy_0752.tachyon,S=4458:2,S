The majority of Internet users in Mainland China spend 100% of their online
time on Chinese websites. Google+, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Blogspot and
many more (see https://en.greatfire.org) are completely blocked in Mainland
China. Most other foreign websites are both considerably slower than
domestic ones, and subject to keyword-based blocking of certain URLs.

The majority of Internet users outside Mainland China spend 0% of their
online time on Chinese websites. This is not just a language issue - there
are a lot of Chinese-speaking people outside of Mainland China, and several
Chinese websites have English-language interfaces. It's also because they
are slow. The Great Firewall slows down traffic in both directions. Concern
with censorship may also discourage some users, as seen recently regarding
WeChat.

In this sense, there is a Chinese Internet or a Chinanet, as opposed to the
rest of the Internet. They are not completely cut off from each other, but
in practice there is little communication between the two. Unfortunately.
