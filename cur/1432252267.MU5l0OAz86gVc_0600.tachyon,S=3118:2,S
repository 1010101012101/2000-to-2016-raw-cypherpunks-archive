It looks like Palladium (or whatever it's called this week) is of concern not
just to individuals but to governments as well (the following text forwarded
from elsewhere):

-- Snip --

  Governments would want to explore the implications of the use and
retention of government-held information and use of software for government
business.
  More particularly, governments are likely to want to explore the issues
related to potential foreign control/influence over domestic governmental
use/access to domestic government held data.
  In other words, what are the practical and policy implications for a
government if a party external to the government may have the potential
power to turn off our access to its own information and that of its
citizens.

-- Snip --

Unlike China, not everyone can address this problem by building their own
systems from the silicon on up.

Peter.
