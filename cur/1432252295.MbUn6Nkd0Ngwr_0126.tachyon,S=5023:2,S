Oops, you are correct.  The AN are the defendants, the occupants of the
vehicle that backfired are the plaintiffs.  Brainfart.

You assume they should act, think rationally, by your definition of the word.

Aye, noted.  Please take note of the US Army response to sudden machinegun 
fire from a bunker, and the US Marine response to it.  Marines have a lower 
life-expectancy in the field for a damn good reason, and while I have no 
way of knowing what prior .mil experience any of those AN members might 
have, I'm not about to assume they would not go charging after a vehicle, 
guns blazing, should they think the occupants of that vehicle had been 
shooting at them.
