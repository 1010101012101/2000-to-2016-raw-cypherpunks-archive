A naive definition.

"Ruined" has connotations which have nothing to do with percentage 
losses. Does a Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy face "ruin" because 
his stock is worth $500 M instead of $10 B?

How about the guy who has come to Cypherpunks meetings whose stock 
holdings at one point were $749 million, but whose holdings are now 
about $25 million?

(These are far, far greater losses than the "66%" threshold, and yet 
these people are not "ruined.")

Now if one is heavily margined, and a stock drop triggers margin 
calls, resulting in liquidation of all positions, negative net worth, 
etc., then perhaps "ruin" is a good word.

And why do you think Cypherpunks, who generally pay lip service to 
privacy issues, would reveal their financial situation to you, or to 
the list?
