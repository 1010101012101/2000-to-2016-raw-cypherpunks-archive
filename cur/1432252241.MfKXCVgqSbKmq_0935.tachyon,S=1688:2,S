The figure that's usually quoted is that 80% of German's military force was
directed against Russia.  Of the remaining 20%, a lot had already been engaged
by France, the UK (via the BEF, the RAF, North Africa), Greece, etc etc before
the US got involved in Europe.  So the Russians should get most of the credit.
