Are you being deliberately dense? The facts that he's using a remailer and
has most uncypherpunk-like notions are alone insufficient to trip the
suspicion circuit. But his insinuations are unusually good, and hence I'd
like to know who he is. 

If deep paranoia cryptoanarchy freaks can be made to endorse TCPA/Pd crap
that's sufficient motivation for a troll.

The style is consistent, and he hasn't called a forgery yet.
