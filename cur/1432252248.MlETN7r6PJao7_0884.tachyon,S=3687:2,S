The ADA does not require writers, whether lawyers or novelists or 
whatever, to write their material in ways that the blind can read, 
that retarded persons can understand, or that the Java-less can 
process.

(Though I admit that many of these rent-seeking vipers would of 
course _like_ the ADA to be extended to cover such things, if only to 
increase the rent they can collect in thousands of lawsuits.)
