I don't think you understand how bearer credentials would work.

With blinded bearer credentials, prosecutors wouldn't have much of a leg to
stand on, since the authenticator is only validating the *existence*, or
not, of a blinded age credential. With bearer credentials, authenticated in
exchange, of course, for cash :-), the authenticator of those credentials
has no idea *who* is asking for that proof of age.

There's no direct sales contact with any particular content vendor.
Validation of age would probably be done in somekind of graded auction
market, anyway.

It would be interesting to see this tested in court. There is sizeable
legal precedent for the issuers of bearer cash, say a nation-state, not
being held liable for purchases using that cash. The same could be said for
issuers of bearer credentials.

Cheers,
