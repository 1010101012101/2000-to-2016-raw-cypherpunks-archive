Absent any real data, crypto-dogma :-) says that you need
hardware-encryption, physical sources of randomness, and all sorts of other
stuff to really solve this problem.

On the other hand, such hardware solutions usually come hand-in-hand with
the whole hierarchical is-a-person "PKI" book-entry-to-the-display
I-gotcher-"digital-rights"-right-here-buddy mess, ala Palladium, etc.

Like SSL, then -- and barring the usual genius out there who flips the
whole tortoise over to kill it, which is what you're really asking here --
this thing might work good enough to keep Microsoft/Verisign/et al. in
business a few more years.

To the rubes and newbs, it's like Microsoft adopting TLS, or Intel doing
their current crypto/DRM stuff, which, given the amount iPod/iTunes writes
to their bottom line now, is apparently why Apple really switched from PPC
to Intel now instead of later. You know they're going to do evil, but at
least the *other* malware goes away.

So, sure. SSL to the keys. That way Lotus *still* won't run, and business
gets  done in Redmond a little while longer.
