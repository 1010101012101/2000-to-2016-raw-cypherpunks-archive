 >>Not to put too fine a point on it, but why are you posting 10 year old

far more useful. Ken.<<

Interpol stole my Dell,I believe they are using it to run a CoinTelPro 
style operation on cypherpunks.I am posting this from
an internet cafe at "eMails that cross themselves in the night"...when the 
Ice Weasels cum all over Lance Cotrelll (If that is his *real* misspeled 
name...)
I'd like to thank everybody for all those wonderfully supportive
eMails that they wrote me--and then thought better of it and
deleted them and reformatted their hard drive...3 times...
