I wonder what the destructive mechanism is for this system?  Heat by 
radiant absorption seems an obvious but impractical method.  If it is, then 
as the article mentions there may be some inexpensive and practical 
countermeasures to such a system, such as making the exterior of the 
missile body into a multi-faceted mirror able to reflect both IR and radar 
energy (although doing the same for the nose cone might prove more 
difficult due to aerodynamics).
