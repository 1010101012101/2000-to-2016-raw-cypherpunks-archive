Pentagon Seeks Source of  Photos

                         By PAULINE JELINEK
                         Associated Press Writer

                         WASHINGTON (AP)--The Pentagon was
                         investigating Friday to find out who took and
                         released photographs of terror suspects as
                         they were being transported in heavy
                         restraints aboard a U.S. military plane.

                         Four photographs of prisoners--handcuffed,
                         heads covered with black hoods and bound
                         with straps on the floor of a plane _ appeared
                         overnight on the Web site of radio talk show
host Art Bell.

                         ``Anonymous mailer sends us photos taken inside
a military C-130 transporting
                         POWS,'' the headline said.
