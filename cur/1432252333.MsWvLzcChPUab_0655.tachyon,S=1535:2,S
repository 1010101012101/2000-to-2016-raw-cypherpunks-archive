Not when it pretends to be a new and wonderful idea, and ignores its past.

Sort of like Apple announcing the world's first 64 bit desktop computer 
when many of us have had DEC Alpha's and UltraSPARC machines on our desks 
since the early/mid 90's -- for example.  (And then it turns out, they 
don't even have a 64 bit OS for it yet!)
