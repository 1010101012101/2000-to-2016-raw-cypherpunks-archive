I was just looking at the official rules for Pepsi's latest sweepstakes
and noticed the fine print about attending the prize drawing contains the
following...

Credit card required for hotel check in.
Government issued photo-id required for air travel.

It's amazing how rapidly the new way of doing things gets assimilated into 
the popular culture, as if these things are perfectly reasonable and it's 
always been that way.

P.S. Whatever became of John Gilmore's lawsuit?
