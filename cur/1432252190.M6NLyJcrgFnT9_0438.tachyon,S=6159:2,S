If you look at the Reuters image of Carlo holding the fire extinguisher, 
he's holding it below head-level. In my opinion, that leaves three options: 
Carlo was going to chuck the extinguisher underhand (and sideways to the 
vehicle, so it would've bounced off) at a low velocity, or Carlo was 
holding the fire extinguisher out in front of him as DEFENSE, or he was 
merely holding a fire extinguisher. It's not clear how much time elapsed 
between the picture of Carlo alive, and the next image, which is him lying 
on the ground with his brains all over the ground. However, the gun is can 
be seen and it's pointed at his head, so I assume it wasn't very long.
There's an image of Carlo under the land rover, with the cop who shot him 
covering or wiping his face. Neither man in the jeep were wearing gas masks 
with face shields, but every other carabinieri member seen in the series is 
wearing them.
The other thing that may not have been mentioned is that there were 
Carabinieri within 30 feet of the land rover, and that Carlo was in the 
Green Zone, supposedly the safe area for protests. There are pictures of 
about 10 fellow members of law enforcement a short distance away, including 
one with both hands on his forehead area. He appears anguished.
There's an image of Carlo under the land rover, with the cop who shot him 
covering or wiping his face.
there's a PDF on indymedia.org with the pictures i'm talking about at 
http://italia.indymedia.org/local/webcast/uploads/carlo-photofile.pdf. Most 
of this analysis is paraphrased from the pdf, but it seems reasonable.
this may be a repeat of the powerpoint presentation post, but it's more 
cross-platform.
