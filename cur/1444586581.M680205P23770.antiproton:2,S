I truly don't know.  I don't have any more info than anyone else, I was 
just musing about how it could have happened.  Obviously, hearing  JY's 
explanation would be the best thing.

Also agree re: the /var/log issue, but I get the impression that the 
restored files weren't kept in the normal file tree structure.  Again, I 
simply don't know and I'm not trying to be an overt JY apologist - I'm just 
saying sometimes, shit happens.  It would help if he would weigh in instead 
of having dorks like me positing hypotheticals.
