Almost true but not the complete story. While the provincially (state) 
owned utility BC Hydro owns most of the capacity there is an entity 
called East Kootenay Power which services a portion of the 
province (state).

Unfortunately the politicians still control the power business in BC 
and have done everything in their power to discourage co-
generation and other alternative suppliers.  Fortunately there is no 
shortage of supply.
