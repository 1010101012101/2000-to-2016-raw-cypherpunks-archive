As most of you know, the RSA patent expires next week (that they issued 
a press release waiving some rights early notwithstanding).  We've been 
waiting a *long* time for this, and now we're throwing a long-anticipated 
party to celebrate!

This is a benefit for the CryptoRights Foundation, which, among other 
things, promotes the use of cryptography by Human Rights workers in 
"less-friendly" countries in order to protect both the workers and the 
people they're trying to interview and help.  [If you've never heard a talk 
by one of these people who goes to train said human rights workers in the 
use of crypto and steganography, you should get someone to tell you about 
it; it's not otherwise obvious how related the fields are, and it's 
extremely enlightening.]

There will be no charge at the door, but t-shirts and stuff will be 
available to buy.  You need to reserve (free) tickets in advance, though,
which can be had by emailing <rsa-patent-benefit@cryptorights.org>.

Below is the full announcement.  Corporate stuff starts at 8, music starts 
at 10.  Let people know about this, and I hope to see you there!

   - Ian
