I am working on negotiating a licensing agreement for a large piece of 
software that contains a cryptographic component. I am trying to 
negotiate a warranty term that favors us in the event that the 
algorithm or implementation should prove insecure. Ideally I would like 
1) disclosure of the algorithm and 2) a representation that 
cryptographic experts consider the algorithm is considered secure or at 
least appropriate to the use being made of it.

Has anybody ever negotiated something like this with a software vendor? 
Can anyone produce sample language from a licensing agreement? Is there 
a better place I can ask this question? ("get a lawyer" is not a 
helpful response. IAAL). Thanks for your help
