You are confusing a firewall with a protocol like IPsec that
provides authentication and replay resistance (using crypto).
A firewall is just a packet filter --if this field is that, do this.

(Steve Bellovin has an online book about them you might enjoy.)
Sometimes they're clever and look inside
the streams, but this won't resist the attacks you're talking about.
Various components of IPsec will.  Read up on how it does that.
