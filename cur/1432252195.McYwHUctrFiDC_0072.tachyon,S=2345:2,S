Wouldn't work for me. For one thing, I'm a programmer; as John Kozubik 
noted, identifiers in code look a lot like random strings. For another, 
I routinely receive email in non-English languages. Not only European 
languages, which probably have characteristics close enough to English 
to do matching, but also in Chinese and Korean. And Lojban, too, which 
itself looks an awful lot like random strings. (And getting legit mail 
from .cn and .kr prevents me from just blocking the entire TLDs of 
those national spam factories. My life sucks.)
