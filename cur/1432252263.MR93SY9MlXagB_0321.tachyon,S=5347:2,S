More to the point, such systems provide the imprecision and convenience which
some rigid and domineering minds need in order to impose their more subtle
and complex belief systems on others.

Only by convention.

Which are only useful if they are used as creative alternatives instead of
forms within which convenient and common ideas can be re-expressed.

Beware of false dictionaries and lexicons.

Intellectual freedom and speech is only as good as the persons who excercise
it -- and in this culture, it is mediocre at best.

But of course for effect the statesman's sage utterings are unequalled.
