I'll bet good money that Washington is leaning on L.A. to drop this 
ridiculous claim.

For several decades the U.S. (and presumably Russia/FSU) has 
convinced the nations of the world that fees need not be paid to 
India, Botswana, and Shakedownistan just because U.S. satellites pass 
overhead. If L.A. is able to shake down Hughes for some tax to be 
distributed to the welfare bums and crack hoes, then Botswana and 
Shakedownistan will be next in line.
