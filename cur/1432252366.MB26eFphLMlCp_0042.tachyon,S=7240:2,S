	Scattering is not reflection. In fact, photons do lose energy
scattering and the first experiments that demonstrated this is where
scattering gets its name: Compton scattering. The compton scattering
formula is easily derived from conservation of 4-momentum. Reflection
from a mirror is easily described by maxwell's equations, but is more
difficult in terms of photons. While the description of the photoelectric
effect is more or less ok, the term "thermalize" means applies to 
contimuum scattering of electrons in the conduction band through collisions
with other electrons, not to discrete transitions. Describing a reflection
as scattering can be done, but not in the length of this response.

	Let me suggest that everyone defer to "Classical Electrodynamics" 
by Jackson, as a definitive reference. It's the canonical physics text on
the subject and is practically universal as the text for a first year
graduate course in any physics program. If you know anyone that's
a physicist, they should have a copy.

	This mixes terminology in a bad way. First of all, any _SINGLE_ photon
scattering from a surface will be scattered in an arbitrary direction with
the appropriate change in energy. A _reflection_ is the collective behaviour
of photons with particular energies that particular interact with the
conduction electrons in a way which is easy to describe with maxwell's
equatiions, but not very easy to describe photon by photon, since from a
miscroscopic view, reflection is a statisitical phenomena. For example,
gold which is fairly thin, will be transparent in the UV, not reflective.

	The energy radiated from a resistor is no different than the
energy radiated from a blackbody, except perhaps in how ideal it
is.

	Currents don't emit photons. Accelerated charges do.

	If free charges behaved this way (i.e., had memories of what changed
their momenta), it would violate both relativity and quantum mechanics.
A charge is at rest in its own rest frame before the absorption and
after the absorption. How would it retain any knowledge of its previous
state without (hint) communicating with neighboring charges?

	The number of photons is irrelavent, since you cannot count them
by virtue of the uncertainty principle between the number of photons
and the phases. The ones you count are the properly symmetrized linear
combination that produces the signal in the detector and that is always
equivalent to a single photon. So the above statement is meaningless.

	They are identical. Or not. Depends on how you write the wavefunctions
in any of an infinite number of equivalent ways. See bose-einstein
statistics.

	This is closer to correct, but still doesn't contain the idea that
it's meaningless to talk in terms of photon numbers except in a very
specific context where one recognizes the limitations and applicability
of the picture.
