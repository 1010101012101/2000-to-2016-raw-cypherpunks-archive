there are a lot of possibilities, siteswap notation is one of these
though i never figured it out in terms of practical use, though for
those exploring and searching out new patterns it apparently
provides a mathematical framework for what could be possible


juggling is a very interesting realm to investigate for many reasons,
one of which is its looping patterns which can be changed during
the pattern itself, perhaps this a form of processing, grammar, or
syntax of some kind. likewise, color can be used to outline or to
provide additional correlations, say if a ball is being sent back &
forth over the top (think this is 'rainbow' pattern), if it is different
color than the other two balls it can help see the dynamics in
a way that same-colored juggling equipment cannot. my view
is that much could be communicated this way via LED balls
and clubs though my skills are extremely limited in this realm
whereas others excel at juggling and could explore ideas fully

i think PS4 and X-Box360 with tracking cameras would be ideal
platforms with RFID juggling balls to teach people how to juggle
via step-by-step instruction. the book Art of Juggling is a guide
for this, though also involves a philosophy of learning via juggling
which i think is most accurate about its underlying, hidden value
as a way of 'learning from mistakes' and incrementally achieving
what can be very difficult goals through trial & error and practice

it also reprograms the nervous system via ambidextrous action
of both side of the brain and nervous system and thus rewires
circuitry which can help dealing with stroke or other issues,
including coordination, memory loss; challenges, optimizes

my research interest is in the relation of juggling and music
as a way of approaching music from a different perspective,
under the assumption anyone can play a musical instrument,
if using a similar pattern based approach for exploring music,
start simple and then modify and further develop patterns,
which is how juggling works, first one ball, then two, then
three, then four... (that is my limit now, three clubs also)

Codes and Clowns: Claude Shannon the juggling scientist

also, juggling patterns could be a basis for establishing a
model for heuristic evaluation of looping hypotheses where
constellations of patterns move through a context and may
alter or change its functioning, transform the looping model
and thus what the parameters, boundaries, rules could be
if considering this in terms of N-patterns being juggled

(then likewise, what if a four or five ball pattern looks like
a three ball pattern from within a certain boundary, etc)
