As for fakes, I'm not so sure this will be a big problem. In any crowd 
there's bound to be several people with cameraphones. I suspect we'll 
collectively develop a built-in scepticism, and wait and see if the other 
recorded versions corroborate the initial 'scandal'. So a fake might not 
have particularly good legs if it's followed immediately by a batch of 
different-angled non-fake recordings of the same event.

>This November, comedian Michael Richards learned about the participatory

>The participatory panopticon is the emerging scenario of distributed

>What all three of the examples I cite at the beginning of this piece have 
>in
>common is that they were recordings of events that (a) the perpetrators
>would, in retrospect, probably wish to have done differently, if at all, 
>and
>(b) would have received little notice in the era before personal networked
>cameras and video-sharing websites. Certainly there may have been rumors
>that a comedian had "gone nuts" on stage, or that UCLA cops had beaten a
>student, but as rumors, they'd have a limited life-span, and would soon be
>forgotten. Because of the participatory panopticon, however, these events
>will for a very long time shape how many of us think about these people.
>
>The participatory panopticon is not going to go away any time soon. The
>publicity associated with the Richards and UCLA cases -- and the political
>impact of the George Allen "macaca" incident -- virtually guarantees that
>more citizens will have cameraphones at the ready to capture and share
>damning evidence of the misbehavior of officials and celebrities. So what
>will the participatory panopticon explosion look like?

>Mass Participation: The next time we see a cameraphone-recorded, newsworthy
>event, chances are we'll have multiple perspectives on it, each video
>providing additional context and evidence. On balance, this will be useful,
>as a typical response by those caught on video is that the recording misses

>Self-recording for self-defense: A key lesson from the 2004 presidential
>campaign in the US was that it's vitally important for protestors to make
>their own (multiple) video recordings of protests and arrests. The NY

>videotaped protestors, but apparently edited the recordings later on to
>justify the arrests -- edits that were exposed by comparisons to the
>protestor videos. If the UCLA cops that beat the kid in the library last

>Self-recording for self-defense won't be much help if the individual does,

>David Brin refers to this as "reciprocal accountability," a phrase I
