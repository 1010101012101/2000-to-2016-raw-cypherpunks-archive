Great howto!

We've been discussing a "safest" setup for hidden service a while ago.
Unfortunately the forum is not in English, so I sum it up shortly:

- it's very similar to your setup, two VMs:
  - VM1 for Tor
  - VM2 for http server and database, host-only networking!
- harden installation with SELinux, grsecurity or AppArmor
- absolutely no php (really bad track record with php apps and language itself)
- nginx/lighttpd/thttpd instead of Apache (smaller code, smaller chance of bugs)

SELinux is for example by default part of RHEL and clones (CentOS, Scientific
Linux). By default only targeted policy is turned on, but you can turn on full
enforcing. AppArmor is in Ubuntu AFAIK.


A more advanced guide for hidden service on hardened Gentoo server (this will
take a bit time to set up, depends on what your threat model is):

- use hardened Gentoo profile
- enable grsecurity in kernel
- make a monolithic kernel, disable module support
- turn on all possible grsecurity features (except RBAC)
- install only necessary software (like webserver and DB), turn off all USE
flags you won't need
- compile everything as position-independent shared object (see -fPIC, -fPIE gcc
options)


Addendum for truly "uberparanoid" installation:

- on VM1, limit new outgoing connections to Tor node IPs, this will need some
script or using NFQUEUE in iptables since the IPs change (enable other IPs
temporarily when doing update)
- on VM1, install unbound locally, tunnel it through Tor with socat to some
recursive DNSSEC-aware resolver, make unbound default resolver in
/etc/resolv.conf "nameserver 127.0.0.1" (do we need DNS at all here?)
- turn on grsecurity's RBAC (role-based access control), this will be pain to
set up the rules for software, but grsecurity has a learning tool that will
greatly assist in generating them by observing the app

With the uberparanoid installation, the greatest risk is a return-to-libc-style
attack on Tor where attacker instructs Tor to make circuit to a node controlled
by attacker, thus revealing IP.
