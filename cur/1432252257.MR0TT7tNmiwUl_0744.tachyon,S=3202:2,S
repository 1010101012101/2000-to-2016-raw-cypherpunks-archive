And a means to verify the sign-off message is from Eric 
Cordian and not an MTM.

The Cordian persona is likely to be hijacked by the other 
alleged disputant or a party out to demolish the Cordian
anonymity.

Persistent identity is hard to prove especially for pseudo
but now that manufactured identities are commonplace
even encouraged to conceal real ones, it is increasingly
difficult to confirm who is who, perhaps impossible.

Which points to the impact on modern culture of the 
humongous growth of spies in the 20th century and thereafter, 
in which lying and deception and secrets withheld from the 
public are official policy of governments worldwide -- 
democratic as well as authoritarian, same same urgent
protection of the state especially from insider citizenry.

Commercial secrets are trivial by comparison to theft of
public authority by the spooks by way of the power of secrecy
and those who are induced to give them power to deceive and
withhold information about government operations without 
effective oversight and accountability.

The US Comptroller General spoke a few weeks ago about the
decline in government accountability and diminished service
to the public by elected officials since the nation was founded.
Original part-time office holders have been replaced by
full-time professionals with a decline in concern for the
public and rise in officials' self-interest. He said it is no 
longer possible to audit the Defense Department, and 
the spooks which constantly raise alarms to justify vast
defense spending, due to national security-overwrought
secrecy.

That citizens have to hide from government surveillance
is a consequence of unquestioned faith in the need for
national spying, a circular justification, and not unlike
how all tyrants hold power, whether political or theocratic.

Fundamentalist faith in the need for national security is
conspiracy mongering like that the US accuses its enemies of.

That the secretkeepers have so much to hide must mean they
are engaged in criminal activites, omerta.
