	It certainly is 'technical', pretty basic, and you must be
	as aware of this just as I am, so I don't understand why you
	want me to repeat it. Trolling? Bah.

	But here it goes again! Pay fucking attention.

	The US military is a 'global adversary' - they have enough taps
	on cables, exchanges, ASs, whatever, to be able to deanonimize
	tor users. Especially so called 'hidden' services. 

	
	On the other hand, people like, say, Ross Ulbricht, don't have
	taps on the global fiber infrastructure, don't have access to
	IXPs, can't hack routers, etc. Get that? 

	Furthermore the only psychos who have that level of access to
	the 'infrastructure' are the syverson psychos, the US military. 
	
	The US military can spy on all the planet - no other national
	government can do that. That why they can safely use tor, and
	no one else can.

	No fallacy. YOU ARE MISAPPLYING THE ARGUMENT.

	They can be OK, and I don't care for any 'general theory' about
	backdoors anyway - I'm just talking about or. 

	The 'backdoor' in tor is simply the fact that the US military
	has sabotaged the internet.

	I don't think they are the dumb ones here...

	Yep. There's nothing surprinsing about that.

	Sorry Mirimir, if you first acknowledge facts, then I might
