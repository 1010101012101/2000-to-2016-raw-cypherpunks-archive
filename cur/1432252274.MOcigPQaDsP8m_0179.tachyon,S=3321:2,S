As a former believer and student of the Bible, I can assure you that 
there is no passage in the Bible that says that Jesus was, will be, our 
should be the *only* person conceived without the benefit of sexual 
intercourse. And what do you think in vitro fertilization is, anyway?

Many / most American Christians stress that they rely on the Bible as 
their one and only source of religious truth.  If so, they have 
absolutely no *religious* basis for objecting to cloning.
