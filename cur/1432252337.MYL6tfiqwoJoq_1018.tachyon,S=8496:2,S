Here, have a read:
https://medium.com/message/81e5f33a24e1

Pay some special attention to this part:

=2D - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=
 - - -

    =E2=80=9CMost of the world does not have install privileges on the =
computer they=20
are using.=E2=80=9D

That is, most people using a computer in the world don=E2=80=99t own th=
e computer they=20
are using. Whether it=E2=80=99s in a cafe, or school, or work, for a hu=
ge portion of=20
the world, installing a desktop application isn=E2=80=99t a straightfor=
ward option.=20
Every week or two, I was being contacted by people desperate for better=
=20
security and privacy options, and I would try to help them. I=E2=80=99d=
 start,=20
=E2=80=9CDownload th=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D and then we=E2=80=99d stop. The =
next thing people would tell me was=20
that they couldn=E2=80=99t install software on their computers. Usually=
 this was=20
because an IT department somewhere was limiting their rights as a part =
of=20
managing a network. These people needed tools that worked with what the=
y had=20
access to, mostly a browser.

So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts,=20
programmers, and so on was this: What=E2=80=99s the best option for peo=
ple who can=E2=80=99t=20
download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: noth=
ing.=20
They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was to=
ld, =E2=80=9Cso=20
they don=E2=80=99t have a false sense of security.=E2=80=9D Since they =
don=E2=80=99t have access to=20
better software, I was told, they shouldn=E2=80=99t do anything that mi=
ght upset the=20
people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organi=
zers,=20
and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporati=
ons and=20
criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they shoul=
d buy=20
themselves computers, I was told.

That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own comput=
er, or=20
literally drop dead. I told people that wasn=E2=80=99t good enough, got=
 vilified in a=20
few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.

Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the=
 same=20
experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations=E2=80=
=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Aeven when=20
people are being hunted by men with guns=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Awhen=
 encryption and security fails,=20
no one stops talking. They just hope they don=E2=80=99t get caught.

    The same human impulse that has kept lotteries alive for thousands =
of=20
years keeps people fighting the man against the long odds. =E2=80=9CMay=

away with it, might as well try!=E2=80=9D
