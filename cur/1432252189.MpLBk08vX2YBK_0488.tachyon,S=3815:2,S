All the liberty that there is in the world today results from the 
Dutch revolt, the Glorious Revolution, and the American 
Revolution.  No oppressive regimes, with the exception of the 
Chinese, were produced by revolution.

Every successful revolution has been a major step forward for 
human liberty (the Russian communist revolution was not a 
revolution, but merely a coup by a little conspiracy.  Same for 
the Sandinista revolution).  Even in revolutions that failed,
like the french, were the old system was swiftly restored by
Napoleon, the power of the old regime was fatally undermined.

The outcome of the recent revolutions in Somalia and Ethiopia may 
be piss poor by Western standards, but compared to the rest of 
Africa they are pretty good, and compared to the previous 
regimes, they are wonderful.
