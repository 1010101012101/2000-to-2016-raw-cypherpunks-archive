The Kabul office of the Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera, the Arab
satellite station that has broadcast two videotapes of Osama bin Laden
denouncing America, was obliterated in US bombing early yesterday morning.
One American bomb fell 20 yards from the office, heavily damaging the
Qatar-based satellite television network's offices before Northern Alliance
forces entered the Afghan capital, network and Pentagon officials said.
