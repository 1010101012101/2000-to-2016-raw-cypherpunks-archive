Freedom means what to you? Getting to vote once every four
or five years on what direction your country is going to
take?

What if freedom means an anarchive un-state?

Being forced to subjugate your views to those of others 
on the basis of your geographical locality, while being 
prevented from gathering with others who may share your 
political views in sufficient numbers such as to be able 
to succesfully secede is not freedom.

What is development? Market liberalisation? Socialism?
Statism or the removal of the state aparatus? 

In statist, capitalist democracy, reduce or increase 
taxes? Remove or increase social welfare and support?
Permit or restrict immigration?

If you are sold on blanket, unqualified terms such as
'freedom', 'development' and 'democracy', and are willing
to accept the empty rhetoric espoused by most politicians
without critical analysis, then you'd probably make a good
subject of the current system. 

Or am I wrong?
