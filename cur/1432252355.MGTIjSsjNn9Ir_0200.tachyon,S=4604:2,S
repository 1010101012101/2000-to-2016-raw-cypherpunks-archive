Eric Murray took my proposal and ran with it, quickly implementing it 
as the "cypherpunks@lne.com" address.

He has said that he is manually "including" various remailers, and 
probably other addresses.

It might be enough for him to include the names outside of the 
address boxes. E.g., "Declan McCullagh," regardless of the 
"declan@well.com" or "agentdeclan@kremvax.org" or whatever.

Of course, if people use different names AND addresses, they are 
indistinguishable from noise.

By the way, subscribing to Eric Murray's cypherpunks@lne.com has cut 
out most of the spam and nearly all of the toad.com traffic. There is 
no significant delay, either. Or to to be more precise, I see my own 
posts about 2 minutes after sending them off. (It's conceivable that 
my own messages loop back to me faster than other messages, but this 
seems an unlikely feature of the mail exploder.)

[Note from Agents in the Northwest: "May just said "exploder." Put 
this in his folder. We may have another Cypherpunk terrorist here."]
