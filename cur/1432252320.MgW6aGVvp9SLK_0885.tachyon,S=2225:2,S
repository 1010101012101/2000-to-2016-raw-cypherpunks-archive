Generally, this would be water and air. If someone pollutes the air 
over their land, that's ok. As soon as the pollution crosses into 
your land, you sue for damages. People are concerned about the 
long term value of their property, so they will have a disincentive
to pollute. 

Not only do you have people holed up in their bunkers, awaiting 
the arrival of the grim crypto-reaper, but everyone has a lawyer or
4 on staff.
