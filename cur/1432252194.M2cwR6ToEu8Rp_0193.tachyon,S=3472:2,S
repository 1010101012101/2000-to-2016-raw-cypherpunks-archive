	 Clever real-world credit card
            thieves apparently have a new high-tech
            tool in their arsenal. A credit card
            terminal maker says it has discovered
            the existence of small, number-stealing
            electronic “bugs.” The devices can be
            secretly placed inside store terminals,
            where they “skim” card numbers with
            each transaction. The bugs are even
            smart enough to trick a terminal into
            “phoning home,” delivering batches of
            stolen numbers to fake credit card
            manufacturing locations. While
            acknowledging the threat may be real,
            Visa International and other terminal
            makers caution that use of the James
            Bond-esque device is hardly
            widespread.
