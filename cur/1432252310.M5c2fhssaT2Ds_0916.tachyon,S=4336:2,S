Rough week for the underground!

Utopia has been seized by the Dutch police, BMR forums got seized by the
Iranian police (anybody want to take any guesses at that one?), and now
Silk Road 2.0 has been owned/possibly scammed everybody. I guess TMP will
take the crown now, but for how long?

I'm honestly not optimistic about the continued operation of _any_ service
if Tor hidden service operators continue to operate in the manner
instructed by the Tor project. There just isn't enough redundancy, servers
need to be located in multiple regions simultaneously.

We shall see what the future holds.
