Just to make sure...

Can anyonee confirm or deny that this is in line with French policies?

Is this an out-of-band attack on the Tor network? How many French TOR nodes 
are there? Does the elimination of French nodes make traffic analysis far 
easier? France has never been part of Echeleon, has it?

OK, don't get me wrong: This sounds "legit" but you never know.

How many emails with links sent into this list are really just a way to 
phish for IP addresses? (Also, I never click on a link that I can't confirm 
would be known via non-Cypherpunk routes.)
