I saw your silly stalking, your incorrect comments about Krakatoa.

Someday you may learn that content matters more than your "listen up,  
boys and girls" and "milk ran out my nose" sort of patter. Then you may  
find actual economic success, no longer dependent on your wife to  
support you.

Consider that CPUs have gotten 10 times faster than when you started  
yammering about "digital bearer instruments" and general programming  
tools have gotten at least a couple of times better. If you can't  
implement what you have been yammering about with this amount of CPU  
power and tools, but instead think you need to raise $$$$ to hire a few  
programmers and have a company, you are clearly smoking herb.

Haskell running on 4 GHz of processor(s) gives you vastly more power  
than any 10 programmers had several years ago.

Get on with it, or give up. Your nattering about "e$" and "Philodex"  
and "Digital Bearer Instruments" is getting really, really old.
