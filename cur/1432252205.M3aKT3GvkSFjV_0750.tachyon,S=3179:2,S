>> A good plastic (haha) surgeon might be able to implant 10lbs or more,
easily enough to bring down a plane.  Breast implants would be the
obvious place to put it, because they certainly can't open up every
woman who wants to get on a plane with "augmentation" so what can you
do? <<

10 lbs can do a *lot* more than take
down a plane, which is very easy when
its in flight at high altitude.

It takes a few weeks to heal from
abdomen surgery that could be done
in a field hospital.  How to sleep
without rolling over on the lump
which is the activator is the tough
part.

Breasts are amusing locations, but 
Al Q doesn't use chicks (yet) and
its not easy to get them to look right.
(Admittedly, get an ugly chick and
not many will check for symmetry etc.)
