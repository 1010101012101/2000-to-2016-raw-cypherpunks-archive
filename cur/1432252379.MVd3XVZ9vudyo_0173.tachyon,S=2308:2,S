They're not speeding up the search; they're speculatively 
pre-loading whatever the top result is into your browser, 
so if you click on it, that page comes up faster.

Of course, this has potential negatives:

* It increases traffic.
* If you're behind a corporate firewall, it
  logs you as having connected to that site,
  and may raise alerts about your visiting
  of certain sites.
* Content you might not want on your machine
  winds up in the cache. Same for cookies.
* The site *may* turn up in your history
  (I haven't checked this).
* The site logs your IP as having connected.

I've turned this feature off.
