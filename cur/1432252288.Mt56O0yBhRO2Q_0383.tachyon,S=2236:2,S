C O R R E C T I O N

In the section on Swedish complicity, the text of the fourth paragraph reads
"...Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, who was  revealed as a US informant in
a 2007 State Department cable published  by WikiLeaks."
This is an error. The cable referred to is an American diplomatic cable from
1973, not 2007.
