The Anglo-Saxons are really happy to read all this bullshit they themselves
made up about Russia. "Your" thoughts are full of false stamps, lies and
slander over Russia.

And with this kind of slave is really impossible to discuss anything. He
never questions any of his smart ideas. He "knows" and he is "sure" for
1000% in anything he thinks and writes and hears about Russia.

Well, you are just another "punk=E2=80=8B" of the Western-pseudo-mass-media
propaganda machine.

So come on punk, gimme the fight ;]

 Keep on fighting for your masters (even not knowing about them).
