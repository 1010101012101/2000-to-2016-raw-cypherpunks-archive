Jim's home in Vancouver, WA, is on a hill overlooking the 
Oregon border; from his house you can see more of Oregon
than Washington. So going across the border for him must 
have been so common as to be barely unnoticeable as with 
most twin-citizens. 

Not for Jeff's evil-intended eye, and his pea-brain which 
must have gone searching for a statute that perfectly fit 
a borderless prey, waiting for dark night to pounce via
fairly dumb GPS gadget (or maybe a TS "illuminator" that
needed no electronic emission, just a shaped object).

If Mueller in Bend, OR, hadn't been invented by the CIA,
Jeff would have had concoct Jim a cross-border target
himself -- and maybe the Agency did him a favor.

CIA ISTAC is still listed in the .GOV database, the only
"CIA" listing. And a search on "Central Intelligence
Agency" only brings up a busy signal.

In contrast, ARIN offers dozens of listings for 
"Central Intelligence Agency."
