          Now Showing Star
........Directed by: Guy Ritchie
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

The Driver faces perhaps his most perplexing challenge: coming
face-to-face with a hugely talented and successful rock star. But
beneath her beauty lies a problem - she always gets what she wants.
Guy Ritchie directs Clive Owen and a surprise guest star in a battle of
power against power.
