i've been following the development of this skin heating
device for a while, and am keen to learn if there may be
an effective means to counter its use.

the new scientist article suggests that the cornea is not
as resilient as skin when it comes to being bombarded with
microwaves, hence i seek opinions on how one might protect
oneself.

if asking such is inane then i guess i should ask to have
my final request.
