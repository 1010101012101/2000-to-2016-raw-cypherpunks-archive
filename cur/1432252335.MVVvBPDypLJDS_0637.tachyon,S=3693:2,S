What suspension of the Constitution are you talking about?

The only terrorism-related provision in the bill criminalizes willful
[planning of] disruption of free assembly, commerce, transportation,
education, and government.  There's the usual requirement of 2 witnesses
or open court confession.

I agree that the expansion of terrorism laws to cover activity not
linked to the federal notion of "terrorism" is dangerous - those acts
are already illegal - but I don't see how the bill ignores the
Constitution.  It simply adds a duplicate law with a harsher punishment.

The list of 131 crimes identifies those crimes to which Oregon
forfeiture laws apply.  Those 131 (now 132) crimes have nothing to do
with terrorism.
