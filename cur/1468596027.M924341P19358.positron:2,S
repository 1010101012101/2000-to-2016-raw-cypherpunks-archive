As a former labor organizer i know that when you are under a microscope
every personal fault you have will be used against you. If you are a
minute late you will be legally fired. If you take too lake a break you
will be canned.

If you are a political organizer it will be your personal faults that
will be used against you - your excessed with booze or drugs or
inability to control impulses or in this case apparent intoxication with
power in relationships.

I very much enjoyed Jakes presentations but i can see how rock star
status can be too much for some. It's important to stay sober when you
are under the gun.
