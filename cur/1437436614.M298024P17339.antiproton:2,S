Corporations are bound to their economic imperative to make such trade
offs. This is the heart of their sociopathic nature. This is the part
of corporations/ companies which needs, somehow, to change in order to
get this world on a better track.

Here's the kind of talk that looks like a hole freshly dug.

Perhaps if there is an actual existential threat to someone's life or
some building (let's please stop using the T word), then "high
pressure persuasion" would be adequate for a court order anyway. As it
should be - up to the point of a subpoena, summons and/ or order to
perform or act - to handle the actual problem.

You seem though to be normalising behaviours and approaches and "high
pressure persuasion" tactics by government departments, in a
generalised way. You might not be intending the things you imply/ say,
but don't be surprised when such positions are mocked or ridiculed.
Don't take such blow back as personal at all though - it's the
"normalisation of bad" and "plainly wrong/ evil" which is being
attacked for the bullshit it is.

Perhaps try something this instead: "And for-profit therefore
sociopathic-by-nature companies do massively collect your metadata AND
your personal information, with or without your consent, and are well
leaked and reported to use and abuse all your data both within and
beyond the law, beyond your expectations, and beyond what many people
consider ethical."

See what we did there? We made it personal, giving a slight hope to
the uninitiated to realise something they did not realise before. We
highlighted some foundations (for profit being inherently
sociopathic). We reminded the reader that their consent is often not
obtained (yes, we can argue about implied consent, the point is we're
edumacating). We make the assertion that companies actually abuse all
that data (whatever "abuse" might mean), just in case someone missed
the memo.

With all this, we are also implying that this abuse is wrong.

Your version sounds like you are -trying- to normalise the wrong,
justify the bad, and 'accept the new messed up world order as best we
can'. We hear enough of that from others. And I saw NO to that abuse!
Give me justification for abuse, at your peril!

"should be" trustworthy?

They're companies. You've missed the bloody memo. And a very bloody
memo the corporate record is, for decades and across industries!

You're not grokking the incentive. It's profit. And it's more than an
incentive, profit is the foundational company-constitutional
imperative for companies (funny that).

This is why companies can NOT be trusted. You seem to be missing this
basic point. Do you own a company?

Some companies start with good policy, and good public stance, most
significantly in this conversation, Google itself - "do no evil". They
don't say that any more. They can't. Did you ever wonder why they
stopped saying that?

Trust is a relevant foundation to community/ society, sure.

But now you've segued into personal. Which is a good place at times,
an effective place. It's more tangible for people.

But here we were talking about companies. I would ordinarily presume
your trust formula is different for companies that it is for actual,
you know, humans.

I suggest not overloading corporate rights, corporate trust, with
human rights, human trust. Not particularly useful in our context.

A rational approach is warranted for sure.

Companies, and in most cases humans working for them, are
predominantly incentivized by money. Yesterday I read an article on
the Great Wall of China. Incredible vision, so many centuries of
building. But when it came down to the time it was 'needed', due to
there being only so many sentries, and so far spread out, and the
sentries paid so little, when the marauding Mongols wanted in, to do
some marauding, they just bribed a sentry or two. Apparently same with
the Europeans in more recent times. So, incentivized people were,
secure, wall was not. The biggest security theater.

I think the great wall may have been useful psychologically though...
to encourage a mindset of unity in the people within.

Your ethics are admirable. I share your personal intentions. I don't
trust companies though, except to plunder markets to the maximum
profit possible.
