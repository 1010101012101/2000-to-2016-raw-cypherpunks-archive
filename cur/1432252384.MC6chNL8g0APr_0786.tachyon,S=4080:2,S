	Last time I checked, "True Names" was going for over $100 on 
the auction sites (you can search through the biggest one at <plug, I 
work for them> www.auctionwatch.com)--although one is at $23 right 
now, and another one at $57.

	I've seen them for over $100 at some of the used book dealers.

	That would be nice. As much as I like his writing, I cringe 
at spending more than cover price on a used book, when I know the 
author will never see a dime of it.
