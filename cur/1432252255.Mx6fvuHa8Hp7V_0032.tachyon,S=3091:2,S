I remember it from the late 60s, well over _30_ years ago. (I know 
because a famous Playmate from around 1967-68, Myers was her name IIRC, 
  was very widely printed out circa 1970, and probably earlier.)

But Tyler and all the other wet-behind-the-ears children are no doubt 
impressed by the "retro" look.

Fer shure!
