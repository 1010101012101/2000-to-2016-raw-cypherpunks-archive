RSA Security Releases RSA Encryption Algorithm into Public Domain

'c = m(e) mod n' Made Available Two Weeks Early

BEDFORD, Mass., Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- RSA® Security
Inc. (Nasdaq: RSAS - news) today announced it has released the
RSA public key encryption algorithm into the public domain,
allowing anyone to create products that incorporate their own
implementation of the algorithm. This means that RSA Security has
waived its rights to enforce the patent for any development
activities that include the RSA algorithm occurring after
September 6, 2000.

Represented by the equation "c = m(e) mod n," the RSA algorithm
is widely considered the standard for encryption and the core
technology that secures the vast majority of the e-business
conducted on the Internet. The U.S. patent for the RSA algorithm
(#4,405,829, "Cryptographic Communications System And Method")
was issued to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on
September 20, 1983, licensed exclusively to RSA Security and
expires on September 20, 2000.

"So much misinformation has been spread recently regarding the
expiration of the RSA algorithm patent that we wanted to create
an opportunity to state the facts," said Art Coviello, chief
executive officer of RSA Security. "RSA Security's
commercialization of the RSA patent helped create an entire
industry of highly secure, interoperable products that are the
foundation of the worldwide online economy.  Releasing the RSA
algorithm into the public domain now is a symbolic next step in
the evolution of this market, as we believe it will cement the
position of RSA encryption as the standard in all categories of
wired and wireless applications and devices. RSA Security intends
to continue to offer the world's premier implementation of the
RSA algorithm and all other relevant encryption technologies in
our RSA BSAFE® software solutions and we remain confident in
our leadership in the encryption market."

For nearly two decades, more than 800 companies spanning a range
of global industries have turned to RSA Security as a trusted,
strategic partner that can provide the proven, time-tested
encryption implementations and resources designed to speed time
to market. These companies, including nearly 200 so far in 2000,
rely on RSA BSAFE® security software for its encryption
implementation and value-added services for a broad range of B2B,
B2C and wireless applications.

During the past 17 years, RSA Security has incorporated the
concepts represented by the RSA algorithm into its RSA BSAFE
cryptographic software. The company has made continuous
enhancements to the way the algorithm has been implemented,
including a number of performance improvements and optimizations,
not reflected in the original patent, for a wide range of
software applications, operating systems and chip designs. RSA
Security also is an industry leader in developing standards on
the robust application of encryption technologies for solving
real-world problems. These core standards, known as the Public
Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), form the underpinnings of
today's most widely used communication methods.

In recent years, encryption technology has taken on an entirely
new level of importance in the world of business and consumer
technology, and RSA Security continues to be a leader in the
industry. Once the province of a small group of technologists and
mathematicians, new developments have raised the profile of
encryption among a broad range of audiences. Moving forward,
electronic signature legislation, export regulation and the
pending selection of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) all
will contribute significantly to encryption playing a key role in
the further expansion of e-commerce initiatives for B2B, B2C and
extended enterprise applications.
