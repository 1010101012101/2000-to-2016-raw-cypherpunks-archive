Hi Dave,

Given the increasing salience of such service blocking mechanisms,
your subscribers might be interested in the specific deal between
Narus and Shanghai Telecom:

http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/73391

It's also worth noting how hardware and services like this have
spawned countervailing technologies to obscure the identity/nature of
IP traffic flows, e.g.:

http://www.numetra.com/

Although Numetra now appears to be positioned to support third-party
content producers and aggregators who hope to remain independent from
access network owners, it seems likely that end user-oriented
products will also emerge to provide an alternative to passive
acquiescence to the enclosure of the Net.

The resulting arms race may be very good for hardware vendors, but
does not bode well for the security and stability of the Internet, IMO.
