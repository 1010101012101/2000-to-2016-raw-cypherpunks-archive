Babylons One, Two, and Three were sabotaged and destroyed. Babylon
Four disappeared twenty-four hours after becoming operational. In
2260, it was discovered that Babylon Four was pulled back in time more
than one thousand years to aid in the First Great War. Babylon Five
was scuttled around 2282; there would never be another. 

We know nothing of Babylon Ten.
