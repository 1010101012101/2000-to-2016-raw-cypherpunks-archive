Vnity is about as old as mankind. With vanity, various ways come to change
one's appearance.

Wider lips. Narrower mouth. Wider eyes. Different shape of eyes. Name a
facial feature, there is a way to enhance or suppress it.

Face-recognition systems rely on visual appearance. They typically need
edges - edges of mouth, edges of eyes...; one popular algorithm for
indexing a face is recognizing these points and measuring their distance.
A little amount of properly applied pigment could shift these values by
couple percents.

So low-tech device a lipstick is could be a potential tool for lowering
the probability of a successful identification by face recognition. Ladies
often carry many more similar "terrorist tools" in their purses.

Opinions, comments?
