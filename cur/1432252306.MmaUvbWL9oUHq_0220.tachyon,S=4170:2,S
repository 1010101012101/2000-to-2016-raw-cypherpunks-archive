Many end users just want to get their work done,
irrespective of the cartridge as long as it meets
their minimum standards. It should be annoying when
one buys a cartridge and the crypto in the printer
rejects the ink. The way business is done in many
countries is that you cannot always go back to the
seller and ask for a replacement. It will make end
users look for printers without any encryption chip.
