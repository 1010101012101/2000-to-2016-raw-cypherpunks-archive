Dear Dec
Please leave out my e-mail TIA.(and thanks for helping me clean my clock.)
Following on from previous Politech posts at...
http://www.politechbot.com/cgi-bin/politech.cgi?name=proffr
An important case for free speech online is due soon in Melb.au.Professor 
rat,(me),an entertainment journalist with the Indymedia group is charged 
with 2 counts of ,'threat's to kill,' and two counts of using a device to 
menace.
It's possible to get 20 years for these offences,(a multiple rapist was 
sentenced to 45 years for 3 rape offences recently here.)
Discovery has revealed 2 main pieces of evidence supposedly copies from a 
'ghost' copy of the entire seized hard drive.One looks like an e-mail 
that's time stamped with the same date as the offending post and was sent 
to 'self',the time difference is at least an hour.Someone apparently copied 
and sent back to self the post within a couple of hours.This someone is 
assumed to be me by the police complainant.
The other piece is supposedly a copy off the main copy that is a screen 
shot of the second offending post as seen at Indymedia.Its not conventually 
time stamped at all.
In au legal aid is very hard to obtain and lawyers actually held a street 
march recently in Melbourne, to call for more funding.I was approved in 
January, of aid to regain my laptop,this was unsuccessful.
   The police have managed to lie to me,steal from me,lock me up in cells 
since condemned unfit for humans,kept my depreciating computer over a 
year,colluded with my mental health team to increase my medication 3 or 4 
times,have me tested with needles in another town at some expense to 
me.When that 'treatment' was refused I was nearly certified for a weekend 
for no reason.
US interest has been exposed by federal police documents obtained under the 
FOI act.Documents exhibit a PROMIS # no.Complaints to the professional 
standards department of the AFP are underway as are ones to the Health 
commission.My case worker said that extradition to the US was mentioned as 
a possibility.(Cinci or the pacifier letters?) Anyone who doubts APster 
,simply as a TACTIC is missing the boat.Declan is correct to describe the 
AP essay as a long winded screed,I am personally mainly interested in the 
'soft drilling' part of it, (and the LEOs extraordinary response to it.)
I was diagnosed with simple schizophrenia in the early eighties.I am 
prescribed Olanzapine.(Zoloft) The post described as one of my typical 
rants is in fact a selected repost from the C/punks list,circa 1996.I don't 
apologize for posting as much as possible before being gagged and/or 
imprisoned like JB and CJ.
Plainly there is insufficient evidence to bring State charges,a 
sen.Conts.Martin Holland is on record for stating in court that,"anyone can 
download there,"(at Indy.)
The complainant,sen.Conts nic Conte,came at me with a knife at the police 
station and sliced my drawstring off my jogging pants.8 months after 
surfing Indy and downloading 'evidence' to hard copy he claims to,"know 
nothing about computers."
The computer squad officer took the 'threats' so seriously that the next 
day after my laptop was seized he started off on another case.(a pedophile 
in a Govt office)
Conte claims to be afraid of threats of 'molotovs'.About a month ago police 
in Italy admitted to planting actual molotovs to justify an extremely 
violent raid on an Indymedia location.
Trial is adversarial in au and sept's hearing is a "contest mention."before 
a Magistrate.I have a list of questions yet have not met my lawyer yet,his 
name is Jarrod Williams and he has been referred to me by Cameron Ford at 
Kyneton's firm,Palmer,Stevens and Rennick.Win lose or draw,I look forward 
to this case finally being heard,snippets of info are available as they 
come to hand at C/punks and I will post a detailed impression of the trial 
there and on Melbourne Indymedia.
Re The improper psychiatric interference under the guise of 
'investigation.' <snip>
I just wrote this to an aussie anarchist...
Subject: 'Russian" psychiatry in au
An country Vic an anarchist has obtained under FOI,evidence that Federal
police and a Mental Health team plotted to increase his medication 3 or 4
times and stick needles in him to monitor drugs.The patient would have had
to pay to get to his blood tests.(in another town.) This collusion occurred
earlier this year and the evidence for the proposed actions was
secret.Several lines are blacked out though a reference to US input remains
as does a PROMIS no on a couple of the documents.When the anarchist rang to
complain to the 'professional standards' Dept of the Federal Police he was
asked for his PROMIS hash no.The use of PROMIS in several countries is
suspected as a tool of repression and murder.(Guatamala,occupied Palestine
and the old South Africa.It is a software tracking method originally stolen
from a small Co called INSLAW by the justice Dept of the US Govt.
In Russia dissidents had a special diagnosis called 'sluggish
schizophrenia.There was a story in last weekends australian about
instituting guidelines for the chaining of mental patients to their beds in
Adelaide Hospital.
Privacy legislation is meant to protect patients records so a complaint has
been made to the Health Commission of Vic.When a response is forthcoming
further complaints may ensue ,to the professional bodies of those State
criminals, involved in this sordid and disquieting episode.
yrs etc.
