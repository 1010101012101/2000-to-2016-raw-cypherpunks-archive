This is going to be great... In theory, at least, one could start in
Boston after work at 5:30 EDT on Wednesday, talk through your teeth while
munching canapes over evening cocktails at the Hahvid Club dahling, jump
on a plane, fly west all night, stay up all the next day, and party all
Thursday night in San Francisco. Ending up, of course, on the floor
somewhere with your feet in the sky and, um, Xes in your eyes, some 30(?)
hours later at 2AM PDT.

Riiight.

Of course, there *are* people threatening to come to Boston from Europe
on the 20th, and, having done something that crazy already, *they* might
be up for something as biochronically challenging, but not me, nooooo....

Cheers,
RAH
A tired old poop who's not at all jealous that *their* party's gonna be
waay cooler than *our* party, but who still can't help but observe that
*we're* raising money for a *sponsor* of *their* party, either.  It was
ever thus, though, and all for very good causes on both accounts,
certainly.
