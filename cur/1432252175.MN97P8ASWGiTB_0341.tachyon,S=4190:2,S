Tor 0.2.0.31 addresses two potential anonymity issues, starts to fix
a big bug we're seeing where in rare cases traffic from one Tor stream
gets mixed into another stream, and fixes a variety of smaller issues.

https://www.torproject.org/download.html

Changes in version 0.2.0.31 - 2008-09-03
  o Major bugfixes:
    - Make sure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection
      with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This
      is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc.
    - Relays now reject risky extend cells: if the extend cell includes
      a digest of all zeroes, or asks to extend back to the relay that
      sent the extend cell, tear down the circuit. Ideas suggested
      by rovv.
    - If not enough of our entry guards are available so we add a new
      one, we might use the new one even if it overlapped with the
      current circuit's exit relay (or its family). Anonymity bugfix
      pointed out by rovv.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Recover 3-7 bytes that were wasted per memory chunk. Fixes bug
      794; bug spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
    - Correctly detect the presence of the linux/netfilter_ipv4.h header
      when building against recent kernels. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
    - Pick size of default geoip filename string correctly on windows.
      Fixes bug 806. Bugfix on 0.2.0.30.
    - Make the autoconf script accept the obsolete --with-ssl-dir
      option as an alias for the actually-working --with-openssl-dir
      option. Fix the help documentation to recommend --with-openssl-dir.
      Based on a patch by "Dave". Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
    - Disallow session resumption attempts during the renegotiation
      stage of the v2 handshake protocol. Clients should never be trying
      session resumption at this point, but apparently some did, in
      ways that caused the handshake to fail. Bug found by Geoff Goodell.
      Bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.
    - When using the TransPort option on OpenBSD, and using the User
      option to change UID and drop privileges, make sure to open
      /dev/pf before dropping privileges. Fixes bug 782. Patch from
      Christopher Davis. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
    - Try to attach connections immediately upon receiving a RENDEZVOUS2
      or RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED cell. This can save a second or two
      on the client side when connecting to a hidden service. Bugfix
      on 0.0.6pre1. Found and fixed by Christian Wilms; resolves bug 743.
    - When closing an application-side connection because its circuit is
      getting torn down, generate the stream event correctly. Bugfix on
      0.1.2.x. Anonymous patch.
