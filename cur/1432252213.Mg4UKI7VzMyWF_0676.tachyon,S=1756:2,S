IRS vs. KUGLIN
By Carl F. Worden

Forget the war in Iraq, Afghanistan and our excellent adventure in
Liberia. Forget about Kobe, Arnold, Arriana, Scott and Laci. The
biggest news of the entire week is that on August 8, 2003, the IRS
was unable to convince a jury in Memphis, Tennessee that the Federal
Tax Code requires the citizens to pay individual income taxes. I kid
you not...

A foolish Constitutional inconsistency is the hobgoblin of freedom, adored 
by judges and demagogue statesmen.
