Of course we do not agree.  Under the DRM/TCPA regime I cannot legally do
the following thing:

Spoof your handshake and then run my cracker on the encrypted data you send me.

So some software will not legally run under DRM/TCPA.

See above.  Please be precise in your response.

No.  They are exactly "software needs to be signed to run".  Otherwise why
cannot I run cp on the movie that Time-Warner-AOL sends me?

Ah, so much for your claim that all software that now runs will run under
DRM/TCPA.  You admit that software I may now run cannot be run under
DRM/TCPA.

No.  Under DRM every "hole" must be plugged.  Else what is the bleating
about the "analogue hole"?  So obviously no non-DRM computer may be allowed
to be sold to the general public under DRM.

Demonstration by formal admission of pro-DRM forces:

Section 4.12 of the Final Report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group, found in the main body of the report at

Ah, now you have fallen off the high line of the long troll.  This is simply
beneath the level of your game.  What you should do is claim that even if
DRM is enforced all over the world, that this must be, from a higher and
more encompassing viewpoint, a triumph of "the market" and the will of the
people.

Good grief!  Please retuen to a less hopelessly ridiculous line.  If TCPA
is so good, and it "might win in the market", well, let 10,000 TCPA
implementations bloom!

I have demonstrated, by example, and by official statements of your own
side, that your claims are incorrect..

I recommend a broader. looser, and more amusing approach to the defense of
DRM.  I like the old Hegelian standard: "THE OVERMIND NEEDS DRM NOW SO AS
TO BE BORN WITHOUT RIPPING ALL HUMAN HISTORY INTO NON-EXISTENCE BY
BACK-REACTION."

oo--JS.
