FREE GUN TRAINING FOR COMMERCIAL PILOTS

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA:  In the aftermath of the World Trade
Center attack, Front Sight Firearms Training Institute,
which claims to be the world leader in providing intensified
courses in the defensive use of firearms for private
citizens and law enforcement alike, feels they have the
answer to stopping commercial airliners from being used as
ballistic missiles.  Front Sight will train every commercial
pilot in the world FREE OF CHARGE in the defensive use of
the handgun.  Front Sight will accept for training all
certified pilots and co-pilots from all commercial airliners
that submit a request for training on commercial airliner
letterhead, designating the pilot and co-pilot to carry a
handgun in the cockpit to defend access to the airliner. The
request for training letter must have the notarized
signature of the airline's chief executive.

Front Sight's Founder and Director, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
understands that his offer may offend those who lack resolve
in stopping terrorists from turning airliners into weapons
of mass destruction. However, he is quick to point out that
the World Trade Center attack is a new realm of terror, not
previously witnessed in the world. Prior to the World Trade
Center attack, terrorists were content to hijack planes and
divert them to safe landings in exchange for negotiated
release of imprisoned comrades. In extreme cases, terrorists
have committed suicide by exploding the grounded plane.
Airliners have also been targeted with bombs and possibly
missiles to spectacularly explode in flight, killing all on
board.  The World Trade Center attack was a new form of
terrorism, where the commercial airliner, loaded with fuel
for a cross country flight is redirected from the cockpit
and turned into an accurate missile of mass destruction.
Front Sight knows this form of terrorism can be stopped
immediately by arming all pilots and co-pilots and training
them in the proper methods of defending their cockpits.

"Commercial airliners must be willing to take an
uncompromising stand that will not allow anyone, under any
circumstances to access the controls of an airliner," says
Piazza. "The pilot and co-pilot, are responsible for the
security of the cockpit.  Without a handgun to defend it,
the cockpit crew is easily defeated.  However, when both
pilot and co-pilot are armed and trained by Front Sight,
they have the tools, ability, and will to defend themselves
and repel the murderous intent of terrorists. In an
emergency, the pilot can fly the plane to a safe landing
while the co-pilot covers the door of the cockpit- ready and
willing to use deadly force to prevent anyone from opening
the door."

Dennis Vied, a retired TWA Captain with 28 years of
experience flying commercial airliners and Front Sight
student fully agrees with Front Sight's solution.  Captain
Vied states, "The terrorists knew that they would face no
opposition to the hijacking, once they managed to get on the
airplane. All they had to do was threaten to do something to
a passenger, and they would be allowed access to the
cockpit. If that didn't work, then they just had to hurt
somebody, which in this case they did. Apparently they cut
the throats of two of the flight attendants. The terrorists
knew they would face no armed opposition, because the
airline screening process would insure that nobody on the
airplane would be armed. We have such an abhorrence to guns
that we fail to allow the good people to arm themselves for
defense. Therefore they are at the mercy of bad people- in
this case the terrorists. I sincerely hope that this is a
wakeup call to America. I think they should arm the crews,
or at least allow those that want to be armed to do so.
Otherwise, you're at the mercy of some crazy son-of-a-bitch
armed with a box cutter! How absolutely absurd!  There is so
much emphasis on prevention, and precious little emphasis on
the ultimate lines of defense."

Aaron Benedetti, a United Airline 747 co-pilot since 1990 is
a Platinum member at Front Sight and has already attended
Front Sight courses in defensive handgun, tactical shotgun,
and practical rifle. Through Front Sight's training,
Benedetti is ready, willing and able to defend the cockpit
of his aircraft if given the proper tools and authority to
do so.  Benedetti states, "We get recurrent training
regarding hijacking and security procedures, but the
training centers around placating and negotiating with the
terrorists to safely land the plane. We are told not to make
any aggressive move and to work toward a calm outcome.  The
World Trade Center disaster is a real blind spot in our
training. The attack reveals that perhaps the only way the
pilots could have stopped it would have been to deny access
to the cockpit and stop the terrorists from taking over the
controls of the plane by any means possible.  In the future,
we should consider that with the cockpit doors locked and
the co-pilot guarding the door with a handgun, calm
negotiations can still take place via intercom to land the
plane safely thus avoiding another World Trade Center
scenario."  Aaron Benedetti recommends all airlines to take
advantage of Front Sight's solution and offer.  He returns
to Front Sight later his year for further training on his
own.

Lieutenant Bob Redmond, SWAT Commander of Nye County
Sheriff's Department concurs that Front Sight's training is
exactly what the commercial airliners need and that they
should immediately begin sending their pilots to Front
Sight. Redmond, who sends his SWAT officers to Front Sight
for firearms and tactical training states, "Front Sight's
training exceeds levels offered by most if not all law
enforcement agencies throughout the country.  Front Sight's
training is so good that I want every officer we have in the
department to attend every course Front Sight offers. If
airlines sent their pilots to Front Sight, it would be like
having SWAT officers in the sky."

Mark Donovan, a pilot for Southwest Airlines, who has taken
over ten Front Sight courses in the last two years finds the
current situation of unarmed pilots rather incredulous.
Donavan explains, "The political climate in commercial
aviation prior to the World Trade Center attack has not been
conducive to arming pilots.  In fact, just the opposite has
occurred.  Airlines have disarmed pilots to the point where
a terrorist with a box cutter can take over control of a
plane because no one is armed to defend the plane or
themselves.  Yet, numerous federal agencies are allowed to
carry a gun on commercial airlines, including such dubiously
qualified agencies as, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, and the
Smithsonian Institution!  Why are federal agents from these
obscure agencies allowed to carry a gun on board when a
pilot with firearms training from Front Sight Firearms
Training Institute is not allowed? My training at Front
Sight far exceeds anything the federal government offers to
these agencies."  Donovan continues, "If we, as pilots are
not given the means and authority to defend our aircraft as
a last means of defense, then who will?  It is apparent that
time was not available to negotiate with the madmen in the
World Trade Center attack.  Clearly, a properly trained
flight crew with a handgun could have saved countless lives.
Front Sight offers this training. I urge all federal
decision  makers to seriously examine Front Sight's solution
to the problem.  I believe it is the only credible answer to
stopping another horrendous tragedy."
Front Sight is the Solution to Gun Violence

Piazza reiterates, "Front Sight is truly part of the
solution to gun violence in this country.  Everyone agrees
that law enforcement should have the very best training
available.  Front Sight provides it.  And everyone agrees,
regardless of what side of gun control one stands, that if
law abiding private citizens are going to own firearms they
should be trained.  Front Sight provides such training to
levels that exceeds the law enforcement community.  Front
Sight now offers the solution to stopping and forever
preventing another World Trade Center attack by training
commercial airline pilots to be that last line of
defense for their passengers, airline, and our country.
Front Sight stands ready, willing, and able to serve."
