My request comes from the fact that, as far as I know, you cannot use a QR 
code to pay POS at an establishment, say at like 7/11. People easily become 
more well antiquated with quick POS payment methods. I.E. (not in 
chronological order) Charlie cards in boston, the upcoming paypass enabled 
NYC subway turnstiles (they completed a trial a little while back), the 
mobil speedpass which has been around for years 
(https://www.speedpass.com/forms/frmSpHome.aspx), and then most recently 
NFC enabled payment terminals popping up everywhere in the US. Anyone can 
apply for an NFC (really RFID, but same tapping concept...) enabled 
credit/debit cards easily now: http://www.paypass.com/, 
http://usa.visa.com/personal/cards/card_technology/paywave.html, 
https://www295.americanexpress.com/cards/loyalty.do?page=expresspay, 
https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/help-center/account/zip/.

I'm sorry, but you cannot tell me NFC is uncommon functionality. Three to 
four of Sprint's cellphone are now NFC enabled; I'm sure other carriers are 
simultaneously following suit. Familiarity with tapping to pay will reach 
the masses through mobile phones, if it hasn't already through the card 
companies ...
