I'm getting 30 EUR/month 100 GByte/month (0.9 EUR/GByte overtraffic)
for a SuSE box at server4free.de, hetzner.de is 10 EUR more, has
80 GByte/month traffic and has Debian 3.0 as well as SuSE.

How well is IPsec supported in 2.6 as compared to FreeS/WAN in 2.4
in regards to opportunistic encryption?
