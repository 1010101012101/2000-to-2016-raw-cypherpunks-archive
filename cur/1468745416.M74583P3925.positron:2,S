Actually, just finding that in the Bill wasn't easy - and it isn't a 
single part, it's taken from at least five different places in the Bill. 
If it seems clear, then I did a good job putting them together.

Thing is, while the Bill isn't good, it doesn't have anything at all to 
do with banning end-to-end encryption. Or banning any sort of encryption.

It can require "relevant operators" to maintain some backdoors, most 
obviously in mobile link encryption and some VPNs and other encrypted 
links which are operated by "relevant operators".

Less obviously, it can be applied to some websites and the like.

But there is no power to ban encryption anywhere in the Bill.

If you as a private person apply the encryption yourself, there is no 
power in the Bill to make you backdoor it (though there have been powers 
in RIPA to enforce demands for keys in some circumstances since 2001), 
and there is no power to prevent you from using encryption.

Yep, we have a brand new female Home Secretary. The old one is now Prime 
Minister ...

I was not clear - while the HS can extend the notices to eg include 
other forms of encryption not applied by "relevant operators", she 
cannot serve notices on, or force any other obligation on, anyone except 
"relevant operators".

If you are a private citizen and you aren't providing a service, she 
can't prevent you from doing any encryption you like, nor can she make 
you backdoor it.

PGP is okay, and there's not a thing in the Bill which says she can do 
anything to ban it.

Neither can she stop people using SSL/TLS, or except in the case of some 
UK-based servers, mandate backdoors in it.

She could in theory serve a notice on Google, Apple or Facebook - but in 
practice, none of these would actually be obligated to obey it.

err, no - that one is defined in the Bill, she can't change the meaning 
of "relevant operator".

She can change some of the things she requires "relevant operators" to 
do - but if you aren't a "relevant operator" she can't require you to do 
anything.
