The Muslim Problem

Nicolai Sennels is a Danish psychologist who has done extensive research int=
o a little-known problem in the Muslim world: the disastrous results of Musl=
im inbreeding brought about by the marriage of first-cousins.

This practice, which has been prohibited in the Judeo-Christian tradition si=
nce the days of Moses, was sanctioned by Muhammad and has been going on now f=
or 50 generations (1,400 years) in the Muslim world.

This practice of inbreeding will never go away in the Muslim world, since Mu=
hammad is the ultimate example and authority on all matters, including marri=
age.

The massive inbreeding in Muslim culture may well have done virtually irreve=
rsible damage to the Muslim gene pool, including xtensive damage to its inte=
lligence, sanity, and health.

According to Sennels, close to half of all Muslims in the world are inbred. I=
n Pakistan, the numbers approach 70%. Even in England, more than half of Pak=
istani immigrants are married to their first cousins, and in Denmark the num=
ber of inbred Pakistani immigrants is around 40%.

The numbers are equally devastating in other important Muslim countries: 67%=
 in Saudi Arabia, 64% in Jordan, and Kuwait, 63% in Sudan, 60% in Iraq, and 5=
4% in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar .

According to the BBC, this Pakistani, Muslim-inspired inbreeding is thought t=
o explain the probability that a British Pakistani family is more than 13 ti=
mes as likely to have children with recessive genetic disorders. While Pakis=
tanis are responsible for three percent of the births in the UK, they accoun=
t for 33% of children with genetic birth defects.

The risk of what are called autosomal recessive disorders such as cystic fib=
rosis and spinal muscular atrophy is 18 times higher an the risk of death du=
e to malformations is 10 times higher.

Other negative consequences of inbreeding include a 100 percent increase in t=
he risk of stillbirths and a 50% increase in the possibility that a child wi=
ll die during labor.

Lowered intellectual capacity is another devastating consequence of Muslim m=
arriage patterns. According to Sennels, research shows that children of cons=
anguineous marriages lose 10-16 points off their IQ and that social abilitie=
s develop much slower in inbred babies.

The risk of having an IQ lower than 70, the official demarcation for being c=
lassified as "retarded," increases by an astonishing 400 percent among child=
ren of cousin marriages. (Similar effects were seen in the Pharaonic dynasti=
es in ancient Egypt and in the British royal family, where inbreeding was th=
e norm for a significant period of time.)

In Denmark, non-Western immigrants are more than 300 percent more likely to f=
ail the intelligence test required for entrance into the Danish army.

Sennels says that "the ability to enjoy and produce knowledge and abstract t=
hinking is simply lower in the Islamic world." He points out that the Arab w=
orld translates just 330 books every year, about 20% of what Greece alone do=
es.

In the last 1,200 years of Islam, just 100,000 books have been translated in=
to Arabic, about what Spain does in a single year. Seven out of 10 Turks hav=
e never even read a book.

Sennels points out the difficulties this creates for Muslims seeking to succ=
eed in the West. "A lower IQ, together with a religion that denounces critic=
al thinking, surely makes it harder for many Muslims to have success in our h=
igh-tech knowledge societies.."

Only nine Muslims have every won the Nobel Prize, and five of those were for=
 the "Peace Prize." According to Nature magazine, Muslim countries produce j=
ust 10 percent of the world average when it comes to scientific research (me=
asured by articles per million inhabitants).

In Denmark, Sennels' native country, Muslim children are grossly over repres=
ented among children with special needs. One-third of the budget for Danish s=
chools is consumed by special education, and anywhere from 51% to 70% of ret=
arded children with physical handicaps in Copenhagen have an immigrant backg=
round. Learning ability is severely affected as well.
Studies indicated that 64% of school children with Arabic parents are still i=
lliterate after 10 years in the Danish school system. The immigrant drop-out=
 rate in Danish high schools is twice that of the native-born.

Mental illness is also a product. The closer the blood relative, the higher t=
he risk of schizophrenic illness. The increased risk of insanity may explain=
 why more than 40% of the patients in Denmark's biggest ward for clinically i=
nsane criminals have an immigrant back-ground.

The U.S. is not immune. According to Sennels, "One study based on 300,000 Am=
ericans shows that the majority of Muslims in the USA have a lower income, a=
re less educated, and have worse jobs than the population as a whole."

Sennels concludes:

There is no doubt that the wide spread tradition of first cousin marriages a=
mong Muslims has harmed the gene pool among Muslims. Because Muslims' religi=
ous beliefs prohibit marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding=
 fresh genetic material to their population, the genetic damage done to thei=
r gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin marriages 1,400 years a=
go are most likely massive. (This has produced) overwhelming direct and indi=
rect human and societal consequences.

Bottom line: Islam is not simply a benign and morally equivalent alternative=
 to the Judeo-Christian tradition. As Sennels points out, the first and bigg=
est victims of Islam are Muslims. Simple Christian compassion for Muslims an=
d a common-sense desire to protect Western civilization from the ravages of I=
slam dictate a vigorous opposition to the spread of this dark and dangerous
religion. These stark realities must be taken into account when we establish=
 public polices dealing with immigration from Muslim countries and the build=
ing of mosques in the U.S.

Let's hope America wakes up before a blind naivete about the reality of Isla=
m destroys what remains of our Judeo-Christian culture and our domestic tran=
quility.
