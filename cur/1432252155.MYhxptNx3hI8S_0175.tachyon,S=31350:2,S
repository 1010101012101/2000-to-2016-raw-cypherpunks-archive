     Eighth Anniversary of 9/11



On September 30, 2001, I published a special issue of Crypto-Gram 
discussing the terrorist attacks.  I wrote about the novelty of the 
attacks, airplane security, diagnosing intelligence failures, the 
potential of regulating cryptography -- because it could be used by the 
terrorists -- and protecting privacy and liberty.   Much of what I wrote 
is still relevant today.

     Skein News



Skein is one of the 14 SHA-3 candidates chosen by NIST to advance to the 
second round.  As part of the process, NIST allowed the algorithm 
designers to implement small "tweaks" to their algorithms.  We've 
tweaked the rotation constants of Skein.

The revised Skein paper contains the new rotation constants, as well as 
information about how we chose them and why we changed them, the results 
of some new cryptanalysis, plus new IVs and test vectors.

Tweaks were due today, September 15.  Now the SHA-3 process moves into 
the second round.  According to NIST's timeline, they'll choose a set of 
final round candidate algorithms in 2010, and then a single hash 
algorithm in 2012.  Between now and then, it's up to all of us to 
evaluate the algorithms and let NIST know what we want.  Cryptanalysis 
is important, of course, but so is performance.

The second-round algorithms are: BLAKE, Blue Midnight Wish, CubeHash, 
ECHO, Fugue, Grxstl, Hamsi, JH, Keccak, Luffa, Shabal, SHAvite-3, SIMD, 
and Skein.  You can find details on all of them, as well as the current 
state of their cryptanalysis, at the SHA-3 Zoo.

In other news, we're making Skein shirts available to the public.  Those 
of you who attended the First Hash Function Candidate Conference in 
Leuven, Belgium, earlier this year might have noticed the stylish black 
Skein polo shirts worn by the Skein team.  Anyone who wants one is 
welcome to buy it, at cost.  All orders must be received before 1 
October, and then we'll have all the shirts made in one batch.

     Real-World Access Control



Access control is difficult in an organizational setting. On one hand, 
every employee needs enough access to do his job. On the other hand, 
every time you give an employee more access, there's more risk: he could 
abuse that access, or lose information he has access to, or be socially 
engineered into giving that access to a malfeasant. So a smart, 
risk-conscious organization will give each employee the exact level of 
access he needs to do his job, and no more.

Over the years, there's been a lot of work put into role-based access 
control. But despite the large number of academic papers and 
high-profile security products, most organizations don't implement it -- 
at all -- with the predictable security problems as a result.

Regularly we read stories of employees abusing their database 
access-control privileges for personal reasons: medical records, tax 
records, passport records, police records. NSA eavesdroppers spy on 
their wives and girlfriends.  Departing employees take corporate secrets

A spectacular access control failure occurred in the UK in 2007. An 
employee of Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs had to send a couple of 
thousand sample records from a database on all children in the country 
to National Audit Office. But it was easier for him to copy the entire 
database of 25 million people onto a couple of disks and put it in the 
mail than it was to select out just the records needed. Unfortunately, 
the discs got lost in the mail and the story was a huge embarrassment 
for the government.

Eric Johnson at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business has been studying 
the problem, and his results won't startle anyone who has thought about 
it at all. RBAC is very hard to implement correctly. Organizations 
generally don't even know who has what role. The employee doesn't know, 
the boss doesn't know -- and these days the employee might have more 
than one boss -- and senior management certainly doesn't know. There's a 
reason RBAC came out of the military; in that world, command structures 
are simple and well-defined.

Even worse, employees' roles change all the time -- Johnson chronicled 
one business group of 3,000 people that made 1,000 role changes in just 
three months -- and it's often not obvious what information an employee 
needs until he actually needs it. And information simply isn't that 
granular. Just as it's much easier to give someone access to an entire 
file cabinet than to only the particular files he needs, it's much 
easier to give someone access to an entire database than only the 
particular records he needs.

This means that organizations either over-entitle or under-entitle 
employees. But since getting the job done is more important than 
anything else, organizations tend to over-entitle. Johnson estimates 
that 50 percent to 90 percent of employees are over-entitled in large 
organizations. In the uncommon instance where an employee needs access 
to something he normally doesn't have, there's generally some process 
for him to get it. And access is almost never revoked once it's been 
granted. In large formal organizations, Johnson was able to predict how 
long an employee had worked there based on how much access he had.

Clearly, organizations can do better. Johnson's current work involves 
building access-control systems with easy self-escalation, audit to make 
sure that power isn't abused, violation penalties (Intel, for example, 
issues "speeding tickets" to violators), and compliance rewards. His 
goal is to implement incentives and controls that manage access without 
making people too risk-averse.

In the end, a perfect access control system just isn't possible; 
organizations are simply too chaotic for it to work. And any good system 
will allow a certain number of access control violations, if they're 
made in good faith by people just trying to do their jobs. The "speeding 
ticket" analogy is better than it looks: we post limits of 55 miles per 
hour, but generally don't start ticketing people unless they're going 
over 70.

     File Deletion



File deletion is all about control. This used to not be an issue. Your 
data was on your computer, and you decided when and how to delete a 
file. You could use the delete function if you didn't care about whether 
the file could be recovered or not, and a file erase program -- I use 
BCWipe for Windows -- if you wanted to ensure no one could ever recover 
the file.

As we move more of our data onto cloud computing platforms such as Gmail 
and Facebook, and closed proprietary platforms such as the Kindle and 
the iPhone, deleting data is much harder.

You have to trust that these companies will delete your data when you 
ask them to, but they're generally not interested in doing so. Sites 
like these are more likely to make your data inaccessible than they are 
to physically delete it. Facebook is a known culprit: actually deleting 
your data from its servers requires a complicated procedure that may or 
may not work. And even if you do manage to delete your data, copies are 
certain to remain in the companies' backup systems. Gmail explicitly 
says this in its privacy notice.

Online backups, SMS messages, photos on photo sharing sites, smartphone 
applications that store your data in the network: you have no idea what 
really happens when you delete pieces of data or your entire account, 
because you're not in control of the computers that are storing the data.

This notion of control also explains how Amazon was able to delete a 
book that people had previously purchased on their Kindle e-book 
readers. The legalities are debatable, but Amazon had the technical 
ability to delete the file because it controls all Kindles. It has 
designed the Kindle so that it determines when to update the software, 
whether people are allowed to buy Kindle books, and when to turn off 
people's Kindles entirely.

Vanish is a research project by Roxana Geambasu and colleagues at the 
University of Washington. They designed a prototype system that 
automatically deletes data after a set time interval. So you can send an 
e-mail, create a Google Doc, post an update to Facebook, or upload a 
photo to Flickr, all designed to disappear after a set period of time. 
And after it disappears, no one -- not anyone who downloaded the data, 
not the site that hosted the data, not anyone who intercepted the data 
in transit, not even you -- will be able to read it. If the police 
arrive at Facebook or Google or Flickr with a warrant, they won't be 
able to read it.

The details are complicated, but Vanish breaks the data's decryption key 
into a bunch of pieces and scatters them around the web using a 
peer-to-peer network. Then it uses the natural turnover in these 
networks -- machines constantly join and leave -- to make the data 
disappear. Unlike previous programs that supported file deletion, this 
one doesn't require you to trust any company, organization, or website. 
It just happens.

Of course, Vanish doesn't prevent the recipient of an e-mail or the 
reader of a Facebook page from copying the data and pasting it into 
another file, just as Kindle's deletion feature doesn't prevent people 
from copying a book's files and saving them on their computers. Vanish 
is just a prototype at this point, and it only works if all the people 
who read your Facebook entries or view your Flickr pictures have it 
installed on their computers as well; but it's a good demonstration of 
how control affects file deletion. And while it's a step in the right 
direction, it's also new and therefore deserves further security 
analysis before being adopted on a wide scale.

We've lost the control of data on some of the computers we own, and 
we've lost control of our data in the cloud. We're not going to stop 
using Facebook and Twitter just because they're not going to delete our 
data when we ask them to, and we're not going to stop using Kindles and 
iPhones because they may delete our data when we don't want them to. But 
we need to take back control of data in the cloud, and projects like 
Vanish show us how we can.

Now we need something that will protect our data when a large 
corporation decides to delete it.

     On London's Surveillance Cameras



A recent report has concluded that the London's surveillance cameras 
have solved one crime per thousand cameras per year.

I haven't seen the report, but I know it's hard to figure out when a 
crime has been "solved" by a surveillance camera.  To me, the crime has 
to have been unsolvable without the cameras.  Repeatedly I see 
pro-camera lobbyists pointing to the surveillance-camera images that 
identified the 7/7 London Transport bombers, but it is obvious that they 
would have been identified even without the cameras.

And it would really help my understanding of the report's per-crime 
cost-to-detect of #20,000 (I assume it is calculated from #200 million 
for the cameras times 1 in 1000 cameras used to solve a crime per year 
divided by ten years) if I knew what sorts of crimes the cameras 
"solved."  If the #200 million solved 10,000 murders, it might very well 
be a good security trade-off.  But my guess is that most of the crimes 
were of a much lower level.

     Robert Sawyer's Alibis



Back in 2002, science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer wrote an essay 
about the trade-off between privacy and security.  I've never forgotten 
the first sentence:  "Whenever I visit a tourist attraction that has a 
guest register, I always sign it. After all, you never know when you'll 
need an alibi."

Since I read that, whenever I see a tourist attraction with a guest 
register, I do the same thing. I sign "Robert J. Sawyer, Toronto, ON" -- 
because you never know when he'll need an alibi.

     Stealing 130 Million Credit Card Numbers



Someone has been charged with stealing 130 million credit card numbers.

Yes, it's a lot, but that's the sort of quantities credit card numbers 
come in.  They come by the millions, in large database files.  Even if 
you only want ten, you have to steal millions.  I'm sure every one of us 
has a credit card in our wallet whose number has been stolen.  It'll 
probably never be used for fraudulent purposes, but it's in some stolen 
database somewhere.

Years ago, when giving advice on how to avoid identity theft, I would 
tell people to shred their trash.  Today, that advice is completely 
obsolete.  No one steals credit card numbers one by one out of the trash 
when they can be stolen by the millions from merchant databases.

     "The Cult of Schneier"



If there's actually a cult out there, I want to hear about it.  In an 
essay by that name, John Viega writes about the dangers of relying on 
Applied Cryptography to design cryptosystems:

    But, after many years of evaluating the security of software
    systems, I'm incredibly down on using the book that made Bruce
    famous when designing the cryptographic aspects of a system. In
    fact, I can safely say I have never seen a secure system come out
    the other end, when that is the primary source for the crypto
    design. And I don't mean that people forget about the buffer
    overflows. I mean, the crypto is crappy.

    My rule for software development teams is simple: Don't use
    Applied Cryptography in your system design. It's fine and
    fun to read it, just don't build from it.

    [...]

    The book talks about the fundamental building blocks of
    cryptography, but there is no guidance on things like, putting
    together all the pieces to create a secure, authenticated
    connection between two parties.

    Plus, in the nearly 13 years since the book was last revised, our
    understanding of cryptography has changed greatly. There are
    things in it that were thought to be true at the time that turned
    out to be very false....

I agree.  And, to his credit, Viega points out that I agree:

    But in the introduction to Bruce Schneier's book, Practical
    Cryptography, he himself says that the world is filled with
    broken systems built from his earlier book. In fact, he wrote
    Practical Cryptography in hopes of rectifying the problem.

This is all true.

Designing a cryptosystem is hard.  Just as you wouldn't give a person -- 
even a doctor -- a brain-surgery instruction manual and then expect him 
to operate on live patients, you shouldn't give an engineer a 
cryptography book and then expect him to design and implement a 
cryptosystem.  The patient is unlikely to survive, and the cryptosystem 
is unlikely to be secure.

Even worse, security doesn't provide immediate feedback.  A dead patient 
on the operating table tells the doctor that maybe he doesn't understand 
brain surgery just because he read a book, but an insecure cryptosystem 
works just fine.  It's not until someone takes the time to break it that 
the engineer might realize that he didn't do as good a job as he 
thought.  Remember: Anyone can design a security system that he himself 
cannot break.  Even the experts regularly get it wrong.  The odds that 
an amateur will get it right are extremely low.

For those who are interested, a second edition of Practical Cryptography 
will be published in early 2010, renamed Cryptography Engineering and 
featuring a third author: Tadayoshi Kohno.
