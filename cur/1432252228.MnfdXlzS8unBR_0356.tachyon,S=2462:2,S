While irritating, that also says something about Bitcon's ease of use.
 If it's easy to make impulse purchases it's easy enough for the

Along similar lines in this discussion:

A few coders are working on adding Tor hidden service support to the
Bitcoin client, i.e. when a Bitcoin client is configured to use Tor it
automagically sets up a .onion address for itself.
