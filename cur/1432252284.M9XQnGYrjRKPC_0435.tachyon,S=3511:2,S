The reason anonymizer is blocked is because it functions as a proxy 
via which one can get to (presumably) any page on the web.  The 
alternative would be to block *every* URL many times: once for the 
regular URL and once for the one that starts with www.anonymizer.com
and once for each of the other proxy-type services out there (any 
number of places where you can surf the web in swedish chef, pig-latin, 
jive, backwards, via language translation, etc, work basically the 
same way - and I bet they're all blocked too).  

I don't think it's anonymous speech they object to; it's all the 
millions of proscribed sites that can be browsed via anonymizer.
