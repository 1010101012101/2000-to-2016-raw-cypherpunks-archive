EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a

BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120

upwards of 170,000 Mw of e|ectricity annua||y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a

of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fulfi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
