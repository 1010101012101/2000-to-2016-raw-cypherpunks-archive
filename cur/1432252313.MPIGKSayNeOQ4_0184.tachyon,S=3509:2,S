Where's the site?  I'm sure some of us might be interested

Thanks for the legal advice.  cryptome still has decss.zip (and I'm
damned happy they do).  Nearly every other site with it caved to MPAA

people to mirror content that might be dangerous to their status with
their upstream provider requires some more details.
