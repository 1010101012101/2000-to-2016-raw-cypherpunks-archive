It would be difficult to shut down the list if it could resume
as "cryptopunks" or something on someone else's server or a Usenet
newsgroup. 

I see it (this is not a close analog, but I like it) as a bunch of
people discussing stuff in a public park. Do you shut down the park,
or the park's speaker corner, because of some alleged bad actors?
Besides, discussions about bomb making, Feinstein's attempts
notwithstanding, are presumptively legal in the U.S.
