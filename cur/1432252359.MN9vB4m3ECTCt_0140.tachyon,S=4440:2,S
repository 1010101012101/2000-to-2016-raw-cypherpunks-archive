It's what many of us predicted (in writing, here) when it was 
announced that ZKS would locate in Canada because of (or influenced 
by) Canada's supposedly freeer policies on encryption. I wrote at the 
time, as others did, that Canada's supposedly "free export policy" 
was likely temporary and was more of a "show of independence" against 
what they perceived to be U.S. control and influence.

Fact is, as we wrote at the time, Canada lacks a solid constitution 
for protection of basic liberties. Sure, defenders will scurry to 
point out, Canada now _has_ a charter/constitution. But it has not 
been the bedrock that the U.S.C. has been, nor has it had a history 
of important tests.

Canada is fundamentally an ad hocracy.

As for the effect on ZKS, I haven't seen any actual uses of Freedom, 
or users of it, so I doubt there will be much effect at all.
