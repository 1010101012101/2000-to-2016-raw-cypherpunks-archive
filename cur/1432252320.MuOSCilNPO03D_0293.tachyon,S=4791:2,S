Think of it as "cargo cult list management".

People want off the list, but they are unwilling to figure out how before 
hand or read anything.  They see someone posting a "remove" or 
"unsubscrive" to the mail list and figure "that must be the way that you do 
it" and do likewise.

I used to see rashes of similar behavior on perl5-porters a number of years 
back. You would think people on technical lists would know better.  I have 
long since learned that this is not the case.

For some of us, that message was received many years ago and was lost in 
the mists of hard drive failures.  For others, their brains were wiped to 
secure the information against discovery by the enemy.  (Or discovery by 
the Discovery channel, whichever comes first.)
