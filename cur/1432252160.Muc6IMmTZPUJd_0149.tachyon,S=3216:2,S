    Civil liberties may take a hit
    By Cathy Young

    [...]

    The movements of foreign visitors will be scrutinized more closely.
    Perhaps most alarming to many civil libertarians, it's likely that the
    government will expand its ability to monitor electronic mail, which
    has been a controversial issue for some time.

    Do I like the idea of the government intercepting e-mail? No. But, as
    long as there's judicial oversight and due process, that's no
    different from its longstanding power to intercept regular mail.

    Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic
    communications so that they are beyond surveillance? Frankly, I found
    it scary even before Sept. 11 - precisely because of the threat of
    terrorism.

    It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; perhaps there are
    no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks.

    Even in the Declaration of Independence, the right to liberty is
    preceded by the right to life.
