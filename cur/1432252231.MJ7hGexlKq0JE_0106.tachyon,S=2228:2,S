The govt. puts the blame on the intelligence for
failing and the intelligence community blames it on
tough laws that prevent them from eavesdropping. Then
they all go amending laws, show their commitment to
the public and reach a win-win situation. Somebody
somewhere should be responsible to take the blame if
this is to stop. The root cause of terrorism in many
cases is that - you screw them and they screw you.
That too has to stop.
