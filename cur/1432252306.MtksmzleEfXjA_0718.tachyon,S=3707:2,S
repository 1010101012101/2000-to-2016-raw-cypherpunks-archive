Yeah, and it matches exactly what I said. It takes a court order, where
is the law that doesn't take a court order, that makes this mandatory all 
the time?. This is what what the Europeans are talking about. They are
talking about making it mandatory to keep all logs all the time. This is a
big difference. The US representative is saying that the distinction
between requiring me as a system operator to cooperate with the law via
court orders and such or requiring me to keep my logs all the time is a
small difference.

Maybe you can't get it, but it is a HUGE!!!! difference.

I'm telling you, dude, up the med's...
