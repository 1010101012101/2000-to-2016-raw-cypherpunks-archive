Because it sounds Really Really Scientific!
That's why E-Meters work so well also!

(Oh, wait, you mean the courts are using pseudoscientific trash to
intimidate people because some scammer told them it'd get the results they

Also, the article says that the proponents
say it could make waterboarding obsolete.
It can't - the purpose of waterboarding is to torture your enemy,
and to get him to accuse other people, and this doesn't do that;
neither one of them will give you true information,
and India's too civilized a place to use torture.
