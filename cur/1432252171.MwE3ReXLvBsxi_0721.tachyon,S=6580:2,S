	    Remarks of Senator Ron Wyden to the United States Senate

	 Proposing a National Emergency Technology Guard (NET Guard)

       Senator Wyden chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science,

			     Technology and Space.


     "I am interested in discussing with the Senate a proposition that I

     think is important in light of the tragic events that unfolded on

     September 11, 2001. As all of us understand now, the communications

     infrastructure of New York, Washington, DC, and indeed the whole

     country, was severely challenged.


     "Wireless telephone networks were severely overloaded and crashed.

     Wireless Internet access was suspended. Telephone lines were cut, and

     communications, for people literally in communities around the East

     Coast of the United States, came to a standstill. Even the immediate

     communication needs of rescue workers, victims, families and aid

     groups were a struggle to coordinate. Survivors often could not let

     family members know they were safe. Families of victims had no

     immediate central clearinghouse to find information or file missing

     persons reports.


     "Hospitals were inundated with searches, requests for help and offers

     of aid, but no way to match them to each other. Even some of our

     nation's premier aid organizations, who have done such a marvelous job

     helping rescue workers, survivors and victims' families, faced

     immediate and severe challenges with respect to information technology

     infrastructure. The New York Times drew a conclusion that I strongly

     agree with: There need to be new ways to set up emergency information

     systems.


     "That's what I'd like to propose. What this country needs is

     essentially a technology equivalent of the National Guard: a National

     Emergency Technology Guard - NET Guard - that in times of crisis would

     be in a position to mobilize our nation's information technology, or

     IT, community to action quickly, just as the National Guard is ready

     to move during emergencies.


     "In our leading technology companies in this nation, there are the

     brains and the equipment to put in place this NET Guard, that could be

     deployed across this country when we face tragedies like we saw in New

     York City. A national volunteer organization of trained and

     well-coordinated units of IT professionals from our leading technology

     companies ought to be in a position to stand ready with designated

     computer equipment, satellite dishes, wireless communicators and other

     equipment to quickly recreate and repair compromised communications

     and technology infrastructures.


     "With Congressional support, the leaders of our nation's technology

     companies could organize themselves, their employees, and their

     resources for this purpose. Medium and small-sized businesses would be

     able to contribute once a national framework was put in place. The

     resources from the federal level need not be extensive; people could

     be designated from existing human resource pools at major and medium

     sized firms and these IT professionals would be trained to perform

     specific tasks in the event of an emergency.


     "I intend to use the Subcommittee that I chair to initiate a dialogue

     among Congressional, corporate, military and non-profit leaders to

     begin a new effort to mobilize information technology in times of

     crisis. As we seek to prevent future disasters, I believe the

     technology professionals of this nation, like most Americans, want to

     use their skills, their equipment, and their talents to this call and

     do their part. I propose we give leading information technology

     professionals a chance to use their ingenuity and creativity to insure

     greater safety and stability for our communities and our citizens in

     the coming days."
