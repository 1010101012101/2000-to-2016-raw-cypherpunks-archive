In the sense you're using it? No. In general they were members of a
society that was driven by religion and strict requirements on behaviour
and cast membership.

In general, no they didn't.

The people in general were help in common ownership, the ownership of the
ruling class. If you think some Aztec could just pack up and walk off you
are completely uneducated in the ways of those societies.

Another example of your ignorance. For example the word 'teo' was used for
'God' by both parties. In addition the Amerindians had cultural beliefs
that led them to believe that the whites were from their God. You don't
kill the messanger of ones own god.

You certainly have a right to prohibit them from smoking in public places
and in -your- private places. Outside of that it isn't any of your
business. As to killing them, that's just specious.
