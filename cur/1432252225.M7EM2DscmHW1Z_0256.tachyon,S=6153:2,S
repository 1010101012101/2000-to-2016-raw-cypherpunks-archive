True. Yet harm gives you cause for Common Law action, no?

That's also precisely what I meant, even if I expressed it a bit
differently.

That is precisely why I said labelling is a "nice gesture". The Code must
not concern itself with labelling, but you *can* do it, some people want
labelled content, and there are political advantages in both rating your
content and having truly voluntary raters around. Why not be one of them,
then? If you don't want to, it's always a valid reason. I just think there
are valid gains in rating, and so e.g. to a degree rate my own site.

Quite. My argument was about what is "nice", no more.

How? Maybe we should limit discussion to this as it's more cypherpunkish
than rating/labelling per se.

It's a question of where you draw the line between coerced and uncoerced. If
many enough of your peers think it's good behavior to label your
communications, and failure to do so leads to an amount of badwill, does
that constitute coercion? If not, we have a voluntary system where social
pressures encourage you to rate, but where the gain is not a direct economic
advantage, but rather the avoidance of the badwill of others. One might
argue that such "bad behavior" should be tolerated, and that rating is no
longer properly "voluntary" if rating only means you avoid an extra-legal
social sanction. Nevertheless, there is a definite incentive for a
non-anonymous person to rate correctly (to maintain his reputation),
sometimes an incentive to misrate regardless (like when you're advocating a
politically incorrect opinion), and the extra possibilities afforded by
anonymity in these situations (using a disposable tentacle to communicate
and/or misrate). This way, anonymity does make a difference even in an
uncoerced situation.

Agreed. If the topic of rating once again surfaces, for whatever reason, we
can always pick it up then. For now it does seem interest is minimal.
