Dear Freedom Premium Services Customer,

Zero-Knowledge is introducing Freedom Privacy & Security Tools 3.0, the next generation of its online security software for consumers. 
This new software includes a personal firewall, form filler/password manager, ad manager, cookie manager and keyword alert. As a 
result, we are focusing our main development efforts on this product as well as other software solutions providing online security.

As such, I regret to inform you that Freedom Premium Services - Anonymous Web Browsing and Private Encrypted Email - will be 
discontinued as of October 22nd, 2001. 

This decision was not taken lightly. It reflects the ongoing high cost and limited returns of operating the Freedom Network - the engine 
that drives the encryption and anonymity process. This is especially true since our customers and partners increasingly choose to 
purchase ready-to-use solutions that provide security and safety online - such as personal firewall, password manager and keyword 
alert - rather than nym-based services. 

For the past two years we have worked very hard to develop and maintain a sustainable private network and we thank you for all your 
support of our endeavor.. We share your disappointment and we apologize for the impact this decision will have on your online 
activities. 

For detailed information regarding the process we will be implementing to shutdown the Freedom Network, please visit us at 
www.freedom.net/prem.html. This link contains important and critical information pertaining to your e-mail accounts as well as our 
special refund policy. We strongly recommend that you visit the above link.

Freedom Network shutdown overview:
A partial network shutdown will occur on Thursday, October 11th, 2001:
 	Freedom nym mailboxes will not accept any more incoming mail as of October 11th, 2001.
 	You will still be able to retrieve mail sent to your nym mailboxes prior to October 11th, but only until October 22nd, 2001.
 	You will however be able to send mail and browse anonymously until October 22nd, 2001.
A complete network shutdown will occur on Monday, October 22nd, 2001:
 	All the Freedom servers will be taken offline.  
 	You will no longer be able to browse anonymously or, send and receive nym mail.


The complete Freedom Network shutdown process and timetable is available at www.freedom.net/prem.html.

Refund Policy overview:
Effective immediately, Zero-Knowledge will be accepting refund requests until November 22nd, 2001.
All users who have purchased Freedom Premium Services as of January 1st, 2001 and later are eligible for a full or partial refund or a 
free copy of Freedom Privacy & Security Tools 3.0.

The complete Refund Policy and detailed eligibility information is available at www.freedom.net/prem.html.

Please send all refund requests to store@zeroknowledge.com. Use your regular email to ensure timely follow up from customer 
service. Please do not send us emails using your nyms to avoid any delays in getting help. Freedom nym mailboxes will not accept any 
incoming mail as of October 11th, 2001. 


We deeply regret that we are unable to maintain the Freedom Network and we wish to thank you for custom and for your understanding 
of this difficult decision we had to make.

Sincerely,

Hamnett Hill
EVP, COO


PS: We apologize for the fact that you may be receiving multiple copies of this email. Since we are unable to make a correlation 
between your real identity/true email address and your nyms, this email was sent to every active nym on the Freedom Network.
