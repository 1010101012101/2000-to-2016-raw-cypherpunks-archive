It was recently concluded that there was no foul play involved in his tragic
death. The arguments are convincing enough. However, it has not been
concluded yet if he was somehow involved in or had knowledge about the
wiretapping, and whether this might have been a factor in his suicide.

Yes, it might have been clumsy operation-wise. Clumsiness was involved in
last year's incident in Italy: "it was a trail of casual cellphone use that
tripped up the 19 purported CIA operatives wanted by Italian authorities in
the alleged kidnapping of a radical Muslim cleric".
http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/28/cia.phonetrail.ap/. On the other
hand, no publicly available information has linked the locations of the
phones involved in the Greek wiretapping with foreign agencies. Various
opinions have been voiced on who might be behind this affair, but no
accusations have been made against the US or any other government.

"One telephone was listed to an inconspicuous Greek-American at the US
Embassy. Journalists learned the phone had been lent to the embassy's Greek
police security detail." http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060320/kiesling

The investigation is still ongoing. It will be interesting to read the final
report.
