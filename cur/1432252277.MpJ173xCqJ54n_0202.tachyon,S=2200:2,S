   And if you look back, it's clear that 99% if not all repression
in the US comes from exactly that basis -- all the sex laws, porn
laws, drug laws -- the intolerant, hate-filled christian mindset that
says sex is bad, mental freedom is bad, pleasure is bad, the wilderness
is bad and must be tamed, subjegated, and "civilised", that the environment
is for humans alone to exploit, that other religions and cultures are
evil and must be suppressed and "rehabilitated" and re-educated as they
did with the Indians.
   Isn't it time for freedom loving people to wake up and start dealing
with the basic problem in the world and especially the US -- christianity?
