Not everyone is equally evil, and even when they are equally evil
not everyone is as immediate a threat.  Roosevelt allied himself
with Stalin, Reagan found himself fighting the same enemy puppet
regime as Pol Pot was fighting.

Hollywood is not TCPA, though there seem to be disturbing
connections, and Palladium is not TCPA either.

Hollywood wants to turn computers users by law into passive
consumers of content generated by large corporations.  Microsoft,
despite all of its sins, has very different and less evil
objectives.

TCPA looks to me suspiciously like a stalking horse for the
hollywood program.  As yet, I do not know what the case is with
Palladium.
