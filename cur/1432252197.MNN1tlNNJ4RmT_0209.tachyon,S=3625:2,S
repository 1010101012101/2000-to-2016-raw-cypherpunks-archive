What thuggish behavior. Kudos to the Village Voice for publicizing this.

I've been accosted (though not arrested) for taking photos on public
sidewalks/streets in Washington, DC. The two times that come to mind
were before 9/11. Photos of the Feds in question:

>From the Village Voice of April 10:

"Watching the Detectives
"The NYPD wants to take your pictureB-but beware
of turning your lens on the cops"

<http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0615,ferguson,72804,5.html>

"But police evidently aren't so keen on
surveillance when the cameras are turned on
themB-particularly when those cameras show them
abusing free-street-parking privileges.

"On March 27, two volunteers from the advocacy
group Transportation Alternatives were detained
for taking pictures of police officers' private
cars, which were parked on the sidewalk outside
the Fifth Precinct in Chinatown. The volunteers
say they were held and questioned at the precinct
for about 20 minutes and instructed to erase the pictures.

""It was intimidating. I was afraid they were
going to arrest me," says Brian Hoberman, 37, who
works as a researcher for the city's Rent Guidelines Board."
