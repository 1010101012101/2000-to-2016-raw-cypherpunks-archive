I don't think I said that, you put it in quotes, implying I did.
It's an okay paraphrase though, so we'll take it like that.

More like I said, without regard to what you DEALT for, the is
no impetus on the "man" to pay what was agreed to. If you don't
like it, you will be deported. This does a nice job of creating
a new, even lower class. It substantially lowers the bar for
wage negotiation. The US Department of Labor has already published
guides for business outlining how to avoid paying overtime.

This new work of the Bush, just really helps cap the issue.

The ditch diggers in question, were -as a group- being paid
(I asked) $500 to put in that run of conduit. As there 
were six of them, and it took a couple of days, well, do the
math. 

Much cheaper than renting a ditchwitch and operator.

They had done this before, and would do it again. Some runs go
better than others, and I'll be some days they might actually
make as much as a 7/11 clerk. But not many.

What happens when the "man" arbitrarily decides to stiff them
from their payment? 

Will the labor department come to mitigate? Or will immigration
come to deport? 

What's more likely under the proposed "guest worker" rule?

Who can sell their labour for whatever they want? 
I am only aware of folks who can sell their labour for what
the market will bear. 
As long as they only want the status quo, well, then that's
fine. 

When the market will only bear 90p, 
Well, making the note on the townhouse is gonna be kinda
tricky, ain't it?
