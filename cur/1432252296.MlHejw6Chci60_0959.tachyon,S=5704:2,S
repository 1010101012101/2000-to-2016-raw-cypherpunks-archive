You clearly can't to wait for individuals to be symptomatic, you have to
detect eposures.  The point, however, is that exposure itself isn't a
high risk given appropriate, timely, treatment.

The Economist is now reporting on "instant screening":

    Oct 18th 2001
    From The Economist print edition

    Instant screening for anthrax is now possible

    [...]

    Unfortunately, the two established methods for identifying anthrax
    and other microbial contaminants involve time-consuming laboratory
    techniques. One is to try to culture an organism from the powder,
    and then subject it to a barrage of chemical tests to identify it.
    The other is to amplify and identify its DNA . The first takes days,
    and the second is a sophisticated technique that few laboratories
    are yet able to manage. So, even if the result is negative, chaos
    may already have been caused and the act of terrorism rewarded.

    A better solution would be to screen on the spot. And technology to
    do this is now available. It uses a test strip, costing $20, that
    looks like a pregnancy-detection kit.

    The Guardian Bio-Threat Alert System is a joint development by
    Alexeter Technologies, based in Wheeling, Illinois, and Tetracore,
    of Gaithersburg, Maryland. It takes 15 minutes to react to the
    presence of anthrax, and it is the only rapid field test now
    available. 

    [...]

Apologies if this was already posted here.  Search of my inbox doesn't
turn it up.

Peace.
