Neonazis run out of York 
(english)
by Baltimore IMC
11:16pm Sat Jan 12 '02
Black bloc and the working class (black, white, puerto rican, jewsish, men, 
women, young and old) kick the nazis out of York.
Anti-racists showed up early morning in York, scouting locations and 
smashing all the white supremacist vehicles they could find with small 
scuffles with any white supremacists they could find.
The black bloc marched around for awhile, found some hammerskins in a 
parking lot and scuffled before the police divided the two groups. Everyone 
went around the corner and there the Nazis were held for about 3 hours 
during Hale's speech (which people opposed to Hale form York took up
much of the space so that nazis couldn't attend, rumored that it got so 
crowded the cops shut the meeting down and pushed everyone back to the 
street). People chanted and yelled, and a few people were arrested after 
some snowballs were thrown.
When the library emptied out, that's when we saw more National Alliance 
people like Bill Roper and Erica Hardwick. All this time the anti-racist 
side continues to swell as it is joined by the working class in all the
diversity that is in York: black, white, puerto rican, jewsish, men, women, 
young and old.
When the white supremacists tried to leave as the police protected their 
exit, local kids led folks through an alley (York is a maze of alleys, they 
are everywhere), to confront the nazis. The nazis got beat on for awhile 
before the cops were able to come to their defense. They push everyone back 
(the bloc is now dissolved throughout the community), and police attacks 
and arbitrary arrests of black bloc and York locals continues to piss off 
the crowd and build solidarity. A black blocker had her arm broken (or 
atleast severly injured) in this confrontation, but the
anti-racists dished out more damage than they took.
At this point everyone is in the parking lot where the Hammerskins 
originally carpooled, and the police had abandonded it to protect the 
nazis. Many of the vehicles are adorned with confederate and other white 
power stickers in their windows, those windows don't last much longer as 
the black bloc begins to demolish them. The cops make several charges to 
clear the lot to allow nazis to get to their vandalized trucks. Again the 
cops continue arbitrary arrests even harassing the medics, which really 
turns the crowd against them. Most of the easy exits from the parking lot 
are blocked by clumps of protestors. Repeated efforts by the cops to clear 
a path through the crowd fail.
Eventually, the police have the nazis trying to escape down an alley. Local 
crews lead the black bloc the way through alleys to catch the nazis at the 
other end. At one of these alleyways one of the nazis trys to run down the 
crowd with his white pickup truck hitting atleast one person
(black bloc, sprained shoulder by He's doing well :), possibly others, 
including a young local girl which again really pisses of the locals. The 
nazi flees back down the alley toward the parking lot, where the cops sieze 
his truck.
Now whatever nazis could escape, try to going along different routes and 
protesters attack them everywhere they find them, alley to alley, street to 
street. Lots of busted windows and bloody nazi faces. In one confrontation 
with another white pickup truck with white supremacist stickers, busted out 
windows and packed with nazis... after being attacked by a crowd, on of the 
nazis waves a gun and the crowd backs down.
Elsewhere nazis are harrassed and chased out of the city. Literally, they 
were run out of town.
There were 25 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct who were all released 
by the evening. Two people had bails set at $500, which were paid, and 
another has a bail of $25,000 and been charged with "assaulting a police 
horse".
The best part of it all is that they were run out of town by multi-racial 
working class crews spontaneously organized (though using the organized 
anarchist/anti-racist action presence as a seed to grow) kicked the nazis 
out of town.
