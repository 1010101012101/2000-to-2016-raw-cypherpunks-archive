"After Alex Roy set the transcontinental driving record, he waited a
year to come forward – until the statute of limitations expired on
every single illegal act he committed. Ed and Dave waited less than
three weeks."

(a great story involving strategic preparation, musical flow...
risky, daring, record-breaking in mass surveillance context)

'A sunspot is an area of the sun where the magnetic fields have gotten
all twisted up. "You get a tangled bunch of magnetic fields, and they
get too tangled and too stressed, they end up erupting," said Holly
Gilbert, a solar physicist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.'

Designing an acoustic diode  // metamaterial
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-acoustic-diode.html

"How the Acoustic Diode Would Work:  Sound waves easily flow in two
directions. Yet in nature, total reflection of sound in one direction
is known to occur at the air-water interface. This gave investigators
the idea that an acoustical diode could be constructed by transmitting
acoustic waves using an asymmetric prism to create total
unidirectional reflection."
