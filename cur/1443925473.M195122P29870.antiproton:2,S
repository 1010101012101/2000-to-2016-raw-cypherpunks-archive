Sorry, but debt is supposed to be something incurred in a time of need
which you are generally able to repay in a mutually acceptable timeframe.
When you start pushing 100yr schedules, you're approaching lifetimes
of humans and govts themselves, funny that structuring ;-)

The US can't repay $18T to anyone in 10 or 25 or maybe even 50 years
without cutting everything else it does to near zero. And that doesn't
include it's unfunded liablilties.

And for the idiots out there... paying debt out of, or mooting debt
via, "growth"
is unrealistic... the geopolitical competitive status (and the closed
cycle nature
of) the planet precludes that kind of growth. Interest rates are backwards,
housing is still rape, etc. Economists these days have to be liek WTF bro?
Have fun, suckers...

The Govt doesn't agree to your terms.
It will have to get seriously fubar before it does.
And at that point you're done anyways.
