The distribution of printed material is now a crime.


Hate Leaflets Distributed in San
Fernando Valley Neighborhoods

(Van Nuys, CA) -- Los Angeles Police say
they are investigating the distribution of
Anti-Semitic hate leaflets found in a Van Nuys
neighborhood. A police spokesperson referred
to the distribution of the material believed to
have taken place between Monday evening
and yesterday morning, a "hate incident." The
                          Jewish Defense League is urging the LAPD
                          and FBI to investigate the incident as a hate
                          crime. JDL spokesperson Brett Stone says
                          residents in Encino and Sherman Oaks called
                          to complain about the leaflets he says were
                          distributed by a group calling itself the
                          National Alliance.
