If you're concerned with the future of the Internet:

How does America get gigabit, open and ubiquitous, broadband 
telecom infrastructure?

The goal of this conference is to outline the history of the 
last 25 years, discuss the current market issues, then give 
a view of the future of broadband and telecom in the US that 
has been mostly untold in the media. It is a future that 
leads to ubiquitous, very high speed networks based on an 
infrastructure that is open to all competitors -- giving 
customers choice, lower prices and new quality products and 
innovative services. And widely acknowledged as critical for 
long term economic growth.
