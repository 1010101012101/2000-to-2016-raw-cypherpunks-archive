It's certainly not broad enough -- it protects "encryption" research, 
and the definition of "encryption" in the law is meant to cover just 
that, not "cryptography".  And the good-faith effort to get permission 
is really an invitation to harrassment, since you don't have to 
actually get permission, merely seek it.
