No they don't! Privacy has to do with two (or more) parties wishing to 
collaborate to prevent third parties from eavesdropping. DRM has to do 
with one party attempting to control everyone else's ability to reproduce.

If these are related to each other at all, they are what mathematicians 
like to call duals. IMO.
