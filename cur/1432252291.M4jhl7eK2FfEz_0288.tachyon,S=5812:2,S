The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri|led 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantial recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
slight|y, you wil| still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
