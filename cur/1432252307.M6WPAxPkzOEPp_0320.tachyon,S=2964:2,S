Actually it may be quite rational.  A certain percentage of the 
population may
be self-medicating for type 2 ADD (nicotine fills in for acetylcholine 
that they
lack).  Some others use tobacco to focus and tune out the really high 
levels
of environmental noise and distraction that are part and parcel of 
modern society.

Some others may do it just because they like it.  Man, cypherpunks has 
really
gone down quite a ways when members are advocating who should be allowed
to consume what and when. Next it will be laws to stop people from 
blowing their
noses in restaurants.  I say let people go to hell in their own way.  
Cigarettes or
Jack Black or cocaine.

But this is typical in the overly 'politically correct' society.  The 
one thing that
really amazed me when I moved to Colorado is the number of middle aged
hippie types that 30 years ago were blasting the establishment for 
controlling
what they wanted to smoke have now *become* the establishment.   A 
professor
friend of mine was smoking some Drum and shooting the bull with me in 
Pearl Street
Mall (in Boulder).  Some new ager comes by and reprimands him for 
generating smoke.
He wasn't even a middle-aged hippie.  The middle-aged hippie types are 
now
running the city council, living in $500,000 homes and laying down nazi 
laws
for the rest.

Hypocrites. Animal Farm come true.  Sometimes I really wish for the 
70's. Cheesy
clothes and Jimmy Carter were small threats to world order.
