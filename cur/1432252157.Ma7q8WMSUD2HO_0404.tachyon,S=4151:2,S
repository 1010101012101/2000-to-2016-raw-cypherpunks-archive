Obviously it is insane to use keys that you do not yourself control 
to keep secrets.  That, however, is not the purpose of TCPA/Palladium 
as envisaged by Microsoft.

The intent is that Peter can sell Paul software or content that will 
only run on ONE computer for ONE time period..

When the motherboard emits blue smoke, or the time runs out, 
whichever happens first, Paul has to buy new software.  If prices are 
lowered accordingly, this might be acceptable.
