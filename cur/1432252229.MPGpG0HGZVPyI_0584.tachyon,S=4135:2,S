I use two kinds of filtering:

1. Mail filters. For nearly 10 years, I used Eudora and Eudora Pro. Now 
I am using OS X Mail, but may switch to Entourage (packaged with 
Microsoft Office). All of these mail filters are incredibly easy to 
learn to use. (Being that OS X is largely FreeBSD, I'm sure I could use 
regular expression filtering, but so far, no need.)

2. Eric Murray's lne.com node, which filters out any source not 
subscribed to the list, basically.

Choate and mattd get filtered into the trash by my own filters, though I 
can see their posts in the garbage if I get bored. (Also, mattd doesn't 
consistently filter into the trash properly...no idea why. If I manually 
run the filters, it works.)

Filtering mail is a necessity these days.
