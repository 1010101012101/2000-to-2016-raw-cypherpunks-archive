OK, Mr Donald...you're shittin' me, right?

>Has anyone who does not look a terrorist done a suicide mission
>outside Israel or Russia?

If you define a suicide mission a priori as the act of a terrorist (I guess 
I do), then by definition anyone who performs such an act is a terrorist. 
Therefore, anyone who performs a suicide mission looks like a terrorist. 
Guess it's simple, then eh?

Yer trollin me, I just know it! YAAGH but I can't help myself...I gotta 
respond! I guess it's OK then if we don't allow strange looking people on 
the planes. Come to think of it, I think YOU look like a terrorist...

OK, so you not only want to stop anybody odd looking from getting on an 
airplane, you want near-welfare, minimum-wage HS dropouts be responsible for 
determining what "odd" means?


>Just don't let anyone who looks like the shoe bomber fly.
>Problem solved.

Huh? The one flaw in this logic is that this only works if you can send this 
particular definition of suspicious "looks" backwards in time. The 
shoe-bomber is a particularly interesting case, as I believe the dude was 
ethnically British. He might have looked odd from the photo you saw 
circulated in the press, but I'd bet a lot of money no one would have picked 
him as looking like a terrorist. However, since we now know about what the 
shoe-bomber looks like, it should be relatively easy to stop his genetic 
clones or identical twins from boarding planes in the future. "Problem 
Solved" indeed. However, this might not work against people that DON'T look 
like the shoe-bomber.

Hum. An interesting, Stalinist logic. Well, Stalin was on a certain level 
immensely practical. I say we build a big electrified fence around Cobble 
Hill Brooklyn and fuck 'em...SOMEONE in there is definitely Al-Qaeda, 
therefore let's assume everyone in there's guilty until proven innocent.

So likewise would you agree that if any non-citizen US soldiers (there are 
10s of thousands non-citizen soldiers in the US) are captured in the 
numerous future wars, then they captors have the right to execute them on 
the spot? Uhm...no Geneva convention or anything? What the hell, it's a 
free-for-all anyway!

Wow. Since Iranians are Indo-European (ie, white), then in the event of war 
with Iran would you advocate rounding up all Americans of Indo-European 
ancestry? Does this have to be "pure", or should we grab the African 
Americans too (which have large % of Indo-European genes)?

Oh wait, most of the Afghans are Indo-Europeans too. So if you're arrested 
then you'll certainly understand that we're really just protecting the US 
from your possible collusion with your relatives in Afghanistan...

What seems to be clear to me is that you believe that your opinions 
originate from some self-consistent logical framework that is "unpopular" in 
some quarters. What also seems clear to me that it's really an inconsistent 
hodgepodge thrown up around the real goal, American domination at all costs, 
damn the logic and damn the consequences.
