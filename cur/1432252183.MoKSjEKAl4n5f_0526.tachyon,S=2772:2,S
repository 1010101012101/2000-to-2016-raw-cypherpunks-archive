Odd - I've been receiving these in random order.  Blame Canada, I guess.
In case nobody's mentioned it, one of the predecessors to
http://www.anonymizer.com/ was "The Great Web Canadianizer",
which, y'know', turned web pages into mock Canadian, eh?
At least the Saturday Night Live Frozen North version, eh?
So you'cd have some brews n donuts while getting your web pages
translated outa yankee and hidin where they come from, eh?

It's also useful for dealing with the US crypto export laws.
Let P and Q be big primes, eh?
				Thanks!
