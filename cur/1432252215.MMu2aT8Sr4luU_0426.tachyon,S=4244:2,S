There's a flaw in this argument:

People would go to theaters to see the film in all of its glory, true.

But the theaters would no longer, in your scenario, have to fork over 
money to the studios.

(Unless you are positing some situation where anybody may download any 
film, but then not display it to others. Or that theaters would face 
special regulation by government, etc.)

In any case, I know a _lot_ of people who watch most of their films on 
cable or satellite or DVD. And cable/DVD sell through is an important 
part of studio revenues. An end to copyright would have a _significant_ 
effect on revenue.

Note that I'm not endorsing copyright as it now stands, just disputing 
your point that ending download restrictions would have no effect on 
studio profits.
