I use Eudora, as I'm very comfortable with it (so comfortable, in fact, 
that it's my primary reason for booting Windows at all.)

The version I use, 5.1, *does* support STARTTLS for POP over both the 
regular port 110 as well as alternate ports, as well as user-defined ports. 
It needs some tweaking, but the capability exists.

I don't know about IMAP, as I don't use IMAP to get my mail.
