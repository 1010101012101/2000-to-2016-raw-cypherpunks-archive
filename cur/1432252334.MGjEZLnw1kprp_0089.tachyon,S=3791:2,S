Clay Shirky has some good thoughts on this in his essay 'The Group Is
Its Own Worst Enemy', found at
http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html

[big snip]

I've been on and off the list for years, mostly as a lurker,
occasionally as a poster. Up until last month (or so) I thought the list
had died. I remember that the S/N radio went way down and toad.com was
going to drop the list a few years back.

Some of the list 'goals' have been achieved, we now have good solid
crypt that we can use. We have operating remailers (although they really
need to be more user friendly). For me personally the biggest obstacle
is time. As I've gotten older I don't seem to have the time to focus on
following discussions in 10 different lists, or work on dozens of
projects.
