Good point.  Do you think there is a critical mass point where developers
would "just say no", though?  Certainly this would tend to push out smaller
independents and could do major damage to freeware.  I'd be much less
inclined to write for an OS where I had to pay for the privelege of running,
even though I wanted to give my software away.  I hadn't planned any
Whistler/XP apps anyway, and this just reinforces my decision.

I couldn't agree more!
