Are we sure this idea (and TIA) wasn't actually floated by those same Psyops 
boys? Something seems a little strange about the notion that they'd 
telegraph their intentions on this idea. Seems to me if they wanted to do it 
they'd just do it, and possibly not even announce their involvement in it, 
creating a string of shell companies to fund their international terrorist 
operations...Oops. Sorry, that's Al Qaeda I'm talking about.
