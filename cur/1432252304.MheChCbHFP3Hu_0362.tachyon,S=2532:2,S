It is reported that the journalists deliberately withheld details
which are available in Snowden's original documents. Somebody
better leak these, fast.

The claims are that some code and magic constants have been weakened,
but also that NSA still has problems with some methods.

We need to know.

Obviously, as a short-term workaround there's fallback to
expensive/inconvenient methods like one-time pads, but long-term
we obviously need new cyphers. Not tainted by any TLA poison.
