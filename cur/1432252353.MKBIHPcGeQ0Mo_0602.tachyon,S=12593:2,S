Title: Orient Express

   Note: Although this article of Sept. 12 is a little outdated by
   new findings, it certainly offers food for thought!

   Orient Express

   By Israel Shamir
   
   Like the Four Riders of the Apocalypse, the unknown kamikaze
   rode their giant crafts into the two visible symbols of American
   world domination, Wall Street and the Pentagon. They vanished in
   flames and smoke, and we do not yet know who they were. They
   could be practically anybody: American Nationalists, American
   Communists, American Fundamentalist Christians, American
   Anarchists, anybody who rejects the twin gods of the dollar and
   the M-16, who hates the stock market and interventions overseas,
   who dreams of America for Americans, who does not want to
   support the drive for world domination. They could be Native
   Americans returning to Manhattan, or Afro-Americans who still
   have not received compensation for slavery.
   They could be foreigners of practically any extraction, as Wall
   Street and the Pentagon ruined many lives of people all over the
   globe. Germans can remember the fiery holocaust of Dresden with
   its hundreds of thousands of peaceful refugees incinerated by
   the US Air Force. Japanese will not forget the nuclear holocaust
   of Hiroshima. The Arab world still feels the creeping holocaust
   of Iraq and Palestine. Russians and East Europeans feel the
   shame of Belgrade avenged. Latin Americans think of American
   invasions of Panama and Granada, of destroyed Nicaragua and
   defoliated Colombia. Asians count their dead of Vietnam war,
   Cambodia bombings, Laos CIA operations in millions. Even a
   pro-American, Russian TV broadcaster could not refrain from
   saying, `now Americans begin to understand the feelings of
   Baghdad and Belgrade'.
   The Riders could be anybody who lost his house to the bank, who
   was squeezed from his work and made permanently unemployed, who
   was declared an Untermensch by the new Herrenvolk. They could be
   Russians, Malaysians, Indonesians, Pakistanis, Congolese, as
   their economy was destroyed by Wall Street and the Pentagon.
   They could be anybody, and they are everybody. Their identity is
   quite irrelevant, but the Jews already decided: it has to be
   Arabs.
   One would think, after Oklahoma, we should become less hasty
   with our conclusions. But my countrymen, Israeli politicians are
   impatient folk. The flames in Manhattan did not die out yet,
   they started political profit taking. Mr Ehud Barak came live on
   BBC, and said `Arafat' within three minutes flat. On CNN, his
   twin Bibi Natanyahu appropriated the blame to Arabs, Muslims,
   Palestinians. Shimon Peres, an old wizened wizard, spoke against
   suicide as a psychiatric adviser, reminding his audience of
   Palestinian attacks. He looked worried: it is hard to enslave
   people who are not afraid to die. This old killer of Kana even
   mentioned Gospels. Density of Israelis on the air approached the
   saturation point. They insinuated and incited, pushing their
   shopping list into a chalk-white face of shell-shocked America:
   please, destroy Iran! And Iraq! And Libya, plees!
   The first twenty four hours of maximal exposure were utilised by
   the Jewish propaganda machine to its utmost. Not a single fact
   was yet known, but racist anti-Arab slurs became a commonplace.
   While we Jews quite reasonably object to any reference to the
   Jewishness of a bad guy, we really do not mind producing
   revolting racist drivel of our own. A good Jewish-American
   activist, James Jordan, warned in al-Awda: "Making broad,
   all-inclusive statements and insinuations about "Jews"
   completely marginalizes and discredits your organization". But
   how come the endless stream of 'broad, all-inclusive statements
   and insinuations', about 'the Arabs' did not 'completely
   marginalized and discredited' the Jewish organisations and media
   who practice it? Apparently, it is a Jewish right to decide who
   will be marginalized in America and who will not.
   The connection was in the minds. The American Jewish
   supremacists want to turn all the world into Palestine, where
   the natives will enjoy harsh local rule and limited local
   rights, while the master race will have a rather different level
   of life. Israel is just a small-scale model of their new brave
   world of globalisation.
   As there were no hard facts against Palestinians, the Israelis
   made their damnedest from the scenes of joy shot in East
   Jerusalem. It is a rather weak point, and I'll tell you why. In
   Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, her favourite
   detective M. Poireau encounters an unusual complication: all
   passengers on board the train have had a good reason to bump off
   the unpleasant old lady. My dear American friends, your leaders
   placed your great country into the old lady's shoes.
   Israelis used the event to the max. They even killed some ten
   Palestinians and destroyed five Goyiish houses in Jerusalem. The
   reports were rather gleeful, in the style `we told you', and the
   experts of Israeli TV concluded by one o'clock, the attack `was
   good for the Jews'. Why? It would strengthen American support of
   Israel.
   The kamikaze attack could do exactly that. America could enter a
   new cycle of violence in its troubled relations with the world.
   Revenge will follow revenge, until one of the sides will be
   obliterated by nuclear blast. It appears president Bush prefers
   this course. He declared war on his and Israel's adversaries.
   Bush did not even understand that the war was declared by the US
   many years ago, only now it started to come home. So many people
   are sick of America's ham-fisted approach, that the countdown
   for the next attack began.
   Alternatively, America could see this painful strike at her Wall
   Street and her Pentagon, as the last call to repent. She should
   change her advisers, and build her relations with the world
   afresh, on equal footing. Probably she should rule in the
   domination-obsessed Jewish supremacist elites of Wall Street and
   media, part company with the apartheid Jewish state. She could
   become again the universally loved, rather parochial America of
   Walt Whitman and Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Abe Lincoln.

         "And the mind - may God preserve you - is more prone to
         deep sleep than the eye. Neediest of sharpening
         than a sword. Poorest to treatment. Fastest to change.
         Its illness, the deadliest. Its doctors, the rarest.
         And its cure, the hardest. Whoever got a hold of it, before
         the spread of the disease, found his sake. Whoever tried to
         wrestle it after the spread would not find his
         sake. The greatest purpose of knowledge is the abundance
         of inspiring thoughts. Then, the ways to go about one's   
         needs are met." -- Al-Jahiz ("Puffy"), 9th Century Baghdad,
         Kitab at-Tarbi` wat-Tadweer ("Squaring the Circle"), p. 101,
         Edited by Prof. Charles Pellat, Institut Francais de 
         Damas, 1955.
