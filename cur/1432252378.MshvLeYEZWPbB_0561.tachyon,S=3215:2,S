Hi. I'm trying to get information on NAMBLA and found your post on a random 
search. I'm having trouble locating NAMBLA. The website seems to have been 
stopped. I've written to someone else (a former secretary of the group) but 
thought I'd try you as well.

Some close friends suggested it as a good place to join, chat and make 
friends with similar interests.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Larry
