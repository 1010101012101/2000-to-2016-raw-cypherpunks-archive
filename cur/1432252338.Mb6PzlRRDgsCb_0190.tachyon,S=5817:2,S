Something I've never bought before - "Globe" 4/17/2001 - has
compromising photos of John Walsh and another babe.

    "Caught! America's most perverted host"

He's been married 29 years, but apparently his new fame (Wanted)
has led him to keep mistresses and take pictures of them when
he gets head! Alrighty!

Yet another person claiming to be morally superior, exposed.

Of course, he's shirtless in one photo, and holding up his
tee shirt in another to flash his nipple (like a girl)!

<snicker>

When will they show Jeff Gordon fucking himself with his gun?
<BANG> oops...one too many anal clenches.

Next time you see Walsh covering one of the FBI's 10 most wanted,
remember that he's not wearing any underwear - he's too sexy for that.

#    Civil rights panel urges end to Indian sports names at schools
#    
#    By Greg Toppo, Associated Press, 04/13/01
#    
#    WASHINGTON -- Saying the use of Indian names and mascots may 
#    violate anti-discrimination laws, the U.S. Commission on Civil 
#    Rights called for an end to their use by non-Indian schools, 
#    colleges and universities.
#    
#    The commission said Indian names and mascots could be viewed 
#    as "disrespectful and offensive" by Indian groups and can create 
#    "a racially hostile educational environment that may be 
#    intimidating to Indian students."

How about a fire-breathing Reno?

Creator of Smiley Face icon dies at 79

By Associated Press, 04/13/01

WORCESTER -- Harvey R. Ball, whose simple drawing of a smiling 
face on a yellow background became a cultural icon, died Thursday 
after a short illness. He was 79.

Ball, who co-owned an advertising and public relations firm in 
Worcester, designed the Smiley Face in 1963 to boost the morale 
of workers in two recently merged insurance companies.

Ball was paid $45 for his artwork by State Mutual Life Assurance 
Cos. of America -- now Allamerica -- in 1963.

He never applied for a trademark or copyright, something his 
son, Charles Ball, said his father never regretted.

"He was not a money-driven guy," Charles Ball told the Telegram 
and Gazette of Worcester. "He used to say, `Hey, I can only eat 
one steak at a time, drive one car at a time."'

Bush virtual pet game popularity soars in China

By D. Ian Hopper, Associated Press, 04/13/01

WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of the downed U.S. spy plane, 
the Chinese apparently have found a new way to ridicule President 
Bush -- a virtual pet modeled after him.

While the U.S.-made PortaBush software for handheld computers 
wasn't released with much fanfare last week, it became a big 
hit in China very quickly.

The software's American designers noticed a huge traffic spike 
Thursday coming from China, at one point reaching about 2,000 
downloads in an hour and threatening to overwhelm their servers.

"About 80 percent of the downloads were coming from China," 
Eruptor Entertainment President Brad Foxhoven said Friday. "We 
just got too much traffic in such a short period of time that 
wasn't letting up."

Released a week ago by Marina Del Ray, Calif.-based Eruptor 
Entertainment, the software toy is similar to the faded Tamagotchi 
craze. Players feed their PortaBush, keep him happy and help 
him make vital national decisions like whether to bomb teen singer 
Britney Spears.
