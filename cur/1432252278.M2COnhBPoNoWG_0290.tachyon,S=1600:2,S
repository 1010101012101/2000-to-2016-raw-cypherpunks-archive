The largest man-made explosion is usually claimed to be Halifax (about 3000
tons of assorted HE's), but there are a pile of others that also count: Oppau,
Texas City, Port Chicago, Lake Denmark, Silvertown, Fauld (more explosives
involved than Halifax, but less loss of life, so Halifax seems to get all the
publicity), etc etc etc.
