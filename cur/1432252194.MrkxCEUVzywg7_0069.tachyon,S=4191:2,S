I think some sort of "fund the campaign of the first politician to succeed
in making said illegal behavior legal" is far more likely to have the 
desired results.

I would argue that politicians are far more predictable than jurors, and
then it's pretty clear you are making a free speech/change the law payout,
rather than do something most people would think is shady.

(Okay, most people think buying politicians is shady, but that feels like
a much easier public relations game to win than bribing jurors)

Anonymity is expensive, and if you can change the game to do what you wish
publicly, and transparently, I expect it will cost a heck of a lot less
per successful outcome.

Lots of lawyers will publicly advertise services for campaign engineering.
Very few will *publicly* advertise services for jury tampering.
