#    "It's just a matter of time before somebody dies or is seriously 
#    injured," said U.S. Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., a sponsor 
#    of the federal bill. "We have to get ahead of it."
#    
#    Nethercutt wants to expand the current legislation to protect 
#    plant lab research in addition to animal research.
#    
#    He's proposing to increase the penalties for terrorism directed 
#    against scientists.
