The third beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.6a is now available from the
OpenSSL FTP site <URL: ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/>.

OpenSSL 0.9.6a is a bug-fix release of version 0.9.6, and currently
contains 52 documented changes.  Among others, this release should build
on all Windows platforms, which 0.9.6 failed to do.  Just as for version
0.9.6, this one comes in two variants, one containing the now well-known
ENGINE code and one that doesn't.  The tar files are:

	openssl-0.9.6a-beta3.tar.gz
	openssl-engine-0.9.6a-beta3.tar.gz

The news section for 0.9.6a gives the following:

      o Security fix: change behavior of OpenSSL to avoid using
        environment variables when running as root.
      o Security fix: check the result of RSA-CRT to reduce the
        possibility of deducing the private key from an incorrectly
        calculated signature.
      o Security fix: prevent Bleichenbacher's DSA attack.
      o Security fix: Zero the premaster secret after deriving the
        master secret in DH ciphersuites.
      o Reimplement SSL_peek(), which had various problems.
      o Compatibility fix: the function des_encrypt() renamed to
        des_encrypt1() to avoid clashes with some Unixen libc.
      o Bug fixes for Win32, HP/UX and Irix.
      o Bug fixes in BIGNUM, SSL, PKCS#7, PKCS#12, X.509, CONF and
        memory checking routines.
      o Bug fixes for RSA operations in threaded enviroments.
      o Bug fixes in misc. openssl applications.
      o Remove a few potential memory leaks.
      o Add tighter checks of BIGNUM routines.
      o Shared library support has been reworked for generality.
      o More documentation.
      o New function BN_rand_range().
      o Add "-rand" option to openssl s_client and s_server.

The next (hopefully real) release is scheduled for Tuesday 2001-04-03.  To make
sure that it will work correctly, please test this version (especially on less
common platforms), and report any problems to <openssl-bugs@openssl.org>.
