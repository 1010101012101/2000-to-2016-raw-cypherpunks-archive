Just a note here, but this is one of the most common stereotypes 
about organized crime figures, and it's just not true.  These guys 
are businessmen -- they won't turn down a deal just because it 
happens to be legal. Organized crime figures are proving flexible 
and adaptable in their exploitation of opportunities to make a 
profit -- they are not interested in "illegal activity" exclusively, 
they just don't give a damn whether a given opportunity happens to 
be legal or not.
