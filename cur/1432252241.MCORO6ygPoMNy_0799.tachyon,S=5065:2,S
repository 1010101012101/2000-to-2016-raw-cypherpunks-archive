Bush alert over pupil's prank

              The threats to George W Bush prompted a major
              alert
              A UK schoolboy sparked an international
              security alert after he sent an e-mail to the
              White House, threatening to kill United
              States President George W Bush.

              The 14-year-old pupil at Blake High School
              in Cannock, Staffordshire sent the threats
              from a school computer.

              He was investigated and interviewed by the
              Special Branch, after the e-mail was
              intercepted by the US Central Intelligence
              Agency.

              The teenager, whose name has not been
              disclosed, was not suspended, but was
              severely reprimanded by the police and
              school authorities.

              A spokesman for Staffordshire County
              Council said the e-mail was sent in
              November last year, at the time of the US
              elections.

              'Several involved'

              "Several boys were involved in this, but
              only one was reprimanded by police
              officers who went to his home," the
              spokesman said.

              The council was in the process of drawing
              up guidelines for schools on internet
              security measures, he said.

              "We hope to keep incidents like this to a
              minimum in the future," he added.

              The school's head teacher, Heather
              Bowman, described the incident as "a
              thoughtless prank".

              It proved that, in an electronic age, all
              communications were traceable and
              attributable, Mrs Bowman said in a
              statement.

              "The school is well aware of its
              responsibilities and has good monitoring
              and security systems in place, which are
              constantly being updated," she added.
