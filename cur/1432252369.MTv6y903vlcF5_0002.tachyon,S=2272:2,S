   from the what,-no-trust? dept.
   [1]Orangez writes "Wired.com reports that 'business travel groups,
   security experts and privacy advocates are looking to derail a
   government plan to insert remotely readable chips in American
   passports, calling the chips [2]homing devices for high-tech muggers,
   identity thieves and even terrorists.' and that 'The 64-KB chips will
   include the information from the photo page of the passport, including
   name, date of birth and a digitized form of the passport picture.'"
