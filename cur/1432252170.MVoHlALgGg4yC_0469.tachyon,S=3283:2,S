Of course, anyone who advances fascism at this time is a *collaborator*

Maybe a tree will martyr itself by jumping into her way as she's
skiing...

                        Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm
                          Springs, on Friday warned
                          that the country should
                          prepare for a fight against
                          international terrorists that
                          will likely include personal
                          sacrifice, the use of ground
                          troops overseas and the risk
                          of retaliation against civilians
                          by the enemy.

                          In a wide-ranging interview, Bono gave dire
warnings
                          of an immediate future she predicted could
include
                          intense scrutiny of airline passengers, a
national
                          system of fingerprinting and identification
cards and
                          the specter of chemical and biological attacks
on the
                          United States.
