Subject: [mnet-devel] ONE_HOP_PRIVACY

A discussion on IRC [1] led me to implement this simple hack.  It makes it
so that all outgoing messages that can be sent through your preferred
relayer
are sent through your preferred relayer.  (If you turn on ONE_HOP_PRIVACY
in your broker.conf file.)  If you also turn on SERVE_USING_RELAY under
the YESNO section in your broker.conf, then the only peers who will learn
your actual IP address will be the relay servers that you use and the meta
trackers (with whom you must talk in order to get the IP addresses of the
relay servers, as well as to get the public keys of the various peers).

Needless (?) to say, this is not "strong" anonymity, as envisioned by David
Chaum, capable of hiding your traffic against dedicated NSA spooks.
It is, however, comparable to the kind of anonymity offered by networks
such as Freenet.

Regards,

Zooko
