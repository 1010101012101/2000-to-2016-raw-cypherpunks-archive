Dear Bush / Telinco - your user, <philchristian@bushinternet.com>,
sent the following email to the Cypherpunks mailing list.
We often get script kiddies trolling for passwords, contraband,
bomb-making materials, and the like.
It's a difficult decision whether to harass them in return,
or ask their internet providers to send them some Netiquette material.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any in the help files on your site -
it was mostly about how to get interactive TV schedules.

Phil - If you want passwords, ask your mother for one.
If you want Richard Stallman's ITS password, it's carriage return,
and by the time you get ITS up and running again, 
you'll have learned something.  Grammar's a good thing to learn also.
