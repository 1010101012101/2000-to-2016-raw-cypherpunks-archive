Workshop on Economics of Peer-to-Peer Systems 
Berkeley, California 

June 5-6 2003 

http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/p2pecon

 From file-sharing to distributed computation, from application layer
overlays to mobile ad hoc networking, the ultimate success of a
peer-to-peer system rests on the twin pillars of scalable and robust
system design and alignment of economic interests among the
participating peers. The Workshop on Economics of Peer-to-Peer Systems
will bring together for the first time researchers and practitioners
from multiple disciplines to discuss the economic characteristics of P2P
systems, application of economic theories to P2P system design, and
future directions and challenges in this area. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to: 

- incentives and disincentives for cooperation 
- distributed algorithmic mechanism design 
- reputation and trust 
- reliability, identity, and attack resistance 
- network externalities and scale economies 
- public goods and club formation 
- accounting and settlement mechanisms 
- payment and currency systems 
- user behavior and system performance 
- measurement studies 
- leveraging heterogeneity without compromising anonymity 
- economic impact to network providers 
- interconnection of P2P networks 

The program of the workshop will be a combination of invited talks,
paper presentations, and discussion. Workshop attendance will be limited
to ensure a productive environment. Each potential participant should
submit a position paper that expresses a novel or interesting problem,
offers a specific solution, reports on actual experience, or advances a
research agenda. Participants will be invited based on the originality,
technical merit and topical relevance of their submissions, as well as
the likelihood that the ideas expressed in their submissions will lead
to insightful discussions at the workshop. Accepted papers will be
published on the workshop website. 

Submission guidelines: 
Submissions of position papers are due March 27, 2003, and should not
exceed 5 pages. Two column papers are acceptable, but the font size
should be no smaller than 11pt. Papers must be submitted electronically
in postscript or PDF format to <p2pecon@sims.berkeley.edu>. 

Important Dates : 

Submission due: March 27 
Notification of acceptance: April 25 
Revised version due: May 22 
Workshop: June 5-6

John Chuang, UC Berkeley (chair)
