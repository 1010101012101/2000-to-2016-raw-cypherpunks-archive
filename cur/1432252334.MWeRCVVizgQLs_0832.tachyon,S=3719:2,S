Let's try to spell this out so even you can understand it, Jim. The
distinction is between killing combatants and killing noncombatants. Do
you get that? Location is incidental. Motive is irrelevant to the
definition. 

American revolutionaries killed British soldiers and their unfortunate
Hessian co-belligerents, not office workers in London (or Boston for
that matter). That's what makes them something other than terrorists.
