They want to pick up a parabolic dish, a LoS laser or a
phased array tracking a point source overhead, all sending
at maybe 5-10 W power?=20

Sure, if your sky is thick with mapping drones. Sounds like
a fifth world problem.

Isotropic radiators with high power are easy to spot.
Dynamic tight beams need at least a passing point of alignment
to get a position fix on the ground station. NSA sigint
used that microwave LoS interception, but this wouldn't
scale for millions of users and very brief low-power
bursts during random alignment events.

Or maybe you just buy http://www.ubnt.com/airfiber or the lower-grade
gear for LoS.

Phased arrays which are flat or half domes are compact and don't
look like anything from air. If you're clever, you can integrate
these into a PV panel.=20
