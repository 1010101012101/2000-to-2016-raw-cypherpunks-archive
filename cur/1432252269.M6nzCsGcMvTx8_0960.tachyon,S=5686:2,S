Here's a little something else I picked up from the same stupid website 
(you know...the one you say only promotes sex between teenagers and 
adults...) 

	 be boys with names like Jimmy & Joey ~ 
     let's say one of them is almost eight, raggedy-kneed blue- 
     jeans & an old slouch tweed cap, hair & eyes both the same 
     soft Venetian brown, body svelte as a Caravaggio 
     urchin-cherub ~ and the other ten-&-a-half, huge slightly 
     crazy green eyes, world record eyelashes, hair the color 
     of Lindisfarne-gospel goldleaf ~ wild enthusiasts, boastful 
     liars, agents of chaos, cuddle-monsters, extortionists of 
     toys & favors, fancy-dancers, dirty jokesters, natural-born 
     exiles from the Mundus Imaginalis ~ right! there must be 
     millions like them in these frozen flatlands, millions of 
     secret epiphanies in thousands of icy boxy little houses at 
     every point of the night-whistle-echoing nation ~ but 
     imagine just this once instead of staying on the Wabash 
     Cannonball or whatever Zephyr you disembark just here & now & 
finally 
     penetrate the mystery of these lost-town boys who might have waited 
     unknowingly forever for someone to notice their beauty, might have 
     grown old and heavy, square & dull without ever communicating 
     their dirty-sweet fragrance & sheer unreasoning joy to a 
     single poet ~ but this time you finally get off the train 
     in this godforsaken grain-embargoed cowburg ~ and thanks to 
     the whim of some nearly defunct amerindian pagan-pervert 
     genius locii this time at last you get to meet Jimmy & a 
     Joey who are precisely as imagined, feed them cheeseburgers 
     & pink shakes & bribe them with action-figures & gum, these 
     two microcosms, these two fire-clowns ~ so that all of us 
     in a moment of mutual unspoken relief at this shattering of 
     worshipful destinies, all of us suddenly gracefully have to 
     embrace & kiss, kiss chaste & cool on the lips & grin like 
     bobcats for this fortunate derailment, this whistle-stop, 
     this milk-run, this hobo's muscatel"
