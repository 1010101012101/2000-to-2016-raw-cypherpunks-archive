I got your point, my love, but I do try to refuse this kind of social
condescension, all these labels.  I am not weaker for being a woman.  I am
not a victim.  And yes, I think it's very disgusting when a person uses
their gender to get benefits.  And yes again, it was very depressing,
really unfair and nocive to see how some people managed their labels
against a "white North American man", being he really guilty or not.  :((

This kind of fake situation creates more prejudice, and more stupid labels,
and more and more social judgements.  The real victims of rape, of all
kinds of brutality and harassment, will lose their credibility, because of
stupid fucking liars and it's sad, unfair, wrong and very, very hurtful for
real victims!  :((

In the other side, I already told you I have transgender friends and make
volunteer work in LGBTQ groups, my love.  There are much hate and
intolerance against them.  It's really hard.

There is so much prejudice against them that it's really hard to discover
the limits between true prejudice or not.  Even working with them, in some
moments, involuntarily, I make horrible gaffes.  :(

Once, I was explaining that a female trans friend was born a man and was
waiting for her hormonal treatment and another trans friend said it was
very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,
genetics only, but I hurt a friend involuntarily.  :(((

Do you understand how hard is having sensibility enough to avoid hurting
fragile people, my love?  So, be careful, please.  Love you!  :*
