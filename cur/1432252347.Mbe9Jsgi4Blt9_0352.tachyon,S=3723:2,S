You're running these crypto modules on an MS OS? Plaintext is entered
via the PC HW/MS Drivers and then exists in memory on the MS system?
This probably describes the environment for most users, though not
necessarily most of those on this list. So why run any crypto at all? On
Linux, maybe, unless you installed a binary that was compromised or
there is a keyboard logger built into the chipset. But on MS it is
probably wasted cycles. Unless it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, I
guess. Maybe I'm just paranoid.
