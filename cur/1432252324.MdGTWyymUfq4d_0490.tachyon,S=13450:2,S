"Metacurrency"?
I don't understand this so I made up a word to go with it.

Seriously. How hard is it to understand that currency's are worth what
everyone thinks they're worth. Nothing more, nothing less.

Stating things like "You money can get physically stolen", "bitcoin went
through a bubble" like that never happens with other currency's!

How can something be good enough for buying money, but not good enough for
buying bread?

I predicted (literally told a friend with 300euro's worth of bitcoins at
the time) "Bitcoin is going though an enormous bubble right now, you should
sell." after which we discussed whether or not it was a bubble, he didn't
really know, and whether or not the bubble would bubble up even more. Now I
predict the people's refound trust in Bitcoins will cause a new bubble, a
(relatively?) much smaller one though, and that overall the value of
bitcoins will rise quite steadily.
