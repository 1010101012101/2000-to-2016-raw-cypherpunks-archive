	Well, I hate to be in the position of defending Jimbo, but he's 
right--in a sense, but not just about women.

	I'd be willing to bet (should there be a way of proving it to my 
satisfaction) that in every relationship, one party would like to change 
AT LEAST 2 things about the other party.

	Of course, this then makes every person who gets into any kind of 
relationship a "gold digger".

	Why do you assume it was a she?
