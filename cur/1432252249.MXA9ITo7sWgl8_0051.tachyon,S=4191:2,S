Meth is not fundamentally that different from Sudafed,
and the nasty chemical processes of extracting the sugar coating
and filler material and moving around a couple of methyl and hydroxy groups
and disposing of the bodies of the people you thought were ratting you out
to the police and the space alien biker gangs could all be avoided
if you could make it legally at a big pharma company.

Before the War on Drugs started helping us by making Sudafed hard to get,
the generic pills tended to be on sale for about ten cents per 30mg dose.
If I'm reading Erowid correctly, and guessing the kinds of quantities
a tweaker might use if it were readily available and nearly free,
a buck or two a day would cover all the meth you could use,
and you could easily make that much at a minimum-wage job in the
extra hours you've got that you used to waste sleeping,
and you wouldn't have to resort to crime unless it seemed like more fun.

Also, you could use somewhat calmer amphetamine relatives instead of meth;
can't be *that* much nastier than tobacco, and much of the cost of
legal pharmaceutical amphetamines today is the DEA paperwork.

Opiates are another drug for which crime would be unnecessary
if the stuff were legal.  The last time I got codeine for dental work,
I think I spent about $5 for 20-30 pills.   That's enough for a day of
Rush-Limbaugh-quantity abuse, and enough for a couple of days' worth
of withdrawal-prevention for an average addict,
and stronger opiates are similar in cost; opiate addiction
doesn't need to be as expensive as tobacco addiction.
By the way, if you've watched the TV medical drama "House",
the star is an acerbic doctor who's addicted to Vicodin,
as an after-effect of leg injury, and it's interesting to see the
wall of political correctness cracking a bit.
