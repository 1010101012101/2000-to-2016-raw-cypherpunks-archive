Yes, you are responsible. Being in possession of a illegaly copied movie,
software, .mp3, CD, book, etc. is in fact a crime.

Copyright is the default, not public domain. So you're saying that if
somebody takes something with intent to steal (even though) it isn't
really stealable then they aren't guilty?

I suspect a jury will not accept the 'I thought it was free' defence.

How is this different, it's still possession (or use) of property
illegaly. Simple ignorance isn't a defence.

No it isn't. You either develop it independently or you don't. You can
however take it without malice, which is what you're talking about.
Not the same thing at all.
