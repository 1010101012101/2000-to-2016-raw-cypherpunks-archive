I've no idea how any of these measures are supposed to inhibit *suicide* 
bombers.

http://eastbay.bcentral.com/eastbay/dailyedition.html has this to say 
about it:

BART will increase police presence throughout its mass-transit train 
system, close all station rest-rooms and remove all garbage containers 
from the platform level as part of heightened security measures.

Bay Area Rapid Transit will continue to monitor all trains in key 
locations, including both ends of the Transbay Tube between San 
Francisco and Oakland, a move that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist 
attacks on the East Coast.

BART also said elevators serving subway stations on the system will 
temporarily operate on an on-call basis, with users contacting station 
agents through an intercom.

BART, which carries more than 330,000 commuters a day, also is urging 
passengers to not leave packages, suitcases or other large items on cars 
or trains.
