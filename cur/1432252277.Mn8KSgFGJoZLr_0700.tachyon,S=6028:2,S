I ran this script on the current consensus. The full results (the
nodes-sniff-summary file) are below my signature. How did you compile
the country-codes to IPs list? That wasn't produced by the script.

It's comforting that this approach yields quickly diminishing returns.
Going from 25 to 60 networks only gets you a 10% increase in networks
surveillance (if I'm reading the output correctly), and returns plateau
entirely at that point (I'm considering about two percent to be in the
noise, which may not be appropriate to this domain).

Also, it's not immediately clear whether eavesdropping those networks
would actually get you strong enough correlation to accurately
de-anonymize users[1]. If our rodent(?) friend(s?) could comment on
this, I'd appreciate their expertise.

I also think that if it were possible for "unsophisticated law
enforcement" to deanonymize Tor users, they would already do it. If I
remember correctly, the Tor project gets a lot of requests from law
enforcement to deanonymize Tor users for them, which indicates that they
can't do it themselves (Andrew Lewman would be able to say if I'm
correct or not). 

I've also never heard of a conviction obtained through the use of this
material, though sophisticated TLAs might not much care. I wonder what a
search through the email dumps leaked by Anonymous in the past year for
Tor would yield. If this attack were possible in the wild, I'd expect
one or more of those contractors to be using it.
