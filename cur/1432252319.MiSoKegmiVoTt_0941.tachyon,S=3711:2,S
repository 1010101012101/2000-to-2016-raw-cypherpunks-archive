The cypherpunks list routinely receives posts from hotmail, aol and
other domains with the text "help me X", where X = something inadvisable
or even illegal.  Your query ranks right up there with these apparently 
clueless yet trolling, provocative solicitations - post something silly, 
expect silly responses.

Paladin Press regularly provides a catalog for bundling with one particular 
magazine, they advertise in nearly all the magazines of that particular and 
also in related genres.  I have seen their catalogs offered for sale by 
some reputable book/magazine sellers.

Not to mention, diligent searchers can easily find the Paladin Press website.

Are you a law enforcement officer searching for a good samaritan to 
prosecute, or are you just stupid?

Don't send me offlist mail.
