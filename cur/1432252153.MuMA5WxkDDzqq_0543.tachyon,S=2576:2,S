 But almost none of the money currently being awarded is going
to people with absestosis or mesothelioma.  It is almost all
going to people with "asbestos-related pleural and pulmonary

deviation from perfect health in any part of any person's
breathing system.

Yes, unnoticeable exposures to blue asbestos does cause harm in
a witchcraft like manner -- but while very few people have been
exposed to blue asbestos, almost all jury awards are based on
witchcraft like harm, where the person is harmed by some
imperceptible magical agent that is impossible to notice.
