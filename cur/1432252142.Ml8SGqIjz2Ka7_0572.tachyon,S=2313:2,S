'''In interviews with board members, they say the rationale for
creating the transit authority police is twofold: they had the legal
right to do it, and "it sounds like a cool idea."'''

also explains why they have been hiding listings recently
(particularly the Police listings moved from Monrovia to Gabriel):

'''The bizarre revelations could also cost the agency its contract to
operate in Monrovia. City Manager Scott Ochoa said he warned Maiwandi
early on that the city did not want him wading into police
business.'''

i bet they bought weapons and tactical body armor to equip their
police force too :)
