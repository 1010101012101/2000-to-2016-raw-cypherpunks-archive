 >>>> info cryptography
"Cryptography" is a low-noise moderated mailing list devoted to
cryptographic technology and its political impact. Occasionally,
the moderator allows the topic to veer more generally into security
and privacy technology and its impact, but this is rare.

WHAT TOPICS ARE APPROPRIATE:
   "On topic" discussion includes technical aspects of cryptosystems,
   social repercussions of cryptosystems, and the politics of
   cryptography such as export controls or laws restricting cryptography.

   Discussions unrelated to cryptography are considered off topic.

   Please try to keep your postings on topic.

MODERATION POLICY:
   In order to keep the signal to noise ratio high, the mailing list
   is moderated. The moderator does not forward off topic messages,
   messages that have substantially the same content as earlier messages,
   etc.

   Please not that the moderator does not always have the time to send an
   explanation of why a message was not forwarded.

TO POST: send mail with your message to
      cryptography@metzdowd.com

TO UNSUBSCRIBE: send mail to
      majordomo@metzdowd.com
   with the line
      unsubscribe cryptography
   in the body of your mail.
