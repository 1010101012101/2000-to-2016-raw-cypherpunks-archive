I did a double take on that too - I thought first "may be this is HTML
email not translating bold into text format properly or something".

I ended up reading it as follows:

   > > Best of luck
   > ASSCRACK. He's WAY too polite.

As in, Rayzer saying Boyce is an ASSCRACK, and not approving.

Then of course the "He's WAY too polite" comment could come across as
"if he were not so polite, he might not be seen as an ASSCRACK, and
would be doing his job properly, as it is, he fucked up."

But then my default "assume best intention" hat compels me to then
assume that Rayzer is a little socially inept, probably as a result of
vaccination damage causing a mild autism or something.

But then, he has demonstrated more than adequate capacity for being not
inept, and in fact quite intellectually incisive (if moronic in his
views - doublethink indeed).

It does seem to me has has failed to contemplate in depth on his
schooling/ indoctrination - at the very least.i
