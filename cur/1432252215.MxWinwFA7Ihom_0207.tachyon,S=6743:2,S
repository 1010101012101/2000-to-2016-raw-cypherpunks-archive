Truecrypt itself actually wasn't licensed under an OSI/FSF approved 
license, was it? I recall reading it had some strange clauses in there 
that they never elaborated upon that made it unsuitable for packaging.

What are the critical truecrypt features people actually want, that made 
it special? Trivial symmetric file encryption? That could be hacked 
together pretty simply. Or something more esoteric? Deniable volumes? 
Detachable headers? Keyfiles?
