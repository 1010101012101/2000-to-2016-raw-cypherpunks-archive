Well, Duh!  What kind of idiot stores memos (dangerous at the best of
times!) concerning wiretapping, and presumably its reasons and possibly
incidental commentary, in unclassified record stores?  What kind of
fucking idiot does that in the Hallowed Halls of Clandestenia, and more
importantly:  what kind of sclerotic retard goes looking for such records
with a bleeping FOIA request?!

That's what I want to know.
