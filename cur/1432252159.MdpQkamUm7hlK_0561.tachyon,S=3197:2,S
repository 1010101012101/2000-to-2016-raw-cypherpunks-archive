Rand supported taxes for the space program and for support of big 
business. So, yes, she was very pinkoid.

And like Rand, you have the same delusions about what's possible and 
what's not.

Your notion that "a gold atom cannot be distinguished from another" has 
anything important to do with issues at the crypto and traceability 
layers is symptomatic of this delusion. Hint: the alleged traceability 
of Federal Reserve Notes at the serial number level has absolutely 
nothing whatsoever to do with traceability of payments and the reasons 
we need digital money.

When a person deposits $10,000 and then writes a check to another 
person, or wires money, or withdraws cash, and so and so forth, do you 
think some record of the serial numbers was the means by which this 
transaction was traced?

Your foolish faith that "E-gold" is some significant step "because gold 
atoms look like all other gold atoms, because there is only one stable 
isotope of gold" is embematic of the delusions which the gold bugs and 
offshore platform silly people have.

And people wonder why the wrong issues are being worked on.
