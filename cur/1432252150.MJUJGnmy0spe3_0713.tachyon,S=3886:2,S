Indeed.

With all of the people running around claiming that data which are
pseudonymous are actually anonymous, it's no wonder that there's so
much confusion.

http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/0005pri1.htm

Trying to point out the property of pseudonymity and to highlight the
differences between privacy risks inherent to pseudonymous and
anonymous data is a great way to get yourself labeled a pedant, by the
way.  It never ceases to amaze me how some people will resist learning
something, even when such learning would clearly be in their interest.
