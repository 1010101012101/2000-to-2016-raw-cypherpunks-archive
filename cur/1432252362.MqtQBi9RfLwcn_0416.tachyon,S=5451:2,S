It's important to recognize some points,

-	It's a backup system, consider bad weather and emergency
	services. CB radio should be broadened to allow this on
	designated channels for the same sort of reasons.

-	Most people wouldn't be sending heavy packets all the time.

-	It would be useful for large audience broadcast (say a church
	wishing to broadcast voice_over_IP to its immediate neighborhood)

-	Your kids could have a 'neighborhood chat room'.

-	Some sort of encryption is required. (Which will be a lot
	easier sell after the IR search thing is found
	unconstitutional)

-	Maxim is making a 900MHz chip that supports 1Mb/s. Using burst
	and spread spectrum I suspect that a network with suitable
	bandwidth and routing rules couldn't generate more bits than
	it could handle with respect to distance between sites.
