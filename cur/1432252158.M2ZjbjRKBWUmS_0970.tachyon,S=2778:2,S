Please post the actual experiences about obtaining a
pre-paid cell phone (aka "mobile" in the less
developed
world) without revealing any (correct) identifying
info,
such as address, telephone no, name, etc.

I know that it can be done in Canada. Unsure about US,
UK and the rest of europe.

regards,
