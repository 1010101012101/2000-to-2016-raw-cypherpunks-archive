Mr Shaddack...

That's some interesting thinking there. The interesting thing is that no one 
might ever even notice the presence of this benevolent worm. It could go 
pretty much unchecked for a while.

As for Variola's comment, you might be right. I just assumed there's some 
kind of relationship between LSB and those spatial freuencies wherein image 
information might be stored. Actually, I would still think there's a 
relationship, in which case an Echelon-like approach based on ffts and 
"noise templates" might be going on (hence the usefulness of jamming).

Anyone got a TLA Operative Handbook? ANy mention in there of what kind of 
photos are best for Stego? How about cloud photos? (particularly where there 
are clouds of many different shapes and sizes present in the photo 
simultaneously.)
