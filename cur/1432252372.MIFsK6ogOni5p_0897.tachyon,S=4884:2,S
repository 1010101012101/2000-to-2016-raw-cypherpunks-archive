=====================================================

Calling all cyberhippies, geeks, artists, filmmakers, WiFi Superheroes,
technovangelists, computer builders/programmers/networkers/users,
robotic mad scientists and their cyborganic chimpanzee lab assistants,
liberty-lovin' lawyers, techeductors, wonks, weirdos, walruses, open
source hackers, octopodes, and friends of all of the above.

Come one, come all, and bring 20 of your friends. This is NOT the event
to miss.

Please help us by forwarding along this invitation to your friends and
fellow cybernauts.

=====================================================

EFF-Austin (http://www.eff-austin.org) proudly brings you the CyberDawg
2003 World Tour*** December 16th at Opal Divines in Austin, TX.

6:00-8:00 - eVoting Roundtable:

Join Dan Wallach, Computer science professor and security expert from
Rice University, for dinner and discussion on eVoting for the December
edition of the EFF-Austin Policy Roundtable.

Dan Wallach is a member of the team, organized by Avi Rubin of Johns
Hopkins, which conducted a scathing analysis of the Diebold voting
system earlier this year.

Dan will discuss the "threat model" for electronic voting. What can go
wrong with evoting systems, what was wrong with the market-leading
Diebold system, and what can geek activists do about it?

8:00-close - CyberDawg:

What happens when you bring together smart, creative, and passionate
minds together to do nothing but talk, laugh, and instigate? We're not
sure. We think it'll be an earth-shattering event, though... The
Singularity, even.

What is EFF-Austin? Who's working behind the scenes? What is it up to
these days? What madcap adventures are planned for 2004? Calendar of
events? How can YOU get involved in the fray? These questions and more
will be answered at the Cyberdawg.

If nothing else, you'll be in the same room with movers, shakers, and
instigators in the Austin Tech/Art/and Cyberliberties scene... That's
gotta be worth something, right?

=====================================================

*** CyberDawg 2003 will not actually go on a world tour. Just Austin...
For that matter, there probably won't be too many thrills, chills, and
spills or the gnashing of metal or screaming fans, either. But it will
be fun, nonetheless.
