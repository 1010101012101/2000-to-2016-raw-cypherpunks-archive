Firstly, there is nothing in the article suggesting that the "Sun" is 
acting under orders from the British government. In fact, the quotes 
imply otherwise.

"  We decided it was not in the national interest to reveal any of 
the book's more sensitive contents. " is one such quote.

Granted, the article goes on to say that the heads of the 
intelligence agencies want the book banned and even want Dame Stella 
prosecuted for violating the Official Secrets Act. The U.S. does not 
have such a broad ban on publication as the Official Secrets Act, but 
it certainly has its own constellation of laws, criminal and civil, 
regarding distribution of bits, export of bits, etc. Ask the inventor 
of the PhasorPhone about how he was banned from describing his own 
invention to others. (Patent secrecy orders, "classified in the 
national interest," codeword material, etc.)

Secondly, the U.S. has imposed limits on the writings of former 
agents of its intelligence services, contractually and otherwise. 
Former agents routinely have to seek permision to publish their books.

Thirdly, some folks in the U.S. have faced prosecution for 
publication of books and photos allegedly violating U.S. security. 
The "Jane's" case of several years back.

Fourthly, the U.S. sometimes resorts to extra-legal measures to stop 
those who write what it doesn't like.
