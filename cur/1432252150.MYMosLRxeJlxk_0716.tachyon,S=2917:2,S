Success against intelligence services may disrupt your career plans:

Adamo Bove, "a master at detecting hidden phone networks" had recently
traced proof of CIA special rendition and torture.  Last Friday, he was
found dead beneath a highway overpass.

In March, 2005, Costas Tsalikidis had discovered eavesdropping
technology on official phones in Greece.  Days later was found hung by
the neck in his apartment.


   http://alternet.org/story/40485/

"His death was ruled a suicide; he, like Adamo Bove, left no suicide note..."

"Were the two alleged suicides more than an eerie coincidence?  A few
media in Italy -- La Stampa, Dagospia and Feltrinelli, among others --
have noted the unsettling parallels. But so far no journalists have been
able to overcome the investigative hurdles posed by two entirely
different criminal inquiry systems united only by two prime ministers
not eager to provoke the White House's wrath.  In the United States,
where massive eavesdropping programs have operated since 9/11,
investigators, reporters and members of Congress have not explored
whether those responsible for these spying operations may be using them
for partisan purposes or economic gain.

As more troubling revelations come out of Europe, it may become more
difficult to ignore how easily spying programs can be hijacked for
illegitimate purposes.  The brave soul who pursues this line of inquiry,
however, should fear for his or her life."
