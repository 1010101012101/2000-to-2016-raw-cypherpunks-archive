When I worked for Citicorp in the late 80s we switched over much of our 
backbone to private fiber.  At the time I was shown detailed fiber routes 
for Sprint's network and after the meeting discussed how easy it would be 
for a disgruntled former employee to dig up multiple locations along their 
the often rural and remote routes and sabotage the entire network.  The 
scenario that particularly concerned me was trenching and installing 
electromechanical guillotines triggered by receive-only terrestrial pagers 
since a multitude of locations could be severed in any order and at 
will.  Although it might be possible to radio locate these it could be a 
grueling job.  Meanwhile the saboteur could extort at will and even plant 
new ones after areas had been declared clean.
