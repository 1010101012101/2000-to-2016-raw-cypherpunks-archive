2.7 had problems.  It's worked reliably for me since 2.8.  YMMV.

Sure.  Union mount the sensitive stuff over /etc as necessary.  CDs are
tamper resistant because they can be removed and carried.  Encryption is
not very useful as a tamper protection measure - it won't protect against
a DoS, or replacement of a partition with a trojan.

Encrypting system binaries is rarely useful.  It creates bootstrapping
problems and doesn't provide much benefit.  Encrypting /usr/local is
useful.

Let's take a step back - this thread started because you suggested
win2k's encrypted filesystem was more useable than openbsd's.  Now your
argument against openbsd is that it's not invisible.

Out of interest, can Windows boot from an encrypted disk?

Yes, there are many different threat models ranging from casual to
paranoia.  Neither win2k nor openbsd will satisfy the truly paranoid.  But
openbsd does have a useful encrypted filesystem.

You're welcome to whine about the loopback not being the right colour or
whatever.  Hell, I'd skip the loopback layer if I could.  In the meantime
I'll use what's available.  My /home partition is encrypted - is yours?

Encrypting data is useful.  Encrypting system binaries is of little value.
