There is a good reason that there are a large number of Mormons in the
service of the government.

Mormons are taught to obey authority from a young age. They are taught to
obey the government that is in power. They also have a very strong moral
code that is inflicted on them, as well as being taught not to drink or
smoke or have any of those other vices that might make them a risk to
those in power.  They only thing that might keep them out of higher office
is that they are taught to be honest.  (We won't go into the intelectual
dishonesty involved in the faith to begin with, but that is a rant for
another time.)

They also have been taught that the men of the church will save the
constitution in the last days.  (Which has a certain amount of irony,
since most high profile Mormons in public office spend a large amount of
time destroying the freedoms mentioned therein.)
