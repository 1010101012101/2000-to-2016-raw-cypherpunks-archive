No. BIND, at least, allows at least two root nameservers. Make one a
traditional one and one not. It's really an issue for the user and not the
nameserver operator.

Simply because you've minimized  the process's desktop doesn't mean it's
not running. The DNS is from your browzer and not Solaris. Kill the
browser and these querries will go away (eventualy, it sometimes takes
Netscape quite a while to actualy shut down).
