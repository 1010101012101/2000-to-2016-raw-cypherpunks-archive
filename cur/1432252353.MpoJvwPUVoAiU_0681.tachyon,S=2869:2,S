I've discovered this great online community service called
SmartGroups.com.  

I have created this group, 'Power Promotion', which I think you will also be interested in.  I've asked SmartGroups.com to send you an invitation to join, which should be in your inbox just after this email.

Email me back if you need any help on how to join, or what it's all
about...

Regards
