It's not a matter of credulity in believing that authorities would carry
out such an assassination, the problem is asserting such an act without
direct evidence. As I said, and as insider Richard Clarke said, it would
be difficult to show.

"What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is
that it's relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a
car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn't
want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn't want
the brakes on, to launch an air bag,"

"in the case of Michael Hastings, what evidence is available publicly is
consistent with a car cyber attack. And the problem with that is you
can't prove it."

It's a conundrum uncovering such operations. If the US has not taken
such acts yet, it, and others, will do so. It's akin to the older
problem of knowing if someone was poisoned in a way to appear as a
natural malady. Intel agencies have long used such measures.

 We were discussing this in chat.
 Someone suggested "sooner or later sploits like this
 will appear on black/gray sploits markets or even become
 public". Then likely car accidents will go up and
 maybe
mainstream media will cry "car/hackers injure human"
 (the other way is not news, it is statistics).
</blockquote>
 Some conspiracists conjectured this might have happened in the fatal,
 fiery crash of the investigative journalist Michael Hastings in L.A.,
 but without hard evidence it's the purview of the credulous prone to
 conspiracy theories rather than an actual one (of which there are many).
</blockquote>
Right, I mean the official story was such a credulous one, and no one in  
squeaky clean US power structure had any motive to eliminate an  
investigative journalist like Hastings.

Oh those credulous conspiracy theorists with their crazy theories about  
assassination via car hacking.
