This is true.  There's a huge disparity between what I see now 
and what I saw when I was really poor and had no degree.

I can't say that for sure...  I have had a friend from high school 
killed in what was later called an accident in a court of law.  But 
I think it's at least fifty percent likely that the court was wrong, 
or applying the standard of a "reasonable doubt" in a case where 
there wasn't enough solid evidence for a conviction.  

But I have had several people I've been close to die for some reason 
other than natural causes.  Mostly they just made mistakes with 
heavy machinery.  Mistakes with guns, by contrast, are mostly non-
fatal. People who did that blew off a few toes or messed up a hand 
or got some birdshot in their leg off a ricochet or something. 

Note that reputation is alive in that society; if it becomes known 
that you have made mistakes with guns, you are likely to find that 
no one wants to be your friend because you're likely to die or kill 
one of your friends accidentally. So it is often regarded as a 
shameful secret, and often people with minor gun wounds (such as 
a few pellets of birdshot from a ricochet) don't seek treatment 
for fear of the embarassment.

As Peter says, now that I live in the world of "educated professionals" 
such things simply don't happen to the people I know today.

In a grim fascinating way, it's just efficient use of human lives
as a resource in capital production.  Those who have the money, and
hence the power, are the ones who've most efficiently used their lives 
to produce capital. Most of them have made most of their production by 
causing others to be marginally more efficient under their management, 
but the principle is sound. They are protected, reflexively, by the 
organism of a human society and the very 'human nature' that you 
just mentioned.  If they were not so protected, we would probably
be a lot less efficient at producing functioning societies.  This 
is because we can't afford the loss of those who understand how to 
produce capital.  And we can't afford to protect all people as well 
as that group is protected. I do not claim that this is good, but 
as the pygmies say, "Eyali djamba.  Njamba, eyaliboye."  Roughly 
translated, "That's the jungle.  That's the way it is." 

And folks, the poor people, the ones who stop to think about it 
anyway, they know the score.  They know that nobody's going to 
have heads of state come to their funerals, or write books about 
what they have to say, or erect monuments when they die, and 
when they think about it, they know why.  If you don't have 
wealth, you have no proof that you've earned the right to matter.  

There are billions of them and they know damn well that as far 
as the people who matter are concerned any one of them can replace 
any other.  As someone from a family that lived well below the 
poverty line the whole time I was growing up, I can report that 
that much gets drilled into you in a thousand ways as a child and 
understanding it and accepting it is a large part of what it means, 
among poor folk, to be an adult.
