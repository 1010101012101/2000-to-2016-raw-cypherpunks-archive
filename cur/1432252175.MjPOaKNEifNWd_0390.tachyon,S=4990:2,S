A "tree" as the term is used in mathematics and computer science has a
single root.  A continuum has an infinite number of points in it.  A grid
... none of these terms has anything much to do with one another.

I don't know why you introduce hypergrids.  But you might consult a
mathematical dictionary - the term seems irrelevant to the current
discussion.

"The geometry on Earth surface is anything but whatever"?  Sorry,
this makes no sense.  However, a geodesic remains a path of minimal
length in the geometry under consideration.  Or so it was when I last
did some reading in finite dimensional metric spaces.

As the term is normally used, "peering" is the settlement-free exchange of
trafic between autonomous systems (ASNs). "Settlement-free" means that no
consideration ($$$) is paid.  This has bugger all to do with cabling.

Peering arrangements generally involve legal departments, and rarely
change once inked.

In the real world, peering policies normally reflect a mixture of common
sense and total misunderstanding of what the Internet is about.  Some
networks just peer with anyone; some have incredibly detailed contracts
and involve months of negotiation.

When senior management is involved, they quite often have a telco
background, and think that peering has something to do with SS7. That is,
they try to insist that the Internet is really just the same as the voice
telephone network, and BGP4 is SS7.  The results are often comic.

What do you think "nexus" means??

Conventional definition:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
n. pl. nexus or nexuses

   1. A means of connection; a link or tie: this nexus between New
York's... real-estate investors and its... politicians (Wall Street
Journal).
   2. A connected series or group.
   3. The core or center: The real nexus of the money culture [was] Wall
Street (Bill Barol).
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As Lewis Carroll tried to make clear a long long time ago, it isn't
very useful to conduct arguments by redefining words as you go along.
