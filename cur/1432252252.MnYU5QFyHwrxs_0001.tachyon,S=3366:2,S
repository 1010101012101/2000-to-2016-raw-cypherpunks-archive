Anarchy online,Prophet Without Honour: Anarchy Online Book One
"Only in his home town and in his own house is a prophet without
honour."
-Matthew 13.57
Prophet Without Honour begins in the year 29,475 on the planet Rubi-Ka. On 
this newly colonised world, orbiting two suns on the outer fringes of the 
galaxy, a series of momentous events will change the course of human 
history for all time to come. The war between Omni-Tek, the corporate 
entity with political and economic control over Rubi-Ka, and the rebel 
clans who fight for the freedom and independence of their people is just 
the precursor to a greater conflict that begins on Earth in the 20th Century.
Three central characters play out three converging roles - one strives for 
immortality, one for power and control, and one for the realisation of 
dreams and prophecies designed to bring humanity one step closer to its 
eventual fate. Spanning almost three hundred millennia of history - 
encompassing the fall and rebirth of mankind, the domination and 
destruction of a corporate hegemony.Etc at
