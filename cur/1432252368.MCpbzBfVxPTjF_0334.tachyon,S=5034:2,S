I've always been intrigued by the volume of reports which indicate that 
when hackers or other outlaws raid a corporate site, the first thing they 
do is scan the stored email files of company executives.

Funny, with all the attention focused pushing the user to encrypt email for 
transmission, no one ever suggests that Admins should/could store all email 
on the local mail server in an encrypted format.

Am I wrong, does some mail server do this?  If not, anyone got any 
suggestions for an efficient design?

Surete,
         _Vin
