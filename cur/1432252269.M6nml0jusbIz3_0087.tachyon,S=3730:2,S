All of the personality disorders are composed mostly of abrasive traits 
that are negative in nature. Maladaptive traits are usually favored over 
adaptive traits (though there are adaptive traits within all personality 
disorders) (Kantor, 1992, p. 10). PAPD is a particularly abrasive personality 
and interpersonal problems are readily identifiable. However, individuals 
with PAPD do not frequently seek treatment for relationship issues as they 
consistently blame others for the problems they have. Even if they do come 
in for treatment for a marital or parent and child problem, they will uniformly 
demand that the treatment providers "fix" the other person or persons who 
are at fault for the problems within the relationship.
