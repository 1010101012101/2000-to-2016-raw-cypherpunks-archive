Well said. SHA-1 works as a many-to-one function and this alone makes it impossible to break if
well applied.  Simply, no global inverse function exists for a many-to-one function (even
though a local inverse may exist, but in this case SHA-1 would not have been well applied).
This is a  mathematical fact. Matters with RSA are still unproven, though, but it is not probable
that it will be broken any time soon in a wide scale.

However, this is not what concerns me at all.  PKI is the problem.  It does not work and it
will not work on a global scale.  E-commerce itself has moved away from PKI for no other
reason.

The problem then is the E-sign Act and state legislation following on its heels, which
not only blurs IMO what a digital signature is but also does not deal adequately with the
liability issues for the different parties involved.

In this scenario, what if  we see a blind push for a global PKI and also include non-repudiation
as an "absolute authentication" based on some mythical "trusted  machines" -- as has been
suggested recently in the good name of e-commerce?

Cheers,
