Stewwwwieeeee!!!!

The man who personally told Mr. Pizza Connection, Looie "The Tap" Freeh,
the only man in legal history to make his AAG bones on wiretap data alone,
that the crypto pony was out of the barn and that he'd better hurry up and
catch it before it got away.

Pity he left on his Gucci loafers instead of changing into his Green
Wellies. Yuck, Looie, wipe off your feet before you go into the Oval
office, next time.

Cheers,
RAH
