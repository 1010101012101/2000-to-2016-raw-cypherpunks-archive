If this is an example of your communication style it's no wonder you've had the shit beat out of you by the cops and I wish them well doing it.  I have been arrested, jailed, lunched with ex State Attorneys, chatted with FBI, bickered with the NSA, watched homicide detectives get a statement from the person who butchered and dismembered my best friend, have an ex-cop relative, had a guy beat almost to death with baseball bats on my front step while the 'pigs' responded code 3 to save his fucking life, lived in warzone ghettos.  Don't tell me about not having any experience with cops.

Your incoherent ranting fails to account for there being good and bad on both sides of the blue line, and frankly I'll take a confrontation with a "pig" over a confrontation with a maniac like you any day.  At least they sort of screen out as many psychopaths as possible.
