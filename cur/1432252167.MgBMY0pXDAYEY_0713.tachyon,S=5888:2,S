Sure.

News articles are the WORST source for legal analysis.

It was clear.  I wanted to make sure to correct the common misconception among
cypherpunks that you can just thumb your nose at a court with impunity.  I
didn't believe that you were exhibiting this behavior, but failing to clear
things up often leads to misconceptions by others, who then cite the
erroniously intrepreted stuff to support their silly ideas about legal-immune
key escrow and etc.

It's a base conflict.  A legal education is the ultimate dose of practical
cynicism.  It quickly becomes apparent not that the law isn't perfect, but
that it is often pretty damn screwed up.  American jurisprudence is about
_fairness of process_, not justice, or right, or wrong.  The frustration that
IAAL types usually have is that IANAL types tend to cross the line from
criticzing the law to giving legal advice which is more derrived from their
dislike for the state of the law than a recognition of what it really is.

Well, again, the legal education process is designed around navigating through
the system, not mapping the behavior of governments.

Oh, I wholly agree.  And I believe this is a fully valid function for
cypherpunks.  Unfortunately, it often shifts into "you should design this
technical solution" - typically a technical solution which will end the
operated in jail.

To me the important distinction is to recognize what we want the ideal to be,
but avoid running afoul of the law in the process.

Agreed.
