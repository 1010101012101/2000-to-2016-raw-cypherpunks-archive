It's our last weekly chat of the year! Here are some notes:

in attendance: Zooko (scribe), Marlowe, freddyb, amiller, David-Sarah,
Warner (late)

* translation: Rana from the Tor project walked Marlowe through
    workflow; Their git repo is checked by transifex. Transifex git
    pulls their repo. The one thing we have to do manually is that
    transifex has no way to check for malicious coding added in
    translations, like XSS/injection-style attacks. Transifex maintains
    a glossary of "one-offs", words that appear. voulnet does
    translations for Guardian Project and Tor and would be interested in
    doing Tahoe-LAFS as well.

* Tenerife, Blake2

* ticket notes:
  #937, #1159, #1539: land them!
  #1240: probably ready to land
  #1525: if tests can be made to pass, land it!

  #1298: trivial, let's land it. If DS doesn't land by this weekend,
         warner will.
  #1643: DS will poke at it, else warner will try to fix
  #1679: warner will try to write a test, test_client.NodeMaker
  #166: DS will consider 166-3.diff, if no objections by this weekend,
        warner will land. The -d issue can be figured out for 1.11
  #1732: warner will try to write a patch this weekend
  #1802: warner will write the patch
  #1735: warner will review and land
  #1777: warner will land
  rest of 1.10 tickets: can be landed if simple, else kick out to 1.11

* 1.10: warner will make a push this weekend and over holidays. Goal is
        to get a 1.10-alpha1 out by xmas, then aim for 1.10-final by
        late January.

* leasedb
  * warner still needs to review davidsarah/1818-leasedb
  * we still need to implement starter-lease code before landing
    1818-leasedb, probably in january
  * DS will rebase 1819-cloud-merge on top of 1818-leasedb
  * DS decided to stick with separate SI,shnum columns instead of a
    single merged shareid column: sqlite accepts foreign keys and unique
    keys and handles primary keys well enough that quota-measuring
    queries (finding unique lists of shares owned by a given account)
    are simple, or at least they can't be simplified enough to justify
    the denormalization hit
  * DS will consider adding the additional leasedb state-transitions to
    the docs (COMING->GONE when the upload process is interrupted before
    the backend creates any part of the share object, STABLE->GONE when
    the shares are deleted out-of-band, GOING->GONE when the share
    deletion process is interrupted but completes anyways), even before
    those transitions are actually implemented.

There will be no dev call next week on 27-Dec-2012. We'll meet again
03-Jan-2012.

happy holidays!
 -Brian
