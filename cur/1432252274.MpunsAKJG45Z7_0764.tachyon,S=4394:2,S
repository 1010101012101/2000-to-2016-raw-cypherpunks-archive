Jim:

We're talking about ways to prevent some of the abuse to which 
remailers are subject. Not sending out plaintext gets rid
of spam, any suggestion that the remailer knows the
content of the message, and makes sure that the recipient
is a crypto-clueful person. 

I'm *not* talking about the remailer re-encrypting a message
before it's sent off to the recipient. I'm talking about the original
sender encrypting the message all the way to the recipient, so
the remailer only sees a 'next address' and an encrypted blob.
Your note indicates that you have failed to appreciate this
simple point.

This won't solve every problem, but it will solve many, and
make running a remailer a much easier choice.

BTW, how would you do key management and billing in a
system which is supposed to be anonymous? My suggestion could
be implemented tommorrow . How long would yours take?

Read more carefully before you post.
