There's no particular need to make it a single-image random dot
stereogram.  Double images are much easier to make and provide an extra
bonus (see below).  Here is an example from a post to cypherpunks on
September 23, 1997:

Using a monospace font, let your eyes separate so the text blocks merge
and you will see the word HI displayed.

To make this all you need is a random character generator to make the
left block, and copy it to the right block.  Then take the "pixels"
where you want letters to appear and shift them one character to the
left in the right-hand block.  Use the random character generator to
fill in the blanks which this shift causes.  That's it.

The hardest part would be finding a simple block font you can use for
the letters.

Now, here's the bonus.  This is a perfect cover for sending large amounts
of random data.  Put your favorite political or sports message in the
stereogram (GO BUSH) and use the random data for steganography.

In the example above the left block is a base 64 encoding of a simple
message.  Unix users can pass the stereogram through "sed 's/ .*//'
| mimencode -u".  For a real stego message you'd use encrypted data
without any headers so it looked purely random.  There would be no way
to distinguish it from any other source of randomly generated characters.

This could even catch on as a legal "thumb your nose at the spooks"
fad, people adding random sterograms at the end of their messages.
You could even have an active .sig which had a constant message but used
different random characters each time.  There typically wouldn't be any
hidden messages, but there would be no way to be sure.
