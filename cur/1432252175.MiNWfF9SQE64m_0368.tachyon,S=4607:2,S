Fuck 'em. We won, plain and simple.
And what is the persecution of Assange but some sort of revenge from a society
that has, all of a sudden, woken up to the reality of the global internet? Not
only is this cat out of the bag, but an identical cat is out of the bag in
practically every country on earth.

And as amusing as Sterling can be to listen to, if he thinks BlackNet didn't
happen then he has to be high: BlackNet has practically swallowed the internet
and it poops out free files all over the place. No doubt too there's all sorts
of anonymous transactions flowing in there.

Soon, the Pundits will be asking what diplomacy looks like in a world where
big secrets can't be kept.
