Rapist being hunted with DNA

London, , Apr. 28 (UPI) -- British authorities are using a new DNA
technique to catch a serial rapist and burglar, the Times of London
reported Wednesday.

Known as "ancestral testing," the technique aims to discover the
rapist's family background and narrow the number of suspects.

DNA samples taken from victims have established the rapist is descended
from native Americans, Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans.

Those samples also indicate the criminal's family originally came from
an island in the Caribbean.

Scotland Yard wants police and civilian staff from West Indian
backgrounds to provide samples so a DNA map can be created to pinpoint
the rapist's origins.

Police also are using another DNA technique to check criminal records to
see if a relative of the attacker has come to police notice.

The perpetrator is responsible for 84 burglaries, four rapes and 27
indecent assaults over 12 years. His sex crimes are against elderly
women.
