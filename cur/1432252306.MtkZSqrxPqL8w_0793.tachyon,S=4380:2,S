Other choices?

   Identity Theft
   Identity Pollution
   Identity Vandalism
   Identity Assault
   Identity Misappropriation
   (Slander in the First Person :)

Would it matter if we substitute "reputation" for "identity".  Is my identity
(to others) any different than the reputation with which it is associated?

Call it what you will.  If institutions that once recognized me fail now
to do so, I have lost something-in-general.

Name that something-in-general.

Cheers!
