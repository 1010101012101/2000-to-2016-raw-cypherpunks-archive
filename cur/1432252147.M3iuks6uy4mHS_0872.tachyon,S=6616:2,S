I work across the street from the Vesey Street location but I saw no one 
when I went out to lunch today. Which is not to say they weren't there, but 
it can't have been very large.

>A) asking the FCC to fulfill its regulatory obligation and investigate

>It's illegal and un-American for your phone company to hand over your
>phone records to the government without a legal order. But it looks like
>that's just what they're doing: violating the privacy and rights of
>millions of innocent Americans in the process.
>
>The phone companies have no right to forfeit your privacy. And just last
>night we learned that the FCC has refused to investigate these illegal
>actions, using the same "state secrets" excuse used by the very phone
>companies it's supposed to hold accountable.
>
>Today, the ACLU is launching a nationwide consumer campaign demanding
>that regulators do their jobs and protect our privacy. We need your help.
>
><Act now to stop phone companies from abusing your privacy.>

>It's outrageous that the agency created to guard the people's interest
>is burying its head in the sand during what may be the most massive
>abuse of customer privacy in American history.
>
>We can't stand idly by while corporations, federal regulators and even
>our elected leaders fail to champion our rights or uphold our basic
>system of checks and balances. The power to right these wrongs
>ultimately resides in the hands of the American people.
>
>The ACLU is filing formal documents with the Federal Communications
>Commission (FCC) insisting that they fulfill their regulatory obligation
>and investigate this breach of consumer trust. At the same time, ACLU
>offices across the country are filing similar demands with regulatory
>authorities in dozens of states.
>
>Regulators need to hear that the public demands action. The longer the
>list of names, the more powerful our message. Federal and state
>officials must use their authority to investigate and fine the phone
>companies, and your voice will make a difference.
>
>Act now to stop phone companies from abusing your privacy.
>
>We must not allow the government and the phone companies to collude in
>this massive illegal attack on our privacy and our trust.
>
>And we certainly can't wait for Congress to act, or for the phone
>companies to reverse course.
>
>Join us in telling the FCC that we won't take no for an answer -- they
>must investigate. And don't let the states follow the FCC's wrong-headed
>example. We are simultaneously filing 20 actions across the nation TODAY.
>
>Please add your name and your voice. All you have to do is use our
>online form. We'll add your name to our demand for FCC action and to
>local filings in applicable states. After you sign on, you can also send
>an email directly to each of the four FCC commissioners letting them
>know Americans want answers and action.
>
>Act now to stop phone companies from abusing your privacy.
>
>As always, thank you for standing with us. Every voice in this fight is
>going to matter, so please take action today.
