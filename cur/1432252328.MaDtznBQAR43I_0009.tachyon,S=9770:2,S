maybe it's off topic, but did any of you tried RetroShare?

I like how every data jumps only between trusted friends, so you can't
really share your IP with authorities.

Yeah, it has a negative side- you need to have trusted friends who use
it (of which I have zero sadly) and those must also be "well
connected". and if you add someone evil as a friend, he can watch you.

but I really like the idea.
