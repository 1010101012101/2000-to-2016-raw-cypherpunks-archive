That's exactly why some people argued against passage of the Bill of
Rights a couple of centuries ago: the listing of some rights in the BoR
would be taken as a complete listing. The Ninth Amendment is supposed to
counteract that, but it's so widely ignored as to be meaningless.

If the US Constitution does not clearly state that the federal
government is allowed to invade your privacy, they're not allowed to. It
doesn't matter how the Interstate Commerce clause is construed, nor how
"provide for the common defense" in the preamble is read: if the
Constitution doesn't explicitly give the feds the right to snoop on your
private affairs, they don't have it.



> Hell, at this rate we may see quartering of troops!...

The Third Amendment's prohibition on the quartering of troops has been
given as a possible defense for evidence gathered by snoopware. Is a
program, installed by a federal agent on a privately-owned computer, a
"soldier" for Constitutional purposes?
