Can you get put in jail for writing code? Sure. Just ask Dmitry Sklyarov.
Or read the old crypto regs. Or write a bot that posts child porn and
start it going. Lots of ways to run afoul of the law -- and that's in
the U.S., where we may even be a bit more liberal about such things,
and where some circuits even believe source code is free speech.

But it does not logically follow that just because you code something,
such as an anonymous mix or similar system, that you have broken the
law. In fact, you probably haven't.
