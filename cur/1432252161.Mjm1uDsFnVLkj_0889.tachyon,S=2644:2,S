Too late.  Stupidity is an entrenched aspect of the system.

If you try to remove stupidity (assuming for the moment that
it could be done in principle) stupid men with guns will 
hunt you down and shoot you in order to protect their
jealously guarded stupidity _and_ ignorance.  For as we
all know, and particularly in non-trivial fields of 
knowledge, knowledge often implies or demands action of
a particular kind, according to the logic of the situation.

Strategic ignorance is therefore extremely valuable -- 
particularly to corrupt government and corporate officers.
