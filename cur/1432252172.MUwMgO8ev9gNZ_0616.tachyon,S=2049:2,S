Reports today that commercial aviation is in dire danger of being 
grounded as freedom fighters deploy even a small fraction of the 
(estimated) 750,000 shoulder-fired missiles to down commercial 
airliners.

(Having sat on Pacific Coast Highway below the takeoff path of LAX 
jumbo jets, I can attest to the fact that they are literally just a few 
hundred feet above. Any van with a moonroof could trivially be set up 
to allow a pop shot at one of these 747s or 767s, leaving every couple 
of minutes.)

The U.S. and U.S.S.R. were handing these SFMs to any freedom fighter 
group that would temporarily swear allegiance to the CIA or KGB.

Now the chickens are coming home to roost.

I stopped flying in 2000.
