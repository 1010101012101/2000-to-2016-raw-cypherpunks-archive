Decryption in the
   case of CSS requires a set of "player keys" contained in compliant
   DVD players, as well as an understanding of the CSS encryption
   algorithm.  Without the player keys and the algorithm, a DVD player
   cannot access the contents of a DVD.  With the player keys and the
   algorithm, a DVD player can display the movie on a television or a
   computer screen, but does not give a viewer the ability to use the
   copy function of the computer to copy the movie or to manipulate the
   digital content of the DVD. --  JON O. NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.

Hey Judge, here's a clue: the fact that a licensed DVD player knows
a password to the content on a disk does NOT prohibit copying the
medium.

Here's another clue:
All your hollywood are belong to us; we just need the bandwidth to
swap them.  If DeCSS were wiped off the earth, licensed players would
still play swapped movies.
