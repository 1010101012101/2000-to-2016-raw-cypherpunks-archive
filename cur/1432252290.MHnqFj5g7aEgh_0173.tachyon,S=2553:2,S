Another possibility is that a large population of those with corrected
vision had their vision slowly degraded by the early applications of the
correction.  I have no experience with vision correction, but I know
anecdotally that most people with corrected vision need their corrections
strengthened throughout their lifetime.  In reality, their sight problem
may have stabilized (or even improved) very early on in the absence of
treatment.  Thus, our perception of what sight abilities the average
person in the United States has might be artificially deflated by early
and aggressive treatment.

Imagine putting back braces on all children that exhibited minor scoliosis
- and asking them to leave it there all their life.  If this were common,
we might be speaking about how back strength and lifting ability must not
be what they used to be...
