Well, Citigroup uses something called a 'Hobbling Terminal', which is 
basically the office suite in a sandbox.

But remember that a Java machine is far more than a virtual terminal, and I 
doubt many users of the future would even understand the difference between 
a machine as we know it and a Java machine. And in many places a Java 
machine will be far cheaper than a quad-core windows box (where 75% of the 
processing is used for Microsoft anyway).

Why does one ever need to leave the sandbox? Basically to run games. But in 
the US PC-only games seem to be fewer and far-between these days, as the big 
game consoles take over. In other words, the computer as we know it will be 
a Java machine (and likely not have windows inside it), and the console will 
absorb the games (and Windows) and maybe play DVDs too. And actually, I 
suspect this is exactly the future Gates envisioned right before he retired!
