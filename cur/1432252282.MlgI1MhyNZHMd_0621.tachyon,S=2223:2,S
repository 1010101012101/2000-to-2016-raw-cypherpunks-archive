RIAA/MPAA and US govt.are working on that. Stand by. I mentioned the
trend, but the point is that's not there yet. There are other countries,
which will take a lot of talking to and threat of economic sanctions,
before it happens. Trust-based BlackNets are really hard to penetrate --
you have to gain trust to join the network. A lot of the nodes will be
run by trojaned machines. A lot of these machines will be run on wireless
networks. Then there's anonymizing traffic remixing, and global
anonymized document storage -- it isn't, but it will be there, by the
time the threat becomes global. At that point a society has to make a
watershed decision, whether it's going police state, or will protect
pockets of privacy. So, no, I'm not over-worried yet. -- Eugen* Leitl
