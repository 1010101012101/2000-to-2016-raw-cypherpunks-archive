I don't know if he did, but of course there is no requirement in the 
U.S. that citizen-units either carry or present ID. Unless they are 
driving a car or operating a few selected classes of heavy machinery.

When I was surrounded by some cops who accused me of planting a bomb to 
blow up Reichsminister Clinton and his family, I refuse to "show them 
some ID." I also refused to let them look in my bag.

Despite their bluster, they had no grounds for their belief, no grounds 
for a Terry stop search of my papers, and no grounds to arrest me. So 
they neither searched my papers forcibly nor arrested me. They did, 
however, order me to leave the grounds of Stanford University, almost 
making me late for a talk before Margaret Rader's cyberspace law class, 
scheduled long, long before the First Fascist scheduled _his_ trip to 
Stanford.
