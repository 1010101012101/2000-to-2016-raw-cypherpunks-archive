Bad analogy. It is more like a radio astronomy list being populated by 
astronomers who support both the constant-expansion ("open") universe model 
and those who support the eventual-collapse ("cyclic") universe model. Both 
groups are astronomers, but because they are both intelligent people who 
support different models, the models are constantly refined to prove one side 
or the other.

Not supported by current evidence. 

A few years ago, this list was highly interesting, and highly volatile. 
Populated by libertarians, anarchists, crypto experts, feds, political 
science students, scientists, cranks, gun nuts, gun control nuts, etc. Now? 
Looks like you've driven most of the interesting people away. Who's left? The 
ones who agree with you? Where's the fun in that?

Don't you get tired of talking into an echo machine?
