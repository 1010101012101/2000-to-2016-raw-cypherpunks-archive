     No, it wasn't debunked at all -- no evidence was given, only
unsupported suppositions. If you only take one subsidy alone, the military
cost, oil has an absurd price, and that cost is rapidly going thru the roof.

     Biodiesel is a much better alternative than ethanol, but each has it's
place. All farming is subsidized at this point, biofuels have the potential
to make farming profitable again. Besides, as long as the oil industry has
even greater corporate welfae payments, why not? Speaking of program
subsidy, how about this:
