Hi guys,

I look at the thread and I'd like to comment on this -

 >I wonder why they didn't use IPSec.

I know IPsec/IKE reasonably well, and I just don't like IKE.
It's too generic, it's under-specified and it fairly big pain
in the ass to implement (I wrote libike a couple of years ago).

Except from being extensively peer-reviewed, the main benefit
of using IKE is a (supposed) interoperability with various vendors.
Since H doesn't need that I decided to go with a custom protocol,
which is nevertheless closely modeled after JFK and ESP.

Apparently there's a demand for this kind of service. I'm getting
at least couple of questions a day regarding proxy/socks support.
I very much doubt though that anyone in near future will be offering
a _free_ service of this kind.

Yes, that's exactly what we do. Server provides three core services -
* peer location
* tunnel mediation
* network management (ie peer grouping and group-level access control)

I'm severely lacking time for updating the website. I do try to answer
all technical questions via email though.

The presumption is correct.

That's obvious to paranoids like you and me :), but not to an average
consumer who just needs to play CS or AoE over a VPN.
