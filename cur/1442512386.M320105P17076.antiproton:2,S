Cells phones in 2016 will start to use Wi-Fi bands for LTE:

There goes our free use of spectrum.  There has been no adiquate effort by Qualcomm to demonstrate that LTE-U will compete fairly for band usage against Wi-Fi.

Much of what they tell - the conversations between Hitler and his generals, "knowing Hitler's most secret thoughts", and Hitler's message re Anzio which Gen Clark read - came from the breaking of the Lorentz SZ40, not the Enigma. Colossus, not Bombe.
