$1.2m PCs go missing
By RICK WALLACE
16jan02
MORE than 500 notebook computers were lost or stolen from federal 
government agencies in the past year.
The lost computers, some of which contain sensitive government documents, 
will cost taxpayers $1.2 million
And bureaucrats seem to have few clues about where they went.
Just two convictions have been recorded over their disappearance.
And with several large departments, including the tax office and defence, 
yet to report losses the toll could climb higher.
Telstra headed the lists of worst offenders for computer losses with 357.
The telecommunications giant lost 170 to carelessness and 187 to theft, 
costing $645,000.
But its performance was better than the year before, when it lost 1000.
The CSIRO, Australia Post and the Family and Community Services Department 
were among the other leading losers.
Along with taxpayers' money, the losses have also seen top-level government 
secrets lost.
A notebook computer that vanished from the Department of Industry and 
Resources contained a Cabinet document.
Another that disappeared from the Prime Minister's department contained a 
report from the Auditor-General.
Agencies that re sponded to the questions also lost another $332,000 in 
desktop computers and electronic equipment.
