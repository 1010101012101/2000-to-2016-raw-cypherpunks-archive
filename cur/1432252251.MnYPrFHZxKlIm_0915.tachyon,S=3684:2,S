King George II seems intent on drumming up support for a space 
weapons platform.  This is interesting for a couple of reasons. 

First, it looks likely to drive a massive wedge between the US 
and its current allies.  Nobody who can't afford to put up their 
own orbiting weapons platform is going to be happy about the US 
doing so. 

Second, it pretty much means the US is going to have to withdraw 
from the space treaty of 1965, which bans space weapons.  This 
latter is actually more interesting to me, because that treaty 
also bans national claims of sovereignty over off-earth property 
(or else Neil Armstrong would have been saying the ancient 
incantation, "we claim this new land in the name of...." when he 
planted that American flag on the moon in '69) and, more 
importantly, private claims of ownership on off-earth property.

As far as I know there is no direct legislation banning such 
ownership in the US -- so it looks to me like the US withdrawing 
from that treaty would allow US corporations to do things like 
register mining claims or other claims on the moon or other 
off-earth real estate, or a US expiditionary force to make 
a national claim of sovereignty over the Moon or Mars or 
whatever the next time there's a government-sponsored landing 
on either of those bodies.

If someone actually tries it, we'll se an interesting test.
Although, perhaps not coincidentally, a space weapons platform 
orbiting Earth is also exactly what you need if you intend to 
*defend* claims of national sovereignty on the Moon, asteroids, 
Mars, etc.
