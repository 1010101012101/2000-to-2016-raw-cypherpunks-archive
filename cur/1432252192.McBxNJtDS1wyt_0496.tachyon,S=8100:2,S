They can only do what the parents allow them to do. I would have told
the school to go fuck itself silly before I'd let them interrogate my
kid. As far as I'm concerned off school time and grounds they have no
say whatsoever.

Read about Vlad Tsepesh. In a private conversation with a recalcitrant
administrator it's what I would suggest as reading material to be
absorbed prior to decision-making...

I actually teach my kids to lie. Whenever some form pops up on their
browser they get pretty creative. The other day I overheard them making
up stuff to enter : male, 36, from Austin, Texas. Not bad for such
little sprouts.

When ( not if ) my kids get in trouble over some 1st issue, they will be
protected unconditionally and without reserve as to methods.
