What do you get if you cross Adobe with Jack Valenti?  An asshole who
jails the
guy who sells patch cords to connect VCRs...


Here's a video store owner doing time for profiting from illegally duped

material.   No circumvention devices needed.  This is just, proper, and
traditional
use of the law.


                        The man who sparked furious protests in
                        Little Saigon by hanging a poster of Ho Chi
                        Minh and flying a Vietnamese flag in his video
                        store is scheduled to surrender to authorities
                        today and begin serving a 90-day jail
                        sentence.

                        Truong Van Tran, 39, of Stanton was
                        charged with video piracy under state law
                        after police who were at his Bolsa Avenue
                        store in 1999 to protect him spotted 147
                        videocassette recorders in his shop, Hi Tek
                        TV & VCR, and later determined he had
                        17,000 bogus videos.

                        He was convicted in August 1999 and
                        sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years'
                        probation. He has been free on bail while he
                        appealed his conviction. The state Supreme
                        Court refused to hear his case in May.
