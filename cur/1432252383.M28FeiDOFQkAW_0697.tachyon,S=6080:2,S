I find myself compelled to advertise :-)

http://www.iang.org/papers/task_market.html
addreses this, and whilst the above comments
are highly applicable, I believe there are
ways forward.

See also the work of Eric Hughes, John Walker,
the AMIX, Robin Hanson and others.

Well, the problem is that you are asking too
much of one OS.  If you want stability, use
FreeBSD (we do).  If you want security, check
out OpenBSD.  If you want portability, try
NetBSD.

If you want to have fun, then Linux is good,
so I hear, but serious business finds itself
unsatisfied.  Mind you, it is getting a whole
lot better!

We've had a lot of success with open source.

My company published the Cryptix java library
back in '96, for purely selfish reasons.
Since then, a team of volunteers (including
our own people) have produced lots of versions,
and kept it moderately up to date.  (It's a
bit quiet now, the lists are down, giving
evidence of the unreliability of the open
source model ;-)

We had to write Cryptix, that was a business
requirement as we needed crypto in Java (and
Perl) and nobody had done it before.  But,
once done, I didn't want to pay to keep it
going.  So we open sourced it.  We got the
support and the updates for free, mostly,
thereafter.

I had to pay for bits and
pieces, sure, but when I paid about $6000
(all up) to get the OpenPGP library written,
it compared pretty well to the licence fees
that RSADSI was charging, of $25,000.  I
got a good price because the source then
got opensourced.  Everybody won.  And, I
had to do it anyway, because RSADSI doesn't
deliver OpenPGP :-(

(Of course there are alternate business
models.  Baltimore, IAIK, RSADSI are some
famous names that decided to sell their
crypto software and made a bundle on the
stock exchange.  But, when it comes down
to it, their model failed, because they
were seduced into the apparent gold mine
of PKI...  But that's getting distracted!)

There are other benefits to the open source
model:  most of the people who've volunteered
have boosted their CVs and picked up good
work because of it.
