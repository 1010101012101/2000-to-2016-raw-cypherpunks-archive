i see encrypted laptops and services fitting this bill, but i haven't
seen a ramp up of encrypted mail in this role.  perhaps i'm just not
looking in the right places.

[i didn't mean to dis encrypted mail quite as much as my previous
comments appear to in hindsight.  it certainly serves a purpose and is
used often in business.  but this is the only domain where i see it
used much at all, and even then, VPN's and SSL/TLS services are
overtaking many of the roles encrypted email used to fulfill.  just my
experience, and admittedly limited experience...]

enterprises are definitely encrypting. FDE and VPN's and SSL/TLS
services growing much more than encrypted email IMHO.  i'd be curious
to know how much of this is due to actual hacker threats, vs. data
spills and regulatory / industry standards compliance pressures.

pen registers for the intarwebs and social network analysis.  they get
most of what they want just watching those opaque bits move around...

i think encrypted torrents are the largest source of encrypted traffic
on the net.  this is purely speculation though; i'd love to see
numbers.  (encrypted torrents, easy.  encrypted mail, still too
hard...)
