Nothing wrong with warlords - right now they are doing a fine 
job of keeping the Taliban down.

What made it a breeding ground for terrorism was not civil war, 
but diminuition of civil war.  The problem was that the Taliban 
was damn near victorious.  If the US government had maintained
the relationship with our former anti communist allies, and
kept on sending them arms, we never would have had 9/11

The trouble was that the government abandoned our allies.   We
should have sent them enough aid to sustain permanent major
civil war against the Taliban.
