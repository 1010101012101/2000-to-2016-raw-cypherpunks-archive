Some do. "A. Melon" is attached to every post coming from one 
particular, fairly new, remailer. (His rant goes something like: "I'm 
a melon, you're a melon, the child pornographer next door is a melon, 
the anti-Iraq freedom fighter is a melon, the woman planning to 
poison the water supply is a melon, etc.").

"Secret Squirrel" is self-explanatory.

I was confused by the "A. Melon" usage myself: for a few hours I 
thought someone I was conversing with from the alt.fan.nietzsche 
newsgroup was the same "A. Melon" who posts here. Not so.

The owner of the remailer posted his explanation a few weeks ago. It 
may have appeared here on the list...I just don't recall. Search 
engines should turn it up.
