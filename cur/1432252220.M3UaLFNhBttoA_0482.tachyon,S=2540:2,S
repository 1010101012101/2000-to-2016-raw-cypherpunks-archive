Transferring home videos from tape to PC is a common and inexpensive 
consumer practice today.  Tapes are cheap and trashing them after use for 
recording of incriminating evidence is an effective way to get rid of that 
copy.  Once transferred to PC users can also now easily encrypt the 
videos.  Eventually only the ignorant criminals that record their crimes 
will be in such embarrassing situations.
