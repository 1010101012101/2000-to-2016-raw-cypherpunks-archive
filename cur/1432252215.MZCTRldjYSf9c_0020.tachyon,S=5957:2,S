It's called "Posse Commitatus," and it's clear that troops cannot be 
used on U.S. soil.

There have been a _few_ cases where regular armed forces were deployed 
in emergencies. Of course, the War of Northern Aggression was one 
massive terror action and the army was of course deployed.

The recent deployments in airports are of the National Guard. These 
units are under controls of _governors_ of states, and are not covered 
by Posse Comitatus. "Calling in the National Guard" has been common for 
many decades.
