that drilling operations at the Mosa 6-13-III well have commenced.
The Mosa 6-13-III wel| is the first of an initial two (2) we|| exp|oration dri||ing programs targeting 
the Gas prone Si|urian Grimsby formation encountered at a depth of approximately 2,10O feet.
Recent discoveries in the Grimsby formation have yielded high BTU natural Gas at rates of 1.2 to 4.2 mi||ion
cubic feet (MMCFD) per day.Individual poo| reserves may be up to 10 bi||ion cubic feet (1O BCF).

Company Profile:
BI0GENERICS LTD is a domestic oil and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy leader 
in today’s Energy market. The company’s shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oi| and Gas is Bush’s #1 priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principa| business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, held significant positions in biotechnology, fiber optics 
and other technology ventures that management believed cou|d prope| shareho|der value.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation – an oil and gas technology leader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas play was natural.
The Company’s other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to fi|e a Form 10 in the immediate future.
