Perhaps not every device, but maybe just one device you use for reading encr=

Want to Evade NSA Spying? Don=E2=80=99t Connect to the Internet<br>
<br>
BY BRUCE SCHNEIER 10.07.13 6:30 AM<br>

<br>
Since I started working with Snowden=E2=80=99s documents, I have been using a=
 number<br>
of tools to try to stay secure from the NSA. The advice I shared included<br=
>
using Tor, preferring certain cryptography over others, and using<br>
public-domain encryption wherever possible.<br>
<br>
I also recommended using an air gap, which physically isolates a computer or=
<br>
local network of computers from the internet. (The name comes from the<br>
literal gap of air between the computer and the internet; the word predates<=
br>
wireless networks.)<br>
<br>
But this is more complicated than it sounds, and requires explanation.<br>
<br>
Since we know that computers connected to the internet are vulnerable to<br>=

outside hacking, an air gap should protect against those attacks. There are a=
<br>
lot of systems that use =E2=80=94 or should use =E2=80=94 air gaps: classifi=
ed military<br>
networks, nuclear power plant controls, medical equipment, avionics, and so<=
br>
on.<br>
<br>
Osama Bin Laden used one. I hope human rights organizations in repressive<br=
>
countries are doing the same.<br>
<br>
Air gaps might be conceptually simple, but they=E2=80=99re hard to maintain i=
n<br>
practice. The truth is that nobody wants a computer that never receives file=
s<br>
from the internet and never sends files out into the internet. What they wan=
t<br>
is a computer that=E2=80=99s not directly connected to the internet, albeit w=
ith some<br>
secure way of moving files on and off.<br>
<br>
But every time a file moves back or forth, there=E2=80=99s the potential for=
 attack.<br>
<br>
And air gaps have been breached. Stuxnet was a U.S. and Israeli<br>
military-grade piece of malware that attacked the Natanz nuclear plant in<br=
>
Iran. It successfully jumped the air gap and penetrated the Natanz network.<=
br>
Another piece of malware named agent.btz, probably Chinese in origin,<br>
successfully jumped the air gap protecting U.S. military networks.<br>
<br>
These attacks work by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the removable<b=
r>
media used to transfer files on and off the air gapped computers.<br>
<br>
Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author. His latest book is<br>=

Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Survive.<br>
<br>
Since working with Snowden=E2=80=99s NSA files, I have tried to maintain a s=
ingle<br>
air-gapped computer. It turned out to be harder than I expected, and I have<=
br>
ten rules for anyone trying to do the same:<br>
<br>
1. When you set up your computer, connect it to the internet as little as<br=
>
possible. It=E2=80=99s impossible to completely avoid connecting the compute=
r to the<br>
internet, but try to configure it all at once and as anonymously as possible=
.<br>
I purchased my computer off-the-shelf in a big box store, then went to a<br>=

friend=E2=80=99s network and downloaded everything I needed in a single sess=
ion. (The<br>
ultra-paranoid way to do this is to buy two identical computers, configure<b=
r>
one using the above method, upload the results to a cloud-based anti-virus<b=
r>
checker, and transfer the results of that to the air gap machine using a<br>=

one-way process.)<br>
<br>
2. Install the minimum software set you need to do your job, and disable all=
<br>
operating system services that you won=E2=80=99t need. The less software you=
 install,<br>
the less an attacker has available to exploit. I downloaded and installed<br=
>
OpenOffice, a PDF reader, a text editor, TrueCrypt, and BleachBit. That=E2=80=
=99s<br>
all. (No, I don=E2=80=99t have any inside knowledge about TrueCrypt, and the=
re=E2=80=99s a<br>
lot about it that makes me suspicious. But for Windows full-disk encryption<=
br>
it=E2=80=99s that, Microsoft=E2=80=99s BitLocker, or Symantec=E2=80=99s PGPD=
isk =E2=80=94 and I am more<br>
worried about large U.S. corporations being pressured by the NSA than I am<b=
r>
about TrueCrypt.)<br>
<br>
3. Once you have your computer configured, never directly connect it to the<=
br>
internet again. Consider physically disabling the wireless capability, so it=
<br>
doesn=E2=80=99t get turned on by accident.<br>
<br>
4. If you need to install new software, download it anonymously from a rando=
m<br>
network, put it on some removable media, and then manually transfer it to th=
e<br>
air gapped computer. This is by no means perfect, but it=E2=80=99s an attemp=
t to make<br>
it harder for the attacker to target your computer.<br>
<br>
5. Turn off all auto-run features. This should be standard practice for all<=
br>
the computers you own, but it=E2=80=99s especially important for an air-gapp=
ed<br>
computer. Agent.btz used autorun to infect U.S. military computers.<br>
<br>
6. Minimize the amount of executable code you move onto the air-gapped<br>
computer. Text files are best. Microsoft Office files and PDFs are more<br>
dangerous, since they might have embedded macros. Turn off all macro<br>
capabilities you can on the air-gapped computer. Don=E2=80=99t worry too muc=
h about<br>
patching your system; in general, the risk of the executable code is worse<b=
r>
than the risk of not having your patches up to date. You=E2=80=99re not on t=
he<br>
internet, after all.<br>
<br>
7. Only use trusted media to move files on and off air-gapped computers. A<b=
r>
USB stick you purchase from a store is safer than one given to you by someon=
e<br>
you don=E2=80=99t know =E2=80=94 or one you find in a parking lot.<br>
<br>
8. For file transfer, a writable optical disk (CD or DVD) is safer than a US=
B<br>
stick. Malware can silently write data to a USB stick, but it can=E2=80=99t s=
pin the<br>
CD-R up to 1000 rpm without your noticing. This means that the malware can<b=
r>
only write to the disk when you write to the disk. You can also verify how<b=
r>
much data has been written to the CD by physically checking the back of it.<=
br>
If you=E2=80=99ve only written one file, but it looks like three-quarters of=
 the CD<br>
was burned, you have a problem. Note: the first company to market a USB stic=
k<br>
with a light that indicates a write operation =E2=80=94 not read or write; I=
=E2=80=99ve got<br>
one of those =E2=80=94 wins a prize.<br>
<br>
9. When moving files on and off your air-gapped computer, use the absolute<b=
r>
smallest storage device you can. And fill up the entire device with random<b=
r>
files. If an air-gapped computer is compromised, the malware is going to try=
<br>
to sneak data off it using that media. While malware can easily hide stolen<=
br>
files from you, it can=E2=80=99t break the laws of physics. So if you use a t=
iny<br>
transfer device, it can only steal a very small amount of data at a time. If=
<br>
you use a large device, it can take that much more. Business-card-sized<br>
mini-CDs can have capacity as low as 30 MB. I still see 1-GB USB sticks for<=
br>
sale.<br>
<br>
10. Consider encrypting everything you move on and off the air-gapped<br>
computer. Sometimes you=E2=80=99ll be moving public files and it won=E2=80=99=
t matter, but<br>
sometimes you won=E2=80=99t be, and it will. And if you=E2=80=99re using opt=
ical media, those<br>
disks will be impossible to erase. Strong encryption solves these problems.<=
br>
And don=E2=80=99t forget to encrypt the computer as well; whole-disk encrypt=
ion is<br>
the best.<br>
<br>
One thing I didn=E2=80=99t do, although it=E2=80=99s worth considering, is u=
se a stateless<br>
operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a persistent volum=
e<br>
to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever saved. Booting<b=
r>
Tails from a read-only DVD =E2=80=94 you can keep your data on an encrypted U=
SB stick<br>
=E2=80=94 is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof, but it grea=
tly<br>
reduces the potential avenues for attack.<br>
<br>
Yes, all this is advice for the paranoid. And it=E2=80=99s probably impossib=
le to<br>
enforce for any network more complicated than a single computer with a singl=
e<br>
user. But if you=E2=80=99re thinking about setting up an air-gapped computer=
, you<br>
already believe that some very powerful attackers are after you personally.<=
br>
If you=E2=80=99re going to use an air gap, use it properly.<br>
<br>
Of course you can take things further. I have met people who have physically=
<br>
removed the camera, microphone, and wireless capability altogether. But<br>
that=E2=80=99s too much paranoia for me right now.<br>
