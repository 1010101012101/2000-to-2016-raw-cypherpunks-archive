Necroposting, to be sure, but it's of relevance to Network 25:

CouchDB (http://couchdb.org/) is a NoSQL database server which is capable
of constructing massively distributed databases with very little effort.
Everything is stored internally as JSON documents, and the server speaks
HTTP(S) with a REST API, so you can manipulate it with a web browser (or
even wget or curl, if you've a mind to).  Applications are written in HTML
with JavaScript and stored in the CouchDB database itself.  To access them,
you just plug the URL of the CouchDB server into your web browser and use
it like any other website.  It runs well on remarkably underpowered
hardware I'm told.

PouchDB (http://pouchdb.org/) is an extremely tiny implementation of much
of the CouchDB API written in JavaScript and is designed to be embedded in
web apps.  When you access CouchDB apps that use PouchDB, PouchDB
transparently proxies requests and caches output from the Couch database.
Here's the nifty bit: If you go offline - your cellular reception tanks or
you have to disconnect from the local wireless net, you can continue to
interact with the web app in question as long as it's in your browser's
cache because it has a snapshot of all of the relevant data inside of it.
When you go back online, PouchDB synchs up with the CouchDB instance
elsewhere...

I have a subprocess researching this combination for Project Byzantium - I
think we can implement the massively distributed microblog with it, among
other things.

For a truly distributed Network 25, we might want to consider researching
and making use of whatever CouchDB socnet apps exist.
