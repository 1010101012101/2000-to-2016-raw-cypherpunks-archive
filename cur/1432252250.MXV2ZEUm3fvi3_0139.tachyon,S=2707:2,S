Probably, -if- it were in Philips best interest. It isn't. What -is- in
Philips best interest is to change their standard so that they can license
exceptions to this. This means they are in a position to monopolize the
market of DRM in regards CD technology.

An additional strategy Philips may be trying is to close down CD
technology and force the market into some newer standard that would allow
Philips a longer-lived income stream. What sorts of patents and IP does
Philips have in DVD technology for example?
