I happened to catch some of the confirmation hearings on CSPAN last 
night.  Of particular interest was John Ashcroft's responses to 
Dianne Feinstein's, (D-Calif.) questions.  Basically Ashcroft stated 
that both Brady and the assault weapon bill are constitutional and 
that he supported their continuance.  He said something to the effect 
that "We need to move forward on these issues". He also mentioned 
that he favored closing the "gun show loophole" (A view shared by 
Republican sellouts).

On both 1st and 4th amendment issues, John Ashcroft has one of the 
worst records on Capital Hill. Ashcroft sponsored the 
"Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation
Act" would have criminalized certain drug- and drug policy- related 
discussions on the Internet, and would have allowed police to conduct 
secret searches of homes, with the residents never being informed 
before or after that the police were there.

It is my opinion that Yale grad Ashcraft is a phony conservative 
(aside from the abortion issue) and phony constitutionalist.

Please visit http://www.StopJohnAshcroft.org today and help stop the 
appointment of John Ashcroft as Attorney General -- or, just call the 
Congressional Switchboard at (202) 224-3121, twice, have them 
transfer you to each of your two Senators in turn, and urge they vote 
"no" on the Ashcroft appointment.

Regards,  Matt-
