And the escrow services can do so anonymously (without lifting the
veil behind the nym-rep)?  Then this third party would let you 
sell a rep; but as you say, now a second rep is involved, the
trustworthiness-rep of the escrow agency.  Then again, that's
all escrow agencies *are*, and they exist, even with quill pens
and dried lamb skin.  Ok, reps can be traded with a little help
from your friends.

Thanks
