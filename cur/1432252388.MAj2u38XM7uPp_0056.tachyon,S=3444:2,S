I'm working on a second edition of _Disappearing Cryptography_, a 
book about steganography and anonymity on-line. In the interests of 
removing any errors from previous editions, I'm offering a $10 reward 
for anyone who reports the technical errors to me.

Here are the rules:

*) Only the first person to report an error wins a prize. This is the 
only way to avoid many people submitting the same error again and 
again and again. I reserve the right to pay duplicate prizes to 
people who appear to have submitted a duplicate in good faith.

*) I reserve the right to decide the size of an error. If 
misspellings counted, spelling someone's name wrong through out the 
entire book would only count as one error.

*) First person is judged by the time the error arrives in my 
mailbox, pcw@flyzone.com.

*) Only technical errors count. Grammar and spelling errors could 
bankrupt me, even after the copy editing fixes 99%.

*) Please submit the page number.

*) Please let me know if you want your name included in the thanks at 
the beginning of the book.


Thank you. You're free to forward this offer to any other list.

-Peter
