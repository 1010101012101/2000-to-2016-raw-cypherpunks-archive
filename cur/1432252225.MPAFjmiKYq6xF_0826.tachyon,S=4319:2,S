I notice you did this:

I'd be very interested in your views on things such as Puppet or Chef: I
myself have been very skeptical of them. Some of the issues are outlined
in this blog post (not by me):

http://blog.thestateofme.com/2013/04/30/an-adventure-with-chef/


It seems that all the evangelists for such things have never heard of
things like MIT Athena and http://www.infrastructures.org/ and don't
seem to know much about the underlying theory.

infrastructures.org describes a system similar to the one in your
slides, albeit using slightly older technology.


I'd be interested in your thoughts on "congruent infrastructure
management" especially around the issues of avoiding divergence, proving
convergence and recovery from failure that doesn't involve wiping the
machine.







Regards,
@ndy
