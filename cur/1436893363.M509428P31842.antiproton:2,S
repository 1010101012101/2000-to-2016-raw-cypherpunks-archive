Everything will be run in the cloud and browser because it is, overall, a better computation model. However, that doesn't preclude 
you from running a cloud locally. Although pretty much proprietary to Google & Amazon until recently, Docker et al and related 
VM/container management APIs that are mappable to all kinds of implementations will allow apps, administration, networking, etc. to 
be fluid between commercial and various types of private clouds.

In a lot of ways, this is an elegant solution and could arguably be much more secure than desktop apps in Windows.  Assuming your 
container system isn't running in Windows, which is becoming an option; one that I won't trust easily.

I did not handle this well (think sputtering as an alternative to
white rage).  At the same time, I am probably in a bubble in that

Echoing Lenin echoing Chernyshevsky, "What is to be done?" or,
