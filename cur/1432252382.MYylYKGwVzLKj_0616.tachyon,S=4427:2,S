AFAIK the US case law is the "Texaco principle" (maybe that is what a
previous poster meant...) which allows you to make copies for personal
educational or research purposes, but not as part of a profession or
business. IIRC scientists at Texaco made copies of a chemistry journal
and the company lost a case when the publishers sued them. 

I think it is the case that the student is allowed, under "fair use" to
make one copy of a small part of a journal for their own education and
research. It is possible that the teacher is allowed to make copies &
give them to the students (though not to sell them). But it is almost
certainly not allowed for a company to make such a packet as part of its
business. (The law seems to imply that education is not a business or
profession, which I have no problem  with, though I guess many
cypherpunks might).

As ever, AINAL & if I was I wouldn't be an American one. (Though I was
working for Texaco at the time of the court case & I now work in a
(British) university where we have to deal with similar copyright law as
it exists here)
