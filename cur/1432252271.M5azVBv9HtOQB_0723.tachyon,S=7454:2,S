That matters from a correction view but not from a usage view, which I
assume we're taking. Basically we don't care what technology the remailer
uses as long as it is correct technology and trustable. From there we care
only what remailers are disfunctional and which are useful.

Well assuming that the remailers are under attack, we start using digital
signatures with initiation information stored in them. Mallet can introduce
duplicates, but the likelihood of a duplicate being detected rises very
quickly, (i.e at a rate of 1-(1/20)^M for M duplicate messages assuming a
drop rate of 1 in 20). This gives us the ability to discount the vast
majority of what Mallet does and get very close to accurate values. The
bigger risk is for Mallet to identify our queries and force the proper
functioning of the node exclusively for the query. Correcting this is much
more difficult, but would only take the use of digital signatures and
encryption on all the messages traversing the network. Since the remailer
user inherently a more developed user than Joe (l)User this is much more
reasonable. But still approaches impossible because the remailer users is a
finite set so Mallet could store all the remailer user keys, and treat them
differently from the query keys. This becomes extremely difficult as long
term keys are defeated as well as ephemeral keys. Instead the remailer users
will have to maintain statistics, or at least a large unknown portion of
them. If users upload to say freenet once a month the number of anonymous
messages they have sent and recieved (without mention of timeframe except
implicitly month) we could get an overall droprate, and the users wouldn't
have to reveal who they are.

Agreed I was beginning to adress this above, it still has some major
problems.

> Q: How to inject traffic into the remailer network anonymously?

through a set of trusted remailers, if those remailers are trusted and are
used for test initiation, then the exact droprate from that entry point will
be known. This will build a reputation for those remailers making it
desirable for trustable remailer operators to be in that set by increasing
the number of messages, leading to better security by initiating from the
trusted list.

You count the messages in and the messages out, you don't care what they
say, where they're from etc, the operator doesn'tr even need to know you're
doing it. Of course this is a rather difficult task, the better option would
be to test the network as a whole, by colluding of users to collect
statistics on their own messages going through, this would defeat much of
what Mallet could do because the test messages would be real messages that
are being propogated through.

Wouldn't be that bad. Treating the network as a function of it's entry-point
seems easiest. Then it's just a simple fraction which can be published raw
or you can waste 4 seconds on a 1GHz machine and compute the values. Either
way it's not compute intensive, most of the work needs to be done by
legitimate users with legitimate messages (to prevent Mallet from playing
with the messages).

> Q: How do we munge the data? What are we trying to 'fit'?

We are trying to determine the best entry-point for anonymous remailer use
as measured by percentage of messages that reach their destination, as
filtered by being "trusted".

> Q: Once we have the data and can (dis)prove the hypothesis, then what?

Then we only trust the servers on the "trusted" list, and we use the best
remailer from the list in terms of delivery. This will encourage individuals
that run worthless remailers to improve their systems, eventually leading to
the dropping of only a handful of messages a year.
