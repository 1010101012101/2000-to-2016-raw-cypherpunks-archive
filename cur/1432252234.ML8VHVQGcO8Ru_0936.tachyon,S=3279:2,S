Yeah.  Something Napster-the-Program-like could easily move,
and there are a large number of OpenNap servers run by random people,
but Napster-The-Company is trying to make money for its investors -
it's no longer a couple of college students whose objective
is to have fun and share music of dubious copyright status.

Because Napster is headed by identifiable US individuals
who've been hit with court orders, the scenario of
"Napster shut down and a surprisingly similar company
reopens in Tonga" would be looked at very closely.
				Thanks!
