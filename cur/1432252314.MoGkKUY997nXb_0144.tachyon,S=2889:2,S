Perhaps Ms. Caproni needs to read the 11th Amendment. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,...

...commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."

Where are your Courts of Law, Ms. Caproni? You are committing a fraud upon the American people, a fraud via public speech, using intimidation from a public, corporate, office.

Best,

Ray.
