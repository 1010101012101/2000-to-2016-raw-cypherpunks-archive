Maybe it's a bit too early to assume complete military takeover of the US.  I
remember, during the election debacle, rumors on the cpunk list that Clinton
was going to refuse to step down and let Bush take over, and that instead,
martial law would be declared, and the US would be taken over by the military. 

I mean, you gotta be paranoid to be on this list, I assume, but you don't have
to cry "military takeover of the whole world!" during every crisis.

Scary as Bush's puppeteers may be, I don't think they did this.  But I know
shit about same.

Check out the novel "American Hero", by Larry Beinhart.
