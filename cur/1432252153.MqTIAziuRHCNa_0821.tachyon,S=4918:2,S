 From time to time newspaper articles appear on how well all is going for 
the newly formed Somali government, despite the fact that it has twice fled 
Somalia and does not seem to govern very much.  It has now returned to 
Somalia for the third time.

A recent news article announced the new Somalian government was recruiting 
to form an army.  It failed to report that the main function of this army 
would be to make war on other Somalis, and that the general leading this 
army was assassinated a couple of days after recruitment began:

I predicted that the new government would become yet another warlord.  This 
process seems well under way.

A fan of the new government and of governments in general 
(marqaan@my-deja.com), reports the situation as follows:

 > If the cowards who murdered general Talan thought they could
 > de-stabilize the newly formed transitional government, they made a
 > big mistake, it will be even a bigger and more tragic  mistake if
 > this murder was orchestrated by elements from the Somaliland,
 > because this will surely cause the Gadabuursi clan of the Awdal
 > region to question their status within the Somaliland administration
 > and seek revenge (and righfully and justly so)against a high ranking
 > member of the Isaq clan within the Somaliland administration.
 >
 > The new administration in the south is talking about finding and
 > bringing into justice those who were behind the killing of Gen.
 > Talan, this is nice and beautifull, but we all know that the only
 > kind of justice that works in Somalia is "Revenge", any politician
 > or influential member belonging to the clan or clans who were behind
 > this act must now watch their backs, sooner or later they will have
 > to pay for the crimes of their folk, the Somali way.
