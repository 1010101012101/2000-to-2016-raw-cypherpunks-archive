>         A Mohawk from the community of Tyendinaga and an

>         The action has been endorsed by the Cornwall Labour
> Council (CLC),
> the Kingston-based People's Community Union (PCU) and
> members of the Mohawk
> communities of Akwesasne and Kahnawake. The CLC has sent

>         Brant maintains that although some members of the
> Akwesasne Mohawk
> community may oppose a potentially explosive action, none
> oppose opening
> the border. "The border is a barrier to community life in
> Akwesasne," says
> Brant, who must submit to car searches and ID checks at
> Customs in order to
> visit relatives who live in the same Mohawk territory, but
> across the
> border. "It is the right of the Mohawk nation to determine
> who can cross
> the border," he adds.

>         According to Darren Bonaparte, the Akwesasne author

> Map: A Mohawk Perspective on the International Border at
> Akwesasne, the
> Mohawks have had a love-hate relationship with the border
> over the years.
> During Prohibition it provided opportunity for illegal

> alcohol trading, and more recently cigarettes and foreign
> nationals have
> illicitly traveled north and south, respectively.

>         The border action was news to Canada Customs

> Gentes-Hawn. "Have we been officially notified?" she asks.
> Still, she's not

> Council, alleges that the feds knew about cigarette

> acting against the
