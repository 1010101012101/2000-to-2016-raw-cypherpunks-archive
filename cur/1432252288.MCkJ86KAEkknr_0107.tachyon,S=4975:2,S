if the signal is your own, and it would not exit the home
by its own force, you have a reasonable expectation of
privacy by a 9-0 vote of about any SCt since Taft died.
Well, 7-2 anyway.

However, if the signals are from outside, received in the 
home (isn't that what Wright was after?), the issue remains
a bit unclear.  I, you see, don't necessarily have the
same reasonable expectation in *your* home.
