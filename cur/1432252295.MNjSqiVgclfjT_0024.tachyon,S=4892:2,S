	A note on this note - I was told back in that era by Sun field
service people that the standard thing to do when a motherboard failed
was to swap the ID prom from the old motherboard onto the new one, thus
avoiding the whole license conversion problem in the first place (but of
course also  doing wonders for the ability to track specific pieces of
hardware and document ECO levels and the like, since a significant number
of motherboards had swapped ID proms in which all the other information
in the prom didn't match the actual board).

	Unfortunately, if the secret disk serial number hashed with the
authentication domain key to generate the actual encryption key for
the data is not readable or writable by the user this trick will not
work for restoring bad disks.   And if it did, it is not clear that 
the overall secure disk system could serve its purpose of protecting
copyright.
