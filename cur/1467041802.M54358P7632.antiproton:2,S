I'm not familiar with the anecdote you mention, but it sounds like
he was acknowledging his own cult of personality..  Anyway, I was
being  slightly hypberbolic when I said "mad".

I read a biography of Stalin like 6 months ago by a guy named
Khlevniuk, and the picture of Koba was not one of insanity per se..
but he was filled with paranoia, extremely crafty, and took a "kill
first" policy with anyone that could possibly pose a threat.  He
was actually planning a bunch of Jewish pogroms when he died in 53.
Beria was said to have danced in glee around the still-living but
paralyzed Stalin after his fatal stroke... of course, Beria was one
sick puppy himself.
