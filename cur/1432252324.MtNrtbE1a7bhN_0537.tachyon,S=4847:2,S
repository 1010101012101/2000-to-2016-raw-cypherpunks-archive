	I can, that's why I don't do that stuff any more. (Not that I 
ever did it much).

	We live in the Post Modern world where making a symbolic 
statement is equivalent to actually doing something about the problem.

	By definition.

	(a). Because by the time the delegates meet, it's too late.

	I can think of a better way of using my talents, but then 
that's why I don't do that shit (Well, that and the fact that while I 
disagree with what the WTO is doing, I disagree for completely 
different and incompatible reasons than the "blank bloc").

	I doubt it was invented that recently.

	Nonsense. There is virtually no risk (especially to someone 
behind a nym) in reacting hotheadedly on a mailing list (THIS IS NOT 
A MESSAGE BOARD). There are significant risks in doing it in real 
life.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
