Sad:
> Starting from December 14th 2007, no new orders for buying e-gold  
> can be placed at the IceGold website.
> Due to the pending adoption of the new version of Estonia's Anti  
> Money-laundering Law IceGold can no longer complete exchanges once  
> the law will take effect in the first half of January 2008. The new  
> law requires exchangers of alternative payment systems such as  
> IceGold to identify all customers face to face.
...
> We hope that this is only a temporary interruption of service and we  
> are actively looking for solutions to continue offering our  
> customers the best service they have becomed accustomed to over the  
> last 7 years. Please check back here for news.

Best,
