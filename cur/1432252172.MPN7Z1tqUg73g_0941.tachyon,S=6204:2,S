For Immediate Release 

Showintel Enters Small-City Markets, 
El Dorado, Arkansas, First Location 

MEMPHIS, Tennessee  (November 27, 2001) --   Showintel Networks, Inc./MULTINET INTL CORP INC/, (Symbol: OTC BB MNIL),  will begin installation of its first small-city, online system for movie theater customers to purchase current entertainment products before the end of the year in El Dorado, Arkansas. 
The unit will be in the lobby of the city’s Stars Cinema, a member of the statewide Stars Cinema chain.  El Dorado is in the south central part of Arkansas and serves a geographic area comprised of six Arkansas counties and two Louisiana parishes, with a total population in excess of 200,000. 
“The ability to service the smaller chains in small markets with the identical application we are deploying in larger chains proves the usefulness of our services to all theater markets,” said David V. Lott, president and CEO of Showintel Networks.  “We are excited to be able to reach to the smaller operators and assist them with a customer pleasing way to generate additional revenues.” 
Showintel Networks, Inc. headquartered in Tennessee, utilizes video on demand technology to provide interactive entertainment and advertising on demand.  Showintel increases consumption of entertainment by creating a system that interacts with the “entertainment life-cycle”.   Combining theater-based advertising, innovative loyalty programs, video-on-demand (VOD) access to pay-per-view (PPV) and subscription services, Showintel can increase loyalty and revenue to a chain of theaters, increase purchases of ancillary products (soundtracks, DVD’s, videos, merchandise) and create a pinpoint targeted direct marketing connection with entertainment consumers to stimulate rentals and PPV, Lott said. 
In addition, some of the infrastructure investment to complete the system can generate incremental revenue through strategic relationships with local ISP and wireless network operators.  Additional information is available at www.showintelnetworks.com.
