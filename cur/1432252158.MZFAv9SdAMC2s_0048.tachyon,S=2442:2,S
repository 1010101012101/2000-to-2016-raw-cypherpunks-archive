   Apple is both a software *and* a hardware company, however, and they've
pretty much always been negligent about making sure that other vendor's hardware
worked with theirs and/or their OS. Just sticking in a new hard drive gives you
error messages (which you can ignore and bypass) when upgrading the OS.  You get
the idea that they want you to only buy their hardware. In fact the whole OS-X
thing is like that -- they deliberately, after having all the betas running on
older powermacs, wrote the production code to exclude anything but new G-3 based
machines.
   Don't get me wrong, I like Apple and their hardware, but some of their
policies suck.
