I believe "Free" to be very different than "Open Source", particularly
open source under viral licensing agreements like the GPL.

My perfect example of free software is the quadratic formula.  I don't
have to pay anyone to use it.  I may use it for any purpose whatsoever,
including commercial applications.  Using it does not obligate me in any
way, or legally encumber any product which includes it.  The knowlege of
it is so widespread that were it to be lost, someone would quickly
reconstruct it and spread it around again.

IT has lots of free things.  Most computer science is free.  I don't have
to mail Andrew Tanenbaum a check if I write an OS, even if I use his book
to design it.  Knuth's books are free.  etc...

I'm a big fan of free.  Free works.  Free is like Pandora's box.  Once
opened, the stuff cannot be put back in.  Ever.

I am less of a fan of schemes like the GPL, which seek to impose a set of 
contagious terms on anything touched by the knowlege.

True scientific inquiry is always driven purely by intellectual curiosity.
Salary is just how you eat and pay the bills.  Understanding the essential 
nature of apparently complex things is its own reward.

Of course my point here is that with minor exceptions, most really great
innovations are unappreciated by the public, and may in fact go
unappreciated by all but a very small number of people working in ones
subspecialty at the time they are announced.

So I think the non-tangible rewards from employers argument for innovation
fails.  Smart people do innovative things because of their intrinsic
coolness, even if no one else in the world can appreciate them.

If you can't do whatever you like with it, it's not free.  Period.

Secure anonymous digital money will never win out over easy to use, 
good buddies with Homeland Security systems like Paypal in the wide 
adoption Olympics.

This is a dead horse that continues to be beaten on this list.

Chaum's ideas were the JPEG Arithmetic Coding of the digital money spec.

They suffered from two faults.  One, they had legal restrictions.  Two, 
other things that were almost as good didn't have legal restrictions.

If Chaum wanted fame and fortune, he should have started eBay.
