If this applies throughout the whole economy (i.e. the natives can't
compete with any product at all), you'll have a trade deficit and sooner
or later the currency rate will go down. That'll end the imports and even
out the difference in efficiency.

In the absence of a currency area boundary, you'll still have Ricardo and
his principle of relative benefit (that the term?). Nobody'll starve
because of competition, unless they're just plain lazy and/or unable to
adapt. Sweatshop work is a variation of the latter.

If the previous buyers get their food cheaper somewhere else, what's the
problem? That production can survive within the confines of an inefficient
economy is no reason to keep running that inefficient economy. Otherwise
you'd be transfering income from the buyer to the seller, and
inefficiently at that.

They made a choice over starving to death. Sounds like a choice to me.
