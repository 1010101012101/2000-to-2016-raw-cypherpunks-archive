Subject: MAY I SHARE THIS WITH YOU?
 
Your name was given to me as someone who has been successful 
in other gifting and/or network marketing programs. I do not wish 
to send anything out unwanted. So, please if you do not wish to hear 
from me, reply with REMOVE and I will gladly take you off my list.  
 
If you would kindly allow me to, I would love to share with you a
gifting activity that has brought me 200% of my initial gift of 
$100 dollars in LESS THAN 3 DAYS!  
 
I would also love to share with you how this activity has allowed
me to HELP SOMEONE IN NEED!  It has given me the opportunity
to have someone come along with me to the activity who may not 
be able to afford to PAY their way in,  yet will receive the same 200% 
back that I did and do this with  NO ADDITIONAL OUT OF POCKET 
EXPENSE TO ME OR THEM!
 
NO Selling, NO Stalled boards, and NO Games!   EASIEST thing 
I have EVER done on the internet and believe me, I have done
alot!  Receive all the CASH you will need for the upcoming holidays,
AND HELP A FRIEND OR RELATIVE IN NEED AT THE SAME TIME!!!
 
DEBT FREE HOLIDAY FOR YOU AND THEM!  I LOVE THAT!
 
THIS IS THE TRUE SPIRIT OF GIFTING!
 
If your interested in learning how I have accomplished this and feel
this may be something you would like to do, please email me at:
Marie@smoothsailing.net  with "CASH" typed in the subject line 
and I will be more than happy to send you the information.  
 
I ASSURE you.....You don't want to miss this!!!
 
Wishing you the Very Best!
Marie
