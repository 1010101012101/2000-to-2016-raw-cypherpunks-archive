A not-so-clever straw man.  "Making" the picture is not the speech in
question, Duh.  Distributing the picture is.  And you can distribute the
picture, without committing the underlying act yourself.

> If you could, it wouldn't be 'porno'...

As I said (and Jimbo ignored), porn is not illegal, per se, only obscenity.
Perhaps that is a distinction without a difference, but that's the way the
laws work.
