That's exactly where the value comes from and why clandanstine groups in
that environment can find funding for such adventure. In a more open
market it isn't worth the hassle, just become an investor in the venture
or commit industrial sabotage. Let them do the work, you reap the benefit.

In an environment where nobody is supposed to have it then anybody is on
top. Remember...

In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
