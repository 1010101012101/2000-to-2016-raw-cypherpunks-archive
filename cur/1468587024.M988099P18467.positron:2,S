I absolutely agree with everything you've said about Assange, and fully
think his interment in Ecuador (the embassy) stems from the massive 
embarrassment
he caused and continues to cause to governments, corporations, etc.

I don't know enough about what Appelbaum ever did beyond some (IMO) 
over-hyped
"art projects" and name-dropping Assange every 5 minutes in that 
internal tor
IRC chat that was leaked. So, seeing I have a lack of knowledge here,
I'll take you at your word at his importance.

Perhaps you're right!  :)
