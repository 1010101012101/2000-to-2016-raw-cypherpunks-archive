The Boston Globe had a story on October 27 about
NSA refusing to share comint on US persons with other
federal agencies, destroying the data upon its lawyers'
advice sooner than usual in the face of anti-terrorism 
pressure. (URL may wrap)

ing_others_in_probe+.shtml

If true, it's a big plus for NSA for complying with the law
when others are rushing to bend, break and revise it.
Some assholes are calling for unleashing NSA from
its Church Committee restrictions, but a few sane
people are saying, no, no domestic spying, we don't
want to go through that again. 

To be sure, the story could be a cover for ignoring the
law.
