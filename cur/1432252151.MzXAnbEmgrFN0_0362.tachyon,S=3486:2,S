Yeah, but they're going to have to be careful. Condit is a Dem,
and so was Clinton, and there are some succulent parallels.
But we haven't heard trash-talking about the Dems from the Repubs
for two reasons:

1. Look at Hyde, Gingrich, Burton. If extramarital affairs were crimes,
the GOP would be equally felonious.

2. Condit is a conservative Dem who often votes with the GOP. One of
my highly placed GOP sources sent me a Condit joke yesterday with this
attachment: "All I know of Condit personally is his voting record,
which I like, so this is meant as non-partisan black humor."
