The UK is a fantastic example of the US in a few years.  In a way,
the UK population are beta testers for the statism of the future here.
If it passes in the UK, they'll try it in the US in a 'wee bit'.

Its when Ross Anderson ends up detained as an enemy combatant
that the sleeper cells (tm) will be triggered.

Not only DNA, of course; surveillance cameras, papers on demand,
domestic CIA (MI-blah) powers, etc.  And y'all are our obediant and
faithful military poodles.  Only the Aussies and Iberians have gotten
the feedback though.  Your turn will come.  Batman in a turban, mofo.

We sympathize, of course, protestant angliospeaking folks are regarded
as human, but bemoan your lack of constitutional
protections (here my more cynical friends accuse me of bill-o'-rights
religion)
and you must pay penance for Benny Hill, anyway.
