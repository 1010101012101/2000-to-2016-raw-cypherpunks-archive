Um, hello?  Farmers are *rational beings*.  They will grow
cash crops given sufficient ROI.  No different from Kentucky
inbreds growing tobacco.  (Funny how no one is allowed
to criticize the US exports of this addictive plant.  Very funny
indeed.  Perhaps the Columbians will start spraying tobacco fields,
(hey if other crops die its collateral damage), and shooting innocent
planes out of the air.  Frankly I'd rather they
buy Al Q a kilo-class sub driven up the Potomac, tobacco keeps
social fnord security solvent)
