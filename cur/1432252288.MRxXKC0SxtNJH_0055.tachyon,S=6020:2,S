Randomly checking for a drivers license which you are required to have =
when driving. Many people who have had their drivers license suspended =
often drive their vehicles anyway. I would assume most states (if not =
all) require you to surrender you drivers license to the police when =
asked. I believe the law actually views the drivers license as the =
property of the state which would be where they have the right to revoke =
it.
