Quibble: only surprising if one misunderstands probability. (Not saying 
you do, just quibbling with any claim that readily calculated 
probabilities can be "surprising.")

instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab
world against us and make a broken tyrant into a latter-
day Arab hero. Assigning young soldiers to a fruitless
hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning
them to fight in what would be an unwinable urban guerilla
war, it could only plunge that part of the world into ever
greater instability."
--George H. W. Bush, "A World Transformed", 1998
For any sequence of n fair tosses, the "length after compression" of 
the outcome is roughly, modulo some constants and factor, (1 - 2^(-n)), 
where "1" is the uncompressed length. In other words, as n gets large 
nearly all strings have a "length after compression" that is close to 
the original length, i.e., little compression. As n gets arbitrarily 
large, an arbitrarily small fraction of strings have a short, concise 
description (are "compressed").
