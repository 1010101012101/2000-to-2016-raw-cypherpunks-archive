This is interesting.
Sorry...I'm a working stiff so I haven't kept up with the protocols. Does 
SIP in any way force a centralized "switch" paradigm on the VoIP 
implementation? My thinking is that it does not, it's more of an interface.

Which means that Zfone could be Peer-to-Peer, and I would bet Zimmerman 
would have shot for that.

Anyone know?
