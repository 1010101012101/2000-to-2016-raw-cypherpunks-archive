(feel free to forward this message in its entirety)

The RSA Data Security Conference is being held 
February 18-22, 2001, at the McEnery Convention 
Center in San Jose, California.

This is the biggest computer security conference
in the world, with 200 vendors and over 10,000
attendees. Personally, I think it's a blast, and
attend every year.

I'm sending this to remind list members that,
although the full conference is quite costly,
there are (as in previous years) a couple of
ways to get all or part of the show for free,
and a discounted fee for academic types.

----------------------------------------------
Free Expo Passes:

The Expo is the Exposition Hall, where about
200 computer security companies from all over 
the world will be pushing their products and
looking for new hires. 

Free passes for the expo are available if you
register over the web until February 15. After
that (or at the door) they cost $50.

The Expo is open Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday
the 20th from 11AM to 7PM, and Thursday the 21st
until 3PM.

---------------------------------------------
Academic Scholarships

ssh Communications Security Inc. has sponsored
a number of student scholarships. 

Any full-time student wishing to apply for a RSA 
Conference 2002 scholarship should submit a 
curriculum vitae (CV) to RSA Security via email at 
rsa2002_scholarships@rsasecurity.com. Preference 
will be given to graduate students and advanced 
undergraduates in relevant disciplines.  Please 
note that scholarships do not cover travel expenses, 
meals or lodging.

---------------------------------------------
Academic discounts (if you can't get a scholarship :-)

The RSA Conference offers a discounted registration 
fee of $595.00 to students and professors of 
academic universities. (which is way less than half 
the regular fee)

------------------------------------------------
Full information on the conference can be found
at http://www.rsaconference.com (which, as others
have pointed out, is Flash-heavy :-( I'm talking to 
people to try to get that changed next year.)

See you there!

[PS: I have no input into the scholarship selection
process, so don't send me anything.]
