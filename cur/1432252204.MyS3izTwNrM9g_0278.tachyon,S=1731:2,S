	SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (AP) -- Two reporters fired for working with the
	National Enquirer on an Elizabeth Smart story revealed their law enforcement
	sources to avoid legal action against them by the Smart family. 

Leaving aside the fact that the story and all of  the components were
patently false, I am interested in the opionions of the few press-persons we
have here on the actions of the reporters.

As a press person, are there any conditions under which you would reveal
confidential sources?  If so, under what conditions would you do so?  If not,
do you have any observations/comments/yawns you would like to share on the
instant case?
