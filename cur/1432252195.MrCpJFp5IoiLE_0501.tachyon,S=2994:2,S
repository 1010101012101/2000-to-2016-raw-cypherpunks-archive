Hello,

I'm having problem with my firewall. Can you help me with this?
For example take this simple program written in Perl:

#!/bin/perl
use LWP::Simple;
 
print (get $ARGV[0]);


How can I retrieve a Html file outside my firewall. Do I need to do something
with proxy port? Letting this program pass through my proxy?

Best regards,
YF
