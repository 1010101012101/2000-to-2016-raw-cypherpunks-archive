Sure, but my point was that this wasn't a flaw in the bitcoin system
itself. Yes, the value of bitcoin is defined by its external exchanges,
but *bitcoin* is a system for tracking the ownership of resources in a
distributed manner - which is a difficult problem that it, so far, seems
to have solved securely.

For sure. However, it's got to start somewhere.

Why shouldn't it? The bitcoin economy is tiny; Mt Gox dominates it like
the Bank of England dominates GBP. However, Mt Gox has no de jure power,
and in due course, competitors will challenge it, thereby decentralising
the economy again.

I hole 18 bitcoins; I'm not too worried that it's dropped like that -
because I think it'll rise again. In fact, now would be a good time to
buy some more...
