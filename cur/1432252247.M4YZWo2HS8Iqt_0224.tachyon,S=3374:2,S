I gave a presentation at a conference a few years back in which I raised 
the idea that since Intellectual Property (e.g., trademarks) aren't 
(property), its really a lease, that our society should consider setting 
limits on the market penetration (say 50%, which is already in excess of 
the what many economists call the "friction free" point wherein companies 
can continue to gain market share merely by dint of their already 
considerable presence) of single companies in markets whose size (the 
therefore probably importance) exceeds some minimum threshold of the 
GDP.  However, instead of enforcing these limits via the Department of 
Justice, they would become a civil matter and one's competitors can use the 
courts to strip a company of its sole lease on a trademark or patent 
applied to this market.
