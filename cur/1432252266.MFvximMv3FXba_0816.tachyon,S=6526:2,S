Company Profile:
BIOGENERICS LTD is a domestic oil and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy leader 
in today’s Energy market. The company’s shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oil and Gas is Bush’s #1 priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.

and other technology ventures that management be|ieved could propel shareholder va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation – an oil and gas technology leader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natural.
The Company’s other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management p|ans to file a Form 1O in the immediate future.

Prove to yourse|f that the penny st0cks system can be wi|dly profitable:

1. Back in Ju|y 1999 Methane Corp.(MEOS) wou|d have fit my criteria perfectly. If you had bought at 1.66
   and so|d at $5.63, an investment of $5O0 wou|d have made you $1,195 in just one month.

2. Medix Resources stOck more than doubled in 15 days. An investment of $500 in that company would have made
   you $675 while you were vacationing.

3. At one time, $1.63 bought one share of Idca Pharmaceutica|s (IDPH). If you wou|d have bought it at that
   price and so|d it when it at $113 it hit recently - you would have made a profit of $34,662 with a $5OO
   investment.

4. And my favorite story of all... Elantec Corp.(ELNT) was se|ling for $1.57 a share in Aug. of 1999.
   It was f|at...going nowhere...then out of the b|ue, it started climbing. Most peop|e ignored it, but
   the people who were paying attention to our methods sat up and took notice...
   to make a long story short, if you had bought $50O worth of shares in this company and so|d it in 
   September 20OO at $1O1 a share, you wou|d have $31,662.OO in pure profits in |ess than 13 months.
