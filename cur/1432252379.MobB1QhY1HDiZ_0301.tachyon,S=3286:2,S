Computer Student on Trial for Aid to Muslim Web Sites
By TIMOTHY EGAN

Published: April 27, 2004

OISE, Idaho, April 23  Not long after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, 2001, a group of Muslim students led by a Saudi Arabian doctoral
candidate held a candlelight vigil in the small college town of Moscow,
Idaho, and condemned the attacks as an affront to Islam.


Today, that graduate student, Sami Omar al-Hussayen, is on trial in a
heavily guarded courtroom here, accused of plotting to aid and to
maintain Islamic Web sites that promote jihad.

As a Web master to several Islamic organizations, Mr. Hussayen helped to
maintain Internet sites with links to groups that praised suicide
bombings in Chechnya and in Israel. But he himself does not hold those
views, his lawyers said. His role was like that of a technical editor,
they said, arguing that he could not be held criminally liable for what
others wrote.

Civil libertarians say the case poses a landmark test of what people can
do or whom they can associate with in the age of terror alerts. It is
one of the few times anyone has been prosecuted under language in the
antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act, which makes it a crime
to provide "expert guidance or assistance" to groups deemed terrorist.

"Somebody who fixes a fax machine that is owned by a group that may
advocate terrorism could be liable," said David Cole, a Georgetown
University law professor who argued against the expert guidance part of
the antiterrorism law this year, in a case where it was struck down by a
federal judge.

Compare to the recent law where editing a paper from a nasty nation
would be illegal.  The IEEE kissed Ashcroft's ass, other
periodicals objected more.
