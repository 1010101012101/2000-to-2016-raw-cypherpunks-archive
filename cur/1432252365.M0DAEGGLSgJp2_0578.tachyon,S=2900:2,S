Quality vs quantity. The ratio of machine-generated words to real-looking
ones. The first one has far more negative hits than positive ones, the
second one has all positive. (However, this is easy to beat by using
randomly selected dictionary words instead. The following step is using a
syntactical parser on the level of sentences. The countermove is borrowing
random paragraphs of otherwise meaningful text from random websites.
Following move is employing of semantical parsers, and then we're
waist-deep in artificial intelligence and natural language analysis. It
will end there anyway.) Won't work too reliably on its own, at least in
the simple version, but could help a Bayesian filter to make a decision.

This approach assumes you are able to detect duplicates (which may be
difficult to do if each spam sent out would be different, eg. using
different sets of pseudowords - which is already being done in some cases,
from the day antispam systems based on hashes of known spams were
introduced), and depends on the duplicates actually reaching your both
addresses within reasonable timeframe.
