Reality precedes fiction. Around Boston I sometimes see
cars with an odd little sticker in the back window, white, round, 
with a stylized blue car in the top half (it can also be read as
the face of someone wearing a fedora, peering out from under the
brim).

If you put one of these stickers on your car, you are giving the
police permission to pull the car over without probable cause if
they find it on the road late at night (1am-5am, or something like
that), just to check that all is in order.

I think it's being promoted as an anti-theft tool. 

I prefer the "This car protected by Smith & Wesson" stickers.

"They that give up essential liberties to obtain temporary safety
will soon have neither libery or safety."
