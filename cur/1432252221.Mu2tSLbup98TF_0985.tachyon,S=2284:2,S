One of the studys more unusual recommendations called for the
                    government to use the Internet to "reduce the
unrestrained public
                    appetite for "secrets by providing good faith
distraction material."
                    The Internet, according to the studys authors, could
be used to help
                    "channel public interest toward already appropriately
declassified
                    material and possibly lessen FOIA requests." 

"Internet enables surfing for
                    secrets "
