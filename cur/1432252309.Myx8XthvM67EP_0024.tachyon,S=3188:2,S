Hi,

The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System, version 0.6.1, is out.

This is a bugfix-only release mainly aimed at fixing serious security
issues in bundled software. All users must upgrade as soon as possible.

What is it?
===========

T(A)ILS is a Live system aimed at preserving your privacy and
anonymity:

- all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through
  the Tor network;
- no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

    Homepage: https://amnesia.boum.org/

Get it, try it, share it!
=========================

Try it! [1] Any comments are most welcome. Please note you'll need to
install the CACert root certificate into your web browser before
connecting to our web site... unless you use Debian.

    [1] https://amnesia.boum.org/download/

What's new?
===========

- Tor 0.2.1.28: resolves possible remote code execution, see the Tor
  project blog post [2] for details
- Other software upgrades fix grave bugs, most of these with serious
  security implications.
- FireGPG and Seahorse: use the same keyserver as the one configured in
  `gpg.conf`.
- HTP: display the logs when the clock synchronization fails.
- Use the light version of the "Are you using Tor?" webpage.

See the online Changelog [3] for more details.
