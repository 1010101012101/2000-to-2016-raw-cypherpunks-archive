>Paper Handsets or on Their Way
>
>8:28:04 AM 1/24/2001 Believe it or not a paper mobile phone is due to be 
>land on the market later this year, making an appearance in retail stores, 
>fast food restaurants and vending machines. A U.S. investor has backed the 
>disposable devices, which were created by Randice-Lisa Altschul, and plans 
>to sell them for $10 a pop. Dubbed the Phone-Card-Phone, the paper phone 
>is as thick as three credit cards and is constructed from recycled paper 
>products. The phones will come with 60 minutes of calling time and a 
>hands-free attachment. The phones can be thrown out once the minutes are 
>used, or more minutes can be added. Altschul, who has 22 patents on the 
>technology, says her business, Dieceland Tech Corp., has 100 million units 
>on order. Reported by The Feature.
