That's not a nationwide thing or an all-phone-companies thing -
most NYC-based numbers would be hard to reach,
and maybe some long distance carrier's database is in NYC,
but it's unlikely they'd have only a single database.

He was making speeches from an AFB in Louisiana.
The logical places to go would be Camp David (guess not...)
or Andrews AFB or the Fort Ritchie, MD emergency site.
The less logical place to go is back to the White House -
it's a bit riskier, but would make good PR.
