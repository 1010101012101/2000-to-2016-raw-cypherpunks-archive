About the American Hyphen Society

The American Hyphen Society is a community-based, not-for-profit,
grass-roots conciousness-raising/education-research alliance that seeks
to help effectuate the across-the-board self-empowerment of wide-ranging
culture-, nationality-, ethnicity-, creed-, gender-, and
sexual-orientation-defined identity groups by excising all
multiculturally-less-than-sensitive terminology from the English
language, and replacing it with counter-hegemonic, cruelty-, gender-,
bias-, and, if necessary, content-free speech. The society's motto is
"It became necessary to destroy the language in order to save it". Its
headquarters are in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
