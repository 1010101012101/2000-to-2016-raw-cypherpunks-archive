I recall reading a very similar explanation of ZK interactive proofs, 
using "zero knowledge in the cave," many years ago. By one of the 
founders of the field

I haven't searched for it to compare his (or hers, though I don't 
recall it as an article by Shafi G.) words to yours, but you should 
have given credit to using the "zero knowledge in the cave" version of 
ZKIPS.
