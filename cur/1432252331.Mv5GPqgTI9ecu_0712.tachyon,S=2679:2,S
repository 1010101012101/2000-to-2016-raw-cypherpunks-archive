Emergence - the tendency of systems to evolve and self-organise - is the 
driving theme of an international digital-art conference in Melbourne this 
week.
Second Iteration, at Monash University, will explore the role of artificial 
intelligence, Darwin's theory of evolution and complex systems in modern 
art and music.

In an ongoing cypherpunks emergency,so called libertarians have been 
exposed as right wing,conservative and corporate shills that hijacked this 
list in a low pathetic attempt to divert and dam the exploding 
cryptoanarchist revolution.
Such 'names' as declan,tim  and ,jamesd stand exposed.They are wreckers of 
the revolution.Damn them to hell.
