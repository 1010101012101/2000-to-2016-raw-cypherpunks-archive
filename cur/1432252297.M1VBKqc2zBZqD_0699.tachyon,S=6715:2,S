due to potential copycats, we will let you know it will 
completely revolutionize the transportation industry. Through 
extensive research and developement, we have successfully 
launched a beta program that has gained recognition and support 
from some really big hitters. Our market research indicates that 
potential customers have responded positive to the "Need" and the 
demand for this type of service. As developers have worked 
closely with major universities toward the implementation of this 
serice during trials, we have been told by professors and 
educators alike that "This service is "Guaranteed" to 
revolutionize and change the way we do business in the 
transportation industry".
