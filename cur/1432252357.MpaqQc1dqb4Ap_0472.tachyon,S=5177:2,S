There are two main meanings of the term "politics".

The one you are referring to is the "pardon-less, dirty fight for power=
", and=20
is the reason many describe themselves as "apolitical".

The other is the classical "of, for, or relating to citizens":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics

This is the one I and the parent spoke about. It is not about the=20
temporary/current power struggle, but about the general *policies*=20
regarding... well, anything, really.

For example, the fact that Deric Lostutter faces more jailtime than rap=
ists he=20
exposed:
http://politicalblindspot.com/he-exposed-steubenville-now-what/

...is a direct effect of hackers not engaging in politics (in the secon=
d=20
sense). And a great exemplification of the good old "regardless of whet=
her or=20
not you are interested in politics, politics *will* get interested in y=
ou,=20
eventually" rule.

I despise the first version of "politics"; I firmly stand on the positi=
on we=20
have to start engaging in the second version, though.
